            <li>I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I had a very pleasant experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D is Amazing!!</li>
            <li>The Step 1 was a very good cleaning toothpaste with some abrasive in it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and a great price for an awesome product!</li>
            <li>So happy great power couple!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this toothpaste is incredible.  </li>
            <li>The mouthwash was the brillance on the bright!</li>
            <li>but I guess I draw the line at walking around with bright orange teeth!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>Headline:&lt;br /&gt; LOVED IT !</li>
            <li>I really loved this product!</li>
            <li>The whitening agent in this system is peroxide, but it tastes good!</li>
            <li>This works extremely good!</li>
            <li>This instead contains stannous fluoride which, surprisingly, can cause staining - and it is even disclaimed on the packaging!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this couldn&#x27;t be any easier!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste worked wonderfully at giving my teeth a good, thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>After a month of using the system for a month I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>Over all, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>What a great product to get your teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>This is a 2 step product that works great and turn my teeth whiter than they have ever been.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>This was great because it feels effortless to use</li>
            <li>experience was great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but the whitening part isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>Step 1&#x27;s tube I loved-the flip cap was great.</li>
            <li>However, these amazing 2 products are great!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste however is great</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I was happy to receive this sample to try, as whitening products can be spendy.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t great either though.</li>
            <li>This duo produces great results.</li>

            <li>I will continue to happily use them.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>No sensitivity and great results.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D is a two step brushing routine that does a great job of clearing surface stains.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great and whitens as it claims.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report this did make a difference.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;-Melissa</li>

            <li>Thank you, Crest, for a great product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or anything</li>
            <li>This toothpaste was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the unpleasantness of parts of the whitening process, I really am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Also a great whitening system that have my friends staring at my teeth.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It is a great product that I will continue to use but not as often as I was maybe every two days or so.</li>
            <li>It honestly is the best whitening stuff that I have used and this is including strips, pastes, gels, etc.</li>
            <li>I also have experienced gum tenderness with the tray system.</li>
            <li>Its a great product and works great.</li>
            <li>I think it makes my teeth look great</li>
            <li>I am happy that I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>I used it 2 times a day for a week and it looked great but did give my teeth a bit of sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Great job at  cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>Almost immediate whitening experienced.</li>
            <li>Great taste.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums felt great.</li>
            <li>It has a great taste and does not irritate whatsoever.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>this would be great as an addition after you have whitened your teeth to use as a maintenance effort.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>and the results are great.</li>

            <li>great on my teeth</li>
            <li>, your teeth look great</li>

            <li>3D CREST WHITENING PRODUCT IS WORKING GREAT FOR ME.</li>
            <li>I have receding gums and was concerned about tooth sensitivity, but experienced none.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a really great whitening product.</li>
            <li>Win</li>
            <li>The taste of the polish is not that great either.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>

            <li>As you can see in the picture crest 3D whitening paste works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am proud to say I fully support this product, maybe it won&#x27;t work as well for you, but it sure has for my teeth!!</li>
            <li>Love that!!</li>
            <li>I trying the product for free!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt this confident in years!!</li>
            <li>The one thing I would change is that Step 2 needs a flip top cap!!</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a trial from bzzkit and love it!!</li>
            <li>The minty taste was also very nice.</li>

            <li>This is awesome and easy!  </li>
            <li>The step one is a great minty flavor, and the step 2 is a milder flavor, yet still pleasant.</li>
            <li>Thank you Crest for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Let me just say AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Bzzzagent sent me this duo to try and it has been amazing!  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this from Crest and Thought this was an amazing over the counter product!</li>
            <li>When paired with my electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m getting amazing results!</li>
            <li>Made a remarkable difference in my teeth without any added sensitivity.</li>
            <li>and I actually really liked it!</li>
            <li>Nice product for the price!</li>
            <li>I really liked this product!</li>
            <li>All opinions stated in this review are my own!</li>
            <li>It had a great flavor and it did a good job.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m way more impressed with this system.</li>
            <li>They feel great, almost as good as when I have my teeth cleaned by the dentist.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I see a difference!</li>
            <li>This is one of the more inexpensive whitening options that I have found, so it really is a great deal!</li>
            <li>In just two weeks time there was a remarkable whitening of my teeth</li>
            <li>I noticed a good improvement and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>you dentist notices a remarkable difference</li>
            <li>and honestly I do think that my teeth look whiter even after 1 use!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this system is that there is no nasty tasting gel.</li>
            <li>my canines which no product has ever done successfully</li>
            <li>but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this great freebie from Crest and bzzagent!  </li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t feel especially clean</li>
            <li>It is in no way pleasant for me and</li>
            <li>No tooth sensitivity at all  and pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>Pleasant tasting.</li>
            <li>I found the taste to be pleasant in both the toothpaste and the whitener.</li>
            <li>The taste was also not that pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product; however, since it is a lengthly multi-step process, it is best to do this right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li>It had a very pleasant and refreshing flavor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, my husband has even started using it as he was impressed with my results.</li>
            <li>However, what I like best is that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it was easy for me to adapt to, as with anything it works best when you follow the directions, and use the products correctly.</li>
            <li>This product was so easy to use, and tasted great!!</li>
            <li>I was using the 3D Brilliance toothpaste before and was happy with that, but this is even better!</li>
            <li>this greatly reduced my sensitivity (although slowed the whitening progress).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>Have you ever noticed that some people have bright front teeth</li>
            <li>My teeth are bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My teeth looked a shade whiter and just as shiny and bright.  </li>
            <li>Take a minute to look at those bright shinny teeth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li>I loved that!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I take good care of my teeth</li>
            <li>; The product is good</li>
            <li>Good product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat the results.</li>
            <li>I cannot say I loved it-</li>
            <li>but you do.&lt;br /&gt;It took longer to brush my teeth using the two-step process, but that&#x27;s a good thing I guess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recieved this free to try from BzzAgent an incredible app!</li>
            <li>Good on crest for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to drink a fair amount of soda and tea and this product has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and if it was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>good news is</li>
            <li>It was a good product.  </li>
            <li>I (surprisingly) had a cleaning scheduled during the period where I was testing this product and had no cavities, but have hot/cold sensitivity around two of my existing fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved the product.  </li>
            <li>I felt that I was doing something good for my teeth.</li>
            <li>However, seeing good results from the product would encourage me to continue using the system.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>This would be a good toothpaste for someone who is trying to get rid of stains in their teeth.</li>
            <li>I loved the whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed by its power, I received it in the mail to test for free from Crest through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Step 1 was a good cleaner but thinner consistency than what I like</li>
            <li>I wanted to give a fair review, so I used the product for 10 days before giving my review.</li>
            <li>Got this free from crest, it works great!</li>
            <li>Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste, Fair whitener&lt;</li>
            <li>Loved using this duo.  </li>
            <li>found the taste good, not overly minty.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would taste as good as it worked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I recieved this free for testing purposes and I am so impressed.</li>
            <li>I felt like it did a really good job of cleaning</li>
            <li>The flavor was good as well</li>
            <li>GOOD  </li>
            <li>but flavor is still good.</li>
            <li>loved the product because it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier than going to the dentist for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Good taste as well.</li>
            <li>that said, a part of me also liked the idea of a two-step process; the packaging for it looked great</li>
            <li>Since I drink a fair amount of coffee each day, the results were quite surprising.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is a all around good product.</li>
            <li>I have not had good results with this product.</li>
            <li>The results were nearly as good as whitening strips for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mess/time involved/discomfort/inability to speak than whitening strips&lt;br /&gt;Results nearly as good as whitening strips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.  </li>
            <li>the good news-</li>
            <li>Amazon does have a fair price on this product as well.</li>
            <li>I do think the product is a good product</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see this product being good for extended use, but I might see myself using it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t/never had had any problems with tooth sensitivity, this is probably a really good product however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved this product as I saw that my teeth were whiter after using.</li>
            <li>I loved that I could use it and just leave the house and not have to worry about walking around at home with strips on my teeth.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of removing surface stains on teeth.</li>
            <li>The flavor is good, not too minty.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My honest opinion about the product is it is great.</li>
            <li>So I will stick with my loved Crest brand,</li>
            <li>Now perhaps that&#x27;s a good thing, as Crest mentions in their Crest 3D commercials, &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>This was a good product.</li>
            <li>The taste was good for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to go see my Dentist to see if all is good with my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>and it makes them feel so good.</li>
            <li>The tubes, themselves, were a good shape</li>
            <li>good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample from BzzAgent of this Excellent toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I drink coffee 5 days a week at work and that cannot be good for your teeth.</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel good, but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job of whitening.  </li>
            <li>I also loved the minty flavor.</li>
            <li>Good product - teeth felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved that the two tubes came in one package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this was perfect as it is very easy, and more convenient because they come as a set.</li>
            <li>I think it does an excellent job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I think the best part isn&#x27;t the whitening power but the squeaky clean feeling in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li>I think this 2-step whitening product is the best way to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and very easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste was pleasant, and I liked both the color and texture of both tubes of paste.</li>
            <li>This product is incredibly cooling and refreshing, it makes your mouth feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>Super affordable, WORKS, tastes wonderful and does not bother my gums or teeth.</li>
            <li>Awesome whitening, mild taste.  </li>
            <li>really loved being able to test these products !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very easy and effective way to get your teeth a bit whiter!</li>
            <li>I am very glad I got to try this</li>
            <li>I experienced no increased sensitivity even after a week or more of use.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is bright and is eye catching.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will remain a customer.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could convince people that I got a great result from this product, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m here for.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks, I have a smile that I am very proud of showing off.</li>
            <li>Was unsure of a 2 step process to brush my teeth, but was very satisfied.</li>

            <li>I think if I use it longer I may see even more improvement in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gone to a dentist and had my teeth whitened to the tune of $300 (and as many years ago think inflation!)</li>
            <li>Pretty darn great!!  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and tastes great.</li>
            <li>But these two together are great and easy to use.</li>

            <li>great product, easy to use</li>

            <li>What a great product, I am so incredibly lucky to have gotten this to review!</li>

            <li>After a week, smile was very bright.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It is that amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li>It works amazing well.</li>
            <li>I can use it every 3 days and still get amazing results.</li>
            <li>The amazing Crest 3d whiting system has been working amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I received these to test from BzzAgent and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>but the end result is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>my review is completely my own thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li>and I gotta be honest</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much whiter and brighter and that makes me happy!</li>
            <li>Everyone notices how nice my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>which is nice that it isn&#x27;t bleachy tasting like some of the whitening products i have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but yet i see its use to removing surface stain which i liked.</li>
            <li>but I would have tried it on my own.</li>
            <li>I liked was that it didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity to my gums or teeth while I was using it.</li>
            <li>As I continued to use the product I liked the way my teeth looked and felt.</li>
            <li>The flavor for was #1 was nice - but not for the #2.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the ease of use and gentle whitening</li>
            <li>I use it with my popular brand electric toothbrush that runs a two minute cycle...</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t believe that I would have purchased it to try on my own otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My smile has never been this impressive, and my family is brushing now more than ever.</li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of whitening toothpaste there is.</li>
            <li>Kind of like the tingly feeling I get when using Listerine.</li>
            <li>With Rembrandt you have to choose: either you buy the kind that works with your stains or the one that whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to see it on the picture.</li>
            <li>All good toothpastes are and whitening toothpastes are even more abrasive so they can reive debris and help remove surface stains from your teeth.</li>
            <li>I thought that it had a really nice flavor also.</li>
            <li>I think that this could be used as a maintenance product if you use whitening strips or on its own.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the flavor.</li>
            <li>did receive a sample for review purposes, but I believe that all reviews should provide honest feedback.  </li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li>A shout out to Crest for sending me this to review and to be honest</li>
            <li>I have seen a plethora of teeth whitening products in the media and in my own life.</li>
            <li>It is nice yo not have to wait like i would with strips or a pen.</li>
            <li>I found that it had a good taste, consistency wasn&#x27;t so pasty but more</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>liked this product quite a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple, efficient and effective teeth cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li>and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>and I am so thrilled that it doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity for me.</li>
            <li>(ha) thing kind of like you&#x27;d do in the winter to warm your hands.</li>
            <li>This product also has a nice minty taste which was a nice surprise as some whitening products do not taste well at all.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I am heading out to buy my own today.</li>
            <li>I liked that fact</li>
            <li>The concept is nice though and a lot easier than whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way Step 1 tasted and</li>
            <li>It was also nice that it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums like the strips do.</li>
            <li>and it also makes you brush for the recommended 2 min for optimum oral health :)</li>
            <li>The toothpaste kind of reminds me of that &amp;#34;bubble mint&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This system is cost efficient and just as effective as getting your teeth</li>
            <li>Great Awesome product instantly cleans and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li>It really is a power duo that&#x27;ll get your pearly whites sparkling in no time &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>No buildup of any kind.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as good as getting your teeth whitened at the dentist, but I do think it was better than my tray system.</li>
            <li>I liked the flavor.</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency of it too because when you put it on your toothbrush it stays there, with one exception.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product.</li>
            <li>so I kind of just count to 60</li>
            <li>But it did work effectively for me</li>
            <li>I honestly and truly saw a difference in two days.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and then of course I had some kind of reaction-allergic or just irritation</li>
            <li>I really liked that.</li>
            <li>Kind of a hassle</li>
            <li>What a nice feeling😊 .</li>
            <li>After using the product for two weeks, I can see an incredible difference in the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it effectively whitens in the time that I would already spend brushing my teeth anyway.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty taste</li>
            <li>® but my opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>(nice and minty)</li>
            <li>Which is really nice</li>
            <li>I did not give this product 5 stars despite loving my results</li>
            <li>Lets be honest here.</li>
            <li>Who has that kind of time?</li>
            <li>I liked the product, although the polishing gel did have a bit of an off taste to it.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a nice mint flavor and the whitening gel</li>
            <li>I liked the &amp;#34;process&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a whitening gel on its own and that&#x27;s all they need to sell.</li>
            <li>I didnt take a picture because honestly, I didnt think it would work because my dad didnt notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. :)</li>
            <li>but this is my Own, honest opinion</li>
            <li>really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I truly liked using it 2 times</li>
            <li>Two steps is also kind of time consuming and somewhat of a hassle</li>
            <li>product has a nice taste.</li>
            <li>Probably not, but it would be nice to have and would improve the product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this system because it is an effective product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always liked the value</li>
            <li>I have always used crest so I was thrilled to try this out.</li>
            <li>my teeth are a lot whiter and feel very clean!</li>
            <li>this easy and quick process works perfectly all by itself!  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li>So worth it!!!</li>
            <li>and I feel a great clean when I use it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my teeth felt really clean and my gums felt great.</li>
            <li>, they felt wonderful after brushing and the whitener was fast and easy to use, with good results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and the price is great!</li>
            <li>Either way, great results and easy to use, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>That said, I am satisfied with the color change, and very pleased with the look of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and it&#x27;s smile-verous (my new word for it).</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest, and I thought it was a great maintenance whitener.</li>
            <li>and so happy I was able to try it for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Good product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Although this did not cause tooth sensitivity in me, it may still cause sensitivity in others, but I am happy to report it didn&#x27;t - and Whitestrips cause my teeth to hurt &amp; become super</li>
            <li>loved how easy the two step process worked.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who don&#x27;t have straight perfect teeth, this product works better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>I loved that is was so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and the change is gradual.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use even though it comes in a set of 2.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>found the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use and can see my self using this product from this point on.</li>
            <li>I love it and love that my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed and even more than the cleaning and polishing, I love the sense of taking care of me for a change.</li>
            <li>the paste and the gel taste pretty good, which was a surprise to me!</li>
            <li>It also made me take better care of my teeth by brushing longer, and I even started to floss more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 2-step process, but does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li>It tastes great, is easy to use and best of all, my teeth are definitely whiter!  </li>
            <li>, they held up nicely  :)</li>
            <li>It would be wonderful if Crest could use a completely recyclable tube - including the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product for a whiter smile..</li>
            <li>I believe it will be much more effective after longer use.</li>
            <li>But all in all, this is by far the best teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>as far as whitening toothpastes go this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>And did it more effectively than any whitening strip I have tried.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be one of the easiest home whitening products out there, as well as the most effective.</li>
            <li>but the more I used it, the more I liked it and liked the results.  </li>
            <li>really liked this combination product, but I was expecting more from it on the whitening front.</li>
            <li>I can once again smile without worry and, yes, Shopper Army, I can &amp;#34;let my freak flag fly, &#x27;cause I feel like I owe it to someone.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for brightening up your smile.</li>
            <li>So far, I am impressed with the product removing stains and yellowing.</li>
            <li>I liked this concept of a toothpaste and a gel whitener that is not a strip, a gel that I brush on my teeth works so much better for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying good things about this product because I got it for free</li>
            <li>I liked the way it makes my teeth look whiter, and enjoy the tingle after brushing!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste combination is great for fresh breath .</li>
            <li>It is effective and if you can bare the taste, this product is great!!!</li>
            <li>I was given this product by Crest to try for free and I am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>After using the product for about 3 weeks, I am happy with my positive results, with no gum sensitivity problems!</li>

            <li>I found this product to be very effective and noticed a whiter smile after just a week of use.</li>
            <li>It did, However, make my teeth feel very clean, I experienced some mild sensitivity with the &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; routine.</li>
            <li>I loved the product, made my teeth feel so clean that after using it I keep wanting to run my tongue across my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really loved the clean feeling in my mouth as if I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>There are more effective, better tasting products out there.</li>
            <li>I would have liked more impute from you as most of the sites you asked us to use didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great clean mouth but strong mint taste</li>
            <li>The Crest two part whitening system helped me get my teeth looking brighter as well as giving them a good clean and almost polished feeling.</li>
            <li>Best part was I got to try it for FREE Thanks to crest.</li>
            <li>Although my mouth felt clean it did not have a good taste.</li>
            <li>I loved the squeaky clean feeling of my teeth after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>What else gives you that kind of clean?!</li>
            <li>I love being able to smile and show my teeth proudly.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ll continue using the product longer and am hopeful that overtime, I will see a more significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to report that it really works!</li>
            <li>Pretty great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does encourage the user to brush for two full minutes which is good.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, though, because you finish with Step 2 anyway!</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to sit around with anything on my teeth and that this product is easy to use!  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste made my teeth feel very smooth and clean.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The kit was easy to use and sat nicely on my bathroom vanity</li>
            <li>I received a box free from Crest and love it!</li>
            <li>I love using this in two steps -- first the brightening paste, which has a good, not overly minty taste and is kind of sparkly.  </li>
            <li>I received the whitening system to try for free from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!  </li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste as a buzz agent  promotion from crest to try for free and love it!</li>
            <li>Great product easy to use tastes great and actually works.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference after using for 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>It tastes a lot like the stuff that&#x27;s on a Crest WhiteStrip, so definitely not the greatest taste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I have never tried any teeth whitening products because I have had so many horror stories.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the results enough to work through that problem though.  </li>
            <li>I was not a fan of not being able to rinse between step 1 and 2</li>
            <li>and I got this product for free to try and give my honest opinions about.  </li>
            <li>I do want to continue to use it to see if it works better</li>
            <li>and then you brush with step 2 for one more minute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using the system and see how much better my teeth can look after a longer time.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try the crest 3d toothpaste and whitening gel through Bzzagent for Free to provide my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m glad I didnt.</li>
            <li>I feel way more confident now</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign in which I share my honest feedback with others.  </li>
            <li>so I would be able to compare my before and after shots.  </li>
            <li>importantly, the results!</li>
            <li>ok it may written them,  but is it cleaning them? &#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my teeth are not the whitest they are also not that &amp;#34;yellowed&amp;#34; so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to help improve the color at all.</li>
            <li>the affordability of this product and the ease of the use :)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the taste of the Step 2 polish more than the Step 1 cleanser.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the fact that the packaging is paper and can be recycled.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my breath smells better</li>
            <li>/&gt;The not-as-positives: The toothpaste didn&#x27;t taste minty like you would expect most toothpaste to taste like.</li>
            <li>(I just have to be a bit more patient).</li>
            <li>Not used to doing more than 1 step!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It would be better to combine this into one toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>The lack of mint makes it &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as if your teeth are not clean.&lt;br /&gt;The #2 tube could use a flip top like the #1 tube.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>The product was just OK.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked better than the whitening kit I got from my dentist</li>

            <li>and I love it.  </li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly continue to purchase it going forward.</li>
            <li>over all, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this product again, but i would try it again if the formula was changed.</li>
            <li>I was given this product for free to try and review from crest, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is more an abrasive/cleaner.</li>
            <li>Step 2 is a polish which has a better taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to continue using this product to whiten my teeth even more!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am now using it for more than 3 weeks and my friends have asked me about my Whittier teeth</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I&#x27;ve used it now, it always burns my gums and lips</li>
            <li>I have also tried whitening pens and still think that this product does a better job.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>My teeth are brighter and I love the minty taste it leaves in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since Crest sent me it for free I said why not!</li>
            <li>My mother enjoyed the product as well...</li>

            <li>You will love it</li>
            <li>My teeth were looking better, believe it or not.</li>
            <li>The taste of the paste was OK, and there is a noticeable difference after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the cleansing portion because I felt like my teeth were a lot cleaner after completing the system with each brushing.  </li>
            <li>As a result they must be whiter because there is nothing for my coffee or wine to cling to :)</li>
            <li>There was much more significance on his teeth than on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>

            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>Once I got to my whiteness level, I&#x27;ve been able to maintain with the use of this product.  </li>
            <li>I think that means I have to go to the dentist honestly and have a cavity filled.  </li>
            <li>The taste - no horrible after-taste -</li>
            <li>Which may have resulted in me not seeing better whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>any event, I was pleased to see that the product did NOT contain any plastic beads that would be harmful to the environment--and my gums.  </li>

            <li>Through BzzAgent, I was able to try this toothpaste and teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works quite well if you follow the directions and use it twice</li>
            <li>I got this free from Bzzagent to try!</li>
            <li>The Finisher was more minty in flavor and was more like a gel in consistency.  </li>
            <li>I love my results and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office would give better results</li>
            <li>I love that I am already brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>Maybe with longer use it might whiten my teeth more.</li>
            <li>See for yourself- top is before, bottom is after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to see results in a weeks time.</li>

            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>but once I started using it, it was OK.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]</li>
            <li>If that could be improved, it would be so much more enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the 2 step process but better texture and flavor</li>
            <li>would have got me to give more stars.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d prefer more of a mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wish the step 2 tube had a flip top like step one did.</li>

            <li>I get to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>I was given a free sample by the company to review but the opinions are my own.</li>

            <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than whitestrips because it whitens all your teeth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE how this system makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I believe the tenderness is being caused by the whitening agent, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure about that fact.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>There needs to be more minty, refreshing flavor like Step 1.</li>

            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>I do think I saw a bit of whitening effect after two weeks of use but, obviously since I&#x27;m not even 100% sure myself, it was underwhelming at best.</li>
            <li>I do feel optimistic that with more time, there will be more pronounced whitening results.</li>
            <li>I am sure to continue to use it-</li>
            <li>Best part is it only took 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>all i feel my teeth are brighter and for people with no sensitivity may like it better.</li>

            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a whitening system that you do not have to leave on your teeth, as the taste of most whitening systems make me gag.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>I love the way my mouth felt after using this and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>I felt confident when using this product.  </li>
            <li>I seriously love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I usually love brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>They come side by side in a cute box step 1 the cleaning paste.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased when my spouse noticed the change.  </li>
            <li>The gel is much more tolerable than the cleansing paste though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from bzz agent #lovefreestuff!</li>
            <li>I thought for sure it would take longer.</li>
            <li>I particularly love the whitening polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was given this product to review for free by BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>Ok so I have been using this 3D Crest Brilliance for about two weeks now.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t expect it to whiten overnight.  </li>
            <li>The picture on top shows my before and the one on bottom is after using this system.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive this product complementary through BuzzAgent to sample it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and only takes 2 minutes to use.</li>
            <li>But since Crest sent me it for free I said why not!</li>
            <li>But after several weeks using the product his teeth were looking healthy and glowing!!!!!</li>
            <li>Okay, I am a cynic.  </li>
            <li>I had not used any whitening products in many years.  </li>
            <li>However, it has done a wonderful job of keeping my teeth white as I&#x27;ve yet to need whitening strips again.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>absolutely love this 2 step system.</li>
            <li>The minty fresh mouth is one of the characteristics that I look for in a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the product for free!</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>love the way my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is ok.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use the product twice a day for best results, and I can only imagine the whitening you would see.</li>
            <li>I was provided free product to review, by Crest, but all views are my own.</li>
            <li>It also makes me more mindful of my dental health: the instructions say to brush with each of the two pastes for one minute</li>
            <li>I preferred the flip top tube to the capped tube.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this product through Amazon, though I shop Amazon all the time and love the site.</li>
            <li>Overall I am impressed with this product and give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I waited to review it till I could be sure of the results.</li>
            <li>I received this for free for review purposes from bzzagent, all options are my own though.</li>
            <li>After using the product for several weeks, I can say, without a doubt, this is the best at-home whitening system I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I used this product that was given to me as a free trial and liked it.</li>
            <li>Is it safe?</li>
            <li>I was able to whiten my teeth just by brushing them.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li>and I was also more confident in smiling around friends and family.</li>
            <li>makes that all better.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the Crest mouthwash that I received.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>love the ease ans results of this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li>The taste was okay</li>
            <li>I have some stains from coffee and wine that I would love to see whitened.</li>
            <li>and I think this one is much better.</li>
            <li>Love love this product, no dentist needed</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and will continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that if I use the 3D Brilliance kit at night and my 3D white in the am, it&#x27;s the perfect combination.</li>
            <li>This works much better than the strips and is comparable to what you would get from your dentist.</li>
            <li>but it was ok.</li>
            <li>this was not setting ok</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better then strips</li>
            <li>I love that feeling</li>
            <li>On top of no pain, my teeth are noticeably whiter as well.  </li>
            <li>So I want to start by saying yes, I did get this product for free to try from BzzAgent, but I am always honest with my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Crest White Kit is the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve come across</li>
            <li>better then the steps on my opiniom because I was going to brush anyway,</li>
            <li>I will finish using the product, but I do not think I will repurchase it as it is a lot more pricey than buying just the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Crest sent me a sample of this for free to try and review!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that I am already brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I love the idea of whitening ALL your teeth and not just the front ones like some whitening kits</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did because otherwise I don&#x27;t think I would have given it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>maybe the results would be more dramatic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you again to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me to try it for Free!</li>
            <li>I also think it has helped improve my tooth brushing regimen because I count while brushing to make sure I&#x27;m using each step for the correct amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li>I felt confident in my smile.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>This product is really interesting despite the fact that Crest is my go to brand.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a flip top tube.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that 3D did not increase my sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with Crest 3D White Brilliance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more the consistency of a gel.</li>
            <li>Crest products are my favorite for tooth brushing, and mouth washing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind using two steps, and Step 2 results in a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to say after about 4 weeks of using these</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the idea of this product.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister and she seemed to love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this system.</li>
            <li>I love the step 1.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the taste of step 2</li>
            <li>I used many products through out the years.</li>
            <li>(more than I saw with the Colgate Optic White)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for bzzagent.com for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li>you leave on without rinsing for just a minute, then you proceed to step two (the whitening finisher), brush for a minute more then rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using my toothpaste system.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>The instructions were ok.</li>
            <li>It should be a flip top like the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Until I was able to try the crest 3d two step teeth whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Overall, the best part was my mouth and teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful to Crest and Shopper&#x27;s Army for letting me test this amazing product for free.</li>
            <li>I find that if I use the 3D Brilliance kit at night and my 3D white in the am, it&#x27;s the perfect combination.</li>
            <li>So, after using it more than a week I do see a difference.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of whitening with this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the taste of this one.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more out of it!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>When I rinse my gums hurt so I have not been able to use the product twice a day.</li>
            <li>This did a better job than I was expecting it to.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I thought it would whiten my teeth more than it did.</li>
            <li>Thank to Crest, I was able to try this product for free !</li>
            <li>I love how my teeth feel after using the product.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>A two part system, hmmmm....not so sure about this.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is sweetened with sucralose, which I find intolerable (as do many people).</li>
            <li>On top of the taste, it has an extra-gritty texture for increased abrasion.</li>
            <li>details/review in greater depth at http://www.beautyskeptic.com/?p&#x3D;3276</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>(Not to mention it is better tasting)  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>OK, as many people are like me and the thought of yet another whitening product and the taste..</li>
            <li>and I hope you end up with better results than I did.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>This is more of a maintenance product than a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>The whole concept is great though - brush teeth for one minute with the cleansing toothpaste</li>
            <li>Whitening your teeth within your daily routine sounded perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty remarkable results in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Rest assured, I have found my go to whitening product that I am absolutely in love with.</li>
            <li>I love how my mouth feels after using this step.</li>
            <li>Again, in just one minute, your teeth are brighter, whiter, and all around more sparkly than before.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White Brillance is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Bzz for sending me this great product to try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s better to put the #2 step gel on with a Q-tip as opposed to a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I will keep using it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love running my tongue across my teeth as soon as I am done brushing them.  </li>
            <li>I was able to notice a difference in about 3 days.  </li>
            <li>The dental hygienist was able to remove the stain from my tooth in under a minute.</li>
            <li>But after using the gel, they felt so smooth!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the Crest 3D White system.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>This product was overall wonderful.</li>
            <li>I just could not spend time reading directions for a process I have been doing for most of my life.</li>
            <li>It might be better if it came with one of those color charts so people can have something to compare to.</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love having that</li>
            <li>Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li>May work better for some.</li>
            <li>Given more time I believe there would been even more lightening of the stains.</li>
            <li>I think it is a novel approach to whitening, but I would like to have seen better</li>
            <li>I found that it helped me to brush longer and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth look</li>

            <li>will purchase this toothpaste going forward, well after my free sample is all used up!</li>
            <li>love the taste - not too &amp;#34;stingy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>So my teeth are not horrifically stained, so I am unsure how this will do for a person who has been smoking for many years or who drinks lots of soda, teas, or coffee.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free of charge by Crest to try and give honest feedback.  </li>
            <li>I did not experience any gum sensitivity or irritations - and the product is easy to use as you brush with each product for one minute (very easy if you have an electric toothbrush)</li>
            <li>Step 2 gives your teeth a super clean, polished look right away, making you feel and look awesome!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product since it seemed like it would be a stronger and more effective paste treatment</li>
            <li>My mouth feels great after using the product and there isn&#x27;t sensitivity like I have experienced with other whitening products.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so fresh and clean after each use and the whitening benefit of it is great.</li>
            <li>I give the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System a 5/5 stars for sure!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I saw results!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the product as I had not used any whitening products for almost a year in an attempt to give my teeth a break.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product through Shoppers Army.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this</li>

            <li>I liked how this product cleaned my teeth and made my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I liked how clean my teeth felt after I used this product.</li>
            <li>but my mouth did feel exceptionally clean after using the product, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>I really liked how clean the product got my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used this product consistently for about three weeks now, and continue to use it in hopes that I see some good results, but so far the lesson that I have learned is that good result pictures are all about the lighting!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to write this review for those who are looking for a gentle, yet effective whitening system!</li>
            <li>The 2 steps are nothing more than what you do every morning to clean your teeth anyway!</li>
            <li>love how clean my teeth feel afterwards!</li>
            <li>Of course they look the best right after I brush, but they are still atleast 1 if not 2 shades whiter than “my normal” all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The toothpaste step made teeth very very clean.</li>
            <li>However, my mouth felt very clean after each treatment.</li>
            <li>I felt like it made my teeth and mouth very clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean after use.</li>
            <li>Using both products gave me a very clean feeling for my teeth.</li>
            <li>On Monday after using the product my mouth and teeth felt very clean even after I had my coffee.</li>
            <li>Overall, this was very pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product because it&#x27;s just my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, I find my teeth staying bright.</li>
            <li>: It is very refreshing and it has a fresh, minty taste.</li>
            <li>I was given a Crest 3D White Brilliance kit to try courtesy of Bzz Agent to try and test so these are my own honest opinions, I used it for a couple days and it was good</li>
            <li>The taste of the first tube was good.</li>
            <li>First the good</li>
            <li>The mouthwash made my whole mouth tingle and it has a really nice flavor !</li>
            <li>does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I took a good look at the color, and could absolutely see a difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>Taste is pretty good, with an aftertaste from #1 that is neutralized by #2.</li>
            <li>First off the taste-was good and did not have a chalky aftertaste.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good stuff; I got it as a sample from the brand through BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>The first step leaned your mouth feeling beyond clean, it&#x27;s almost am anything feeling lol.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was super excited to start as whiter teeth is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m loving this system and plan to keep using it!!</li>
            <li>Your Smile Forward !!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Step 1 is super minty, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy the two step process worked.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and starts working immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to bzzagent and crest 3D for allowing me to try this product as part of a promotion, absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly easy to use and the taste is okay.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to understand to make sure you maximize your results.</li>
            <li>found it was pleasant to use, but didn&#x27;t really whiten my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The process was easy to do i love the way it is numbered so no trying to remember which is first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and makes your mouth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this whitening kit for free, and I must say, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample from Crest of their 3D white brilliance toothpaste through BzzAgent and was impressed with it.</li>
            <li>- I liked that the gels did not foam too much - and that the tooth paste (step 1) has a nice minty</li>
            <li>how I got this awesome product for free from BzzAgent and how I would keep them posted of my final results.</li>
            <li>thanks BzzAgent for introducing my family to this great product and the opportunity to try for free.</li>

            <li>and that was more important.</li>
            <li>I was able to try Crest 3D for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I, like many others received a free trial from Crest and Bzz agent.</li>
            <li>However, I feel that there are better teeth whitening toothpastes/products available.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free on smiley 360 for a review.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>I was able to try it free as a member of Shopper Army but all opinions remain my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product just be leary if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I got to try it for free as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free by Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I was able to try this product free through Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>So glad I got to try it for free</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that works with consistent use I love it.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fantastic, better than after the dentist cleans them.</li>
            <li>I think this would be great to use in its entirety once every six months, maybe to maintain the results of a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I was able to try out this product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on my smile, and since using this whitening duo, I&#x27;ve gotten many more.  </li>
            <li>Implementing this regimen in place of your normal toothpaste is supposed to give you a dazzling, professional-grade</li>
            <li>The best part is that I have absolutely no pain or sensitivity.</li>
            <li>got this product complimentary of Crest but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Nor does it have the nice fresh taste I appreciate in Crest toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>the first step, the cleaning, was a great cleaning paste, not too minty, just right.</li>
            <li>Sounds too good to be true, right?</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix, or need a deep whitening, then this is probably not your best bet.</li>
            <li>While I did receive this product free to try out, I can honestly say this is the easiest way to get whiter teeth quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product free thru crest and bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product for free for being a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They may not be shades whiter (again, I don&#x27;t need to whiten really) but they seem so much shinier and my mouth stays clean All Day, which is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product that is so easy to use and get results right away.</li>
            <li>but the best part is how clean my teeth feel all day long.</li>
            <li>I feel that my teeth are very clean and smooth, and also whiter and brighter than they were before using the two step system.</li>
            <li>I also love getting compliments on my teeth and smile!</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably brighter and whiter, and I feel so confident with my smile!</li>
            <li>I love my smile!</li>
            <li>I was concerned about increased sensitivity due to the peroxide, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I did not experience any!</li>
            <li>for the system in stores, it&#x27;s definitely more wallet friendly as well.  </li>
            <li>plus I love having fresh breath!  </li>
            <li>And the best part is, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no pain or sensitivity from it whatsoever!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed the my teeth are whiter, but what&#x27;s even better is when people compliment me on my smile!</li>
            <li>I wanted a before and after but couldn&#x27;t get a true one because I saw results after 3 uses!</li>
            <li>But after a month I noticed and even more significant difference.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I was a couple shades lighter and my teeth were SO SMOOTH!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a good whitening system but probably not meant for me!</li>

            <li>Easy to use, just too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I found this to be easy to use, and the two step process easy to follow.</li>
            <li>The process is easy to do.</li>
            <li>I only used it once a day because many people said they experienced sensitivity when using twice a day.</li>
            <li>is an easy way to get whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>The 2 step process was easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite strong, but it does work to some extent.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some whiteners irritate my teeth or gums, because they are too strong.</li>
            <li>I did not find it to strong and it didn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>So, besides the strong flavor I would say I like this product</li>
            <li>I was able try this product at no cost thanks to Bzzagent, but this opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li>The taste was a bit strong, but I got accustomed to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this product to everyone and even though I had a sensitivity to this I still continue to use it periodically.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-does not provide the strong minty flavor that I prefer in a toothpaste</li>
            <li>This teeth whitening system is quite strong and abrasive.</li>
            <li>The Step 2 was also very easy to use and had a pleasant flavor very similar to Step 1.</li>
            <li>They feel as smooth and clean as they did this morning!</li>
            <li>It actually is pretty easy but the results aren&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought the Crest 3D white did a really great job of getting my mouth, teeth, and gums very clean looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>I received this amazing whitening system from BzzAgent, thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people with very crooked teeth like me because it works better than a whitening toothpaste and doesnt need to conform to fit your teeth like strips or mouth plates.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty amazing product.</li>
            <li>The results are noticeable, and I&#x27;ve had people comment on how white and beautiful my teeth are.</li>
            <li>no strips or trays that you have to wear in your mouth, good whitening results, no sensitivity, no change to your normal routine...just brush.</li>
            <li>I recently received this product for free through BzzAgent and loved it!</li>
            <li>I did use warm to hot water to rinse and maybe that helped.</li>
            <li>Step 2 also gives a bit of a burn, but it&#x27;s not necessarily bad, just seems refreshingly</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and clean my teeth feel after brushing without any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how this product made my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>my teeth and mouth felt a lot more clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I liked the way it made my teeth and mouth feel -- clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The pastes leave this super fresh, super smooth clean feeling like none I&#x27;ve every experienced.</li>
            <li>But I loved the clean feeling of my teeth that lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people with a busy lifestyle and you are able to get that dentist cleaning feeling right at home.</li>
            <li>I loved the easy 2 step system that you can complete in just 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>allowing me to start my day feeling bold, fresh and confident!</li>
            <li>To be honest the first use was when I really noticed the most change, however it&#x27;s still whiting!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste made my mouth so fresh and clean feeling and the whitener made my smile so bright.</li>
            <li>I however did not like the feeling of the whitening finisher on my teeth, but after using it my mouth was fine.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean, my breath felt fresh, and most importantly, my teeth looked whiter!  </li>
            <li>The taste on both was fine for me.</li>
            <li>It has a fine taste to it as well.</li>
            <li>It could be that it was more convenient and that I used it more consistently.</li>
            <li>taste and texture of the cleaning paste is fine.</li>
            <li>The taste was fine too.</li>
            <li>My experience was fine.</li>
            <li>Some toothpaste are too minty and foamy, this was neither, so made brushing for 60 seconds easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>Lucky me!</li>
            <li>This is a clear gel, it doesn&#x27;t have as pleasant a taste as the toothpaste gel, but it is not off-putting.</li>
            <li>I quickly changed my mind!  </li>
            <li>I found that this toothpaste made my teeth feel really clean, squeaky clean as a matter of fact!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and BZZAgent, I had the opportunity to try this product for FREE!!</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this kit and couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about the simplicity, convenience, price, and pain-free, instantaneous results.  </li>
            <li>The tubes are easy to apply to your toothbrush and the deep cleansing toothpaste has a great tasting mint flavor.</li>
            <li>The Whitening Finisher gel that comes with the Crest 3D White Brilliance system is a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>I found Crest 3D white easy to use and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>: Maybe worth it for excellent clean feeling, much more than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is intended to whiten teeth that haven&#x27;t been treated before, but as a touch up for previously treated teeth and as a followup to the excellent Crest 3D Luxe whitening strips, this is a great product and one I&#x27;m definitely keeping in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product for cleaning, I didn&#x27;t get the whitening results I had hoped for but they are certainly whiter.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to give the Crest 3D Daily Whitening System a try and after about two weeks of use, I can say I&#x27;m definitely impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I did also receive it as part of a promotion but love it so much!!</li>
            <li>All in all very pleased with this and record it highly.</li>

            <li>After three days, I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I received this for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent but opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It may not be a huge impact, but you can notice the difference.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that I was one of the ones chosen by BzzAgent to receive a free box of the Crest 3D White cleansing and whitening system to try.  </li>
            <li>Even with the amount I do use it I can tell a huge difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>

            <li>pros of this product for me are that it is easy to use and yields quick results while not exacerbating my tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The system is easy to use and gives quick results.</li>

            <li>I got this product for free thanks to Crest through BzzAgent and am really happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>The second step is especially great because my teeth are not perfectly straight, so by brushing in the paste, I&#x27;m able to get every spot!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product as a bzz agent, but all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li>When I smile in pictures I see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>What an inexpensive and easily accessible alternative, then going to the dentist to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have generally always had good results with whitening products.  </li>
            <li>price - if it was just me, it is fine as I won&#x27;t use it that quickly</li>
            <li>although I have not noticed a remarkable change in the color of my teeth, and the pictures were not sent as there was no obvious difference, I welcomed the opportunity to try this product as I had been considering the purchase of a whitening system for some time</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure that abrasion is not</li>
            <li>Love this product so much!</li>

            <li>Noticed a more willing manner to wanting my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>Then the mouthwash came and, although reluctant at first after reading reviews from others, I finally tried it and loved it !</li>
            <li>After all of this, I rinsed and looked at my smile, and it already looked whiter!</li>

            <li>Since using it, Ive noticed a significant improvement in the color/shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference in the whiteness after the first use that just got better with each additional use.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a significant difference-</li>
            <li>I however do find it sort of time consuming in the morning and haven&#x27;t been able to consistently use this product twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was really excited about receiving this product-</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference in the whiteness after the first use that just got better with each additional use.</li>
            <li>However, I did not notice any  significant whitening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this product</li>
            <li>I was excited that this didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This Crest product has been consistent, not over whitening, which has made for a more even</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>Still worth it, though!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this set.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw the price of it in stores.</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to get to try this two step whitening product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>whitening paste is very effective in lifting moderate stains fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>My teeth do feel clean and fresh after each use though!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this FREE in the mail from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth were super clean after the very first use!</li>
            <li>aside from the whitening, one thing I noticed from day one was how clean my teeth felt and</li>
            <li>After brushing with this system my teeth felt incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that it made my teeth feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li>The Crest products make your mouth feel tingly and clean, and I can see the difference in the whiteness of my teeth after just 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Step one, literally had my teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>brush for 60 seconds with Step 1 to leave your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This product promises a clean mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean, refreshed and</li>
            <li>Dentist office clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and leaves my mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li>an clean for hours.</li>
            <li>Its like after a trip to the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>But, for how clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li>My guess would be that this would be a really great after-care product if you had your teeth whitened professionally as it would probably maintain really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>The downsides to this product (for me) is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as clean as I am used to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products before and with the exception of whitening tooth pastes, most whitening products make my teeth unbearably sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky people who got to try this for free through BzzAgent and Crest.  </li>
            <li>It does make my teeth feel EXTREMELY clean</li>
            <li>a polished (think after dentist visit clean)</li>
            <li>I was able to try the product for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>Your mouth just feels so intensely clean and minty</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Each time, after brushing, my teeth and mouth felt extremely clean.</li>
            <li>how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>Made teeth feel clean and polished.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a 2 step system to clean, polish and brighten.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love now how clean my mouth is, as comparable with the kind of clean after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;After two days I can physically see that my gums are pinker and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, they still feel remarkably clean.</li>
            <li>It did leave my teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li>My teeth looked and felt clean for hours after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I was able to try this product for free as a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked this product and was so glad I got to try it.</li>
            <li>The 1-2 punch of the cleanser and polisher assure your teeth are squeaky clean like they feel after the dentist as week as brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li>I also felt that my teeth were well polished, clean, and shiny.</li>
            <li>And running your tongue over your teeth (the acid test for clean) is a pleasure.</li>
            <li>but otherwise my teeth whitened up and felt clean.</li>
            <li>They also feel incredibly clean after brushing with this system.</li>
            <li>that clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so freaking clean feeling and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is from the most reputable manufacturer of oral hygiene products in the world and may be used with complete confidence.</li>
            <li>I do like how clean my teeth feel after I use step 1</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel clean and polished.</li>
            <li>I have had excellent results so far and have only been using the product for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after I use it, and the clean feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt slippery clean.</li>
            <li>When using this product my teeth feel exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li>You clean, then you whiten.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling stayed all day.</li>
            <li>The two step system made me feel like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting really clean.</li>
            <li>and I just never felt like I ended up with really a really clean mouth.</li>
            <li>It just leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>You just use tube 1 to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>and the toothpaste did make my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>My teeth did feel clean.</li>
            <li>I also felt that my mouth and teeth were clean all day.</li>
            <li>When you are finished your teeth are literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I have found that using it twice a day as direction keeps my teeth squeaky clean all day.</li>
            <li>It is a two part system that one uses twice a day to clean and remove stains.  </li>
            <li>I found myself using my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste at night and the whitening toothpast (the two tubes) in the morning when I felt refreshed and more willing to commit the full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It actually had a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>And, since I find using the product pleasant, I will continue to use it and await bigger -- and brighter --</li>
            <li>In addition, the whitening paste was pleasant enough to use.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very good concept, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the past month since using this.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first two days but after brushing my mouth didn&#x27;t feel very clean</li>
            <li>And not to mention my mouth feels cool, fresh!</li>
            <li>far it is working way more than my expectations were for an over the counter product!</li>
            <li>It was awesome for about the first 2 weeks, then I started having major build-up on my back teeth at the top.</li>
            <li>At first I was not to sure it was doing a good job getting my teeth white, but then I happened to read the instructions and it said to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>The first couple days my gums hurt but that got better quick.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered a free trial system of Crest 3D White Brilliance as part of a promotion from Crest, I was happy to try it out and see if I could use it more frequently to get a faster whitened</li>
            <li>and honestly i smile more often since i am more confident in my self, who knew white teeth</li>
            <li>I was fortunately chosen to try and review crest 3d white brilliant daily cleansing from bzzagent for free!</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use and results were noticeable right away.  </li>
            <li>After receiving this whitening kit from BzzAgent I was pretty excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that this really does brighten your smile!</li>
            <li>I received Crest 3D White free from Crest and BzzAgent and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working!!  </li>
            <li>so I use it for special occasions and</li>
            <li>I love this new product!!</li>
            <li>Love this new system!!</li>
            <li>I think there could be a bit more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; teeth feel after using the product but as a whole if you are looking for a product to clean and whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>, the surprising part was how clean my teeth actually felt.</li>
            <li>I think there could be a bit more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; teeth feel after using the product but as a whole if you are looking for a product to clean and whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>the most part, this product did exactly what it claimed to do, and I am enjoying my newly brighter and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>Has a super fresh, minty taste!</li>
            <li>I was super excited.</li>
            <li>i was super excited and still am.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this after receiving it to test through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about whitening with this two step system from Crest.</li>
            <li>The strips are hard to stick perfectly on your teeth</li>
            <li>, When I received the package I was super excited to test this one out.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to get it and think it might make a difference.</li>
            <li>My teeth were brighter and more vibrant!</li>
            <li>I avoid tasting this by just brushing on the front of my teeth that you can see (why do I need bright white molars, right!?).  </li>
            <li>While it was largely effective, it had a strong peroxide taste, took noticeably longer, and left me with significant sensitivity in my teeth.</li>
            <li>but i didnt see much result for whitnening after using it for a week but toothpaste is nice and fresh making my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty great alternative to bleaching.</li>
            <li>I do think that I have experienced quicker and more drastic whitening from professional whitening - but that comes with a bigger price tag.</li>
            <li>They are bright, white and shiny.</li>
            <li>first impression of Crest 3D White was attractive packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to tell my husband and children to not touch it because they&#x27;ve all seen how white and bright my teeth are.</li>
            <li>Thanks crest for the free product to review!</li>
            <li>and it takes just as good as any regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I do drink lots of caffeine (pepsi and sweet tea) so that could be the problem.</li>
            <li>I thought that my Crest 3D White toothpaste was a good product.</li>
            <li>The only whitening agent is hydrogen peroxide (which may or may not be good as all the spendier products I&#x27;ve seen on the market seem to use carbamide peroxide).</li>
            <li>I received a full sized sample to review from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t do this because I love it so much I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li>(let me tell you, it does discipline me and make me brush my teeth for the full two minutes).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found that it really helped me feel better about smiling in pictures.</li>
            <li>I drink a fair amount of tea, so the daily use of this product has helped my teeth immensely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was true to the crest name!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I could improve it, I would make the whitening results more intense, but for what it does it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample of this product for testing courtesy of Crest and bzzagent.</li>
            <li>and I hope to see whitening after a full use of the product.  </li>
            <li>The Deep Cleaning toothpaste in the step one tube is a good consistency</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than trays or strips, so I love the convenience as a coffee and wine drinker.</li>
            <li>After 2 full minutes of brushing, spit.</li>
            <li>I loved the deep cleansing toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt super clean and polished.</li>
            <li>I used this product for two full weeks.</li>
            <li>I kept using it for 3 more days and my gums are still very tender.</li>
            <li>But this cleaning system actually has a good taste.</li>
            <li>The polish was not as tasty but gave my teeth a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels so super clean.</li>
            <li>It is a good product to maintain the whiteness of your teeth form daily tea and coffee discoloration.</li>
            <li>Just brush gently, and be patient, and you will love the results.</li>
            <li>I myself will continue using this product since I am a true believer in it.</li>
            <li>I received a full sized sample of this kit from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it really helped me to have whiter teeth and better gum health.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would really work</li>
            <li>it says six weeks for full results</li>
            <li>It has a minty taste that I loved, but the gritty polish took awhile  to get used to</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample of this product for testing courtesy of Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>what I’m sure you really want to know about is the results.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free and pleased with overall how it worked.  </li>
            <li>but was starting to whiten good</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m not in the minority here when I admit that I don&#x27;t ALWAYS brush for a full 2 minutes 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li>I brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call myself the pickiest person when it comes to toothpaste, but I do want it to keep my teeth white and do a good job, of course.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product for those days in between your regular visits to the hygienist.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for allowing me to sample this product for free!</li>
            <li>I did use it for two weeks to get the full effects.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super clean and whiter than ever before.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely used my fair share of whitening products.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t mind the taste and it helps me brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I also use the whitestrips, but I&#x27;m loving the toothpaste, because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad but there could be improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Not Bad</li>
            <li>My theeth are not badly stained though</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Brushing for two minutes isn&#x27;t too hard, but if you are a quick brusher then this might not be the best product for you.</li>
            <li>The first step makes my teeth feel SUPER clean, and it lasts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take any extra time out of your day and my teeth feel super clean and look amazing.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I had high hopes for this product and was really excited to try it</li>
            <li>I adapted easily and my teeth felt cleaner and more refreshed after both steps were complete.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my BzzAgent complimentary trial set  from Crest and BzzAgent and had to try it right away!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean all day - none of that fuzzy feeling that I have experienced with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I received the product free with BZZkit but cannot wait to purchase more for friends and family to have a professionally whiter smile!</li>
            <li>so I am aware of how easy it is to stain my teeth.</li>
            <li>When I used this product I immediately felt a deep clean feeling and a tingle of freshness but best of all I actually noticed that my teeth looked, dare</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast results!</li>
            <li>The deep cleansing toothpaste leaves your teeth and gums feeling clean and refreshed and the whitening finisher leaves your smile shining bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a way to brighten my smile and this seemed easy ,quick and economical .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush with the first paste (spit but don&#x27;t rinse) and then brush with the whitener.</li>
            <li>Easy and really works!</li>
            <li>And its so easy and fast to use!  </li>
            <li>Sorry Crest, but still happy I was able to try it for free :)</li>
            <li>What I love the most is the lasting super clean feeling I have.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it and loved being able to talk about my personal trials!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>It left my teeth and mouth feeling especially clean, like it feels right after a cleaning at the dentist&lt;</li>
            <li>The system is super easy to use on a twice daily basis, tho, and I am happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity after using this product which was a surprise to me because I have experienced that with other teeth whitening brands.</li>
            <li>The tooth paste leaves your teeth feeling super clean then the second step for whitening just adds to the beautiful smile, it amazes me how much whiter my smile is in just 4 days of twice a day</li>
            <li>The minty freshness is great and there is very minimal after taste from the whitening portion.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to report that the added sensitivity was very minimal.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this product if only for the great clean healthy feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Voila, clean, fresh mouth and a whiter looking set of teeth.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste itself isn&#x27;t overly minty but it leaves a fresh clean feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get that fresh, clean teeth feeling</li>
            <li>This toothpaste combo leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I also feel my teeth are clean and my breath is fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>teeth felt “fresh from the dentist” clean after two minutes, instead of 30 minutes in the dental hygienist chair.</li>
            <li>I found that this product helped my mouth feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>The 2 step system from Crest is convenient to use at home and works wonders for making one&#x27;s mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>After both steps, I found my mouth to feel completely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Although my mouth felt &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; (almost fresh from the dentist clean)</li>
            <li>After both steps, I found my mouth to feel completely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean after use and fresh mouth</li>
            <li>A quick google search suggested that both of those substances are included to help scrape plaque off your teeth.</li>
            <li>and I like quick results, both of which Crest has nailed with this system.&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li>It is literally an instant result that gets even better with more use and probably the fastest whitening product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But I think that&#x27;s just me liking super duper minty breath.</li>
            <li>so Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System are the perfect products for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a non-smoker would see even more whitening, so I would definitely encourage folks to try it, they&#x27;ll like it!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results:  After using for about a month I don&#x27;t notice tremendous differences in the coloring of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for tremendous changes you won&#x27;t find it here.  </li>
            <li>Crest 3D White Brilliance daily cleansing and whitening system is a great product!</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how white it does get your teeth in a short amount of time</li>
            <li>Also saw results quickly.</li>
            <li>but it is a quick process</li>
            <li>Through BzzAgent, I was able to try Crest 3D White for FREE!</li>
            <li>I received this Crest 3D White Brilliance Duo free in the mail from Bzzagent.com to try out and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>The CREST 3D WHITE BRILLIANCE DAILY CLEANSING AND WHITENING System is absolutely awesome!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste combo definitely exceeded my expectations and I will be sure to buy some more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li>When you clean your teeth with this product it feels strong like it is really working.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly this product worked.</li>
            <li>Since this product is replacing my daily tooth paste I am going to continue to try it and see if in 3 more weeks I have better results.</li>
            <li>I have been using my free Crest 3d white brilliance tooth paste and whitening gel from Buzzagent for just a couple of weeks and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>so luckily I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.  </li>
            <li>Can it totally remove many, many years of tea and cola stain?  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed this product and more than likely will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>While it works great, I just can&#x27;t justify spending this much on toothpaste on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I am a big coffee and soda drinker and was pleased that I was able to try this out and see what it could do for my darker stained teeth.</li>
            <li>(and he doesn&#x27;t notice much, lol!)This is a great product and one I&#x27;m definitely keeping in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>I might be most pleased white</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different whitening toothpastes, gels, strips, lights to get rid of stubborn coffee stains.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Teeth feel super clean&lt;br /&gt;-Absolutely</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and not messy either.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it, but after 4 weeks of use, my teeth don&#x27;t look that much better.</li>
            <li>Usually whitening toothpaste keeps the whiteness going for a good while longer than regular toothpaste, but I found this to be absolutely the best whitening product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After using this the first time, I immediately noticed my teeth were squeaky clean and smooth just like a fresh polish from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this for some more time, but as of right now I am not seeing much change in color.</li>
            <li>I think if you were to use a product like white strips, this toothpaste system would be an easy way to keep up your brilliant white smile.</li>
            <li>, my teeth feel very clean and smooth, almost like I just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>However, after each brushing my teeth did feel very clean and smooth, almost like having had a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth in just a couple weeks use, and I began to notice a difference within the first couple of brushings.  </li>
            <li>I was leary at first but after using it for a week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>I will admit that for the price, the actual tube of toothpaste, which I tend to use more of, is on the smaller side, but with a sale or a coupon, this would be a great investment.</li>
            <li>Compared to other whitening toothpastes, I do think this two-step system is more effective in whitening and brightening my teeth.</li>
            <li>It should be more effective and easier than the other products I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The treatments seems to work better then normal whitening toothpaste, as I never see a difference with those.</li>
            <li>clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>really liked this whitening product better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If you really want a brighter smile and don&#x27;t mind gritty, overpowering toothpaste then its a great product because I did start to see results of its whitening power</li>
            <li>I got to try it for free thanks to Crest!  </li>
            <li>this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying the product for free thanks to Crest® and bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the taste and smell of the product and it cleaned really well!</li>
            <li>I got my first trial for free</li>
            <li>I think this product is great for the average customer.</li>
            <li>The first 3 days I noticed a difference on how light the marks were after using the Crest 3D.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning aspect of the product was much better than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but like my normal routine better.</li>
            <li>(I tried this product for free thanks to Crest!)</li>
            <li>I loved the feeling of my teeth having that just from the dentist feel and it lasted all day long.</li>
            <li>What I really liked about the toothpaste was how clean my mouth felt, even after waking up the next morning.</li>
            <li>Just 2 steps and 2 minutes and your mouth is fresh &amp; clean and your smile is whiter &amp; brighter.</li>
            <li>I liked the taste and it left my mouth feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li>I liked the clean feel I got when I ran my tongue over my teeth both the front and back.</li>
            <li>And while I personally wasn&#x27;t noticing significant whitening, I didn&#x27;t exactly have the most yellow teeth to begin with -- and my dental hygienist went out of her way to ask me if I&#x27;d ever whitened my teeth before, because they looked so great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using that toothpaste system consistently for 10 days both morning and night and feel like the product is a great toothpaste, gives a deep clean, makes my teeth stronger and also really whitens my smile.</li>
            <li>Not only did I love this product but it made my mouth feel so clean and energized!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m a big fan of the 3D whitening toothpaste, so I was really excited when I received a free trial kit from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed using the new Crest two step system.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s where the magic happens so I live with it.</li>
            <li>I used a previous whitening system by crest, and experienced some pain while using the whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, fast and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>really like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Fast, Easy, Results.</li>
            <li>This is a simple 2 minute process that did a pretty good job</li>
            <li>Step 1 was a nice minty flavor that left my mouth tasting really fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Step two makes your breath super fresh and your teeth feel like they just had a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>This product is so fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if I was seeing any whiting but after about 4 or 5 days of using this 3D Crest, my husband could even tell that yes my teeth are getting much whiter.</li>
            <li>The system is easy to use, much better than the whitening strips or trays, and as quick as regular tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>Not TV announcer white, but pretty good.</li>
            <li>The product was really easy to use and didn&#x27;t take much time to use.</li>
            <li>I am an avid fan of the Crest 3D White toothpastes and was delighted when I had the chance to try out this 2 step system.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D is easy, fast</li>
            <li>I loved how easy it was to use, and took so little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothpaste and whitener each had a different yet nice flavor and really made me feel that my teeth were as clean as if I were at the dentist getting a cleaning !</li>
            <li>I can see a major difference in the color of my teeth and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I waited to review to see if it really lived up to it&#x27;s name, and to my shock and excitement, it did!!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I was first offered this campaign from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for 2 weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do in 2 more!</li>
            <li>It only got better from there!  </li>
            <li>Just after the first day I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li>I have noticed results after the first week and have not had to stop drinking coffee!</li>
            <li>WHITENS FROM THE FIRST DAY!</li>
            <li>AND IT WHITENED FROM THE FIRST DAY!</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!!</li>
            <li>At first I was excited about the results I saw on Day one.</li>
            <li>Seemed pretty simple to use for best results use twice a day and each bottle for only one minute each.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference of whiter teeth the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>and I say this because with brushing twice a day, my teeth feel smooth and free of plaque pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I have always big a Crest fan, now I like them even more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more when it&#x27;s gone!)</li>
            <li>The second step is the polisher and this used in conjunction with a power brush is where the magic happens!</li>
            <li>2 steps in my opinion are not necessary when their clinical toothpaste does whitening too plus much much more!</li>
            <li>I would not believe the difference it made after just the first time of using it!</li>
            <li>To time one minute doing the first step and then not rinsing (ICK!)</li>
            <li>I loved that it cleaned my teeth and the first few days were ok</li>
            <li>The second step is the polisher and this used in conjunction with a power brush is where the magic happens!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner after I get done brushing then with any other kind of toothpaste and they look a lot whiter, too!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more when this runs out!  </li>
            <li>but I definitely noticed a change in my pearly whites for the better after using the product ffor a week or so - even my kids noticed!  </li>
            <li>This new product is completely different and has a great minty taste.</li>
            <li>The directions on the back are very user friendly!!!</li>
            <li>Naturally I said yes since I&#x27;m very comfortable with the brand.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent member, I was able to try this new product free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look black light white, but that&#x27;s probably for the best.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this system because it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require lots of extra effort, but still provides great results.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use, your mouth feels sqeaky clean, and already a shade whiter.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product for free and I have to say that I love it.  </li>
            <li>felt really clean with the first step.  </li>
            <li>all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself is really great, It takes about two minutes, the first tube is kind of gritty and the second tube that you use immediately after has a peroxide compound in it to really penetrate any stains.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity like I&#x27;ve experienced with other whiteneing products in the past.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than any other whitening treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried and it is so easy!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing with my normal toothpaste to use, but my teeth felt smooth and clean all day</li>
            <li>I feel that this stuff is only good until a certain extent of whiteness.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a pleasant peppermint flavor, and the combination of the two products together cleaned my teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li>It really truly does work for whitening and my breath is super fresh!</li>
            <li>I tried this product for free thanks to Crest® and BzzAgent.  </li>

            <li>tried this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I did get to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>I really like how smooth my teeth feel</li>
            <li>This two step daily cleansing and whitening system is a product that does seem to be effective at whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive this through BzzAgent and was able to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was picked to get a free sample of Crest 3D white brilliance from Crest via BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>however, temporary discomfort is worth getting these kinds of results.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I brush longer and better because I am following the detailed instructions for the two-step process.</li>
            <li>and I do think I notice a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>I am loving the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System that I received from BZZAgent for review.</li>
            <li>The results make it worth it, and I&#x27;ve just tried to avoid getting step 2 on my tongue to alleviate the taste.</li>
            <li>so I have plenty of damage to fix, but I belive if I stick with this product after I finish the bottles and continue on it on my own, I will have a whiter and younger</li>
            <li>am diet cola addict, so I definitely depend on a whitener to keep my teeth looking nice.  </li>
            <li>However, I have a cracked tooth and the peroxide has found its way to the most sensitive part of that tooth.</li>
            <li>#34;bubble up&amp;#34; like traditional toothpaste so even though I knew the toothpaste was effective, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fee&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my teeth feel smooth and not gritty.</li>
            <li>I am super OCD when it comes to making sure my teeth are clean and white.</li>
            <li>Made me feel like I had a youthful smile</li>
            <li>it also makes your teeth sensitive, so i would probably use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks Crest and Bzzagent for this free sample!</li>
            <li>The more, eh, intense dentist&#x27;s product had created so much sensitivity in my teeth that I thought I was feeling disheartened and pessimistic about whitening products.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive teeth but would love to find a whitening product I can use.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if I could just use one tube and get the same results.</li>
            <li>My breath is fresh and my teeth are noticeably whiter after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My smile can use all the help it can get and this works.</li>
            <li>Just brush your teeth for one minute with each product and in five days, a brighter and healthier smile.</li>
            <li>I liked this simple to incorporate two step system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Clean, Fresh mouth&lt;</li>
            <li>my own - based on my personal experience using this</li>
            <li>After only using it for about a week, I was getting compliments on how nice my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>I found this system tastes a lot better than the (HD) system, so it actually made the whole experience a lot more pleasurable.</li>
            <li>personally love my teas during the day and red wine in the evening and was hoping this would be a good solution to keep my teeth white.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure because ice never had a professional polish, but I can say at it does work.</li>
            <li>Generally, I liked the Crest 3D White product.</li>
            <li>I have been using the system for over 4 weeks now with success.</li>
            <li>I liked that I could whiten my teeth without adding extra steps to my routine.</li>
            <li>My breath also stays fresh for longer.</li>
            <li>some days are better than others - and out of about 10 uses, I&#x27;d say this product made my teeth feel sensitive about 2 or 3 of those.</li>
            <li>I really liked the feeling the products left in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried this Crest 3D White product and it made me feel like I was doing something nice for myself.</li>
            <li>I think with continued use it&#x27;ll keep making my smile brighter.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzReport, I received a free sample of Crest 3D White Brilliant Daily Cleansing and Whitening System.</li>
            <li>However, my gums were a bit sensitive after using it for that many days.</li>
            <li>though the pain to get there may not have been worth it...</li>
            <li>I liked the taste and zingy feeling in my mouth when I used the Crest 3D White.</li>
            <li>But it defiinitely leaves a fresh breath feel.</li>
            <li>After realizing this I started to brush more lightly and for no longer than a minute which is plenty of enough time.</li>
            <li>two was nice because it cleaned off all of that gritty toothpaste from step one.</li>
            <li>so maybe there is just too much staining on my teeth already for the product to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a difference in the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li>Most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t give me the results I want, and bleaching gels make my teeth so sensitive that I have to stop using them before they even have a chance to work.</li>
            <li>I was able to try 3D White for free.  </li>
            <li>My parents even asked if I had gone for a cleaning because my teeth looked so fresh.</li>
            <li>To be honest my teeth are naturally very white.  </li>
            <li>But, I’m a self-professed fresh breath junkie</li>
            <li>and my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>and I get compliments all the time on my smile.</li>
            <li>and I have started showing my smile again.</li>
            <li>and I can see a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>However it did not give me that fresh feeling you get after you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>product took some getting used to, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>liked the product and overall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking to brighten your teeth a bit and don&#x27;t like the strips.</li>
            <li>I was also hoping for a noticeably whiter smile, but I&#x27;m not convinced it showed up yet.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test this product at no cost and thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Just wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li>the whitening paste tastes a bit like hydrogen peroxide - this didn&#x27;t really bother me too much either as I didn&#x27;t find the hydrogen peroxide taste overwhelming.</li>
            <li>my teeth haven’t been as white as I would have liked before using this system.  </li>
            <li>My smile is brighter and my teeth shine.</li>
            <li>I found my teeth and gums to be more sensitive with use.</li>
            <li>With just those two point, it makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li>After Day 3, I could tell that my smile was brighter.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a brighter smile but didn&#x27;t want to pay for anything too costly.  </li>
            <li>My mouth didn&#x27;t feel fresh or minty when I was done brushing.</li>
            <li>Overall, really liked it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my teeth were feeling more sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and</li>
            <li>Definitely a worth while purchase and</li>
            <li>This two step daily cleansing and whitening system is a product that does seem to be effective at whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this product nice is the fact I don&#x27;t have to use it daily for it to work.</li>
            <li>It will be well worth your time and effort</li>
            <li>I hoped for a whiter smile, but my teeth may just need stronger whitening ingredients</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the polishing effect of step 1, but wished it made my mouth feel cleaner and refreshed</li>
            <li>My smile is noticeably brighter ever since I&#x27;ve been using the system even when I drink coffee.</li>
            <li>It does leave my mouth feeling fresh, and I like that it encourages me to brush for the dentist-recommended amount of time (2 minutes).</li>
            <li>My teeth felt super clean all day after using this system, and I could see a bit of a change from the very start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System for free and I&#x27;m in love with the results.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it anyways, because I like how fresh my mouth feels.&lt;br /&gt;**i</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the results.  </li>
            <li>Although I prefer a mintier taste for step 1, my mouth feels fresh after I use this product.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is that it enables me to whiten all of my teeth and just not a few that strips cover.</li>
            <li>I was always unsure about smiling and showing my teeth but with the crest 3d whitening toothpaste I am not afraid to show off my smile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much faster than whitening strips taking only 2 minutes to get awesome white teeth.</li>
            <li>You can decide if the cosmetic results are worth the damage; for me, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could notice a difference within a weeks time that I had a brighter, lighter smile.</li>
            <li>Over all the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a noticeably whiter smile after just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I realized that they were helping whiten my teeth and keep them fresh.</li>
            <li>the fresh taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This step honestly makes me feel like I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to brighten your smile.</li>
            <li>I feel my teeth are fairly white on their own; I try to stay away from drinks that will stain my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had the pleasure of receiving Crest 3D White Brilliance System as part of my honest feedback from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I am used to the fresh tasting mint flavors of crest</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fresh from the dentist.</li>
            <li>results.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a complimentary sample of this, by Crest and Bzzagent</li>
            <li>I do believe I noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>positive things about this product is that it made my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and although it does take more work than a regular toothpaste, it is diffenantly worth the try, as this is not expensive as in a dental office for whitening.</li>
            <li>It is a great maintenance product for those that have previously whitened their teeth and would like to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on many positive reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li>I have had a very positive experience with the product.</li>
            <li>This product provides quick, easy results and has given my teeth a whole new level of clean.</li>
            <li>really love the clean feeling you get in your mouth after using this product, it is so easy to use and not at all time consuming like other whitening products.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this as I had been wanting to get my teeth whitened professionally for a while now but hadn&#x27;t had the time to do so.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say I recommend it for whitening because of my experience, but I will certainly recommend it for clean, fresh teeth.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the way it worked, but after using Crest 3D White my mouth and teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean and fresh as it did when I used Crest 3D White -</li>
            <li>I loved how clean my mouth felt and my teeth were a little whiter but</li>
            <li>The whitening polish left my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>i like that this is easy to use because you can just replace your normal toothpaste with this 2 step process.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use, Step 1 is a normal toothpaste</li>
            <li>My husband is even excited about using it and asked to make sure it is on the next grocery run.</li>
            <li>Does it whiten better than the original Crest 3D white toothpaste?</li>
            <li>about one shade whiter, which for me is great since other products have never seemed to really work with all of the hassle that you go through.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and while I did have some burning and irritation to my gums, that was normal.</li>
            <li>The brushing easily fits into a normal routine.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>and i certainly leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Achieving a whiter smile in two easy, refreshing and love that smile steps is possible, with the addition of Crest 3D White to your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>first step is the toothpaste, it does not have the super minty taste of most toothpaste, but it definitely makes your teeth feel clean, you do not rinse after, which takes some getting used to...</li>
            <li>Not the best tasting toothpaste, especially step 2 which is easily recognizable for the peroxide that it is, but much easier and quicker than white strips and at ~$12</li>
            <li>This 3D White Brilliance, by contrast, provides excellent whitening, in much less time, with a better freshness and great taste, and I have not experienced any sensitivity.</li>
            <li>less than super bright teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing white in areas I did not expect and my teeth continue to feel clean through most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean my mouth feels after using step one (The deep cleansing paste)</li>
            <li>This product really helped to make my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Omg i love crest 3D daily it leaves my mouth feeling so minty clean.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a very strong minty taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh for several hours and the whitening polish tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I used to much and my teeth felt kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li>I got this product as a promotion through BzzAgent (great website) and as an avid coffee drinker and, now, ex-smoker I have always wanted whiter teeth and this helped a little.</li>
            <li>The price compared to other whitening products is also really good.</li>
            <li>At first i was not too sure of having to use a combination of 2 products but after using it for a week i saw results, It really works and its not so much fuss as it gets to become part of your brushing routine.</li>
            <li>The deep cleansing tooth paste is more abrasive than most normal toothpastes and people, including myself, have a tendency to brush too</li>
            <li>I read other reviews that said the taste was disagreeable because of the sweetener, however I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>mouth stay pretty fresh for hours&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely effective in not only whitening but the protection of tooth enamel and gums</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for fast and satisfying results!!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>I believe the product works well, since I noticed a difference almost right away.</li>
            <li>right...</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, that seems counterproductive.  </li>
            <li>After brushing with Step One you are supposed to spit, and start Step Two right away.  </li>
            <li>although, I would recommend not eating or drinking right after using the product&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>If I brush right after coffee or food,  I will see the color of the drink or food come off my teeth into what I spit into the sink.</li>
            <li>and then you go right into Step 2 (no rinsing) which is the whitening gel.</li>
            <li>This seemed like it was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>yeah right?</li>
            <li>I could not wait to get this product for being a bzzagent, #freestuff, I started using this right</li>
            <li>right I thought two min for whiter teeth right.</li>
            <li>The flavor is just right - not too minty and not to mild.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>That just doesn&#x27;t feel right to me.</li>
            <li>have really enjoyed the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System and am loving my new whiter, brighter smile!!</li>
            <li>I liked this better than the Crest Pro-Health stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Step 1, the minty cleaning toothpaste really leaves your mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I had no adverse reactions, and my mouth felt clean after using this 2 step product, but I was really hoping for noticeably whiter brighter</li>
            <li>So have to confess, after the initial week, I tried using my own toothpaste first</li>
            <li>It did clean my teeth really well, but I was hoping to notice a difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even after eating my mouth still feels clean thanks to this system.</li>
            <li>Aside from those benefits though, it didn&#x27;t really leave my mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li>flavor of the blue toothpaste I used when I was a kid, and the gel has more of a cool mint flavor.</li>
            <li>I liked after spitting out the first paste how you can see what it is actually taking off your teeth.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference and it leaves your mouth feeling so clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very refreshed and clean after every use.</li>
            <li>I really felt the difference in the two products and felt like my teeth were so clean when I was done using it.</li>
            <li>My first impression of the product was that I really liked the packaging (packaging is a big factor in my purchase).</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and instant results.  </li>
            <li>Very easy and did not add any extra time to my routine.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use; and did make a big difference in brightening my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>Instructions are very clear and easy.</li>
            <li>receiving the box i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to open and excited  that the bottom portion of the box was recyclable  :)</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this new two step system.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White is hands down the best you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>As a Crest fan, I have used Crest’s other 2-step whitening system before (Crest ProHealth HD), and I liked the results as well as the squeaky clean feeling it gave my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest, and I could tell a difference after the first week, it wasn&#x27;t super noticeable but to me it was a big improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks now and am happy to say I&#x27;ve actually been able to notice a brighter whiter smile.</li>
            <li>/polish your teeth for a professional clean feeling!</li>
            <li>As a strips user before, I love that being able to brush on the polish really allows you to get into the cracks between teeth as well as the far back teeth so that the whiter smile looks more natural and consistent throughout!</li>
            <li>but hey you have to work hard to look beautiful</li>
            <li>I was lucky and got to tryCrest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System free from bzzagent!  </li>
            <li>I was so lucky to of received this product for free from BzzAgent and was really excited to try it since I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker.  </li>
            <li>I have been extremely impressed with Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System thus far.</li>
            <li>I received the kit complimentary from BzzAgent and Crest and have been singing its praises since the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li>I received this full size product to try thanks to Creat and Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>Worth using because it does really work!</li>
            <li>In addition the taste and smell was not the best, it kind left you with a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the toothpastes I’ve used have not made much difference in the shade of my teeth, and the whitestrips, while effective, hurt my sensitive gums and the process was very time consuming.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get a full star rating because I really felt the tubes were a downside.</li>
            <li>I was able to use 3D white pain free and it really whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My smile was whiter and brighter after the first use.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity of testing a full size sample of this product thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>As did not have any problems with my teeth becoming sensitive after using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to the strips as I don&#x27;t usually have time to do those during the day, and since I&#x27;m already there brushing,</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve used Crest 3D Whitestrips and those worked great, but they were so unnatural for me.</li>
            <li>I use a pretty powerful electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt; Pleasant Experience but no Significant Whitening</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as effective as white strips, but good for slight improvement and maintaining your pearly whites!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to continue using this and find out if this is my new HG product for my teeth!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to join this campaign to test out this new whitening system!</li>
            <li>It also made my mouth feel fresh and clean longer normal.</li>
            <li>As a mom, it can be hard to even find time to do the most basic necessities of cleanliness, so I am happy to have this product so that I don&#x27;t need to add anything more to my already busy day!</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t feel like it makes my mouth feel as minty fresh as normal toothpaste, but I do like how completely clean my teeth feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend checking this system out especially if you want a super clean feeling and better looking mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a coffee loving, red wine drinking, smoker I&#x27;ll take any whitening I can get, and I certainly get it with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This power couple totally works and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>The of taste of the toothpaste (step 1) is very mild and actually enjoyed it compare to other toothpaste</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the step one toothpaste had a pretty good flavor, unlike the other system I had tried.</li>
            <li>and I rinse my mouth out right after the first step.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly encouraged me to brush longer!</li>
            <li>Step 2 tastes a little more like normal toothpaste, and both together leave your mouth feeling super super clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>The amazing part is that they last like that the whole day, no lie.</li>
            <li>The two step paste system was easy to use, and clearly explained on the package.</li>
            <li>Before getting this product I would have liked to know about the dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I received the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from BzzAgent (free from Crest) to try out for free and review.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s worth getting for simple ease of use and time efficiency.</li>
            <li>Before I started using this I was using a baking soda based toothpaste for the last 5+ years, which has helped me maintain my smile without using teeth whitening strips more than once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 Step System for free from BzzAgent to test out.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh feeling my mouth was left with!</li>
            <li>Fresh breath and white teeth for an affordable price, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Crest&#x27;s 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System works great.</li>
            <li>I got a few comments about my smile being bright</li>
            <li>I got it for free in a trial thanks to Crest and am already buying my second round because it really works that great!</li>
            <li>and I overall was happy with results, which in my mind is ultimately what matters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though a bit more work using the 2-step system, I think the end result is worth the extra bit of effort.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>After brushing with this system my teeth definitely felt smooth and free of plaque, which lasted throughout the day even after eating.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I didn&#x27;t get movie star white teeth, but I did improve my smile.</li>
            <li>Ease of use is paramount, this product surprised me because it did work, and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Loved this product; simple and efficient way to get my teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li>I really liked the clean, polished feeling this left me with; like coming home from a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>This product is super affordable and I got fast results.</li>
            <li>but I just wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work well enough to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest® and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember I have noticed that people seem to have a fixation with the appearance of their teeth.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first abut the 2 step process with this system, however, I think it is well worth the extra step.  </li>
            <li>I have not been the most consistent with using them day and night, but in just a week I&#x27;m already starting to notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>the first is a deep cleansing regular toothpaste that tastes great</li>
            <li>The first tube you use has a gritty feel to it and does a great job at cleaning your teeth, the second tube is like a silky gel that glides over your teeth.  </li>
            <li>two weeks later after consistently using the product I photographed my smile in my bathroom and found that my teeth looked more stained</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean all day long and the whitener has turned my pretty smile into a fabulous smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results I am seeing by using at night with my normal Crest toothpaste in the mornings, and I like that this is easier and less time consuming than the whitening strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- but my teeth did not whiten very much.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, with that being said, I have really enjoyed using the product so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be able to test out the Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean and fresh as well because it is an actual toothpaste and not just a whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>Brushing with the deep cleansing paste leaves my teeth very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive the crest 3d white free through buzz agent.</li>
            <li>It tastes fine to me, with no harsh chemical taste.</li>
            <li>The whitening part was fine, I had no trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to try this whitening product thanks to crest.  </li>
            <li>After following this easy 2 step and wow, I love the results routine for two weeks I find I am flashing the pearly whites with confidence.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall if you are a busy person who wants to have a whiter smile, this is an easy and pretty affective</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new tooth whitening paste.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited as I have wanted to try a new whitening product.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new teeth whitening product and was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Running my tongue over my teeth, they feel so smooth and clean and looking in the mirror - SO WHITE!</li>
            <li>but my teeth definitely feel consistently clean and smooth without plaque.</li>
            <li>I really feel this toothpaste gives my teeth that straight from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Step 1 really left my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>This combination (easy and quick) is key for me.</li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s 2 steps total) and is really quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Packaging was super easy to open and didn&#x27;t give me a workout.</li>
            <li>I am loving the clean, fresh feeling of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re really looking for a good clean, some pearly whites, and don&#x27;t mind paying extra for that, the product definitely does work.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it to find it refreshingly minty fresh tasting and leaving my teeth exceptionally clean feeling after only one use of step 1 of the two step system.</li>
            <li>Several shades whiter on my teeth makes me very ready for attending my best friend&#x27;s wedding in a few weeks!</li>
            <li>Step one - the daily cleanser has a lovely sparkly pearl white color and the flavor is appealing.</li>
            <li>My smile thanks you as well.</li>
            <li>Other than that I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I think with continued use this product would have a lot of benefits, much more than a traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had a better taste.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s just two minutes total</li>
            <li>I would say over all I like Crest 3D I will for sure be buying it as an alternate system to whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee and tea drinker</li>
            <li>I think this product would definitely help most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This product is one of the first</li>
            <li>This product is a lot better that Crest White Strips.</li>

            <li>I have always used Crest whitening products since the first whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I did notice whiter teeth after the first week of use</li>
            <li>I found that using the 2-step process sometimes was more work than I wanted to put in, especially in the morning rush.</li>
            <li>Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>I think this actually worked better than the dentist polishing I go through twice a year.</li>
            <li>I did not mind the two step process at first.</li>
            <li>I think that my dentist needs to be consulted before I decide to use a hydrogen peroxide treatment daily as I don’t know what that chemical does to healthy bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for allowing me to try this product!  </li>
            <li>first step in the two part system, the toothpaste comes with a warning that the fluoride may cause staining.  </li>
            <li>I personally love crest toothpaste, but normally only gel.</li>
            <li>I used this item twice a day for as long as I could, but starting day 2 I experienced discomfort while using this product.</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee drinker</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it enough to even see if it would whiten my teeth at all.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a whitening product as I have always been concerned about damage to my teeth, caused by the whitening ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I first received the product I read the instructions and the warning printed on the package to watch out for irritation and discomfort from using the product.</li>
            <li>I have only one thing to say and that is you will love it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for inexpensive ways to whiten my teeth, but there is so much out there!  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product before it came out and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li>As an avid coffee and tea drinker</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% confident I&#x27;ll actually pay for another set when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>After just the first brushing, my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li>The whitening paste has a bit of a funny, chemical taste to it</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the Crest 3D White system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a very different experience using two products as most of us are used to one toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Way better than white stripes!</li>
            <li>Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>My husband and I had many stains and after only a week we could see quite a difference in our smiles</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for letting me be your guinea pig!</li>
            <li>This is the first toothpaste I have found that makes me say that.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase this again when I run out!</li>
            <li>my reasons for most likely not purchasing this product in the future:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>me, the cost of the system prohibitive - around $25 for toothpaste that frankly won&#x27;t last more than a month is a lot to spend on toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say it was worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The first step (tube 1) is cleansing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the minty fresh flavor of the toothpaste which lasts long after brushing.</li>
            <li>After the first week my spouse started to notice it</li>
            <li>As a coffee and red wine lover, I have tried many teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li>not 100% sure if I am supposed to finish the entire contents before ending treatment?  </li>
            <li>I would definitely use this again, not as my standard toothpaste, but every so month for maintenance to keep my smile looking bright and sparkly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would actually see a difference in my teeth</li>
            <li>You definitely cannot skip step 2, skipping step 2 mades my teeth feel porous and possibly more prone to stains.</li>
            <li>(as at this point, if you&#x27;re competent enough to whiten your teeth, I doubt it&#x27;s necessary to explain how to brush them), but in this case, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a tad bit more detail as to prevent excess or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>our first teeth come in</li>
            <li>I used my first whitening strips when i was in the fifth grade and have found whitening pens in my stocking on Christmas morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the first step as I would any toothpaste, and that it what it feels like.</li>
            <li>It goes on similar to the toothpaste but seems somehow more liquidy.</li>
            <li>Like most toothpastes I believe that crest was likely going for a mint flavor, and because I do not like he taste of mint, this could be the reason the taste bothered me.</li>
            <li>Most mint lovers would probably not have a problem with the taste, but that is my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed results within a week of consistent brushing.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days after I tried the product, my gums seemed to be sore and almost felt like they were cut or burnt.</li>

            <li>Being able to particularly address these areas (previously damaged by antibiotic treatment) did produce some results that even the dentist had not been able to achieve.</li>
            <li>The first paste feels like it dries my mouth out when using it</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I do run out.</li>
            <li>I think this product would work great for people who are regular coffee or tea drinkers or who have minor surface discoloration, but I guess I don&#x27;t have surface stains.  </li>
            <li>This 2 step system at first seemed like a bother to me</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use for a few days, my teeth aren&#x27;t as bright.</li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This time I tried it for 2 weeks, for the first week I used it twice a day as directed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the invite buzz agent!</li>
            <li>but my teeth feel better with this system than with just a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>first I had to get used to the two steps but after using it for a couple of days</li>
            <li>Like after going to the dentist when you have your teeth cleaned, stains and discolorations on my teeth are fading and they look a lot more white.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>The whitening step two has a different taste but not terrible.  </li>

            <li>Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>Overall we are completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I found that it really helped me remove coffee stains from my teeth and brightened my smile</li>
            <li>I found these products to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Plus, since you&#x27;re brushing and I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re doing that twice a day, you&#x27;re being consistent with your whitening routine.</li>
            <li>For me, the hardest part about using products like whitening strips is to keep consistently using the product to obtain results.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could not believe the stains it removed.</li>
            <li>The first tube (cleansing toothpaste) is purple and the directions say to brush with this paste for one minute, spit, but DO NOT rinse.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for it because it is written on the packaging as something to be aware of</li>
            <li>Now the real question!  </li>
            <li>I really like this!  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is this system takes 2 minutes</li>
            <li>First you brush with the included tooth paste for one minute.</li>
            <li>My first day of use, Step 1 felt like I was brushing my teeth with sand paper,  my gums started to bleed after Step 2.</li>
            <li>So if you are committed to using this product it really works!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>But it makes me teeth feel exactly like they do after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I am now a true believer and will definitely keep buying this product once my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I only use it at night when I have more time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a product that works!</li>
            <li>It really did whiten!  </li>

            <li>I really enjoyed using Crest 3-D White toothpaste and whitener.</li>
            <li>They felt exactly like they do after a dental cleaning</li>
            <li>I felt like after 3 weeks my teeth actually looked better than after the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I think this worked better than crest white strips.</li>
            <li>You brush your teeth with the first part, which is the cleansing part, and then spit it out.</li>
            <li>Even if the texture wasn&#x27;t awfully gritty, I don&#x27;t think I would be able to accept the taste of this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they really were lighter!</li>
            <li>I wanted to give myself consistent time with this product before reviewing it.</li>
            <li>well I brush with the first paste (paste number1)</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I could rinse after Step 1!</li>
            <li>but I can only say that it was OK.  </li>
            <li>I recommend that you try this product because it won&#x27;t make your teeth any more yellow that they are!</li>
            <li>He is an occasional smoker so his teeth are more dis colored than mine.</li>
            <li>While I may not be able to definitively say my teeth look whiter, I can say they definitely feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I like this tooth paste but at the same time, the two step part isn&#x27;t the most convenient.</li>

            <li>I was unsure about this product when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the brush time or the taste after the first use.</li>
            <li>the two part process is more than I would incorporate daily; I didn&#x27;t like the taste of either</li>
            <li>I love this kit, and definitely will be purchasing when this one is done, I really do think it works well at whitening, and brightening my smile.</li>
            <li>I panicked and thought I&#x27;d discontinue use for sure, but then later when I was driving to work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to my teeth &amp; which products I use on them</li>
            <li>I would probably not use this product on a regular basis because of the sensitivity issues, but it might be okay for use along with a sensitivity toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed the refreshing feeling in my mouth following the daily cleansing system.</li>

            <li>On the first day of use I could tell that my teeth felt ultra-smooth and polished.</li>
            <li>My hygienist&#x27;s first comment was &amp;#34;Wow</li>
            <li>While the HD system is similar, I received amazingly better results with the 3D Brilliance System.</li>
            <li>I found the first step to be tolerable.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I believe the 3D Brilliance kit is an excellent kit and has the same if not better results than whitening strips or an office whitening system.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a two step process, first you brush with a paste followed by a whitening gel.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any more whitening effect than when I was using the regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My canines are a bit more yellow than the rest of my teeth</li>
            <li>First, you brush with step 1.  </li>
            <li>Step one - the daily cleanser has a lovely sparkly pearl white color and the flavor is appealing.</li>

            <li>I was able to try this Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>However I follow the directions exactly, step 1 brush for 1 minute spit but don&#x27;t rinse then do step 2, and my teeth are not any whiter.</li>
            <li>I have always preferred Colgate toothpaste over Crest because I feel that overall Colgate has a more minty flavor which I like.  </li>

            <li>I won&#x27;t say my teeth are blindingly white now, but they do look better.</li>
            <li>I also feel like the product helped prevent more stains from my constant coffee drinking.</li>
            <li>This is an old-school method of whitening because it essentially buffs away the stains...taking precious enamel with it.</li>
            <li>whitening gel in step two is nothing more than a peroxide-based gel on steroids; you should probably not actually brush with this.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have uber sensitive teeth, but want a nice white smile like everyone else....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold;).</li>
            <li>I love Crest 3D White Brilliance!  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many people already and definitely think you should give it a try!</li>
            <li>I like this much better than the white strips.  </li>

            <li>I really enjoyed trying Crest 3D white.</li>
            <li>However, I can confidently say that I have definitely seen whiter teeth after using this for a month.</li>

            <li>I noticed a difference within the first five days.</li>
            <li>Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>Too much on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>I love how white you can automatically see my teeth are after the usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>After the first use, began to see an improvement.</li>
            <li>AFTER JUST A FEW USES, I COULD SEE A GOOD IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li>might as well make it just a few seconds longer for the good outcome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge deal but perhaps both products can be combined and still get good</li>
            <li>I found that my teeth felt extremely clean, more so than any other toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love my daily coffee and noticed this cleansing kit working right away thanks to the dual step system.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Crest and BzzAgent, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Go for it, its definitely worth the time, money and your new smile.</li>
            <li>As you are only brushing with this new system, I did not think it could possibly be as effective as WhiteStrips, but I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from Crest.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Crest and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>The two step process was easy to complete each day and it really freshens up your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While my teeth felt clean, I don&#x27;t feel like my entire mouth/breath was clean after using.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product for free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product for free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent, and have been using it for about a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the white strips and other brands by far Crest 3D is the best!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out how well this system works and that it was safe for my very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you right now - it is very wierd when you use the whitening part by itself</li>
            <li>- it has a bit of texture to scrub the teeth nice and clean without being overly coarse or gritty.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased by the long lasting clean feel as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System does effectively keep my teeth clean throughout the day -</li>
            <li>This is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried that says visibly whitens and ACTUALLY shows a significant difference!</li>
            <li>My teeth felt &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and much whiter than normal</li>
            <li>My only complain is that the toothpaste is incredibly minty, like so minty it burns a little bit.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because there aren&#x27;t many whitening toothpastes that taste good.</li>
            <li>I cannot use it every day because I have sensitive teeth, but when I wanted to whiten up my smile, I used it!</li>
            <li>I have had many great experiences with the Crest brand in the past, and this new product is no different!</li>
            <li>I most definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth any more money than any other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product I was using two different kinds of toothpaste applied to my toothbrush at the same time and the results are very good (much better than the Crest 3D White.)</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, The smell was pleasant, unlike other competitors.</li>
            <li>of my favorite parts was the foaming action because that gets deep down into the crevices that whitening strips could never reach and the micro cleansers polish away stains and leave my mouth feeling very fresh and clean, with clean fresh breath.</li>
            <li>When I think &amp;#34;3D White&amp;#34; I think of something that will be very obvious, a bright white.</li>
            <li>It may not be as quick or quite as perfectly white as a professional job, but it&#x27;s HUGE and still working!</li>
            <li>What I found to be really great about this particular whitener, is that it doesn&#x27;t stray me from my daily routine or add any extra time to getting ready.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product was simple and easy to use and didn&#x27;t take any more time</li>
            <li>This system is as easy as brushing your teeth, and provides even better results than more tedious options.</li>
            <li>My teeth are relatively white with few stains anyway, so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change with this product, but they did appear shiny and felt nice and clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that you can get your teeth clean and whiten them at the same time in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I did start using it a few weeks after I finished my box of 3D Crest Professional Effects strips (best ever), but I could tell that it kept stains at bay and made sure my teeth were extra white.</li>
            <li>I have tried and used whitening systems in the past that have been pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not the same fast results as with the strips</li>
            <li>I have had my fair share of whitening products (especially after having braces back in the day).</li>
            <li>but I felt like my teeth were more sensitive to eating when not using this toothpaste instead of a sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was only using the system once a day since it seemed to irritate my gums, but since I&#x27;ve started brushing more gently</li>
            <li>Getting used to a 2 step process takes some time, but the system doesn’t really take up much more time than a traditional 2 minute brush.  </li>
            <li>Crest 3D White is overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a good difference when I switched to using this over Crest&#x27;s regular extra whitening paste, and think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while.</li>
            <li>now I have really grown to like it and love the lasting effects it has made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the deep cleaning really works and I love that.</li>
            <li>It not only tastes good, but it actually whitens!</li>
            <li>The paste has a tiny amount of grit in it to make your teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>Once I tried it, I realized that it didn&#x27;t really change my routine at all, which made me much more open to using it.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, my teeth are noticeably whiter (maybe a few shades?).</li>
            <li>After the very first trial ( both steps), my mouth felt really clean, cleaner than it had since my last dentist visit and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Less is more!</li>
            <li>It left your teeth feeling almost dental visit clean!</li>
            <li>Definitely ended up with a clean pearly whites!</li>
            <li>Not only that but the paste left my mouth feeling minty fresh, crisp and very clean!</li>
            <li>Mouth felt like a &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27;s office&#x27; clean feeling after each use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and use a special toothpaste for that purpose, so I probably will not purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Imagine my delight when the Crest 3D White system gave me whiter teeth after the first usage and it was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had a positive experience using this product.</li>
            <li>If you use it as directed I am positive that you will also see results.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, an awesome site that allows consumers to try and review products so that you don&#x27;t have to waste money on the &amp;#34;highly marketed-brain-washed-advertising-to-buy-it&amp;#34; items; I can share with you the truth of the new 3D white Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li>I LOVE a white smile and have been a loyal customer to the Crest 3D White brand.</li>
            <li>I have had excellent results so far and have only been using the product for few weeks.</li>
            <li>First of all, I really like the two step process...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say that consistent use of the product has made my teeth any whiter</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re becoming white again.</li>
            <li>Its much more convenient than using whitestrips or gels to whiten your teeth, and it takes just as long as it takes you to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was excited about the concept of being able to just brush my teeth to whiten them without using any messy trays, etc.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I did feel a bit of tooth/gum sensitivity, which made me think that the whitening product might really be working.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t say on the package exactly how much of each tube to use on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>One of my recent products I was able to review is the crest 3d brilliance daily cleaning for free.</li>
            <li>At first, when I started using this 2 step system I didn&#x27;t really think I would like it.</li>
            <li>So I was able to try crest 3D white brilliance daily cleansing and whiting system for free.</li>
            <li>My first impression of the toothpaste was that I tasted a hint of baking soda and the polish was very tingly in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about the product at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would cause too much extra work in my normal routine.</li>
            <li>I the past I have tried whitening mouth washes, which weren&#x27;t too helpful and didn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li>The product tastes good and is not harsh like other whitening strips I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is especially true for someone who is lazy in their routine or rushed.</li>
            <li>This is true, you will notice that if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Overall an incredibly simple and effective way to whiten and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li>After you rinse and see the kind of sparkling teeth shining back at you, a big smile is all you can do.</li>
            <li>the illuminating complex makes them very bright and lustrous like no other toothpaste or whitening system has done for me before.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt clean and fresh every time I brushed.</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D White product made my teeth feel really clean, shiny, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for ways to keep my smile clean and white.</li>
            <li>It left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>The only downfall you still need to used toothpaste for a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of the product - it felt sort of &#x27;chalky&#x27; and I prefer a more traditional minty toothpaste flavor -</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty sensitive, so I am always hesitant to try new whitening products, but I got to try this for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>This caused sensitivity more on my gums than the teeth directly though, which was really only noticeable when rinsing right after brushing.</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling a little grimy after so I ended up brushing with my own toothpaste first (adding an additional step).</li>
            <li>You can really feel it polishing and brightening your smile , I definitely recommend it for any one looking for a brighter, whiter smiler, even those with more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first Deep Cleansing toothpaste was a nice refreshing mint and seemed like the Crest toothpaste I usually use.</li>
            <li>My teeth FEEL clean when finished and are much whiter than with my previous routine, and that&#x27;s a good enough answer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for someone that wants a whiter brighter and even cleaner smile without having to spend a ton of money on products or at the dentist.</li>
            <li>But I guess a little change is better than nothing!</li>
            <li>So I think it might be better with a programmable or normal toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not THAT hard to turn it off and on, and it&#x27;s worth it for clean, white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Crest, for giving me a free sample!</li>
            <li>: The process was easy and relatively convenient.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how mild the toothpaste was</li>
            <li>Not only does it really whiten your teeth, but it also leaves your mouth feeling extremely fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Bzzagent sent me a free sample of Crest 3D White to test out - and from the first try I have been hooked.</li>
            <li>whitening gel is really easy to follow and make a daily habit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple with easy to understand directions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>It is easier in this regard, but the second step feels easy to skip or forget altogether.</li>
            <li>The fact that the polish does not open easily (one-handed), adds to the issue.</li>
            <li>It is such an easy system.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just easy to do while you are brushing you are cleaning your teeth and whiten them at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee, tea, and wine regularly, and using normal toothpastes with whitening agents in them seems to do ok for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; of the whiteness of my teeth, but gradually by my 6 month cleaning there are some stains that need attention.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth and find whitening strips to bother me</li>
            <li>With Crest 3D White it was as easy as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time more than your normal twice a day, two minute brushing.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy, especially once you get used to the routine.</li>
            <li>The first step paste made my teeth and mouth feel squeaky clean (though it did take my gums a couple of days to get used to the formula-I normally use toothpastes for sensitive teeth).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of whitening products, but they all make my front teeth super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This product is simple and easy, it&#x27;s just brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>My gums and teeth became super sensitive while using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So simple, easy to use, and time</li>
            <li>This is such an easy process....</li>
            <li>but I actually prefer the Diamond strong whitening paste &amp; mouthwash</li>
            <li>Also, did not like the after taste, had to rinse several times to get rid of the strong taste.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you give Crest 3D white a try.</li>
            <li>were becoming a little more sensitive</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was super excited because I had been looking for something that would actually work on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Pro: It may get me to brush for longer (certainly closer to the 2 minutes you are supposed to)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m certain that Step 1 changes the pH balance in the mouth.</li>
            <li>This is one time that I cannot wait to go to the dentist and show off my new pearly whites!!  </li>
            <li>What I liked most was that all my teeth and to the gum-line was whitened, whereas with the trays I was usually using, I was only whitening the bottom parts of my front teeth.</li>
            <li>There have been several whitening products I have used in the past, but this was the best tasting by far.  </li>
            <li>The first step tastes ok, the 2nd step dries my mouth and makes my skin &amp; gums sensitive to temperatures.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I gave this product a chance after day 1 and am looking forward to seeing my new whiter teeth in the future!</li>
            <li>So this..this was a home-run and definitely part of our new routine :)</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;The Crest 3D white system is easy to incorporate into your morning routine without adding much time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast acting product.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about the new Crest 3D White toothpaste set!</li>
            <li>but I was relieved and excited to find out that you do the first step for one minute and then spit and add the second for another minute.</li>
            <li>My mouth actually feels healthier rather than more sensitive!  </li>
            <li>was excited to see if the Crest product worked differently and much to my surprise, it did!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a decent product that does give results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>So when I was offered the opportunity to try the new Crest 3D white toothpaste I was very excited.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the new crest 3d white brilliance daily cleansing toothpaste via BZZ agent and Crest for free.</li>
            <li>Now, the whitening product: Easy to apply without an extensive waiting time for the finish + no icky taste that makes one want to spit it all out and quit!</li>
            <li>There are no beads in it to get stuck under the gums; the smell is amazing and little burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Following the instructions, brushing with the purifying cleanser first - the taste is good, very similar to other Crest Pro Health® toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The second step paste tasted different than most toothpastes taste but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommended this whitening system to anyone who wants quick results!</li>
            <li>This is the first time my teeth have that I just left the dentist clean feeling</li>
            <li>The concept is you first brush your teeth with a deep cleansing toothpaste to clean your teeth and then brush with whitening finisher to polish and whiten.  </li>
            <li>Once I applied too much product and hurt my gums but that was fully my fault and was fine to continue two days later.</li>
            <li>Still need to wait long enough to see a result, but my teeth feel super clean and fresh after brushing!</li>
            <li>I normally use an electric toothbrush, but recommend not turning it on for Step 2, as for me it spread the paste around too much, when I mainly want to whiten the teeth that show in a smile.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing this on my own free will as there was little to no results.  </li>
            <li>One reason why I think that this product does a better job at whitening is that it is being brushed on with a bristle brush instead of the little rubber brushes that come with whitening pens, and is better than the strips because its not just sitting on your teeth.</li>
            <li>This Crest 3D White gave me a noticeable difference from the very first use!</li>
            <li>This has been hard for me to whiten because the whitening solutions have always made the spots brilliant white and</li>
            <li>It has the same texture as a regular whitening toothpaste with an amazing minty taste.</li>
            <li>Did I notice a HUGE improvement after using this product, no, but I did see an overall improvement in the health of my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a month now-- for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I got the Crest 3D White free thanks to Crest for being a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>This product is great,been using it for a few weeks now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of effort which is huge for me and the results are definitely visible.  </li>
            <li>It left my teeth smooth and they felt really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention i received Crest 3D White for free Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a huge difference in whiteness per se, but I definitely think it&#x27;s noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a month now-- for free thanks to BzzAGENT.com.</li>
            <li>am only giving it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t see any HUGE improvements in the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li>and I can already tell my teeth are much whiter.</li>
            <li>Got the opportunity to try out Crest 3D White Brilliance kit via a free sample from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Paste is so much easier than strips or trays...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have much options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing it for 3 weeks and can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I have seen happen with this system.  </li>
            <li>and I was please at how gentle it was on the faux part of my tooth versus my real tooth.  </li>
            <li>and I really needed to do something about it.  </li>
            <li>Step 1 has some mint flavor,  but step 2 straight up tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li>but the results have much to be desired.</li>
            <li>The results are more gradual than the Crest Strips, but that&#x27;s to be expected from something that takes 2 minutes versus 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really like the results.</li>
            <li>tubes themselves don&#x27;t feel very sturdy,  but even with my toddler grabbing one off the counter</li>
            <li>I could see how much whiter my teeth were</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay money for this, especially since I can get tooth whitening gel at my dentist for free each time I go for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>My breath was much fresher as well.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t really notice much whitening.</li>
            <li>I really like the whitening system.</li>
            <li>It still whitened my teeth really well, even though I used it once per day.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I was brushing with the gel or if it had evaporated.</li>
            <li>It really did make my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>I have spent more time brushing my teeth using these products than I ever have.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical since my teeth weren&#x27;t really very discolored to begin with, but I thought &amp;</li>
            <li>I really like the Crest 3D kit.</li>
            <li>This product does what it says -- it really does whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I found that it really helped me to take the time to brush</li>
            <li>These products really made a difference with the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>but I never thought any of them really worked.</li>
            <li>I received 3D White kit through Crest to try for free.</li>
            <li>But there really was no aftertaste, so that was okay.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>My teeth did not get much whiter.</li>
            <li>I received my Crest 3d white brilliance through bzzagent for free.</li>
            <li>; I like it that much.</li>
            <li>Crest is much milder an experience.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know as much about mica.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really...</li>
            <li>After about 4 days of use I could really see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a paste that you could use to really prep your teeth for whitening strips</li>
            <li>(if maybe not as fast.)</li>
            <li>can bring so much of a difference.</li>
            <li>and I found that this was not a product I really cared for.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the toothpaste (Step 1),</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t wait to spit it out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this product would be of much help</li>
            <li>After about one week, I really started noticing a difference in the look and feel of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my teeth coloration.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent</li>
            <li>This product really whitens.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li>While it may seem a bit cumbersome or a pain to have two tubes of toothpaste, it is a million times easier than waiting with white strips or painting a gel on your teeth and holding a light up to them, etc.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like how much counter space two products took</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li>My teeth look whiter, and feel much cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li>While I used the product as directed and did not mind the taste, I did not notice much of the whitening effect as promised.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Thank you Shopper Army for giving me the opportunity to try a free product of Crest 3D White for review.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Overall, I did enjoy testing this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to have much whiter teeth from using it- hoped for the results you would get from using gel trays but not having to use them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really helped me keep a cleaner, fresher, feeling teeth and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
            <li>I dont have time for whitening strips,and mouthwashes, and toothpastes dont really work to really whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>it really leaves my teeth looking whiter and healthier than just using toothpaste</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste system.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Having white teeth is extremely important to me</li>
            <li>I still find this to be a much easier system to use than using strips or going to the dentist to whiten, as it can be done at home.  </li>
            <li>I received the Crest 3d white kit to test out for free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>but I had so much discomfort on my gums from this product.</li>
            <li>really had high hopes for this as it wasn&#x27;t a tray or a leave on treatment too!</li>
            <li>All in all, I deem this a sufficient product that I would absolutely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Really brightens the teeth</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement to whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>kind-of like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste.</li>
            <li>This product really did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>I was really worried before I started as I had tried a Crest Whitening toothpaste before</li>
            <li>This makes teeth whitening so much easier.</li>
            <li>really did see an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I really don&#x27;t like using fluoride-containing toothpaste, as it really can leech calcium out of bones.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel like there has been any change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>:&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the dreaded whitening strips, this product is a real pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this method of teeth whitening over the strips any day.</li>
            <li>Really whitened my teeth, use just a couple of times a week though.</li>
            <li>Did the whole process 2 day in a row</li>
            <li>Even though I do use the strips to whiten my teeth as well I much prefer this method.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s much easier than the whitening strips out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on using two products (don&#x27;t like to waste any more time :) )</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li>I got to try Crest 3D daily cleansing and whitening system for free.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are visibly whiter thanks to this system and I will continue to purchase it for myself and my husband.</li>
            <li>Thanks to crest</li>
            <li>I was invited to try Crest 3D White by receiving a free sample.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a dentist and easier/ quicker than the strips.</li>
            <li>Hi received the Crest 3D White Brilliance for free through a  champaign with BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>and it did not foam as much as I like a toothpaste to foam.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>so I did not see much results and it burned my gums on occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does make your teeth feel like you just got them polished at the dentists office.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH easier to use than ill-fitting strips.</li>
            <li>Step 2 really whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks before I really noticed a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t really appear to be getting any whiter either.</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent for the opportunity to test and review this product.</li>
            <li>I was also amazed about how fast I got results.</li>
            <li>In addition, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loveeee it.</li>
            <li>I feel like the results are very comparable.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, people started noticing how much whiter my teeth were.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I felt that there were some days that my teeth looked whiter, but at the end of two weeks, I didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks straight now</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not going to say that it really whitened them</li>
            <li>Thanks for adding this to your whitening lineup.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts about trying yet another tooth whitener, but this one has really won me over.</li>
            <li>I found that very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I got to try out Crest 3D White Brilliance for free from Crest.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was too much for my gums.</li>
            <li>VERY  </li>
            <li>REALLY  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of the Crest 3D White Brillance toothpaste system from #crest and #bzzagent.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than the trays or strips.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>(is it really a system or is it just two separate products bundled as one?)</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste in all.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very stained and porous.</li>
            <li>It really does work for whitening your teeth.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, I really cannot see any noticeable changes to the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li>But Crest makes that a much easier feat to accomplish.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste and the gel worked really well.</li>
            <li>but really it flies by</li>
            <li>I got this product free from BzzAgent and Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.</li>
            <li>My teeth do feel much cleaner and shinier after using the product.</li>
            <li>and that is when I really started noticing the difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li>This was much easier to use than whitening products in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for adding this to my whitening lineup.</li>
            <li>I have been trying the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for a couple weeks now for free, courtesy of BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li>You can see the edges of my teeth are much whiter in the bottom picture and my teeth are just whiter over all.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my teeth coloration.</li>
            <li>Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  </li>
            <li>Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in terms of teeth whiteness.</li>
            <li>but I didn’t really expect it to be</li>
            <li>These two products works really well at cleaning and whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>After a week of use my teeth looked so much whiter.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended not using it because it caused too much sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and Bzzagent</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>There was too much of a mint flavor.</li>
            <li>The Step 2 product is really gooey.</li>
            <li>When I was getting ready for work the morning</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Your mouth feels really clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me having to basically brush my teeth twice seems to take too much time.</li>
            <li>However, the toothpaste is very abrasive.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt or cause discomfort really.</li>
            <li>It really does help to whiten the teeth</li>
            <li>I think this system has really helped maintain the whiteness of my teeth that I have achieved through using whitening strips.</li>
            <li>but really it hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I received the Crest 3D Brilliance through BzzAgent and was very eager to try it.</li>
            <li>My teeth might have been one shade whiter, but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I will say that after using the toothpaste, my teeth were VERY shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I noticed after day 1 that my teeth were much shinier - like after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the flavor of step one but step 2</li>
            <li>Thanks Bzzagent for allowing me to try out this product</li>
            <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t very stained, so I had almost immediate results.</li>
            <li>I guess as much as they are going to whiten.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste really adheres to your teeth</li>
            <li>I have used the product for several weeks and enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I drink so much coffee that my teeth have been looking</li>
            <li>Tried it thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>To really tell I would suggested taking pics weekly.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Just received a Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with my white smile thanks to Crest 3d white.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase this product, unless the cost was too much for me to afford, like $25.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>but it really worked and made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>It really did whiten and remove some surface stains.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 2 step because you feel like your really cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Having white teeth is extremely important to me and after I tried the system I can tell it do it</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and brighter and the process is so much easier than using whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks, my teeth were so much whiter</li>
            <li>They really require a time commitment</li>
            <li>I said I received the Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent for review.  </li>
            <li>I was recently chosen to try this product for free through Bzz agents.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li>this product I did not experience much sensitivity and my teeth after about 17 days were about 3 shades</li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth whiting on the very 1st week.</li>
            <li>That means I review products for free and give back my opinion and review.</li>
            <li>I could not believe it that I really saw results after one use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely none, unless you count the &amp;#34;blue 1&amp;#34; coloring in the HD cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I really struggle with, though, are the two steps.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like the two steps.</li>
            <li>Since using Crest 3d white brilliance toothpaste I have gotten many complements on my pearly white smile</li>
            <li>I am not finishing the tubes since I am concerned what they are doing to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try Crest 3D White Brilliance System through BzzAgent for free.</li>
            <li>I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost all whitening toothpastes with very lackluster results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really in awe.</li>
            <li>My teeth really look</li>
            <li>It really dries out my mouth after use.</li>
            <li>I received the opportunity to try Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you really want to see results I wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit.</li>
            <li>It very evenly whites my teeth</li>
            <li>Your whole mouth will thank you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trialing this product for about two weeks now thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>but nothing so intense that I&#x27;d stop using it.</li>
            <li>Even with once a day, my teeth are very noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li>the whiting part didn&#x27;t really seem to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really like the taste of it</li>
            <li>A fantastic product that left my teeth whiter and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and intend to continue using.</li>
            <li>I did not notice much, if any, improvement in the whiteness of my teeth while using this product.</li>
            <li>You brush with step one paste for one minute, spit but do not rinse and then brush with step two paste for one minute then spit, rinse and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>I did not see much of any difference in the whiteness of my teeth using this product.</li>
            <li>My teeth were very yellowed before I used the product.</li>
            <li>I have been a user of Crest WhiteStrips from the very beginning.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>I have noticed a bit of whitening,not as much as I would like,but I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>But I did see a very noticeable difference in my teeth in 4weeks.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely blown away by the results.</li>
            <li>I use this product twice daily, and I am so pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>This is really nice in comparison to whitening strips which can be messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li>(so be careful NOT to apply to your gums), but I was surprised at how much I liked</li>
            <li>I find that the toothpaste leaves an overall clean feeling in my mouth, but there is a lack of minty flavor or any real flavor for that matter, which is kind of odd.</li>
            <li>Really liked the performance of Crest 3 D white ,I will very definitely continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li>really liked the idea of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System since I’m already brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I really liked the Crest 3D White toothpaste overall -</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended for those with more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I had done professional whitening and had a good experience</li>
            <li>I know they say if this happens, stop using it for a few days, but I have to wonder about the safety of the product itself when I have this kind of reaction to it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not whitening, you&#x27;re yellowing.&amp;#34; but when a product claims to be &amp;#34;99% as white as a professional polish&amp;#34; then I expect better results.</li>
            <li>I swapped out my Optic White toothpaste for this two step system and so far love the results.</li>
            <li>This was really gentle on my teeth and since I only used it at night, I was still able to use my sensitive toothpaste in the morning.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is very minty and makes my teeth feel very clean, but made my mouth very dry.</li>
            <li>When I tried the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to apply.  </li>
            <li>I actually really noticed a difference pretty quickly after using this two-step system, only after about a week!  </li>
            <li>I have finally found something that really works!!!</li>
            <li>I prefer a more minty toothpaste and this one was pretty  bland.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have super stained teeth and thought they were pretty much as white as they could get...until I started brushing with the 3D whitening toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>Upon testing I first notice the taste and texture of part 1, it was gritty and had a mild minty type taste.</li>
            <li>I drink tea and coffee on a regular basis so I was excited to get Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li>So when I received my free sample of Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System (THANK YOU, CREST and BZZAGENT!!), I had an open mind but was not expecting significant results.  </li>
            <li>I first started researching Crest’s new product</li>
            <li>I first started researching Crest’s new product</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, the system is not very expensive.</li>
            <li>This product system only takes an extra minute of your time and it is well worth it for what it can do for your smile and your pocket book compared to dentist office whitening treatments!!</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D white has my teeth clean, smooth and white!  </li>
            <li>So while I do enjoy Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for its ability to keep my teeth squeaky clean and based on this would repurchase this product, I&#x27;m still holding out hope that I will see whiter teeth with longer use of this system...</li>
            <li>With that said, I do feel Crest 3D White left my teeth feeling smooth and clean and it may have lightened the color of my teeth a bit after two weeks of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>It took an opportunity, presented to me by someone other than myself or my dentist, to really pay attention more closely to the pearly whites!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel super clean, and not much whitening effect!</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel super clean in a way you can&#x27;t get from other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I did not see significant whitening from using Step 2, though I only used it once a day and didn&#x27;t have very stained teeth to begin with.</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably brighter, shinier, and overall they feel very clean, similar to the way they feel right after a cleaning at the dentist’s office.</li>
            <li>The first time my teeth got very sensitive with use.  </li>
            <li>At first the toothpaste caused white spots on my gums (which I was warned of on the label).&lt;br /&gt;After a few days the brushing became more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I really like how clean my mouth feels after brushing and my teeth definitely do look whiter.  </li>
            <li>Another plus about this system is that my teeth feel really clean...almost as clean as they are after I have just left the dentist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two step process was a little more work, but since I&#x27;m using an electric toothbrush with 30 sec interval warnings, the timing portion was relatively easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>My teeth felt very clean, with no residue or pastey or bitter aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is not very minty it does leave my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I admit I do not use this product like it was directed (at least twice a day) because I am pregnant and have a strong gag reflex right now.  </li>
            <li>The Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is a two step process but is very easy to use -- you brush your teeth with the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste for one minute and then brush on the Whitening Finisher.</li>
            <li>2 minutes of brushing my teeth has whitened better than any other toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It takes no longer than brushing your teeth with regular toothpaste,  with the added result of a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>I will preface my review by saying that I was excited to have been selected to try the Crest 3D White program.</li>
            <li>think it would likely work better for me if I were willing to give up my morning coffee, but overall I like it as a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I will say that after two weeks of using the product daily, one I absolutely had whiter teeth, but my teeth started becoming sensitive to sweets.</li>
            <li>This is a much more convenient way to whiten that other methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I haven&#x27;t experienced the gum pain I had with whiteners in the past, but it still makes a visible difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 weeks of using Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, I noticed a significant difference in how my teeth felt and looked.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the step 1 product, my teeth feel cleaner than normal using this, but step 2 was a little too runny</li>
            <li>The first step is the toothpaste---it has a white color, mildly gritty consistency, and a refreshing mint flavor.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to see if this actually works for me.</li>
            <li>The flavor is okay, nothing offensive but the results are extremely noticeable within1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am madly in love with this toothpaste, I will never brush with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out but nervous that I would experience the same sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>It was more noticeable with my husband who has genetically slightly-yellow teeth, and after using this for a little while he&#x27;s teeth were much whiter!</li>
            <li>It is a bit more time consuming than other tooth paste</li>
            <li>I was excited to try Crest 3D White as part of my participation with BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>This system has a better flavor, and texture, than other systems I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to see the final color.</li>
            <li>It even whitened the edges on the top and bottom which my other toothpaste wasn&#x27;t working on.</li>
            <li>This tooth paste is definitely better than any other that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>She also suffered with a tinge of sensitivity, but after switching to a softer toothbrush than her regular one, said that the sensitivity has lessened significantly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t that excited to have to time my brushing, but it was manageable, especially with the hope of whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m sure this is due to my reduced usage of step</li>
            <li>The taste is so much better than other whitening products I have experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this two step system had potential and was excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The thing that annoys me about the product with the packaging you are easily able to distinguish between step 1 and step 2 easily due to the labeling and color.  </li>
            <li>I love the first one I tried, the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System, but this one falls short.</li>
            <li>I got better results than I have with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have been trying the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System for the past 2 weeks, and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the whitening power, it leaves my teeth feeling extra clean, more so than with any other toothpaste I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>Crest, you have won me over with the amazing new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!!!</li>
            <li>Right away, I really noticed how white my teeth got after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li>I am continuing to use this daily and with every brush my teeth look whiter and professionally clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth are squeaky clean after I use it &amp; they are noticeably whiter and brighter after only using it for a week or so!</li>
            <li>My teeth actually felt clean &amp; polished - with that &amp;#34;smooth as a dentist polish&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used traditional whitening strips in the past and been happy with the results</li>
            <li>and it left my teeth somewhat whiter and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The two step process really left my teeth clean</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind using 2 different steps to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The deep cleansing step one makes your teeth feel amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>It had a gritty texture to it and after a minute I started getting a squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li>1 min to deep clean &amp; 1 min to whiten...</li>
            <li>I prefer to use it once a week to keep that clean feeling going between visits to the dentist but daily use irritated my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>In fact my teeth actually stayed and felt clean ALL day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any benefits from the short time use from using this product, I used it for the full 4 week period</li>
            <li>Not only did I get the initial clean feeling, they stayed clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>While I did not experience any actual whitening of my teeth, I did like the clean look and feel, and they did seem to be brighter.</li>
            <li>I drink tea and have not been able to use whitening toothpaste in a long time because my teeth are so sensitive</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t particularly like the sucralose taste in Step 2, and it makes me very thirsty.</li>
            <li>I found that the product left my teeth feeling clean and polished</li>
            <li>Step one gives your mouth that just left the dentist clean feeling, while step two polishes</li>
            <li>This product not only works but it makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure about the taste at first, but it grew on me after a few days.</li>
            <li>It truly is a deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li>No.1 really deep cleans my teeth and freshens breath-it&#x27;s a clean and a freshness you can feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to do, and you can see results quick!</li>
            <li>When I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System free through Bzzagent, I was so excited to try a new whitening product.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations for this one either.</li>
            <li>I was able to try Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through BzzAgent where it was sent to me to try for the next couple weeks and review.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it because I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results after using whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>My standard Crest toothpaste has a whitening component, and while I’m sure it helps prevent stains, over time certain habits (I drink coffee and red wine often) lead to</li>
            <li>There is very little foaming that occurs when using it and the flavor isn&#x27;t anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>I find that if you have really sensitive teeth, this may be a bit too strong for you (similar to what the dentist uses for whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to the other pastes I have used the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning paste leaves your teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I found the step 2 finisher would almost burn a little if I got it on my gums too much, but as long as I kept it mostly on my teeth it was fine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone looking to whiten your teeth, while getting a deep clean to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Start with the cleaning product: Crisp, clean, pleasant tasting paste with no burning or unpleasant mouth feelings.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to use and was hassle free.  </li>
            <li>The first day or two, it was quite tingly and sensitive to the gum line</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a full size product from Crest for a BzzAgent campaign but will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe that it is a good maintenance product, but not necessarily a good whitening</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure there was any whitening to be honest.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>first tube, the cleansing toothpaste, is nearly intolerable to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure to be honest with you.</li>
            <li>Try Crest Whitestrips or a similar product for TRUE whitening...</li>
            <li>Especially with a cool water rinse.</li>
            <li>However, when I learned what the 2 part process actually was, I realized it’s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>But honestly the first step just ruins the entire process for me, and makes it not worth paying more for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the clean, fresh feeling left in my mouth after using the Crest 3D, but I saw only a very slight change in brightness or whiteness.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural, quick, and easy way to get whiter teeth, I would recommend Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I thought the product had a very mild mint flavor, which was great for me because mint makes me sick to my stomach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed to be a really easy 2step process; you first brush for a minute with the blue tube, spit (don&#x27;t rinse), and brush another minute with the white tube.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty simple and easy to use product which I like, but I do think if I want to get whitening done, the one step crest white strips once a week is just easier than the two step process.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy, at-home teeth whitening system that really works!</li>
            <li>I loved this toothpaste, it took a little while to actually see the benefits of the whitening</li>
            <li>Would really like to see the finisher have a little more substance and be in a flip</li>
            <li>I can live with that!).</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean when I&#x27;m finished brushing, and no weird after taste or filmy sensation is left behind. :)</li>
            <li>Then BzzAgent sent me a new and more gentle product - Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel</li>
            <li>gave me fresh clean breath and suprisingly noticed my teeth looking less dinghy</li>
            <li>There is a mild sensation of a brisk cool wind coming in my mouth during that final polishing step and during the final rinse, but I suffer no negative side effects from the whitening agent.</li>
            <li>I look at this as more of a treatment rather than typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth this morning?&amp;#34; My teeth felt so clean, and my breath was so fresh after using Crest 3D White that it felt like I had just brushed!</li>
            <li>But the more I used it the less it hurt.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this though buzzagent but have since given some out as gifts!</li>
            <li>The second step toothpaste was more of a gel and that definitely took some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen silica in tons of toothpastes, including the ones recommended by my dentist, most of which do not advertise themselves as whitening and can still have low RDA (Relative Dentin Abrasivity) values.</li>
            <li>I tend to brush my teeth for a longer period anyway with my Sonic Care toothbrush, and the 2 step process is quick and simple for me because the toothbrush makes a noise after 1 minute and then stops after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I liked that I could see a difference in whiteness after a few days of using what I didn&#x27;t like was how sensitive this made my teeth.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was it made my gums super sore.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product from BuzzAgent to give it a try and tell what I thought!</li>
            <li>A toothpaste that promises to help a host of issues most people don&#x27;t even have and then fails at safely cleaning my teeth without causing pain is not one I can recommend.</li>
            <li>This is diffrent as its a quick way to polish your teeth white!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much staining to start out with (I actually started using this product the day after my routine cleaning at the dentist), but I did notice a brighter, whiter smile after 7 days.</li>
            <li>will most likely not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li>I will say that it did make my teeth feel smooth, but I did not notice a marked whitening, so overall, I did not like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, and the stains that often form between cleanings, on my lower teeth between gums, it has steadily been removing them.</li>
            <li>I only wish I took a before photo of my teeth to show you how quickly they whitened.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for obvious results and ease of use, the crest 3d white strips are much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am lucky enough to be trying this product through Crest and Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing and Whitening System is an innovative, easy-to-use product.</li>
            <li>I think that the only downside to this toothpaste is that I didn&#x27;t really feel like my mouth was minty fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li>Even better, the steps come in the same package, so no buying multiple products!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this duo, and shocked by just how effective it is.</li>
            <li>However it did improve my teeth and will yours if you keep your expectations realistic.</li>
            <li>main drawback with this system is that I don&#x27;t always have time to use it.</li>
            <li>did not like this product, mainly for the taste/feel of it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Particularly after using it for 1 week, I compared side by side photos and my teeth looked brighter, cleaner, and felt smoother.</li>
            <li>Overall, my teeth do feel nice and clean as a result of using this system, but I think the whitening process has been a bit slow-</li>
            <li>I feel if you are really into your teeth and feel extra steps are worth the benefit, then this product for you.</li>
            <li>I have been on a constant search for a quick, inexpensive whitening system for a while now.</li>
            <li>Yes, the main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide</li>
            <li>I took my before photo the day the product arrived and my teeth looked surprisingly white in natural light.</li>
            <li>I was able to try out the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleaning % Whitening system.</li>
            <li>This system works so well because you have to brush it on with your toothbrush, so you are able to do the front and back of teeth, unlike with strips where only the surfaces with the strip will be whitened.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions properly and are really motivated to get a whiter smile - you have to commit 2 minutes to the brush.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products in the past and this is by far my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I have had a positive experience so far.</li>
            <li>The process is pretty easy - you brush with one, then the second step, but it left my gums and teeth very sensitive after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>all know how much teeth whitening costs-- professionally in the hundreds and some over the counter can be a bit pricey!</li>
            <li>My whole mouth felt super-clean and fresh and I did notice the whitening, even though I normally use a whitening toothpaste regularly.</li>
            <li>and I love how white my teeth are just because I am doing my normal daily routine with brushing.  </li>
            <li>I love that there isn&#x27;t any strips to mess with or leave on paste.</li>
            <li>thought this product was a great alternative to professional whitening systems and white strips or trays, all of which I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest 3D White Brilliance for a few weeks now and (luckily) haven&#x27;t experienced any of the staining or abrasion mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li>The taste is okay, the step one is not really strong or minty and the step 2 doesn&#x27;t really have any taste.</li>
            <li>The two-step process of the  Crest 3D Brilliance Cleansing and Whitening System turned out to be easier than I expected and was easy to work in to my normal tooth brushing routine.</li>
            <li>is so much more easy to do and to use than the whitening strips or other whitening systems because you don&#x27;t have to wait half an hour or longer to see the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I may have set my expectations too high thinking</li>
            <li>will continue to use Crest&#x27;s 3D Whitening toothpaste that I have used for years which I do highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My breathe was not only minty fresh but last, and my teeth were more radiant and white.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your home.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations - Crest products always deliver -</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li>I am not one to use Whitening products on my teeth, but was fortunate enough to receive a box of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System for free as a buzzagent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I had, and still have, high hopes for this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li>and I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I did not have high hopes for this one either.</li>
            <li>so I uphold them to a high level, and they succeeded.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>The taste is a little like the whitening strips, but still leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have been using whitening strips, toothpastes, and even light systems in the past When I received the cleansing and whitening system I was very excited to open it up and try it out.</li>
            <li>I love the new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!</li>
            <li>I have tried other whitening toothpaste but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>you have any significant staining or have not had your teeth professionally cleaned recently</li>
            <li>The upswing from this product clearly out ways the few minor flaws of this great new product</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth can be sensitive at times with certain products and this wasn&#x27;t an issue with this product.</li>
            <li>a little more sparkly after.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could be a little more minty.</li>
            <li>I hope they will &amp;#34;deyellow&amp;#34; a little bit more, though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a complete freak about keeping them as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>I like the two steps so that I can target the whitening just on the fronts and backs of my teeth, but still know I got a complete and total clean.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other products where you need to leave the whitening substance on for five minutes or longer, this is a very quick and efficient process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and don&#x27;t take mass time out of your day like other whiting systems.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a little more sensitivity in the area around my crown, but I think that is normal with any teeth-whitening product.</li>
            <li>and you can feel it not come off as easy as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use compared with other teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li>I try to stay away from whitening products because they seem to really bother my sensitive teeth, so I was very surprised that this did not!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised, really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Daily kit (free through BzzAgent thanks to Crest) for about 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>What really sold me though was when I used my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous when I began using this product that it would aggravate the sensitive spots on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any stains or weird sensations.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and have yet to feel any real sensitivity or pain from using the product.</li>
            <li>it really whiten as well as a professional polish?</li>
            <li>but I was surprised how much whiter my teeth got.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any uncomfortable sensitivity.</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free from BzzAgent, but that has absolutely no impact on my opinions.</li>
            <li>I thought that would be tedious, but it was actually great.  </li>
            <li>One minute for the cleansing toothpaste and another minute for the whitening finisher; that&#x27;s all it really takes to achieve professional looking result from this system.</li>
            <li>I got to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>It only last a few minutes, but it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give this a review of the whitening, but if your sensitive to a lot of whitening products this may not be the item to buy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li>Only 2 minutes required for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to notice an improvement within a few days.</li>
            <li>I plan to rotate this into my brushing routine a few times a year to maintain a healthy white smile.</li>
            <li>and then you brush with the step 2 tube and rinse like normal.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, I no longer notice the numbness, but I also don&#x27;t see any more whitening either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gives you a white smile in days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price it is currently being sold at.</li>
            <li>I would normally get.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a brighter smile without the added cost or time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to give it a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I am giving this product 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as fresh as I would want it too.</li>
            <li>and I actually saw a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>I am not in love with the taste and texture of the whitening gel (step 2) but it is very similar to the gel that is on whitening strips, so not unexpected.</li>
            <li>I would be likely to use this system maybe twice a year to renew my smile and re-whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>The box says this is normal and the spots went away, but it did make me wonder a bit about what caused that</li>
            <li>looking forward to continuing to use Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to see an even brighter smile.</li>
            <li>I find that my smile actually is brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mint wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and left your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The three products helped me brush longer and maintain a routine I hadn&#x27;t normally done.</li>
            <li>This makes a difference, if your gums can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;First you use Step One as you would a normal toothpaste for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works in two steps, step 1 is to brush normally, then without rinsing your mouth or toothbrush, add the step 2 gel to your brush and brush again for about 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>When brushing normally I like to brush three to four minutes</li>
            <li>All you have to do is brush with the paste and the gel for one minute each, twice a day, as you normally would.  </li>
            <li>I used the product for a week and my smile was as white as could be</li>
            <li>You whiten your teeth in the time that it normally takes to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first that maybe the toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t give me as good of a cleaning as my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Then instead of rinsing, you brush with the step 2 toothpaste which is a whitening finisher for 1 minute and then rinse as normal.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I am not a fanatic about tooth whitening</li>
            <li>I wanted to brush with my normal toothpaste after I was finished this the Crest 3D system.  </li>
            <li>Now,  I only use it on the part of my teeth that show when I smile.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big improvement in the whiteness of my smile.</li>
            <li>I think the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System is more hype than action.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that anyone that is looking for a whiter smile pick it up at a local retailer or online today!</li>
            <li>but I did like how you replace your normal teeth brushing routine with this...rather than waiting with a mouthful of whitening strips for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>then I skip this system and use my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a tea fanatic, which is no Bueno for my chompers.</li>
            <li>My teeth were slightly sensitive at first, but I began to notice a vast improvement in the first 3 days of using this product.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White helped my smile to be brighter.</li>
            <li>Been using the Crest 3D white toothpaste for the past couple of weeks and it is really good.</li>
            <li>I at first didn&#x27;t think it would do much to my teeth but after a week i definitely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>When I first received Crest 3D White, I wanted to see if it would REALLY whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>Second step surprised me with the cool minty flavor.</li>
            <li>I normally get teeth sensitivity from whitening toothpastes but ever since using this system, I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity.</li>
            <li>to use two step process that replaces your normal toothpaste</li>
            <li>that I normally didn&#x27;t finish using it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It left my teeth whiter and the taste was fresh and minty.</li>
            <li>After so many years of drinking coffee, tea and soda, I thought it would be a waste of time</li>
            <li>I normally have problems with whitening toothpaste causing my teeth to hurt</li>
            <li>The strips normally do so</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, I don&#x27;t have to do anything out of my normal bedtime schedule.</li>
            <li>have tried a lot of different products to help whiten my teeth without much success.</li>
            <li>I hated it at first, made my mouth draw up inside, felt like I ate a lemon, the second one is good and taste good too.</li>
            <li>The step 1 tastes like the stuff they use at the dentist office, which was a little odd at first, but it really does make your teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant 2 paste&#x27;s man that&#x27;s going to be a lot of work, but it&#x27;s really not anytime then normal!!!</li>
            <li>but I feel like Crest&#x27;s line of single system toothpastes clean and whiten as well</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System through Bzz Agent to try.</li>
            <li>My teeth seem whiter, and clear and am very impressed that my teeth do not feel more sensitive, or painful due to using this product.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste, although a little gritty, seems to get rid of the gunk on my teeth and makes them feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I think if I continue to use this product that I will have eventually get the super white teeth like you would expect from a professional whitening.</li>
            <li>It works great and is not overly foamy making it less messy.</li>
            <li>The steps are easy to follow, just adding one extra minute to the daily process of brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>The two part system was easy to use and took no longer than my regular daily dental routine.</li>
            <li>The second time I used the product I could feel a slight tingling but no sensitivity which was nice.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; taste left in my mouth and after using the step 2 gel my teeth feel as though they have some of that product left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too strong, left temporary white spots on my gums.</li>
            <li>, now not everyone has strong white teeth to start with, so not everyone will get movie star WHITE, I was one of those people.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent, but when I received it, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the similarities in packaging to Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health HD two-step system, which I&#x27;ve been using thanks to a previous BzzCampaign.  </li>
            <li>was that im order to do this the right way you need to add an extra step to your bruahing routine.</li>
            <li>Basically you are now brushing your teeth for 2 mins total (which helps right off the bat)</li>
            <li>A few months ago I received another product from Crest that was very similar and that I liked just a little better because it did not give my gums that tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>It claims it can keep your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish!</li>
            <li>But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that evening though half of my normal brushing time was done with the whitener, my teeth still felt very clean.</li>
            <li>While using this product my mouth did feel clean and fresh, unlike those tried in the past</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great and easy product to use if you are trying to whiten your teeth and don&#x27;t like the taste of feel of white strips, or are unable to afford professional whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of two step toothpaste systems, but this one is definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>At the same time I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth looking much whiter, so I&#x27;m not sure just how effective this system has been for me.</li>
            <li>My gums have had a little sensitivity to step two, so I make sure to steer clear of them while brushing.</li>
            <li>Cu toothpaste and whitening agents are both light in flavor in Middle earth and foam very much especially compared to a normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>After using step 2, my teeth stared to get a little sensitive which I experience with most whitening systems.</li>
            <li>Ive been using Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a few weeks now, at first I really didnt care for the taste or smell, they were a tad strong for me.</li>
            <li>I was also feeling frustration about my new tea habit and the stains it has been leaving on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth just felt new again.  </li>
            <li>#34;You look different.&amp;#34; and you haven&#x27;t bought a new shirt or done anything new with your hair</li>
            <li>I wonder if that&#x27;s a replacement for the product I tried or a totally new product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new products to whiten my teeth, and I drink a lot of tea and soda</li>
            <li>The first step is a deep cleaning whitening toothpaste and there&#x27;s a clear improvement after this step, but the real improvement comes with the finisher in step 2, which Crest calls a &amp;#34;whitening finisher.&amp;#34; I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing.</li>
            <li>The taste of the product is minty and can be gritty, but it does leave your mouth fresh and clean, not like other toothpastes I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>I mean your mouth feels like you just left the dentist type of clean!!!</li>
            <li>The first cleansing toothpaste has a great fresh taste--the second doesn&#x27;t seem to have a strong taste, but a very minor hint of the peroxide aftertaste--but not enough to be unpleasant.</li>
            <li>My teeth did feel extra smooth after using like I left a dentist chair</li>

            <li>It was not the most enjoyable experience, but I knew that it was like putting peroxide on a dirty wound.</li>

            <li>The toothpaste had a good flavor and the only slightly negative thing would be</li>
            <li>I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing.</li>
            <li>My teeth are also very sensitive</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at my reaction to the Crest Toothpaste as I often use Arm &amp; Hammer that also has peroxide and baking soda with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>but.....my teeth are now very sensitive...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>This is very much like the HD white although they added a flavoring to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>his product comes in a very professional looking package.</li>
            <li>The tube labeled #1 was very abrasive to my gums and was not a smooth clean like my normal paste.</li>
            <li>Instructions are clearly labeled, I like the fact that each bottle has a big 1 and a 2, so you get the steps right, even if you are not wearing your glasses.</li>
            <li>I did have to stop after the 1 month because I developed sensitivity in my upper right molars.  </li>
            <li>Having dealt with not so white teeth my entire life I was excited to try out a new product.</li>
            <li>The experience was pleasant because it was not bad tasting nor did it leave a bad after taste.</li>
            <li>so it was fun at first and then became a slight chore.</li>
            <li>But, I only felt that sensitivity the very first use, and even with consistent use for several weeks, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little chemically and not super pleasant.</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned the less-than-stellar taste of the &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34; (kind of tastes like fennel), but it&#x27;s not that bad and my teeth feel VERY clean after brushing with both products.</li>
            <li>This one surprised me!  </li>
            <li>The other thing I love is that all of my teeth are whitened equally.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the 3D White</li>
            <li>Not only that bit within the first two uses</li>
            <li>first, I thought it was overly-strong, as it left my lips and gums</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it once a day or every other day.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, I bet you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised too!</li>
            <li>and when I first tried It I instantly saw a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>The directions tell you to brush with the Step 1 tube first, which is the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste that prepares your teeth, then spit -don&#x27;t rinse (which I would tend to forget a time or two)-</li>
            <li>This is my first whitening product that wasn&#x27;t a regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>I have mostly always used Crest products and have used different forms of the 3D white before such as the whitening strips, mouth rinse and the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The product does actually whiten over time and I can definitely see myself buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li>You use the first one for one minute and then you use the second one for one minute as well</li>
            <li>It tastes very similar (if not identical) to Crest 3D White toothpaste (which it actually may be) and I have always found that product enjoyable and efficient.</li>
            <li>The second step, whitening finisher, really works well!</li>
            <li>The first tube is a deep cleaning toothpaste-use this for one minute.</li>
            <li>Instead, I opted to try breaking the top corner off - which resulted in a small cut to my finger.  </li>
            <li>Which is pretty simple - however -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other crest 3D white products and wasn&#x27;t  able to get these results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Process: With this product you first brush your teeth for one minute and then immediately following you brush the again with step 2 (the whitener)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive either!</li>
            <li>After brushing and rinsing I actually see the gross stuff in the sink and my smile looks so much whiter - not</li>
            <li>It is so much more convenient for me to use this over other whitening systems because I can do it at the same time I brush.  </li>
            <li>with the first deep cleaning toothpaste and 1 min.</li>
            <li>The “system” involves a 2 step process, where first you brush for one minute with a Deep Cleaning Toothpaste, followed by brushing for one minute with a Whitening Finisher gel (with no rinsing in between steps).</li>
            <li>It did leave some white spots on my gums after the first usage.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this Crest 3D White Brillance Daily Cleansing System compliments of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>First is your deep cleansing toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The first tube you use for 1 minute and the second tube you use for 1 minute as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth were already pretty white when I started using this system, but I did see them brighten up from use.</li>
            <li>You simply have to brush your teeth first with the toothpaste and then with the whitener.</li>
            <li>My teeth were pretty white to start out with</li>
            <li>My teeth are normally somewhat sensitive -</li>
            <li>but the end result is well worth the minor discomfort.</li>
            <li>White, white and white love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>When I first tried Crest 3D White</li>
            <li>but once I started I noticed a complete difference!</li>
            <li>the system is paste that you can use just like regular toothpaste; much easier than strips or trays!</li>
            <li>It works if you&#x27;re willing to do the the two step process daily.  </li>
            <li>It made my teeth considerably whiter in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>This two-step system works better than the whitening toothpastes I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>reviews mentioned gum sensitivity and their gums turning white which did happen to me the first two or three times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty simple procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>and it left my breath pretty minty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one thing I should mention: the first time I used this product, I saw a white spot on my gum on one side Immediately after using.</li>
            <li>so I brush my teeth pretty regularly</li>
            <li>However, the Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste and whitening gel combo really worked!  </li>
            <li>The kit is a two step process, the first step being a toothpaste and the second step being the whitener that you use on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think people instantly realize it&#x27;s because my teeth or whiter, but I know that has been why I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my smile lately.</li>
            <li>I was a smoker for many years and never seemed to get my teeth white with other over the counter products.</li>
            <li>I first started using the product I followed the recommendation of brushing with this twice daily.</li>
            <li>and I’m willing to try anything by Crest, my trusted toothpaste brand, for a white smile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No nasty taste you usually have with whitening products.</li>
            <li>The first tube contains a fluoride toothpaste and the second contains a whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>Evidently, it has definitely made a difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a Crest toothpaste or a teeth whitening product buyer</li>
            <li>The first step in this 2 part system is a deep cleansing toothpaste</li>
            <li>I like that this is incorporated in your normal brushing routine, no messy strips or trays.  </li>
            <li>first toothpaste is a cleanser that deep cleans, while fighting cavities.  </li>
            <li>My teeth normally respond well to whitening toothpastes and treatments, but I have never had my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>If this kid uses the original Crest 3D white as step one, followed by the whitening gel for part two, I would definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li>Per the instructions, you first brush for 1 minute with the Step 1 toothpaste (which is for deep cleaning).</li>
            <li>Pretty simple</li>
            <li>I was really surprised, but after 3 weeks they are looking even whiter!</li>
            <li>I was so surprised!</li>
            <li>Given my age times a cup of coffee a day and several glasses of tea equals to 94524257822466 cups of staining liquid that have drenched my teeth in for over five decades and Crest 3D White was able to make them a bit whiter and not so yellow.</li>
            <li>I knew that I would love it, because I have used the crest 3D products in the past, and have also used the toothpaste booster as well, so</li>
            <li>There is a 4 step process with this kit, but it’s not difficult to get in the habit of doing it daily</li>
            <li>first you brush with the deep cleansing toothpaste &amp; then you spit (but do not rinse!) and use the whitening finisher.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and would definitely purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li>mother on the other hand had pretty stellar results with the regimen.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the product might be too time consuming with multiple steps, but it ended up working out</li>
            <li>The first time I used my kit, my initial reaction was &amp;#34;this is like a car wash for my mouth!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>On the third day I knew that due to increasing sensitivity I would not be able to continue with this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, this has done a pretty job of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>First is a Deep Cleansing toothpaste that you use for one minute.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think that there would be any difference in using this product compared to regular whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li>Both step 1 and step 2 left a no-so-nice aftertaste after brushing which just made me want to switch back to my original crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but my teeth are pretty white anyways</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now really willing to shell out the $40+ to get quality results with Crest&#x27;s white strips system instead.</li>
            <li>At first I used daily and after 3 days my teeth bothered me.</li>
            <li>And, I think not only does it whiten, it cleans my teeth more thoroughly than any other toothpaste product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>After all my teeth are 65 years old!</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used the product, it burnt the gums above my two front teeth.</li>
            <li>product has 2 steps, the first is for prepping your teeth by cleaning them, like a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because I have coffee stains and other staining on my teeth.</li>
            <li>The first step (the deep cleansing toothpaste)</li>
            <li>Then I used the Crest 3D White once a day and then brushed my teeth with my original toothpaste Crest Whitening.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is so much higher than regular toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is suggested to use first step for 1 minute then 2nd step for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>First is a Deep Cleansing toothpaste that you use for one minute.</li>
            <li>My teeth are generally pretty white, but they could always be whiter, and that just didn&#x27;t happen with this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay, just for the deep cleaning aspect.</li>
            <li>The first step tastes a lot like the blue sparkle tooth paste that I used as a kid.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant because I was adding a second tube of toothpaste to my brushing routine.</li>
            <li>In between the toothpaste and whitening gel, my teeth felt pretty gritty.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised though!</li>
            <li>I first used this product last Sunday, Aug. 31, 2015.</li>
            <li>and I could feel the cleansing action in my mouth!</li>
            <li>The first step is the deep cleansing paste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, it seemed to make a whitening change to my teeth, but it&#x27;s not really for me.</li>
            <li>One of the lost teeth is an incisor, right there in the forefront of my smile, and with the dentures being porcelain, which doesn&#x27;t stain, and my real teeth staining regularly from my love of drinking tea, I have a hard time keeping my teeth white enough for my dentures to blend in.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this toothpaste I found it to be extremely strong and burned my mouth a little bit, but this went away by the third day of using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The first step DOES make my mouth a little dry, but  come step 2, it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>The taste is a little strong</li>
            <li>and I realized it might be a little too strong for that,</li>
            <li>I am a daily coffee drinker,  and the dual whitening system really helps keep staining at bay, and has erased some older staining on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the same because my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean enough like the system does for you.</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D White left me with a clean feeling mouth &amp; teeth.</li>
            <li>, my husband said my teeth look like I just left the dentist, all clean, white &amp; polished!</li>
            <li>I do realize I will never have a true white movie star smile but just less stains will be nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure getting your teeth professionally done will get your teeth stark white, but I was looking for a much more affordable option to give me teeth a little boost.</li>
            <li>have been using Crest products for a long time but Crest 3D White daily cleaning &amp; whitening system is really a new innovative way of cleaning and whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest #D White Brilliance for a few weeks (Free thanks to Crest) and I must admit I really like so far.</li>
            <li>The two-step process was easy to do, but a bit messy.</li>
            <li>I would switch up with my normal sensitive toothpaste every few uses and they were fine.</li>
            <li>The All day dry mouth just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I started to see results after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive teeth, so I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly; I have only been using it once a day</li>
            <li>I have recently visited my dentist, so I know I have a beautiful mouth, as they tell me, so this was definitely disturbing.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I brushed after my professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact that it does not use the harsh chemicals that a normal dentist would be using on your teeth if you were to go in for a whitening with them.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it two stars because people with sensitive teeth do need to be aware that this toothpaste alone will make hell in your mouth.</li>
            <li>But to put that into perspective, I have what I would describe as a sensitive tongue; I don&#x27;t like hot sauce or red wines, etc., because of the taste they leave on my tongue or in my mouth.</li>
            <li>There are two steps involved in this process but that is the beauty, you will spend more time concentrating on brushing your teeth thoroughly rather than up down, back forward, spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I brushed with the “deep cleansing toothpaste,” a gentle plaque-blaster, first.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because I do have sensitive teeth that the whitening portion of the process would make my teeth more sensitive then usual</li>
            <li>, there really wasn&#x27;t a refreshing minty feeling one usually gets from regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth usually and had no issues with this system making my teeth any more sensitive which was one of my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flavor is not as minty as other Crest products I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>and honestly it’s not as bad as some other teeth whitening products I’ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe that it may have made my teeth a slightly lighter shade of yellow and they appear to shine more</li>
            <li>and I think that the 2nd step should have been better tasting also, it was bland at best.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>super simple and only takes 2....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize something this simple could give you such quick results.</li>
            <li>By the way, even though you are brushing your teeth in two steps instead of one, it really doesn&#x27;t take more than a few extra seconds because each step takes one minute of brushing, and the general rule of thumb is to brush for two minutes anyway.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try Crest 3D White, but apprehensive as in the past whitening products didn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
            <li>I noticed a dramatic difference after two to three days and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Having recently got my adult braces off, I have been on a constant search for a quick, inexpensive whitening system.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a good taste and is no more abrasive than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So my teeth aren&#x27;t exactly pure white.</li>
            <li>While the 2 step system takes longer, I definitely notice a much cleaner feeling than the regular one tube route, so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
            <li>I mean, no new stains/discoloration appeared so that&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not fully sold on the whitening function of this product.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I got the campaign invite through BzzAgent to try Crest&#x27;s new 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System, I signed up right away.</li>
            <li>feel that this whitening toothpaste could really benefit those who have moderate to severe staining on their teeth, but I&#x27;m not sure those who don&#x27;t have significant staining will see much of a result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day due to sensitivity in the past, but so far I haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>The Step 1 toothpaste made my mouth feel very dry by the time I was ready to start Step 2 and made me really want to rinse.</li>
            <li>As for the whitening results, I have not noticed a significant difference, maybe a slight change if anything.</li>
            <li>i noticed a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but it wasn&#x27;t significant.  </li>
            <li>and I made sure to get as little as possible on my gums or anywhere else besides the teeth.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a little liquidy) put it on toothbrush, screw top back on (or have finisher drip onto vanity), then brush!</li>
            <li>I actually like that it keeps me in check with spending a decent amount of time brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li>The kit seemed far more serious than my normal tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many whitening systems and have had little to no results until now!!</li>
            <li>If you have a busy schedule and don&#x27;t think you can devote the little bit of extra time to using this system, then you might be better off using another whitening system.</li>
            <li>As being part of the dental field its hard to trust brands on their products, as far if it works, how it taste, and if it&#x27;s safe for your teeth.</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s how it is supposed to work to give you that deep down clean?!</li>
            <li>I took a before and after photo the very first time I used the 3D White Brilliance Daily cleansing system, and I immediately saw major results!</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this new product to anyone,if only for the deep clean andfresh breath</li>
            <li>After a few applications I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I am very self conscious of my yellow teeth and always try to buy products that can approve their appearance.</li>
            <li>Clearly labeled Step 1 and Step 2....</li>
            <li>It is comparable to the residue left by the whitening strips of old and it makes me feel like the product is really working.</li>
            <li>Though only using it a couple days thus far, I am hopeful that I will see some real whitening results moving forward.</li>
            <li>Since I am a regular coffee drinker I really wanted this to work, I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait for a sensitive gums version.</li>
            <li>I like that this product doesn&#x27;t really change my morning routine, and I think that I will continue to use it, but only after I get my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to feel less clean because of this.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old toothpaste again!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Crest 3D white strips and this beats them by far, and at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I have also used Crest Strips, which work really well, but those take 30 minutes and are an extra step after brushing.  </li>
            <li>second step is the whitening gel, it has no taste to it really</li>
            <li>you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it after a week because it caused my teeth to ache, I already have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>And much quicker than your white strips or trays</li>
            <li>I had to discontinue them because it was making my teeth overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White Toothpaste system really lived up to its claims.</li>
            <li>The two step process really made each brushing feel like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>As far as whitening, I see brighter teeth, shinier teeth</li>
            <li>And lastly (and this is nit-picking really)</li>
            <li>I really like Crest 3D White tooth paste.</li>
            <li>The 2nd tube has peroxide, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it did not.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White dual cleansing &amp; whitening system - works really well as a cleaner of the teeth &amp; mouth</li>
            <li>For my natural front teeth, I did notice that they were whiter.</li>
            <li>I was rooting for this product-I really was, but after faithfully brushing twice daily for 2 weeks I saw no noticeable whitening results.</li>
            <li>This was a concern for me since the carbamide peroxide in my dentist’s professional products resulted in intolerable side effects for me.</li>
            <li>The multiple product tube stand upright and don’t take up much counter space.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this whitening system to anyone who wants whoter teeth, but without the harshness of whitening strips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no harsh taste to either paste and didn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>That may just be because I have a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You brush using the purple tube (marked 1) for one minute.</li>
            <li>but once you get step 2 on and spit and rinse it all out, your teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Also I like Red Bull that doesn’t really help to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>but I justify it as the whitening power in action.</li>
            <li>I found that it really helped my teeth feel cleaner than regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li>have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I was surprised that i could see some results.</li>
            <li>convinced my husband to use the product with me because I professionally had my teeth bleached five years ago.</li>
            <li>Now I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My gum line was white and irritated the whole time I used this product</li>
            <li>My sensitive gums were not irritated by the product</li>
            <li>My gums and teeth are fairly sensitive, so it may not be an issue for others.</li>
            <li>daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 contains stannous fluoride, which can stain teeth, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble there.</li>
            <li>Although this doesn&#x27;t replace a professional whitening treatment, it&#x27;s probably the easiest thing to incorporate into your routine to get your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I just figured I was too sensitive for whitening products.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would criticize is that I wish it stated on step 2 (the whitening finisher) how much of the whitening product to put on the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>My fear was the regular teeth would look much whiter and brighter than the teeth with fillings.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised I was not one of them.</li>
            <li>For some reason, Crest uses something in their products that makes my gums and soft tissue slough off.  </li>
            <li>There are no messy trays to fill or strips to line up.</li>
            <li>Just old fashioned brushing.</li>
            <li>far, this is working well</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive mouth and the inside of my mouth wasn&#x27;t irritated at all by this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a week then took a break because my teeth were just too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My old toothpaste is going in the trash.</li>
            <li>So if you want to try a whitening product that will work and not make your teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>It seemed to take several days before the whitening even took effect, but yes, it did whiten, just not as much as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>I just really like this two step system from Crest 3D White.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Since I never used whitening treatments before, my gums may be sensitive.</li>
            <li>It did make my gums sensitive</li>
            <li>Looking at the ingredients I was worried about the hydrogen peroxide in the whitening polish as i have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>This is actually round two for me in terms of whitening toothpastes, courtesy of Bzz Agent and Crest who sent the toothpaste to me to try for free.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive teeth)</li>
            <li>have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>, therefore I thought my teeth would be sensitive to this, however, they were not.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li>far as results go, I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 weeks now</li>
            <li>The maximum results achieved really depend on how often you use the product and if you do so properly.</li>
            <li>After a week of use as suggested, my gums did indeed become sensitive.</li>
            <li>but I am still sticking with it to complete the tubes.</li>
            <li>They became sore and sensitive, and even bled from the whitening solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so far is the taste of step two.</li>
            <li>My teeth are not that sensitive but after doing this treatment for a couple weeks they started to become.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a professional whitening.  </li>
            <li>I was most concerned about the toothpaste being sensitive on my teeth, which it was not, at least so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort and the only reason I gave the product a 9 rather than a 10 is because the first two times I used the polish, I got some pretty noticeable white spots on my gums above my front teeth.</li>
            <li>Felt like I had just returned home from a professional teeth cleaning at the dental office.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>After using this product for a short time, my teeth are brighter, smoother, polished and ready for my 35th class</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>product promises that it keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish with daily use 4 weeks after a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a timer or clock near me when I brush my teeth</li>
            <li>I did not experience any tingling or sensitive teeth which is another benefit of whitening gradually.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they are pearly white, but they are much brighter than they were before using this product.</li>
            <li>There are no miracles here so far</li>
            <li>I’m a mom to young kids</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth.</li>
            <li>thats really gets your teeth clean,then you move on to step 2 without rinsing,you apply the second product to your teeth and brush.</li>
            <li>affect sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>But cannot stand how sensitive my teeth are now.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think this is just a marketing scheme to get users to use twice as much toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I used this product thrice and the second tube caused me to gag each time-cannot use it safely-I really tried...</li>
            <li>My teeth do not seem to change color with any whitening products including professional.</li>
            <li>It claims that it deep cleans, and keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive gums and teeth</li>
            <li>Each time I use the system, my teeth feel like they do after a professional cleaning at a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to try the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System compliments of Crest and BzzAgent!  </li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>As a treat to myself since I stopped smoking 4 years ago, I&#x27;ve gotten my teeth professionally whitened once a year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I have extremely sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It was completely cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>I found I concentrated on really brushing my teeth for the entire length of time.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>This product is not for anyone with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really think that my teeth are getting a lot whiter from this Crest 3D White</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>was surprised it was a 2 step process</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Within a week my mom noticed and asked if I had to teeth professionally whitened.  </li>
            <li>maybe they can make it in a sensitive version but</li>
            <li>I tell everyone I know about the products I get to test, this by far has been one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again in the future!</li>
            <li>So , with this being said, I could possibly be expecting way too much.</li>
            <li>I noticed a considerable difference after just a week.</li>
            <li>While I like the results, I am a busy mom and the two step process</li>
            <li>but after a week, I looked at the before picture of my teeth and the after using Crest 3D White for one week and really see a difference.</li>
            <li>After the 2nd step the bottom front of my tongue was really stinging.</li>
            <li>I could see the difference after one use, but I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>, it makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>I think if I did it would absolutely make a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whiten but have used the crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li>At the same time, he is very diligent with his teeth and getting dental  cleanings,</li>
            <li>It did make my gums sensitive</li>
            <li>, i can see some of the result just within these couple of weeks, i will continue using them for the whole month and come back for a follow up result.</li>
            <li>I have never had professional whitening done in the dentists office.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really surprised at how well it whitens and how soon I started getting results - after using Crest 3D Brilliance for just a couple of days</li>
            <li>Then spit don&#x27;t rinse, put step two on your tooth brush and brush for at least one more minute.</li>
            <li>I followed the usage instructions, but didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the color of my teeth after using several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Much easier to use then the white strips and easier too.</li>
            <li>I would have to say I am not a fan of how sensitive it made my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>My gums were sensitive throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really simple, works really well</li>
            <li>The one problem I do have with it is my teeth seem overly sensitive now.</li>
            <li>The product promises that it keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish with daily use 4 weeks after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>I am definitely surprised that this product has worked so well for me.</li>
            <li>have no streaks, no discoloration and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>and WOW...</li>
            <li>My teeth are not as white as I would like, but I don&#x27;t care too much about whitening strips</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two-step system is simple and very comparable to just brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>and my teeth were so sensitive it hurt to even breathe with my mouth</li>
            <li>however it made my teeth sensitive again</li>
            <li>So far none of that.</li>
            <li>Each product has left me unsatisfied-whether it was from the shade of my teeth or to how much my teeth hurt afterwards.</li>
            <li>I wish I was kidding with that, but that&#x27;s how sensitive my teeth are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a professional whitening done before, but I can almost bet by the time I&#x27;m done, it would be close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>It takes maybe 15 seconds longer than using regular toothpaste and its so much easier than the strips or gel to leave on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>it if would cause my teeth to be sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whitened</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a coffee drinker with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Of course my teeth are their whitest after brushing and not after drinking tea, but I see distinct benefits from doing a whitening regimen so regularly since I have this tea habit that is constantly staining my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes it feels like extra work to do the second step as well, but worth it if you want results.</li>
            <li>It has a gritty chemically taste but with time I did get used to it and can definitely see a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>Not through the four weeks yet so time will only tell if it actually works as promised and is worth the price (thankfully I #GotItFree).</li>
            <li>Although it takes dedication to use TWO different toothpaste products, the extra effort is worth it.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have heavily stained teeth, I do drink more than one hit of coffee daily</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White definitely whitens your smile.</li>
            <li>both felt that anyone who brushes their teeth for a minimum of 2 minutes each time they brush will likely see at least some kind of whitening regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li>In just the time it takes to brush my teeth, I&#x27;ve been not only deep cleaning my teeth, I&#x27;ve also been gradually whitening my smile.</li>
            <li>Noticed a change- not completely white but a definite brighter smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if someone in your family doesn&#x27;t have the patience for whitening strips this could be a good alternative, but for me, ill stick w whitening</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty gross, and my mouth feels a little dry after I brush with both tubes, but I think this toothpaste has more benefits to offer then drawbacks.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on how white my teeth are &amp; people think I get them professionally whitened!!!</li>
            <li>I like that the whole process takes two minutes- certainly not too much time to ask.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this whitening system, but felt that the actual results fell a little flat.</li>
            <li>Left my teeth feeling very clean, with a little tingle of freshness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attached a photo with before (left) &amp; after (right) photos to show my personal results.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to anyone looking to gradually whiten their teeth without the expense of a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>However, after using it 5 times (not even consecutively) I developed an extreme sensitivity in 2 teeth that is still present 2 week later (but it is getting better).</li>
            <li>I quickly found that the system didn&#x27;t lengthen my dental routine much longer than usual.</li>
            <li>For not having to do anything extra than just brushing for the 2 minutes you normally would anyway, I will take it!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to whiten my teeth as they are a little stained just through all the sodas, coffees and teas that I drink.</li>
            <li>Pros so far: motivates me to brush for a full 2 minutes and twice a day, not bad tasting, gentle whitening, not messy, not an extra product or time spent (just usual teeth brushing which you should be doing anyway.</li>
            <li>size of the tubes are large enough to last an individual user for about 2-3 months (twice a day use)&lt;br /&gt;-Step 1 is pretty thorough in it&#x27;s cleansing power (makes teeth literally squeaky</li>
            <li>It is an easy 2 step system that takes no longer than your usual brushing time.</li>
            <li>I use other Crest 3D White products and I was very excited to try the Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, which I received from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Going to the dentist to get the trays and making special trips when you run out of the whitening gel can be a hassle and costly especially when there are options now like this Crest 3D White Brilliance Duo which delivers similar results.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference, and that motivated me to use it twice a day, which improved my previous tooth brushing routine.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was looking for a miracle working - magic toothpaste sent down from God above and expected way too much from two tubes...</li>
            <li>But once you get the system down it goes quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not willing to give up coffee for whiter teeth, but I am always looking for a toothpaste that will brighten my smile.</li>
            <li>My teeth aren’t sparkling white, but I haven’t finished the total program yet, still have more than half a tube left, so I will update this later when I see the final results, but I just wanted to say it absolutely and quickly makes an obvious difference.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hate sucralose, have flawless, strong teeth, and only wish to lift everyday stains (like coffee), this may work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it hard in the past to find a whitening product that works and still has great</li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical about using two different products to clean my teeth, but after just the first use, I was hooked!</li>
            <li>The Credt 3D system also leaves my mouth and teeth feeling so clean and hasn&#x27;t caused any sensitivity as other whitening products have in the passed!!</li>
            <li>One other comment that I do have about this product is that it does take a little bit more time than just using a normal whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I received the brand new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for testing purposes thanks for Crest.</li>
            <li>My mouth always felt EXTREMELY clean, although a bit dry, after each brushing and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean and look whiter after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>Someone with less yellow or coffee stain could possibly have better results.</li>
            <li>I have tried the white strips before and they are super annoying, so this was a great product to try.  </li>
            <li>I have seen some people complain about sensitivity and problems using this particular system so users should be cautious, but I havee personally has no problems.</li>
            <li>Not being able to rise after brushing with the first step was really weird .</li>
            <li>The first seems like a standard Crest toothpaste and the second tube</li>
            <li>It worked especially well since I do not have &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; teeth - my lower incisors particularly overlap.</li>
            <li>which is exactly how the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System makes your teeth feel and look!!!</li>
            <li>Step 2 is a 2.3 ounce tube of &amp;#34;whitening finisher&amp;#34; that has several ingredients, but the main powerhouse is the Hydrogen Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think what it is mainly doing is zapping the bacteria in your mouth that can cause your teeth to go yellow -</li>
            <li>This is the first toothpaste-like product I&#x27;ve found that actually produces whitening results in over a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive some Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing cream to try.</li>
            <li>I regularly use a whitening toothpaste and felt like my teeth were pretty white.</li>
            <li>This product has some pretty big claims that definitely set the bar as how to how well it was supposed to perform.</li>
            <li>just starting up, I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee than usual.</li>
            <li>In addition, my normally non-sensitive teeth and gums were suddenly cut up and sensitive after using this product.  </li>
            <li>so usually when using a product like this I have to discontinue, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with Crest 3D White :)</li>
            <li>This is the first whiting product that I actually see results, but the it does turn my gums white and does hurt after brushing.</li>
            <li>I noticed a big improvement and with steady use for about three weeks now, my teeth are continuing to whiten and brighten -</li>
            <li>Not all &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; white better, but definitely a few shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White definitely held up to it&#x27;s claim; there was a noticeable difference within the first use.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the product, plus it didn&#x27;t bother my teeth like similar products have in the past.</li>
            <li>I would probably suggest you read through the ingredients and make sure that you are fine with all the active ingredients which may be a little harsh for sensitive teeth and gum.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy for me to just incorporate a little extra time for both steps.</li>
            <li>It does have a different taste compared to normal toothpaste, but I am willing to have a different taste for sparkly white teeth!</li>
            <li>After using this system for a few days I honestly have to say this is the only whitening system in which i have seen actual visual results of my teeth showing whiter in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li>Step 1 provides deep cleaning and although it tastes a little gritty, it is worth the extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li>After the first week and a half, I did notice a little tenderness in my gums above my top two front teeth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it as your main whitening product, however, as someone who has used Crest White Strips in the past, this has proved t be a fantastic way to keep up the effects of the strips.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like and initially my teeth were sensitive but after a few uses were fine.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of just two minutes to help whiten my teeth due too drinking coffee and tea daily, however Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily &amp; Cleansing Whitening System is making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got a free sample from Bzz Agent because I had given up trying them after 100 fails.</li>
            <li>Has a slight sandy texture that about really scrubs all of the gunk from your teeth, while still being gentle.</li>
            <li>It is hard to put in words just how THRILLED I am with the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in the color and could see that it was working, but my teeth got very sensitive and I ended up switching back to my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The first step left my mouth feeling dry, a bit dull, and like I really needed to brush my teeth with something that would clean them.</li>
            <li>Although this flavor was only in the first step, and the second had more of a neutral flavor, it was hard to reach for the second step and keep brushing when my tongue was screaming for some bubblegum flavored children&#x27;s mouthwash to neutralize the sting!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to that flavor as I highly dislike it, but this was very minor here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you should really brush your teeth for that long anyway.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product, either, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It was interesting to say the least, but it was a mental indicator that maybe it was working really well.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that my teeth are a bit more sensitive than before using this product.</li>
            <li>It takes the same amount of time as my normal tooth brushing process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two step process seemed like a time consuming hassle at first, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li>and my gums are going back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have tried other teeth whitening products in the past, and each had its own problems.</li>
            <li>I also am a heavy coffee drinker and that too has left a color to my teeth that I wasn&#x27;t able to get removed over the coarse of time.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is a deep cleansing toothpaste that you brush with as you normally would for 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>it does not take any extra time during my normal morning and night time brushing routine.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit worried at first because my teeth are so sensitive and other products tend to hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the system is good, but i am not sure if i would purchase it, as it is slightly expensive for less than exceptional results.</li>
            <li>I normally use Aquafresh deep cleaning toothpaste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other whitening products in the past and haven&#x27;t always liked them.</li>
            <li>It also hurt my gums the first week, so I would be careful to avoid brushing your gums as it can irritate them.</li>
            <li>The Step 2 (polish) can irritate the gums at first (I only used it every other day in the beginning until my gums were acclimated to being stimulated more than usual).  </li>
            <li>Its the same as many other similar Crest Pro-health or 3D series, it&#x27;s probably the taste of the specific ingredient</li>
            <li>It goes back to normal.</li>
            <li>People kept asking me how long it took to use, so I told them it takes less than 5 minutes, but you get very quick results.</li>
            <li>Now, the difference is not greatly dramatic, but it&#x27;s enough to make me purchase a second kit!</li>
            <li>I did notice, troublingly, that a tiny portion of my gums (the part right where my front two teeth meet) turned WHITE one day after I brushed.</li>
            <li>is a little harder to squeeze out and the  taste is not the most optimal.</li>
            <li>The whitener has a very mild taste which is hard to describe -</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, i was a little upset, because it cut my normal tooth</li>
            <li>There is not a true minty flavor that you are used to with regular toothpaste and step one is more gritty and step two is more like a thin gel.</li>
            <li>At first I was afraid that using a whitening product would make my already sensitive teeth MORE sensitive</li>
            <li>I am lucky because I have abnormally white teeth already, due to not drinking coffee, tea, wine, or smoking,</li>
            <li>I felt that the taste of the product was very tolerable, unlike other whitening toothpastes, but it did make my gums very sensitive, and I stopped using it after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Husband tried it and has noticed a new shade of white to his teeth.</li>
            <li>After using Crest&#x27;s new polish for only three weeks, my plaque and stains disappeared!</li>
            <li>Like I said that’s a big claim, and didn’t know if it would live up to that.</li>
            <li>I have a new staple in my daily routine and am beyond thrilledwith my results.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was chomping at the bit to try a new whitening product as a few months ago I had a negative experience with a professional whitening product purchased through a dentist’s office.</li>
            <li>They either only focus on whitening and your teeth don&#x27;t feel so clean or they are so harsh that they leave your teeth so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Even using just once a day, I still saw results within three days and after over month, my teeth definitely looked less yellow and more white.</li>
            <li>I really thought that it would be too much extra effort to do a second toothpaste twice a week</li>
            <li>When I saw the BzzAgent Campaign for the Crest #D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing system I was very eager because this is the product that I have been searching for.</li>
            <li>My toothbrush runs for an exact amount of time, so I have to stop it in the middle (after guessing how long it&#x27;s been) and then start it up again, whereupon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried had a very bleach-y tasting whitening gel, and it actually tasted a lot like Crest white strips.</li>
            <li>It made my teeth a shade whiter and added a slightly brighter smile.</li>
            <li>I initially thought it would be too much of a hassle to use two different tooth pastes</li>
            <li>I have had the privilege to use 3D Crest White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I drink several cups of coffee daily, so I need a realistic whitening solution that won&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really would recommend this product especially for anyone who drinks a lot of coffee, tea or red wine.</li>
            <li>have had professional whitening done by my dentist, followed up by the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; at home solutions used with my professional dentist tray to keep my teeth white as they do start to fade over time, regardless of whether you had it done at a dentist or not.</li>
            <li>Never happened again, especially when I realized that I had actually had too much of the gel on my brush that time.</li>
            <li>I started using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system and realized how much whiter my teeth could be.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the taste of the gel (2nd step).</li>
            <li>Step 1 seemed like regular toothpaste and had a similar &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; It did not seem to get very bubbly.</li>
            <li>Using this 2-step system is so much easier since all I have to do is just add a second tube to my daily brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that big of a difference is my teeth, I&#x27;d rather use crest white strips while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>I have hidden my teeth when I smile.</li>
            <li>As someone who wants to maintain a white smile, but not a huge fan of the cost of strips or professional systems, I am officially planning on using this system regularly, to maintain my pearly whites!</li>
            <li>taste is okay-its kind of plain and perhaps a little peroxide-y tasting.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled for the product at first because I have tried whitening my teeth with other products but never got much results and usually left my teeth very sensitive to cold stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with me, but I have not used it regularly because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I havent tried a product like this before because I have very sensitive and crooked teeth</li>
            <li>and I smoke, so I was very skeptical, however I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference, plus I&#x27;ve received many comments on how white my teeth look!!</li>
            <li>If possible, I would recommend using a small toothbrush to provide you with more precision (if such a thing exists).</li>
            <li>I do know that can be a major issue for some when using a whitening solution.</li>
            <li>I had negative experiences with tooth whitening products in the past and am happy to report that was not the case with Crest 3D White toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find it objectionable, neither did I have any major sensitivity.</li>
            <li>This takes about 1 minute longer than usual tooth brushing, because you are brushing with the toothpaste for 2 minutes, then the gel for about a minute, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>It is a really simple two step system: first you brush your teeth with the step 1 deep cleansing toothpaste which deep cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>I had no other problems with it after that.</li>
            <li>I do not usually use Crest Products and will not be using this one in the future either.</li>
            <li>This is the first teeth whitening product I have ever used, and I can&#x27;t compare it to any other whitening product out in the market.</li>
            <li>first few times I used it I did have some moderate whitening of my gums that really freaked me out.</li>
            <li>it is kind of hard to hold an already used toothbrush in one hand and try to get the cap off with the other.</li>
            <li>i enjoyed using the crest 3D white daily cleansing and whitening system and after a few days I actually saw a difference.</li>
            <li>Although whitening is a nice result, I found that having to brush in two steps daily was a bit tedious especially in the mornings when I was rushing to get ready for work.</li>
            <li>Other whitening products are a single step easy, simple, and done.</li>
            <li>At day ten, my gums started to get a little sensitive, so I went back to my regular toothpaste until they felt better, then returned to the Crest 3D White Brilliance Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products that are far more expensive and don&#x27;t compare to the clean, white results that this product provides.</li>
            <li>The price may seem a little hefty, but I think it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>This by far is better than any other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It did seem to whitening my teeth a little but the accompanying teeth sensitivity wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks I have seen a subtle change in my teeth color although believe with  continued use they will get more white.</li>
            <li>Though it may take a little longer than normal brushing, since you are using a two step process, I found that it really helped me to brush while watching tv....</li>
            <li>When I first received the product I was a little worried that it would make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>Typically, I use Crest 3D White Luxe (Diamond Strong) to not only keep my teeth white but to strengthen my enamel.</li>
            <li>No issues, and I generally have these with whitening products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather do minor maintenance daily than use whitening strips for 30 minutes per day.</li>
            <li>After a minute, and without rinsing, I brushed again for another minute with the “whitening finisher,” a clear gel polish.</li>
            <li>2 is a clear gel like finisher that actually makes mouth wash</li>
            <li>I have only been using it about 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>and I will purchase it in the near future when I am out of it!</li>
            <li>Then you use the white tube (marked 2) for one minute.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth as white as the whitestrips, but it doesn&#x27;t leave them as sensitive either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using GoSmile for the longest time to maintain my teeth from getting too far on the yellow side.</li>
            <li>Now if theu decide to make one for sensitive teeth I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>Impressions: I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far</li>
            <li>As far as whitening goes, the idea is that the second whitening finisher has hydrogen peroxide in it, and that&#x27;s what giving you the whitening.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would completely replace my regular toothpaste but would use this instead of whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Lately I have been trying to achieve a whiter smile and nothing I&#x27;ve tried seems to really give you any visual results</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest 3D White for about 9 days so far</li>
            <li>but I just wish they had this same product, but specifically for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity was either from cut gums or related to the professional fluoride treatment I used.</li>
            <li>Next time, I will skip whitening immediately after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised that Crest 3D White didn&#x27;t burn my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dentist prescribed trays but those left my teeth sensitive for days.</li>
            <li>So I stopped the treatment and went back to my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Just after a week it was such a noticeable difference that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all users especially those who suffer from genetic plaque build up and consumers who have naturally yellower teeth.</li>
            <li>but now they are white, and this is all thanks to Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System!</li>
            <li>The two step system only requires 2 minutes of brushing, which you should be doing already anyways, and is not messy like trays and whitening strips that take 30 minutes to work.  </li>
            <li>but I never expected it to.  </li>
            <li>far as whitening, it definitely helps.</li>
            <li>I could see a marked difference in the shade of my teeth, within several days of use.</li>
            <li>I did have a problem, though, with the second step, the gel, making my gums sensitive after repeated use.</li>
            <li>and it seems I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a regular whitening paste that works anywhere near as well as this combo.</li>
            <li>So far, I can say how simple this system is to use.</li>
            <li>I will update with a before and after picture when I&#x27;m further into the process, but so far, pending results, I would recommend this system to anyone trying to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li>When the Crest Pro Health HD system didn&#x27;t produce sparkling white results, I was really hoping that the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System would step it up.</li>
            <li>Four stars for MAINTENANCE whitening of your pearly whites... &amp;#34;Maintenance&amp;#34; being the operative word with this two step Crest 3D White Brilliance daily toothpaste and whitening gel because I have been using this product twice day day for 2 minutes EACH application and have really only noticed that it has kept my teeth as white as when I applied it for the first time almost 20 days ago.</li>
            <li>I found my teeth to be cleaner and whiter much quicker than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see such whitening results.</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White helped, but didn&#x27;t completely whiten the stains.</li>
            <li>So I support this product, but people with naturally sensitive teeth need to find a different way to whiten.</li>
            <li>Its a two step processes that you brush then do not rinse til you complete the second step.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from using this product because I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips before and they are clumsy and inconvenient to use and not all that effective.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any point in whitening teeth not visible especially since they became sensitive.</li>
            <li>Claiming to keep your teeth up to 99% as white as a professional polish/teeth whitening treatment, this product makes some tall claims.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use the Crest 3D White, my mouth feels like I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>It comes with two different toothpaste you use them in the order they are marked.</li>
            <li>As my two front teeth are veneers, I have a problem with keeping the teeth around them white enough to look normal.</li>
            <li>I recently started using Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste as my normal every day toothpaste and used it morning and night.  </li>
            <li>but I have pretty sensitive teeth and usually have to use a sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the past few weeks once a day and am loving the results.</li>
            <li>I received a box of the Credt 3D whitening system and I was already kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li>But I feel like it&#x27;s removed a thin top layer of stain.</li>
            <li>That was not the case, the taste is kind of a faint Minty, chalky taste.</li>
            <li>Even after a few uses I noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I received a box of the Credt 3D whitening system and I was already kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li>The taste was ok but not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that when I first began using Crest 3D Whitening System, my teeth did not become overly sensitive, as was my experience in the past using whitening strips.</li>
            <li>The system also brightened and whitened my smile after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>but truthfully when I&#x27;m tired and want to go to bed, I just want to brush.</li>
            <li>I did notice a little more of a &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; feeling with this paste than my previous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit of a pain using two different pastes, but I got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I followed the easy two steps to a whiter smile but man that taste was hard to get past.</li>
            <li>It states right on the label that it may leave small white spots on the gums, but that&#x27;s normal and they will go away.</li>
            <li>As soon as I can afford the new crown, I will definitely use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a while now</li>
            <li>Definitely considering this as a new part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>This new Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 tube system is simply put...AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I was provided a box of the New Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Thus I am blown away by the new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to do a professional whitening system.</li>
            <li>My gums have gotten a few white spots which disappear quickly, but no sensitivity yet.</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty sensitive and when I would use other whitening products, they would get SUPER sensitive to the point of avoiding anything cold or hot.</li>
            <li>It was odd to have to spit after using the first tube of toothpaste without rinsing.</li>
            <li>After trying this I noticed after the first couple of times that I could see a slight difference.</li>
            <li>At first the product irritated my gums in a couple of places, but with less vigorous brushing this problem went away.</li>
            <li>Crest 3d White Brilliance Daily Cleansing system DOES NOT MAKE MY TEETH SENSITIVE!</li>
            <li>I feel it worked better than other whitening products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I am a coffee drinker and my teeth are pretty yellow and stained due to this.</li>
            <li>As I said, I am an avid user of other Crest 3D white line products, so I am not for or against this company in any way.</li>
            <li>My favorite part was that this didn&#x27;t hurt my gums like other whiteners have in the past.</li>
            <li>Strips and trays that I&#x27;ve used in the past also offer quick results, but this product was easier to use AND contributed to my dental health.</li>
            <li>The product provided me with a really deep down clean feeling that lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li>The product was a little hard to get used to because it made my mouth kind of burn.</li>
            <li>The two step process is not a big difference from my regular one step brushing routine, and doesn’t really require any extra brushing time (2 mins total?</li>
            <li>The step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste like straight peroxide like other products.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste itself doesn&#x27;t really bother my teeth (other whitening toothpastes do)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing and Whitening System for the past two weeks since I received it from BzzAgent and Crest for free to try and provide feedback.</li>
            <li>So, then I skipped to every other day, and they still bothered me, but not as much.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that step two tastes a little bit too medicinal, but, overall the product still tastes better than other whitening solutions on the market.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after only a few times, but even after the first try my teeth felt cleaner!</li>
            <li>By incorporating into my daily brushing routine, I&#x27;m consistently whitening with minimal effort another big plus in my book.#GotitFree #PowerCouple</li>
            <li>set is nice because it&#x27;s completely manageable, takes hardly any extra effort, and doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth feeling raw from over-brushing.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very yellow due to being given high doses of antibiotics when I was young.</li>
            <li>So I got this for free thanks to bzzagent and crest and was skeptical.</li>
            <li>I also was expecting a more dramatic difference in my teeth,  </li>
            <li>: The toothpaste texture is very similar to all of Crest&#x27;s toothpaste and the whitener is a clear gel that reminds me of the product on the back of Crest Whitestrips, but in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s safe and not as expensive as seeing a professional.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m seeing about the same results I get from a regular whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have two boxes of different types of white strips collecting dust in my medicine cabinet because they make my teeth so sensitive they feel &amp;#34;see-through&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Prior teeth whiting treatments have led my teeth to become extra sensitive, but I have not noticed an increase in tooth sensitivity with use of this product.</li>
            <li>I still feel like my old whitening toothpaste is easier with the same results, but they are the same brand</li>
            <li>step 2, the whitener kind of left a weird taste in my mouth, but after rinsing, it went away.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s worth doing for a few weeks at a time and then going back to something else.</li>
            <li>but I have no complaints about the taste, had no burning or irritation and no dry mouth.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has the same refreshing taste as you would expect from Crest, but the step 2 polishing agent has a strange taste and left my mouth feeling a little dry.  </li>
            <li>&amp; my teeth are already 2 shades whiter and aren&#x27;t super sensitive like other professional whitening systems I&#x27;ve used in the past from the dentist with the whitening trays and gels, or with the over the counter whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Crest cleansing kits in the past and was curious how effective this one would be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the crest white strips in the past and was excited to try something that seems along the same lines, and included in my routine already, but quicker than the strips.</li>
            <li>I did get a little gum tenderness the first couple of days</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re in separate tubes and there&#x27;s not the same amount of product in each tube, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using more of one than the other.</li>
            <li>The Crest took a little getting used to because it was rather abrasive on my gums at first.</li>
            <li>No other toothpaste has ever made me feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>On the first day, I did have a little sensitivity but have not had any since then.</li>
            <li>After the first day or two, I could only see minimal results and became even more skeptical but kept up with the two step brushing process.</li>
            <li>I have a crazy coffee habit and love tea and red wine, so even though they are pretty white, they could always use some help.  </li>
            <li>Usually I give up before I really see rests because my gums become very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I either did not want to be in pictures at all or did not smile in them very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not feel that the Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system whitened my teeth &amp;#34;99% as white as a professional polish.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I had to remind myself not to rinse the first few times after completing step 1.&lt;br /&gt;--Taste</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this product i really noticed a difference!</li>
            <li>it caused or irritated a canker sore on my gum in the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>Have a whiter smile in just a few uses!</li>
            <li>At first, I found the product to be rather abrasive, leaving my gums sore, but after a few days of use, the soreness went away.</li>
            <li>and I have a soda everyday also, so my teeth where pretty stained when I started using this</li>
            <li>the first 2 days of using it that lasted just a few seconds after brushing.</li>
            <li>The first few days my gums had a stinging feeling.  </li>
            <li>it gives you a nice natural white without giving you that artificial glow.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this at first, because with lots of whitening systems, they can be harsh and abrasive to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only complaint that I have is that you need to be careful when using the whitening product,  try to avoid it touching your gums,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Colgate Total White which kept my teeth clean, but never very bright.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I have noticed much whitening over the last few weeks, but that being said, I still like this toothpaste based on the mint flavor and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some of their other whitening products in the past, such as white strips and whitening mouthwash, but was excited to try this new</li>
            <li>The only down side is it may be a little strong for some to use twice a day.</li>
            <li>My teeth seem a little whiter after 3 weeks, but they were pretty white to begin with</li>
            <li>But other than that it was a decent product.</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty bad for toothpaste, barely minty, and it has a kind of bitter taste.</li>
            <li>It does seem to make my mouth somewhat dry but other than that it was not difficult.</li>
            <li>It does seem to make my mouth somewhat dry but other than that it was not difficult.</li>
            <li>When I was selected to receive this product I was so excited because I have only used whitening strips in the past and did not like how long that lengthened my cleaning routine each day.  </li>
            <li>every one has noticed the new whiter teeth and have asked if I spent a fortune at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>As a smoker and coffee drinker (by coffee drinker, I mean I drink a gallon a day), I&#x27;m in some serious need of a good teeth whitener.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whose to blame for that, but it is a turn off right off</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White seems to be the answer, by adding a simple little step to my normal brushing routine, and with no harsh side effects.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a much cheaper alternative than professional teeth whitening which I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>I did have a slight burning sensation on my gums once or twice while using this, but not so much as to dissaude me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not super brighten fast.</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight improvement in the whitening of my teeth but really didn&#x27;t care for the taste or side effects of the gel.</li>
            <li>After the first few weeks of using this product my teeth have become several shades whiter, which was what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I did not have any sensitivity or negative side effects, just not the quick results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>And I used step 2 (the whitening paste) only on my teeth visible when I smile (those usually covered by whitening strips).</li>
            <li>:  While brushing, I notice certain spots in my mouth hurt a little.</li>
            <li>However, I still only noticed minor color change, definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to professional dental whitening services.</li>
            <li>the crest 3d white really works and is easier to use than I previously thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Its only 2 steps so its not a very long time consuming routine.</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a few weeks now and have nothing but positive things to say about it.</li>
            <li>It took a little over a week and before I noticed a difference, but even my husband remarked how much brighter my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>The flavor was a little intense for me</li>
            <li>This system is very much like the Crest HD system I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It feels a little bit gritty in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t get very foamy, but it does leave my teeth feeling</li>
            <li>At first it was a little strange to get used to a 2 part system, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li>but if they smile really wide, you can see that the teeth a little farther back are discolored?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to tell them that it was less expensive than that and painless too!</li>
            <li>My teeth and usually very sensitive to whitening products, and this two-part system hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort or pain to my teeth like other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when first trying this product as all other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes I have tried in the past were less than great.</li>

            <li> Thank you BzzAgent and Crest for the wonderful opportunity.</li>

            <li> This system works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the way this product whitens.</li>

            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I had a very pleasant experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D is Amazing!!</li>
            <li> The Step 1 was a very good cleaning toothpaste with some abrasive in it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product and a great price for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> So happy great power couple!</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this toothpaste is incredible.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash was the brillance on the bright!</li>
            <li> but I guess I draw the line at walking around with bright orange teeth!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Headline:&lt;br /&gt; LOVED IT !</li>
            <li> I really loved this product!</li>
            <li> The whitening agent in this system is peroxide, but it tastes good!</li>
            <li> This works extremely good!</li>
            <li> This instead contains stannous fluoride which, surprisingly, can cause staining - and it is even disclaimed on the packaging!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this couldn&#x27;t be any easier!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste worked wonderfully at giving my teeth a good, thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> After a month of using the system for a month I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Over all, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> What a great product to get your teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> This is a 2 step product that works great and turn my teeth whiter than they have ever been.  </li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> This was great because it feels effortless to use</li>
            <li> experience was great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> but the whitening part isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li> Step 1&#x27;s tube I loved-the flip cap was great.</li>
            <li> However, these amazing 2 products are great!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste however is great</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this sample to try, as whitening products can be spendy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t great either though.</li>
            <li> This duo produces great results.</li>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It is a great product that I will continue to use but not as often as I was maybe every two days or so.</li>
            <li> It honestly is the best whitening stuff that I have used and this is including strips, pastes, gels, etc.</li>
            <li> I also have experienced gum tenderness with the tray system.</li>
            <li> Its a great product and works great.</li>
            <li> I think it makes my teeth look great</li>
            <li> I am happy that I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I used it 2 times a day for a week and it looked great but did give my teeth a bit of sensitivity.</li>

            <li> It has a great taste and does not irritate whatsoever.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s great</li>

            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>

            <li> The step one is a great minty flavor, and the step 2 is a milder flavor, yet still pleasant.</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Let me just say AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Bzzzagent sent me this duo to try and it has been amazing!  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Crest and Thought this was an amazing over the counter product!</li>
            <li> When paired with my electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m getting amazing results!</li>
            <li> Made a remarkable difference in my teeth without any added sensitivity.</li>
            <li> and I actually really liked it!</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product!</li>
            <li> All opinions stated in this review are my own!</li>
            <li> It had a great flavor and it did a good job.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m way more impressed with this system.</li>
            <li> They feel great, almost as good as when I have my teeth cleaned by the dentist.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I see a difference!</li>
            <li> This is one of the more inexpensive whitening options that I have found, so it really is a great deal!</li>
            <li> In just two weeks time there was a remarkable whitening of my teeth</li>
            <li> I noticed a good improvement and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> you dentist notices a remarkable difference</li>
            <li> and honestly I do think that my teeth look whiter even after 1 use!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this system is that there is no nasty tasting gel.</li>
            <li> my canines which no product has ever done successfully</li>
            <li> but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this great freebie from Crest and bzzagent!  </li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t feel especially clean</li>
            <li> It is in no way pleasant for me and</li>
            <li> No tooth sensitivity at all  and pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> Pleasant tasting.</li>
            <li> I found the taste to be pleasant in both the toothpaste and the whitener.</li>
            <li> The taste was also not that pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product; however, since it is a lengthly multi-step process, it is best to do this right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li> It had a very pleasant and refreshing flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, my husband has even started using it as he was impressed with my results.</li>
            <li> However, what I like best is that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> , it was easy for me to adapt to, as with anything it works best when you follow the directions, and use the products correctly.</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use, and tasted great!!</li>
            <li> I was using the 3D Brilliance toothpaste before and was happy with that, but this is even better!</li>
            <li> this greatly reduced my sensitivity (although slowed the whitening progress).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Have you ever noticed that some people have bright front teeth</li>
            <li> My teeth are bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My teeth looked a shade whiter and just as shiny and bright.  </li>
            <li> Take a minute to look at those bright shinny teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> I loved that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take good care of my teeth</li>
            <li> ; The product is good</li>
            <li> Good product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat the results.</li>
            <li> I cannot say I loved it-</li>
            <li> but you do.&lt;br /&gt;It took longer to brush my teeth using the two-step process, but that&#x27;s a good thing I guess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recieved this free to try from BzzAgent an incredible app!</li>
            <li> Good on crest for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to drink a fair amount of soda and tea and this product has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and if it was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> good news is</li>
            <li> It was a good product.  </li>
            <li> I (surprisingly) had a cleaning scheduled during the period where I was testing this product and had no cavities, but have hot/cold sensitivity around two of my existing fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  </li>
            <li> I felt that I was doing something good for my teeth.</li>
            <li> However, seeing good results from the product would encourage me to continue using the system.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> This would be a good toothpaste for someone who is trying to get rid of stains in their teeth.</li>
            <li> I loved the whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by its power, I received it in the mail to test for free from Crest through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Step 1 was a good cleaner but thinner consistency than what I like</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a fair review, so I used the product for 10 days before giving my review.</li>
            <li> Got this free from crest, it works great!</li>
            <li> Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste, Fair whitener&lt;</li>
            <li> Loved using this duo.  </li>
            <li> found the taste good, not overly minty.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would taste as good as it worked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I recieved this free for testing purposes and I am so impressed.</li>
            <li> I felt like it did a really good job of cleaning</li>
            <li> The flavor was good as well</li>
            <li> GOOD  </li>
            <li> but flavor is still good.</li>
            <li> loved the product because it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier than going to the dentist for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Good taste as well.</li>
            <li> that said, a part of me also liked the idea of a two-step process; the packaging for it looked great</li>
            <li> Since I drink a fair amount of coffee each day, the results were quite surprising.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a all around good product.</li>
            <li> I have not had good results with this product.</li>
            <li> The results were nearly as good as whitening strips for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mess/time involved/discomfort/inability to speak than whitening strips&lt;br /&gt;Results nearly as good as whitening strips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> the good news-</li>
            <li> Amazon does have a fair price on this product as well.</li>
            <li> I do think the product is a good product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see this product being good for extended use, but I might see myself using it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t/never had had any problems with tooth sensitivity, this is probably a really good product however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved this product as I saw that my teeth were whiter after using.</li>
            <li> I loved that I could use it and just leave the house and not have to worry about walking around at home with strips on my teeth.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job of removing surface stains on teeth.</li>
            <li> The flavor is good, not too minty.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion about the product is it is great.</li>
            <li> So I will stick with my loved Crest brand,</li>
            <li> Now perhaps that&#x27;s a good thing, as Crest mentions in their Crest 3D commercials, &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> This was a good product.</li>
            <li> The taste was good for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to go see my Dentist to see if all is good with my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> and it makes them feel so good.</li>
            <li> The tubes, themselves, were a good shape</li>
            <li> good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample from BzzAgent of this Excellent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee 5 days a week at work and that cannot be good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel good, but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job of whitening.  </li>
            <li> I also loved the minty flavor.</li>
            <li> Good product - teeth felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I loved that the two tubes came in one package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this was perfect as it is very easy, and more convenient because they come as a set.</li>
            <li> I think it does an excellent job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I think the best part isn&#x27;t the whitening power but the squeaky clean feeling in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I think this 2-step whitening product is the best way to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste was pleasant, and I liked both the color and texture of both tubes of paste.</li>
            <li> This product is incredibly cooling and refreshing, it makes your mouth feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> Super affordable, WORKS, tastes wonderful and does not bother my gums or teeth.</li>
            <li> Awesome whitening, mild taste.  </li>
            <li> really loved being able to test these products !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very easy and effective way to get your teeth a bit whiter!</li>
            <li> I am very glad I got to try this</li>
            <li> I experienced no increased sensitivity even after a week or more of use.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is bright and is eye catching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and will remain a customer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could convince people that I got a great result from this product, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m here for.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks, I have a smile that I am very proud of showing off.</li>
            <li> Was unsure of a 2 step process to brush my teeth, but was very satisfied.</li>

            <li> I think if I use it longer I may see even more improvement in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gone to a dentist and had my teeth whitened to the tune of $300 (and as many years ago think inflation!)</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and tastes great.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It is that amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li> It works amazing well.</li>
            <li> I can use it every 3 days and still get amazing results.</li>
            <li> The amazing Crest 3d whiting system has been working amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I received these to test from BzzAgent and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> but the end result is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> my review is completely my own thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> and I gotta be honest</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much whiter and brighter and that makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Everyone notices how nice my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which is nice that it isn&#x27;t bleachy tasting like some of the whitening products i have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but yet i see its use to removing surface stain which i liked.</li>
            <li> but I would have tried it on my own.</li>
            <li> I liked was that it didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity to my gums or teeth while I was using it.</li>
            <li> As I continued to use the product I liked the way my teeth looked and felt.</li>
            <li> The flavor for was #1 was nice - but not for the #2.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the ease of use and gentle whitening</li>
            <li> I use it with my popular brand electric toothbrush that runs a two minute cycle...</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t believe that I would have purchased it to try on my own otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My smile has never been this impressive, and my family is brushing now more than ever.</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of whitening toothpaste there is.</li>
            <li> Kind of like the tingly feeling I get when using Listerine.</li>
            <li> With Rembrandt you have to choose: either you buy the kind that works with your stains or the one that whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to see it on the picture.</li>
            <li> All good toothpastes are and whitening toothpastes are even more abrasive so they can reive debris and help remove surface stains from your teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought that it had a really nice flavor also.</li>
            <li> I think that this could be used as a maintenance product if you use whitening strips or on its own.</li>
            <li> and I really liked the flavor.</li>
            <li> did receive a sample for review purposes, but I believe that all reviews should provide honest feedback.  </li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> A shout out to Crest for sending me this to review and to be honest</li>
            <li> I have seen a plethora of teeth whitening products in the media and in my own life.</li>
            <li> It is nice yo not have to wait like i would with strips or a pen.</li>
            <li> I found that it had a good taste, consistency wasn&#x27;t so pasty but more</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> liked this product quite a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple, efficient and effective teeth cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> and I am so thrilled that it doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity for me.</li>
            <li> (ha) thing kind of like you&#x27;d do in the winter to warm your hands.</li>
            <li> This product also has a nice minty taste which was a nice surprise as some whitening products do not taste well at all.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I am heading out to buy my own today.</li>
            <li> I liked that fact</li>
            <li> The concept is nice though and a lot easier than whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way Step 1 tasted and</li>
            <li> It was also nice that it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums like the strips do.</li>
            <li> and it also makes you brush for the recommended 2 min for optimum oral health :)</li>
            <li> The toothpaste kind of reminds me of that &amp;#34;bubble mint&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This system is cost efficient and just as effective as getting your teeth</li>
            <li> Great Awesome product instantly cleans and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li> It really is a power duo that&#x27;ll get your pearly whites sparkling in no time &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> No buildup of any kind.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as good as getting your teeth whitened at the dentist, but I do think it was better than my tray system.</li>
            <li> I liked the flavor.</li>
            <li> I liked the consistency of it too because when you put it on your toothbrush it stays there, with one exception.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product.</li>
            <li> so I kind of just count to 60</li>
            <li> But it did work effectively for me</li>
            <li> I honestly and truly saw a difference in two days.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and then of course I had some kind of reaction-allergic or just irritation</li>
            <li> I really liked that.</li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle</li>
            <li> What a nice feeling😊 .</li>
            <li> After using the product for two weeks, I can see an incredible difference in the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it effectively whitens in the time that I would already spend brushing my teeth anyway.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty taste</li>
            <li> ® but my opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> (nice and minty)</li>
            <li> Which is really nice</li>
            <li> I did not give this product 5 stars despite loving my results</li>
            <li> Lets be honest here.</li>
            <li> Who has that kind of time?</li>
            <li> I liked the product, although the polishing gel did have a bit of an off taste to it.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a nice mint flavor and the whitening gel</li>
            <li> I liked the &amp;#34;process&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a whitening gel on its own and that&#x27;s all they need to sell.</li>
            <li> I didnt take a picture because honestly, I didnt think it would work because my dad didnt notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. :)</li>
            <li> but this is my Own, honest opinion</li>
            <li> really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I truly liked using it 2 times</li>
            <li> Two steps is also kind of time consuming and somewhat of a hassle</li>
            <li> product has a nice taste.</li>
            <li> Probably not, but it would be nice to have and would improve the product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this system because it is an effective product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always liked the value</li>
            <li> I have always used crest so I was thrilled to try this out.</li>
            <li> my teeth are a lot whiter and feel very clean!</li>
            <li> this easy and quick process works perfectly all by itself!  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> and I feel a great clean when I use it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth felt really clean and my gums felt great.</li>
            <li> , they felt wonderful after brushing and the whitener was fast and easy to use, with good results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Either way, great results and easy to use, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> That said, I am satisfied with the color change, and very pleased with the look of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and it&#x27;s smile-verous (my new word for it).</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest, and I thought it was a great maintenance whitener.</li>
            <li> and so happy I was able to try it for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Although this did not cause tooth sensitivity in me, it may still cause sensitivity in others, but I am happy to report it didn&#x27;t - and Whitestrips cause my teeth to hurt &amp; become super</li>
            <li> loved how easy the two step process worked.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who don&#x27;t have straight perfect teeth, this product works better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> I loved that is was so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and the change is gradual.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use even though it comes in a set of 2.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> found the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to use and can see my self using this product from this point on.</li>
            <li> I love it and love that my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed and even more than the cleaning and polishing, I love the sense of taking care of me for a change.</li>
            <li> the paste and the gel taste pretty good, which was a surprise to me!</li>
            <li> It also made me take better care of my teeth by brushing longer, and I even started to floss more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 2-step process, but does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li> It tastes great, is easy to use and best of all, my teeth are definitely whiter!  </li>
            <li> , they held up nicely  :)</li>
            <li> It would be wonderful if Crest could use a completely recyclable tube - including the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product for a whiter smile..</li>
            <li> I believe it will be much more effective after longer use.</li>
            <li> But all in all, this is by far the best teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> as far as whitening toothpastes go this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> And did it more effectively than any whitening strip I have tried.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be one of the easiest home whitening products out there, as well as the most effective.</li>
            <li> but the more I used it, the more I liked it and liked the results.  </li>
            <li> really liked this combination product, but I was expecting more from it on the whitening front.</li>
            <li> I can once again smile without worry and, yes, Shopper Army, I can &amp;#34;let my freak flag fly, &#x27;cause I feel like I owe it to someone.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for brightening up your smile.</li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed with the product removing stains and yellowing.</li>
            <li> I liked this concept of a toothpaste and a gel whitener that is not a strip, a gel that I brush on my teeth works so much better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying good things about this product because I got it for free</li>
            <li> I liked the way it makes my teeth look whiter, and enjoy the tingle after brushing!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste combination is great for fresh breath .</li>
            <li> It is effective and if you can bare the taste, this product is great!!!</li>
            <li> I was given this product by Crest to try for free and I am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> After using the product for about 3 weeks, I am happy with my positive results, with no gum sensitivity problems!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone wanting an easy whitening product!</li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use ad it works!</li>

            <li> I love love love this toothpaste combo!  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be very effective and noticed a whiter smile after just a week of use.</li>
            <li> It did, However, make my teeth feel very clean, I experienced some mild sensitivity with the &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; routine.</li>
            <li> I loved the product, made my teeth feel so clean that after using it I keep wanting to run my tongue across my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really loved the clean feeling in my mouth as if I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> There are more effective, better tasting products out there.</li>
            <li> I would have liked more impute from you as most of the sites you asked us to use didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great clean mouth but strong mint taste</li>
            <li> The Crest two part whitening system helped me get my teeth looking brighter as well as giving them a good clean and almost polished feeling.</li>
            <li> Best part was I got to try it for FREE Thanks to crest.</li>
            <li> Although my mouth felt clean it did not have a good taste.</li>
            <li> I loved the squeaky clean feeling of my teeth after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> What else gives you that kind of clean?!</li>
            <li> I love being able to smile and show my teeth proudly.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ll continue using the product longer and am hopeful that overtime, I will see a more significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy to report that it really works!</li>
            <li> Pretty great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does encourage the user to brush for two full minutes which is good.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, though, because you finish with Step 2 anyway!</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to sit around with anything on my teeth and that this product is easy to use!  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste made my teeth feel very smooth and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have experienced no staining or strange discoloration in my teeth or gums and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Results were amazing and very quick and noticeable</li>
            <li> This whitening system is amazing, in just 2 easy steps you are on your way to whiter, brighter teeth.</li>
            <li> I also liked how easy it was.</li>
            <li> Nice product easy to use, gradual improvement</li>
            <li> The kit was easy to use and sat nicely on my bathroom vanity</li>
            <li> I received a box free from Crest and love it!</li>
            <li> I love using this in two steps -- first the brightening paste, which has a good, not overly minty taste and is kind of sparkly.  </li>
            <li> I received the whitening system to try for free from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!  </li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a buzz agent  promotion from crest to try for free and love it!</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use tastes great and actually works.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference after using for 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> It tastes a lot like the stuff that&#x27;s on a Crest WhiteStrip, so definitely not the greatest taste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any teeth whitening products because I have had so many horror stories.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the results enough to work through that problem though.  </li>
            <li> I was not a fan of not being able to rinse between step 1 and 2</li>
            <li> and I got this product for free to try and give my honest opinions about.  </li>
            <li> I do want to continue to use it to see if it works better</li>
            <li> and then you brush with step 2 for one more minute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using the system and see how much better my teeth can look after a longer time.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the crest 3d toothpaste and whitening gel through Bzzagent for Free to provide my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m glad I didnt.</li>
            <li> I feel way more confident now</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign in which I share my honest feedback with others.  </li>
            <li> so I would be able to compare my before and after shots.  </li>
            <li> importantly, the results!</li>
            <li> ok it may written them,  but is it cleaning them? &#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my teeth are not the whitest they are also not that &amp;#34;yellowed&amp;#34; so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to help improve the color at all.</li>
            <li> the affordability of this product and the ease of the use :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the taste of the Step 2 polish more than the Step 1 cleanser.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the fact that the packaging is paper and can be recycled.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my breath smells better</li>
            <li> /&gt;The not-as-positives: The toothpaste didn&#x27;t taste minty like you would expect most toothpaste to taste like.</li>
            <li> (I just have to be a bit more patient).</li>
            <li> Not used to doing more than 1 step!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> It would be better to combine this into one toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> The lack of mint makes it &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as if your teeth are not clean.&lt;br /&gt;The #2 tube could use a flip top like the #1 tube.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> The product was just OK.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked better than the whitening kit I got from my dentist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful for crest giving me a free trial!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use strips or anything else,</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gladly continue to purchase it going forward.</li>
            <li> over all, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this product again, but i would try it again if the formula was changed.</li>
            <li> I was given this product for free to try and review from crest, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is more an abrasive/cleaner.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a polish which has a better taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to continue using this product to whiten my teeth even more!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am now using it for more than 3 weeks and my friends have asked me about my Whittier teeth</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I&#x27;ve used it now, it always burns my gums and lips</li>
            <li> I have also tried whitening pens and still think that this product does a better job.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> My teeth are brighter and I love the minty taste it leaves in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since Crest sent me it for free I said why not!</li>
            <li> My mother enjoyed the product as well...</li>
            <li> MANY PEOPLE WHO SAW ME</li>
            <li> After two weeks, they are more noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many whitening toothpastes that I can’t even put a count on it.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for sure.</li>
            <li> I love Crest products and I am always whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> Simpler is often better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products though out the years</li>
            <li> and this one did better than most.</li>
            <li> I found that this product had great results and much easier to use that the trays.</li>
            <li> You will love it</li>
            <li> My teeth were looking better, believe it or not.</li>
            <li> The taste of the paste was OK, and there is a noticeable difference after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the cleansing portion because I felt like my teeth were a lot cleaner after completing the system with each brushing.  </li>
            <li> As a result they must be whiter because there is nothing for my coffee or wine to cling to :)</li>
            <li> There was much more significance on his teeth than on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would have used it longer if I would have seen greater</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> Received this to try for free as a Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I love this system.</li>
            <li> Once I got to my whiteness level, I&#x27;ve been able to maintain with the use of this product.  </li>
            <li> I think that means I have to go to the dentist honestly and have a cavity filled.  </li>
            <li> The taste - no horrible after-taste -</li>
            <li> Which may have resulted in me not seeing better whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> any event, I was pleased to see that the product did NOT contain any plastic beads that would be harmful to the environment--and my gums.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product i got to try it from bzzagent</li>
            <li> more abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully for 3 weeks and absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li> That was for sure a plus for me.</li>
            <li> white.&lt;br /&gt;The two step system is super easy and is much more pleasant than strips or gels.</li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed with it and will buy it again; however maybe not all the time.  </li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent, I was able to try this toothpaste and teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works quite well if you follow the directions and use it twice</li>
            <li> I got this free from Bzzagent to try!</li>
            <li> The Finisher was more minty in flavor and was more like a gel in consistency.  </li>
            <li> I love my results and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office would give better results</li>
            <li> I love that I am already brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> Maybe with longer use it might whiten my teeth more.</li>
            <li> See for yourself- top is before, bottom is after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to see results in a weeks time.</li>
            <li> Like anything else, if you drink liquids that stain make sure you keep on top of using the product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Crest 3D White system.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a wonderful product and I will definitely continue to use it and purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> It makes it easier and more convenient to whiten rather than waiting 30 minutes for a strip.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> but once I started using it, it was OK.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]</li>
            <li> If that could be improved, it would be so much more enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the 2 step process but better texture and flavor</li>
            <li> would have got me to give more stars.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d prefer more of a mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish the step 2 tube had a flip top like step one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten mines free!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years and nothing helps.</li>
            <li> This is not a horrible product, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I get to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample by the company to review but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> So, I tried it again after a break hoping that the sensitivity would be better this time.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than whitestrips because it whitens all your teeth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE how this system makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I believe the tenderness is being caused by the whitening agent, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure about that fact.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> There needs to be more minty, refreshing flavor like Step 1.</li>
            <li> I would love to just have 1 step.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed it.</li>

            <li> Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Promising, but maybe it needs more time..</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> I do think I saw a bit of whitening effect after two weeks of use but, obviously since I&#x27;m not even 100% sure myself, it was underwhelming at best.</li>
            <li> I do feel optimistic that with more time, there will be more pronounced whitening results.</li>
            <li> I am sure to continue to use it-</li>
            <li> Best part is it only took 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> all i feel my teeth are brighter and for people with no sensitivity may like it better.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product free for review purposes but this review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I got the pleasure of trying this product FREE!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of step one.</li>
            <li> Thank you to BzzAgent and Crest for the free sample!</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it twice a day with zero sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but truthfully I could see results after just a couple uses.</li>
            <li> At work, everyone kept asking me what I was using, to whiten my teeth, so I told them that I&#x27;d been using this, since I got it as a free gift from Bzzagent!</li>

            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a whitening system that you do not have to leave on your teeth, as the taste of most whitening systems make me gag.</li>

            <li> They come side by side in a cute box step 1 the cleaning paste.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when my spouse noticed the change.  </li>
            <li> The gel is much more tolerable than the cleansing paste though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from bzz agent #lovefreestuff!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure it would take longer.</li>
            <li> I particularly love the whitening polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was given this product to review for free by BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been using this 3D Crest Brilliance for about two weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t expect it to whiten overnight.  </li>
            <li> The picture on top shows my before and the one on bottom is after using this system.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this product complementary through BuzzAgent to sample it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and only takes 2 minutes to use.</li>
            <li> But since Crest sent me it for free I said why not!</li>
            <li> But after several weeks using the product his teeth were looking healthy and glowing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, I am a cynic.  </li>
            <li> I had not used any whitening products in many years.  </li>
            <li> However, it has done a wonderful job of keeping my teeth white as I&#x27;ve yet to need whitening strips again.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> absolutely love this 2 step system.</li>
            <li> The minty fresh mouth is one of the characteristics that I look for in a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the product for free!</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> love the way my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is ok.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use the product twice a day for best results, and I can only imagine the whitening you would see.</li>
            <li> I was provided free product to review, by Crest, but all views are my own.</li>
            <li> It also makes me more mindful of my dental health: the instructions say to brush with each of the two pastes for one minute</li>
            <li> I preferred the flip top tube to the capped tube.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product through Amazon, though I shop Amazon all the time and love the site.</li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed with this product and give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I waited to review it till I could be sure of the results.</li>
            <li> I received this for free for review purposes from bzzagent, all options are my own though.</li>
            <li> After using the product for several weeks, I can say, without a doubt, this is the best at-home whitening system I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I used this product that was given to me as a free trial and liked it.</li>
            <li> Is it safe?</li>
            <li> I was able to whiten my teeth just by brushing them.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li> and I was also more confident in smiling around friends and family.</li>
            <li> makes that all better.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the Crest mouthwash that I received.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> love the ease ans results of this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li> The taste was okay</li>
            <li> I have some stains from coffee and wine that I would love to see whitened.</li>
            <li> and I think this one is much better.</li>
            <li> Love love this product, no dentist needed</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and will continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that if I use the 3D Brilliance kit at night and my 3D white in the am, it&#x27;s the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the strips and is comparable to what you would get from your dentist.</li>
            <li> but it was ok.</li>
            <li> this was not setting ok</li>
            <li> I like it a lot better then strips</li>
            <li> I love that feeling</li>
            <li> On top of no pain, my teeth are noticeably whiter as well.  </li>
            <li> So I want to start by saying yes, I did get this product for free to try from BzzAgent, but I am always honest with my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Crest White Kit is the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve come across</li>
            <li> better then the steps on my opiniom because I was going to brush anyway,</li>
            <li> I will finish using the product, but I do not think I will repurchase it as it is a lot more pricey than buying just the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Crest sent me a sample of this for free to try and review!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I love that I am already brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I love the idea of whitening ALL your teeth and not just the front ones like some whitening kits</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did because otherwise I don&#x27;t think I would have given it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> maybe the results would be more dramatic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you again to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me to try it for Free!</li>
            <li> I also think it has helped improve my tooth brushing regimen because I count while brushing to make sure I&#x27;m using each step for the correct amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;</li>
            <li> I felt confident in my smile.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> This product is really interesting despite the fact that Crest is my go to brand.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a flip top tube.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that 3D did not increase my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Crest 3D White Brilliance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more the consistency of a gel.</li>
            <li> Crest products are my favorite for tooth brushing, and mouth washing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using two steps, and Step 2 results in a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to say after about 4 weeks of using these</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the idea of this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister and she seemed to love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this system.</li>
            <li> I love the step 1.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the taste of step 2</li>
            <li> I used many products through out the years.</li>
            <li> (more than I saw with the Colgate Optic White)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for bzzagent.com for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> you leave on without rinsing for just a minute, then you proceed to step two (the whitening finisher), brush for a minute more then rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using my toothpaste system.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> The instructions were ok.</li>
            <li> It should be a flip top like the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Until I was able to try the crest 3d two step teeth whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Overall, the best part was my mouth and teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful to Crest and Shopper&#x27;s Army for letting me test this amazing product for free.</li>
            <li> I find that if I use the 3D Brilliance kit at night and my 3D white in the am, it&#x27;s the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> So, after using it more than a week I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of whitening with this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the taste of this one.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more out of it!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> When I rinse my gums hurt so I have not been able to use the product twice a day.</li>
            <li> This did a better job than I was expecting it to.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I thought it would whiten my teeth more than it did.</li>
            <li> Thank to Crest, I was able to try this product for free !</li>

            <li> This toothpaste is sweetened with sucralose, which I find intolerable (as do many people).</li>
            <li> On top of the taste, it has an extra-gritty texture for increased abrasion.</li>
            <li> details/review in greater depth at http://www.beautyskeptic.com/?p&#x3D;3276</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> (Not to mention it is better tasting)  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> OK, as many people are like me and the thought of yet another whitening product and the taste..</li>
            <li> and I hope you end up with better results than I did.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> This is more of a maintenance product than a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> The whole concept is great though - brush teeth for one minute with the cleansing toothpaste</li>
            <li> Whitening your teeth within your daily routine sounded perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some pretty remarkable results in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Rest assured, I have found my go to whitening product that I am absolutely in love with.</li>
            <li> I love how my mouth feels after using this step.</li>
            <li> Again, in just one minute, your teeth are brighter, whiter, and all around more sparkly than before.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Brillance is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Bzz for sending me this great product to try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s better to put the #2 step gel on with a Q-tip as opposed to a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I will keep using it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love running my tongue across my teeth as soon as I am done brushing them.  </li>
            <li> I was able to notice a difference in about 3 days.  </li>
            <li> The dental hygienist was able to remove the stain from my tooth in under a minute.</li>
            <li> But after using the gel, they felt so smooth!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Crest 3D White system.</li>

            <li> This product was overall wonderful.</li>
            <li> I just could not spend time reading directions for a process I have been doing for most of my life.</li>
            <li> It might be better if it came with one of those color charts so people can have something to compare to.</li>

            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>

            <li> May work better for some.</li>
            <li> Given more time I believe there would been even more lightening of the stains.</li>
            <li> I think it is a novel approach to whitening, but I would like to have seen better</li>
            <li> I found that it helped me to brush longer and more thoroughly.</li>

            <li> will purchase this toothpaste going forward, well after my free sample is all used up!</li>
            <li> love the taste - not too &amp;#34;stingy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> So my teeth are not horrifically stained, so I am unsure how this will do for a person who has been smoking for many years or who drinks lots of soda, teas, or coffee.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free of charge by Crest to try and give honest feedback.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience any gum sensitivity or irritations - and the product is easy to use as you brush with each product for one minute (very easy if you have an electric toothbrush)</li>
            <li> Step 2 gives your teeth a super clean, polished look right away, making you feel and look awesome!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product since it seemed like it would be a stronger and more effective paste treatment</li>
            <li> My mouth feels great after using the product and there isn&#x27;t sensitivity like I have experienced with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh and clean after each use and the whitening benefit of it is great.</li>
            <li> I give the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System a 5/5 stars for sure!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I saw results!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try the product as I had not used any whitening products for almost a year in an attempt to give my teeth a break.</li>

            <li> love how clean my teeth feel afterwards!</li>
            <li> Of course they look the best right after I brush, but they are still atleast 1 if not 2 shades whiter than “my normal” all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> and that was more important.</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest 3D for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I, like many others received a free trial from Crest and Bzz agent.</li>
            <li> However, I feel that there are better teeth whitening toothpastes/products available.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free on smiley 360 for a review.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I was able to try it free as a member of Shopper Army but all opinions remain my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product just be leary if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I got to try it for free as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free by Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I was able to try this product free through Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> So glad I got to try it for free</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that works with consistent use I love it.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fantastic, better than after the dentist cleans them.</li>
            <li> I think this would be great to use in its entirety once every six months, maybe to maintain the results of a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was able to try out this product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on my smile, and since using this whitening duo, I&#x27;ve gotten many more.  </li>
            <li> Implementing this regimen in place of your normal toothpaste is supposed to give you a dazzling, professional-grade</li>
            <li> The best part is that I have absolutely no pain or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> got this product complimentary of Crest but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Nor does it have the nice fresh taste I appreciate in Crest toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> the first step, the cleaning, was a great cleaning paste, not too minty, just right.</li>
            <li> Sounds too good to be true, right?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix, or need a deep whitening, then this is probably not your best bet.</li>
            <li> While I did receive this product free to try out, I can honestly say this is the easiest way to get whiter teeth quickly.  </li>

            <li> I was very excited to receive this product for free for being a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They may not be shades whiter (again, I don&#x27;t need to whiten really) but they seem so much shinier and my mouth stays clean All Day, which is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product that is so easy to use and get results right away.</li>
            <li> but the best part is how clean my teeth feel all day long.</li>
            <li> I feel that my teeth are very clean and smooth, and also whiter and brighter than they were before using the two step system.</li>

            <li> I love my smile!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about increased sensitivity due to the peroxide, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I did not experience any!</li>
            <li> for the system in stores, it&#x27;s definitely more wallet friendly as well.  </li>
            <li> plus I love having fresh breath!  </li>
            <li> And the best part is, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no pain or sensitivity from it whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed the my teeth are whiter, but what&#x27;s even better is when people compliment me on my smile!</li>
            <li> I wanted a before and after but couldn&#x27;t get a true one because I saw results after 3 uses!</li>
            <li> But after a month I noticed and even more significant difference.</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I was a couple shades lighter and my teeth were SO SMOOTH!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is a good whitening system but probably not meant for me!</li>

            <li> Easy to use, just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I found this to be easy to use, and the two step process easy to follow.</li>
            <li> The process is easy to do.</li>
            <li> I only used it once a day because many people said they experienced sensitivity when using twice a day.</li>
            <li> is an easy way to get whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process was easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite strong, but it does work to some extent.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some whiteners irritate my teeth or gums, because they are too strong.</li>
            <li> I did not find it to strong and it didn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> So, besides the strong flavor I would say I like this product</li>
            <li> I was able try this product at no cost thanks to Bzzagent, but this opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li> The taste was a bit strong, but I got accustomed to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too strong.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this product to everyone and even though I had a sensitivity to this I still continue to use it periodically.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-does not provide the strong minty flavor that I prefer in a toothpaste</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening system is quite strong and abrasive.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 was also very easy to use and had a pleasant flavor very similar to Step 1.</li>
            <li> They feel as smooth and clean as they did this morning!</li>
            <li> It actually is pretty easy but the results aren&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought the Crest 3D white did a really great job of getting my mouth, teeth, and gums very clean looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> I received this amazing whitening system from BzzAgent, thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with very crooked teeth like me because it works better than a whitening toothpaste and doesnt need to conform to fit your teeth like strips or mouth plates.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty amazing product.</li>
            <li> The results are noticeable, and I&#x27;ve had people comment on how white and beautiful my teeth are.</li>
            <li> no strips or trays that you have to wear in your mouth, good whitening results, no sensitivity, no change to your normal routine...just brush.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product for free through BzzAgent and loved it!</li>
            <li> I did use warm to hot water to rinse and maybe that helped.</li>
            <li> Step 2 also gives a bit of a burn, but it&#x27;s not necessarily bad, just seems refreshingly</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and clean my teeth feel after brushing without any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how this product made my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> my teeth and mouth felt a lot more clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I liked the way it made my teeth and mouth feel -- clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The pastes leave this super fresh, super smooth clean feeling like none I&#x27;ve every experienced.</li>
            <li> But I loved the clean feeling of my teeth that lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with a busy lifestyle and you are able to get that dentist cleaning feeling right at home.</li>
            <li> I loved the easy 2 step system that you can complete in just 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> allowing me to start my day feeling bold, fresh and confident!</li>
            <li> To be honest the first use was when I really noticed the most change, however it&#x27;s still whiting!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste made my mouth so fresh and clean feeling and the whitener made my smile so bright.</li>
            <li> I however did not like the feeling of the whitening finisher on my teeth, but after using it my mouth was fine.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean, my breath felt fresh, and most importantly, my teeth looked whiter!  </li>
            <li> The taste on both was fine for me.</li>
            <li> It has a fine taste to it as well.</li>
            <li> It could be that it was more convenient and that I used it more consistently.</li>
            <li> taste and texture of the cleaning paste is fine.</li>
            <li> The taste was fine too.</li>
            <li> My experience was fine.</li>
            <li> Some toothpaste are too minty and foamy, this was neither, so made brushing for 60 seconds easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> Lucky me!</li>
            <li> This is a clear gel, it doesn&#x27;t have as pleasant a taste as the toothpaste gel, but it is not off-putting.</li>
            <li> I quickly changed my mind!  </li>
            <li> I found that this toothpaste made my teeth feel really clean, squeaky clean as a matter of fact!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BZZAgent, I had the opportunity to try this product for FREE!!</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this kit and couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about the simplicity, convenience, price, and pain-free, instantaneous results.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are easy to apply to your toothbrush and the deep cleansing toothpaste has a great tasting mint flavor.</li>
            <li> The Whitening Finisher gel that comes with the Crest 3D White Brilliance system is a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I found Crest 3D white easy to use and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> : Maybe worth it for excellent clean feeling, much more than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is intended to whiten teeth that haven&#x27;t been treated before, but as a touch up for previously treated teeth and as a followup to the excellent Crest 3D Luxe whitening strips, this is a great product and one I&#x27;m definitely keeping in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product for cleaning, I didn&#x27;t get the whitening results I had hoped for but they are certainly whiter.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to give the Crest 3D Daily Whitening System a try and after about two weeks of use, I can say I&#x27;m definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I did also receive it as part of a promotion but love it so much!!</li>
            <li> All in all very pleased with this and record it highly.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a unique and easy way to whiten.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Crest, and I have really been thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see huge whitning results.</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t see huge results.</li>
            <li> After three days, I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I received this for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent but opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It may not be a huge impact, but you can notice the difference.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I was one of the ones chosen by BzzAgent to receive a free box of the Crest 3D White cleansing and whitening system to try.  </li>
            <li> Even with the amount I do use it I can tell a huge difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> After using it I noticed a huge difference.</li>

            <li> I really loved how clean my teeth felt after using it, but I never saw any whitening after 2 weeks and have since gone back to using dissolving whitening strips once a day; which I feel work a lot better for the money.  </li>
            <li> so when I got a free offer from Crest and bzzagent to try this product for free I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be easy to use, not bad tasting, and what I can to expect from Crest brand.</li>

            <li> and so we were thrilled to find something that worked and that didn&#x27;t have the side effects that we&#x27;ve experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> The system is super easy to use and the results are almost immediate.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening products and was very pleased with the refreshing taste of this one!</li>
            <li> this product works very well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It doe seem very strong, but you want strength in your whitening toothpaste, or it probably isn&#x27;t going to do much.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Crest through BzzAgent and am really happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> The second step is especially great because my teeth are not perfectly straight, so by brushing in the paste, I&#x27;m able to get every spot!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product as a bzz agent, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I love trying out new oral health products so my mouth/teeth can be in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try it for free and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier!!</li>
            <li> and after you&#x27;re done your teeth feel soo smooth and are whiter right off the bat!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have very fresh and clean breath.</li>
            <li> and I feel my mouth is very fresh and clean</li>
            <li> However, the effects are temporary (less than 15 seconds) and are worth the great results!</li>
            <li> how easy and convenient it was to obtain professional whitening results in the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li> Quick, clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and is quick and simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy (and inexpensive) way to get that bright, white smile!</li>
            <li> Most everything I heard was positive, so I agreed to try out the free sample.</li>
            <li> When I smile in pictures I see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> What an inexpensive and easily accessible alternative, then going to the dentist to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have generally always had good results with whitening products.  </li>
            <li> price - if it was just me, it is fine as I won&#x27;t use it that quickly</li>
            <li> although I have not noticed a remarkable change in the color of my teeth, and the pictures were not sent as there was no obvious difference, I welcomed the opportunity to try this product as I had been considering the purchase of a whitening system for some time</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure that abrasion is not</li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> But when BzzAgent sent this magical product out, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope for it at first.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try the product.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited to receive this product from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a buy!</li>
            <li> Noticed a more willing manner to wanting my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> Then the mouthwash came and, although reluctant at first after reading reviews from others, I finally tried it and loved it !</li>
            <li> After all of this, I rinsed and looked at my smile, and it already looked whiter!</li>
            <li> My teeth are significantly whiter and they stay that way.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this package.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it.</li>

            <li> I was excited to re</li>
            <li> I did get this product free from Crest via BzzAgent to test and review, this is my my 100% true opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my smile just after one brushing and my husband even made a comment about my teeth!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it significantly whitened</li>
            <li> After several days I did experience whitening of the teeth, so the product has been successful for me.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this product, which I received as a trial from Crest.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Since using it, Ive noticed a significant improvement in the color/shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference in the whiteness after the first use that just got better with each additional use.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a significant difference-</li>
            <li> I however do find it sort of time consuming in the morning and haven&#x27;t been able to consistently use this product twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was really excited about receiving this product-</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference in the whiteness after the first use that just got better with each additional use.</li>
            <li> However, I did not notice any  significant whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this product</li>
            <li> I was excited that this didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This Crest product has been consistent, not over whitening, which has made for a more even</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> Still worth it, though!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this set.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw the price of it in stores.</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to get to try this two step whitening product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> whitening paste is very effective in lifting moderate stains fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> My teeth do feel clean and fresh after each use though!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this FREE in the mail from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were super clean after the very first use!</li>
            <li> aside from the whitening, one thing I noticed from day one was how clean my teeth felt and</li>
            <li> After brushing with this system my teeth felt incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that it made my teeth feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li> The Crest products make your mouth feel tingly and clean, and I can see the difference in the whiteness of my teeth after just 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Step one, literally had my teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li> brush for 60 seconds with Step 1 to leave your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This product promises a clean mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean, refreshed and</li>
            <li> Dentist office clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and leaves my mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> an clean for hours.</li>
            <li> Its like after a trip to the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> But, for how clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li> My guess would be that this would be a really great after-care product if you had your teeth whitened professionally as it would probably maintain really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> The downsides to this product (for me) is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as clean as I am used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products before and with the exception of whitening tooth pastes, most whitening products make my teeth unbearably sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky people who got to try this for free through BzzAgent and Crest.  </li>
            <li> It does make my teeth feel EXTREMELY clean</li>
            <li> a polished (think after dentist visit clean)</li>
            <li> I was able to try the product for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> Your mouth just feels so intensely clean and minty</li>
            <li> My teeth felt so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Each time, after brushing, my teeth and mouth felt extremely clean.</li>
            <li> how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> Made teeth feel clean and polished.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a 2 step system to clean, polish and brighten.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love now how clean my mouth is, as comparable with the kind of clean after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;After two days I can physically see that my gums are pinker and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, they still feel remarkably clean.</li>
            <li> It did leave my teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li> My teeth looked and felt clean for hours after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try this product for free as a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked this product and was so glad I got to try it.</li>
            <li> The 1-2 punch of the cleanser and polisher assure your teeth are squeaky clean like they feel after the dentist as week as brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li> I also felt that my teeth were well polished, clean, and shiny.</li>
            <li> And running your tongue over your teeth (the acid test for clean) is a pleasure.</li>
            <li> but otherwise my teeth whitened up and felt clean.</li>
            <li> They also feel incredibly clean after brushing with this system.</li>
            <li> that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so freaking clean feeling and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is from the most reputable manufacturer of oral hygiene products in the world and may be used with complete confidence.</li>
            <li> I do like how clean my teeth feel after I use step 1</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel clean and polished.</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results so far and have only been using the product for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after I use it, and the clean feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt slippery clean.</li>
            <li> When using this product my teeth feel exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> You clean, then you whiten.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling stayed all day.</li>
            <li> The two step system made me feel like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting really clean.</li>
            <li> and I just never felt like I ended up with really a really clean mouth.</li>
            <li> It just leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> You just use tube 1 to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> and the toothpaste did make my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> My teeth did feel clean.</li>
            <li> I also felt that my mouth and teeth were clean all day.</li>
            <li> When you are finished your teeth are literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I have found that using it twice a day as direction keeps my teeth squeaky clean all day.</li>
            <li> It is a two part system that one uses twice a day to clean and remove stains.  </li>
            <li> I found myself using my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste at night and the whitening toothpast (the two tubes) in the morning when I felt refreshed and more willing to commit the full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It actually had a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> And, since I find using the product pleasant, I will continue to use it and await bigger -- and brighter --</li>
            <li> In addition, the whitening paste was pleasant enough to use.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good concept, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the past month since using this.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first two days but after brushing my mouth didn&#x27;t feel very clean</li>
            <li> And not to mention my mouth feels cool, fresh!</li>
            <li> far it is working way more than my expectations were for an over the counter product!</li>
            <li> It was awesome for about the first 2 weeks, then I started having major build-up on my back teeth at the top.</li>
            <li> At first I was not to sure it was doing a good job getting my teeth white, but then I happened to read the instructions and it said to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> The first couple days my gums hurt but that got better quick.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered a free trial system of Crest 3D White Brilliance as part of a promotion from Crest, I was happy to try it out and see if I could use it more frequently to get a faster whitened</li>
            <li> and honestly i smile more often since i am more confident in my self, who knew white teeth</li>
            <li> I was fortunately chosen to try and review crest 3d white brilliant daily cleansing from bzzagent for free!</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use and results were noticeable right away.  </li>
            <li> After receiving this whitening kit from BzzAgent I was pretty excited to try it out!</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that this really does brighten your smile!</li>
            <li> I received Crest 3D White free from Crest and BzzAgent and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working!!  </li>
            <li> so I use it for special occasions and</li>
            <li> I love this new product!!</li>
            <li> Love this new system!!</li>
            <li> I think there could be a bit more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; teeth feel after using the product but as a whole if you are looking for a product to clean and whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> , the surprising part was how clean my teeth actually felt.</li>
            <li> I think there could be a bit more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; teeth feel after using the product but as a whole if you are looking for a product to clean and whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> the most part, this product did exactly what it claimed to do, and I am enjoying my newly brighter and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> Has a super fresh, minty taste!</li>
            <li> I was super excited.</li>
            <li> i was super excited and still am.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this after receiving it to test through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about whitening with this two step system from Crest.</li>
            <li> The strips are hard to stick perfectly on your teeth</li>
            <li> , When I received the package I was super excited to test this one out.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to get it and think it might make a difference.</li>
            <li> My teeth were brighter and more vibrant!</li>
            <li> I avoid tasting this by just brushing on the front of my teeth that you can see (why do I need bright white molars, right!?).  </li>
            <li> While it was largely effective, it had a strong peroxide taste, took noticeably longer, and left me with significant sensitivity in my teeth.</li>
            <li> but i didnt see much result for whitnening after using it for a week but toothpaste is nice and fresh making my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty great alternative to bleaching.</li>
            <li> I do think that I have experienced quicker and more drastic whitening from professional whitening - but that comes with a bigger price tag.</li>
            <li> They are bright, white and shiny.</li>
            <li> first impression of Crest 3D White was attractive packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to tell my husband and children to not touch it because they&#x27;ve all seen how white and bright my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Thanks crest for the free product to review!</li>
            <li> and it takes just as good as any regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I do drink lots of caffeine (pepsi and sweet tea) so that could be the problem.</li>
            <li> I thought that my Crest 3D White toothpaste was a good product.</li>
            <li> The only whitening agent is hydrogen peroxide (which may or may not be good as all the spendier products I&#x27;ve seen on the market seem to use carbamide peroxide).</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample to review from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t do this because I love it so much I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li> (let me tell you, it does discipline me and make me brush my teeth for the full two minutes).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me feel better about smiling in pictures.</li>
            <li> I drink a fair amount of tea, so the daily use of this product has helped my teeth immensely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was true to the crest name!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could improve it, I would make the whitening results more intense, but for what it does it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this product for testing courtesy of Crest and bzzagent.</li>
            <li> and I hope to see whitening after a full use of the product.  </li>
            <li> The Deep Cleaning toothpaste in the step one tube is a good consistency</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than trays or strips, so I love the convenience as a coffee and wine drinker.</li>
            <li> After 2 full minutes of brushing, spit.</li>
            <li> I loved the deep cleansing toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt super clean and polished.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two full weeks.</li>
            <li> I kept using it for 3 more days and my gums are still very tender.</li>
            <li> But this cleaning system actually has a good taste.</li>
            <li> The polish was not as tasty but gave my teeth a cool feeling.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels so super clean.</li>
            <li> It is a good product to maintain the whiteness of your teeth form daily tea and coffee discoloration.</li>
            <li> Just brush gently, and be patient, and you will love the results.</li>
            <li> I myself will continue using this product since I am a true believer in it.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of this kit from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me to have whiter teeth and better gum health.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would really work</li>
            <li> it says six weeks for full results</li>
            <li> It has a minty taste that I loved, but the gritty polish took awhile  to get used to</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this product for testing courtesy of Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> what I’m sure you really want to know about is the results.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free and pleased with overall how it worked.  </li>
            <li> but was starting to whiten good</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not in the minority here when I admit that I don&#x27;t ALWAYS brush for a full 2 minutes 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li> I brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call myself the pickiest person when it comes to toothpaste, but I do want it to keep my teeth white and do a good job, of course.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product for those days in between your regular visits to the hygienist.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for allowing me to sample this product for free!</li>
            <li> I did use it for two weeks to get the full effects.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super clean and whiter than ever before.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely used my fair share of whitening products.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t mind the taste and it helps me brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I also use the whitestrips, but I&#x27;m loving the toothpaste, because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The taste is not bad but there could be improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Not Bad</li>
            <li> My theeth are not badly stained though</li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Brushing for two minutes isn&#x27;t too hard, but if you are a quick brusher then this might not be the best product for you.</li>
            <li> The first step makes my teeth feel SUPER clean, and it lasts!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take any extra time out of your day and my teeth feel super clean and look amazing.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I had high hopes for this product and was really excited to try it</li>
            <li> I adapted easily and my teeth felt cleaner and more refreshed after both steps were complete.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my BzzAgent complimentary trial set  from Crest and BzzAgent and had to try it right away!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean all day - none of that fuzzy feeling that I have experienced with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I received the product free with BZZkit but cannot wait to purchase more for friends and family to have a professionally whiter smile!</li>
            <li> so I am aware of how easy it is to stain my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I used this product I immediately felt a deep clean feeling and a tingle of freshness but best of all I actually noticed that my teeth looked, dare</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast results!</li>
            <li> The deep cleansing toothpaste leaves your teeth and gums feeling clean and refreshed and the whitening finisher leaves your smile shining bright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a way to brighten my smile and this seemed easy ,quick and economical .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to brush with the first paste (spit but don&#x27;t rinse) and then brush with the whitener.</li>
            <li> Easy and really works!</li>
            <li> And its so easy and fast to use!  </li>
            <li> Sorry Crest, but still happy I was able to try it for free :)</li>
            <li> What I love the most is the lasting super clean feeling I have.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it and loved being able to talk about my personal trials!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> It left my teeth and mouth feeling especially clean, like it feels right after a cleaning at the dentist&lt;</li>
            <li> The system is super easy to use on a twice daily basis, tho, and I am happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity after using this product which was a surprise to me because I have experienced that with other teeth whitening brands.</li>
            <li> The tooth paste leaves your teeth feeling super clean then the second step for whitening just adds to the beautiful smile, it amazes me how much whiter my smile is in just 4 days of twice a day</li>
            <li> The minty freshness is great and there is very minimal after taste from the whitening portion.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to report that the added sensitivity was very minimal.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this product if only for the great clean healthy feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Voila, clean, fresh mouth and a whiter looking set of teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste itself isn&#x27;t overly minty but it leaves a fresh clean feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get that fresh, clean teeth feeling</li>
            <li> This toothpaste combo leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I also feel my teeth are clean and my breath is fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> teeth felt “fresh from the dentist” clean after two minutes, instead of 30 minutes in the dental hygienist chair.</li>
            <li> I found that this product helped my mouth feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> The 2 step system from Crest is convenient to use at home and works wonders for making one&#x27;s mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> After both steps, I found my mouth to feel completely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Although my mouth felt &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; (almost fresh from the dentist clean)</li>
            <li> After both steps, I found my mouth to feel completely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean after use and fresh mouth</li>
            <li> A quick google search suggested that both of those substances are included to help scrape plaque off your teeth.</li>
            <li> and I like quick results, both of which Crest has nailed with this system.&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li> It is literally an instant result that gets even better with more use and probably the fastest whitening product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s just me liking super duper minty breath.</li>
            <li> so Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System are the perfect products for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a non-smoker would see even more whitening, so I would definitely encourage folks to try it, they&#x27;ll like it!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results:  After using for about a month I don&#x27;t notice tremendous differences in the coloring of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for tremendous changes you won&#x27;t find it here.  </li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Brilliance daily cleansing and whitening system is a great product!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how white it does get your teeth in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> Also saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> but it is a quick process</li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent, I was able to try Crest 3D White for FREE!</li>
            <li> I received this Crest 3D White Brilliance Duo free in the mail from Bzzagent.com to try out and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The CREST 3D WHITE BRILLIANCE DAILY CLEANSING AND WHITENING System is absolutely awesome!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste combo definitely exceeded my expectations and I will be sure to buy some more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> When you clean your teeth with this product it feels strong like it is really working.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly this product worked.</li>
            <li> Since this product is replacing my daily tooth paste I am going to continue to try it and see if in 3 more weeks I have better results.</li>
            <li> I have been using my free Crest 3d white brilliance tooth paste and whitening gel from Buzzagent for just a couple of weeks and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> so luckily I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.  </li>
            <li> Can it totally remove many, many years of tea and cola stain?  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed this product and more than likely will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> While it works great, I just can&#x27;t justify spending this much on toothpaste on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I am a big coffee and soda drinker and was pleased that I was able to try this out and see what it could do for my darker stained teeth.</li>
            <li> (and he doesn&#x27;t notice much, lol!)This is a great product and one I&#x27;m definitely keeping in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I might be most pleased white</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different whitening toothpastes, gels, strips, lights to get rid of stubborn coffee stains.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Teeth feel super clean&lt;br /&gt;-Absolutely</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and not messy either.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it, but after 4 weeks of use, my teeth don&#x27;t look that much better.</li>
            <li> Usually whitening toothpaste keeps the whiteness going for a good while longer than regular toothpaste, but I found this to be absolutely the best whitening product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After using this the first time, I immediately noticed my teeth were squeaky clean and smooth just like a fresh polish from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this for some more time, but as of right now I am not seeing much change in color.</li>
            <li> I think if you were to use a product like white strips, this toothpaste system would be an easy way to keep up your brilliant white smile.</li>
            <li> , my teeth feel very clean and smooth, almost like I just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> However, after each brushing my teeth did feel very clean and smooth, almost like having had a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth in just a couple weeks use, and I began to notice a difference within the first couple of brushings.  </li>
            <li> I was leary at first but after using it for a week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> I will admit that for the price, the actual tube of toothpaste, which I tend to use more of, is on the smaller side, but with a sale or a coupon, this would be a great investment.</li>
            <li> Compared to other whitening toothpastes, I do think this two-step system is more effective in whitening and brightening my teeth.</li>
            <li> It should be more effective and easier than the other products I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The treatments seems to work better then normal whitening toothpaste, as I never see a difference with those.</li>
            <li> clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> really liked this whitening product better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If you really want a brighter smile and don&#x27;t mind gritty, overpowering toothpaste then its a great product because I did start to see results of its whitening power</li>
            <li> I got to try it for free thanks to Crest!  </li>
            <li> this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying the product for free thanks to Crest® and bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the taste and smell of the product and it cleaned really well!</li>
            <li> I got my first trial for free</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for the average customer.</li>
            <li> The first 3 days I noticed a difference on how light the marks were after using the Crest 3D.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning aspect of the product was much better than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but like my normal routine better.</li>
            <li> (I tried this product for free thanks to Crest!)</li>
            <li> I loved the feeling of my teeth having that just from the dentist feel and it lasted all day long.</li>
            <li> What I really liked about the toothpaste was how clean my mouth felt, even after waking up the next morning.</li>
            <li> Just 2 steps and 2 minutes and your mouth is fresh &amp; clean and your smile is whiter &amp; brighter.</li>
            <li> I liked the taste and it left my mouth feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li> I liked the clean feel I got when I ran my tongue over my teeth both the front and back.</li>
            <li> And while I personally wasn&#x27;t noticing significant whitening, I didn&#x27;t exactly have the most yellow teeth to begin with -- and my dental hygienist went out of her way to ask me if I&#x27;d ever whitened my teeth before, because they looked so great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using that toothpaste system consistently for 10 days both morning and night and feel like the product is a great toothpaste, gives a deep clean, makes my teeth stronger and also really whitens my smile.</li>
            <li> Not only did I love this product but it made my mouth feel so clean and energized!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a big fan of the 3D whitening toothpaste, so I was really excited when I received a free trial kit from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed using the new Crest two step system.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s where the magic happens so I live with it.</li>
            <li> I used a previous whitening system by crest, and experienced some pain while using the whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, fast and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> really like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Fast, Easy, Results.</li>
            <li> This is a simple 2 minute process that did a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Step 1 was a nice minty flavor that left my mouth tasting really fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Step two makes your breath super fresh and your teeth feel like they just had a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is so fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if I was seeing any whiting but after about 4 or 5 days of using this 3D Crest, my husband could even tell that yes my teeth are getting much whiter.</li>
            <li> The system is easy to use, much better than the whitening strips or trays, and as quick as regular tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> Not TV announcer white, but pretty good.</li>
            <li> The product was really easy to use and didn&#x27;t take much time to use.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of the Crest 3D White toothpastes and was delighted when I had the chance to try out this 2 step system.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D is easy, fast</li>
            <li> I loved how easy it was to use, and took so little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothpaste and whitener each had a different yet nice flavor and really made me feel that my teeth were as clean as if I were at the dentist getting a cleaning !</li>
            <li> I can see a major difference in the color of my teeth and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I waited to review to see if it really lived up to it&#x27;s name, and to my shock and excitement, it did!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I was first offered this campaign from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for 2 weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do in 2 more!</li>
            <li> It only got better from there!  </li>
            <li> Just after the first day I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> I have noticed results after the first week and have not had to stop drinking coffee!</li>
            <li> WHITENS FROM THE FIRST DAY!</li>
            <li> AND IT WHITENED FROM THE FIRST DAY!</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!!</li>
            <li> At first I was excited about the results I saw on Day one.</li>
            <li> Seemed pretty simple to use for best results use twice a day and each bottle for only one minute each.  </li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference of whiter teeth the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> and I say this because with brushing twice a day, my teeth feel smooth and free of plaque pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I have always big a Crest fan, now I like them even more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more when it&#x27;s gone!)</li>
            <li> The second step is the polisher and this used in conjunction with a power brush is where the magic happens!</li>
            <li> 2 steps in my opinion are not necessary when their clinical toothpaste does whitening too plus much much more!</li>
            <li> I would not believe the difference it made after just the first time of using it!</li>
            <li> To time one minute doing the first step and then not rinsing (ICK!)</li>
            <li> I loved that it cleaned my teeth and the first few days were ok</li>
            <li> The second step is the polisher and this used in conjunction with a power brush is where the magic happens!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner after I get done brushing then with any other kind of toothpaste and they look a lot whiter, too!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more when this runs out!  </li>
            <li> but I definitely noticed a change in my pearly whites for the better after using the product ffor a week or so - even my kids noticed!  </li>
            <li> This new product is completely different and has a great minty taste.</li>
            <li> The directions on the back are very user friendly!!!</li>
            <li> Naturally I said yes since I&#x27;m very comfortable with the brand.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent member, I was able to try this new product free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look black light white, but that&#x27;s probably for the best.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this system because it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require lots of extra effort, but still provides great results.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use, your mouth feels sqeaky clean, and already a shade whiter.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free and I have to say that I love it.  </li>
            <li> felt really clean with the first step.  </li>
            <li> all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself is really great, It takes about two minutes, the first tube is kind of gritty and the second tube that you use immediately after has a peroxide compound in it to really penetrate any stains.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity like I&#x27;ve experienced with other whiteneing products in the past.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than any other whitening treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried and it is so easy!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing with my normal toothpaste to use, but my teeth felt smooth and clean all day</li>
            <li> I feel that this stuff is only good until a certain extent of whiteness.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a pleasant peppermint flavor, and the combination of the two products together cleaned my teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li> It really truly does work for whitening and my breath is super fresh!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Crest® and BzzAgent.  </li>

            <li> I received this for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I am trying this product free thanks to crest but this in no way swayed how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> tried this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I did get to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth my teeth feel</li>
            <li> This two step daily cleansing and whitening system is a product that does seem to be effective at whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive this through BzzAgent and was able to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was picked to get a free sample of Crest 3D white brilliance from Crest via BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> however, temporary discomfort is worth getting these kinds of results.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I brush longer and better because I am following the detailed instructions for the two-step process.</li>
            <li> and I do think I notice a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> I am loving the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System that I received from BZZAgent for review.</li>
            <li> The results make it worth it, and I&#x27;ve just tried to avoid getting step 2 on my tongue to alleviate the taste.</li>
            <li> so I have plenty of damage to fix, but I belive if I stick with this product after I finish the bottles and continue on it on my own, I will have a whiter and younger</li>
            <li> am diet cola addict, so I definitely depend on a whitener to keep my teeth looking nice.  </li>
            <li> However, I have a cracked tooth and the peroxide has found its way to the most sensitive part of that tooth.</li>
            <li> #34;bubble up&amp;#34; like traditional toothpaste so even though I knew the toothpaste was effective, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fee&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my teeth feel smooth and not gritty.</li>
            <li> I am super OCD when it comes to making sure my teeth are clean and white.</li>
            <li> Made me feel like I had a youthful smile</li>
            <li> it also makes your teeth sensitive, so i would probably use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks Crest and Bzzagent for this free sample!</li>
            <li> The more, eh, intense dentist&#x27;s product had created so much sensitivity in my teeth that I thought I was feeling disheartened and pessimistic about whitening products.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive teeth but would love to find a whitening product I can use.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if I could just use one tube and get the same results.</li>
            <li> My breath is fresh and my teeth are noticeably whiter after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My smile can use all the help it can get and this works.</li>
            <li> Just brush your teeth for one minute with each product and in five days, a brighter and healthier smile.</li>
            <li> I liked this simple to incorporate two step system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Clean, Fresh mouth&lt;</li>
            <li> my own - based on my personal experience using this</li>
            <li> After only using it for about a week, I was getting compliments on how nice my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> I found this system tastes a lot better than the (HD) system, so it actually made the whole experience a lot more pleasurable.</li>
            <li> personally love my teas during the day and red wine in the evening and was hoping this would be a good solution to keep my teeth white.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure because ice never had a professional polish, but I can say at it does work.</li>
            <li> Generally, I liked the Crest 3D White product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the system for over 4 weeks now with success.</li>
            <li> I liked that I could whiten my teeth without adding extra steps to my routine.</li>
            <li> My breath also stays fresh for longer.</li>
            <li> some days are better than others - and out of about 10 uses, I&#x27;d say this product made my teeth feel sensitive about 2 or 3 of those.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feeling the products left in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried this Crest 3D White product and it made me feel like I was doing something nice for myself.</li>
            <li> I think with continued use it&#x27;ll keep making my smile brighter.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzReport, I received a free sample of Crest 3D White Brilliant Daily Cleansing and Whitening System.</li>
            <li> However, my gums were a bit sensitive after using it for that many days.</li>
            <li> though the pain to get there may not have been worth it...</li>
            <li> I liked the taste and zingy feeling in my mouth when I used the Crest 3D White.</li>
            <li> But it defiinitely leaves a fresh breath feel.</li>
            <li> After realizing this I started to brush more lightly and for no longer than a minute which is plenty of enough time.</li>
            <li> two was nice because it cleaned off all of that gritty toothpaste from step one.</li>
            <li> so maybe there is just too much staining on my teeth already for the product to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a difference in the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li> Most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t give me the results I want, and bleaching gels make my teeth so sensitive that I have to stop using them before they even have a chance to work.</li>
            <li> I was able to try 3D White for free.  </li>
            <li> My parents even asked if I had gone for a cleaning because my teeth looked so fresh.</li>
            <li> To be honest my teeth are naturally very white.  </li>
            <li> But, I’m a self-professed fresh breath junkie</li>
            <li> and my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> and I get compliments all the time on my smile.</li>
            <li> and I have started showing my smile again.</li>
            <li> and I can see a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> However it did not give me that fresh feeling you get after you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> product took some getting used to, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> liked the product and overall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking to brighten your teeth a bit and don&#x27;t like the strips.</li>
            <li> I was also hoping for a noticeably whiter smile, but I&#x27;m not convinced it showed up yet.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product at no cost and thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li> the whitening paste tastes a bit like hydrogen peroxide - this didn&#x27;t really bother me too much either as I didn&#x27;t find the hydrogen peroxide taste overwhelming.</li>
            <li> my teeth haven’t been as white as I would have liked before using this system.  </li>
            <li> My smile is brighter and my teeth shine.</li>
            <li> I found my teeth and gums to be more sensitive with use.</li>
            <li> With just those two point, it makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> After Day 3, I could tell that my smile was brighter.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brighter smile but didn&#x27;t want to pay for anything too costly.  </li>
            <li> My mouth didn&#x27;t feel fresh or minty when I was done brushing.</li>
            <li> Overall, really liked it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth were feeling more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and</li>
            <li> Definitely a worth while purchase and</li>
            <li> This two step daily cleansing and whitening system is a product that does seem to be effective at whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes this product nice is the fact I don&#x27;t have to use it daily for it to work.</li>
            <li> It will be well worth your time and effort</li>
            <li> I hoped for a whiter smile, but my teeth may just need stronger whitening ingredients</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the polishing effect of step 1, but wished it made my mouth feel cleaner and refreshed</li>
            <li> My smile is noticeably brighter ever since I&#x27;ve been using the system even when I drink coffee.</li>
            <li> It does leave my mouth feeling fresh, and I like that it encourages me to brush for the dentist-recommended amount of time (2 minutes).</li>
            <li> My teeth felt super clean all day after using this system, and I could see a bit of a change from the very start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System for free and I&#x27;m in love with the results.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it anyways, because I like how fresh my mouth feels.&lt;br /&gt;**i</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the results.  </li>
            <li> Although I prefer a mintier taste for step 1, my mouth feels fresh after I use this product.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is that it enables me to whiten all of my teeth and just not a few that strips cover.</li>
            <li> I was always unsure about smiling and showing my teeth but with the crest 3d whitening toothpaste I am not afraid to show off my smile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much faster than whitening strips taking only 2 minutes to get awesome white teeth.</li>
            <li> You can decide if the cosmetic results are worth the damage; for me, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could notice a difference within a weeks time that I had a brighter, lighter smile.</li>
            <li> Over all the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a noticeably whiter smile after just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realized that they were helping whiten my teeth and keep them fresh.</li>
            <li> the fresh taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This step honestly makes me feel like I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to brighten your smile.</li>
            <li> I feel my teeth are fairly white on their own; I try to stay away from drinks that will stain my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of receiving Crest 3D White Brilliance System as part of my honest feedback from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I am used to the fresh tasting mint flavors of crest</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fresh from the dentist.</li>
            <li> results.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a complimentary sample of this, by Crest and Bzzagent</li>
            <li> I do believe I noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> positive things about this product is that it made my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and although it does take more work than a regular toothpaste, it is diffenantly worth the try, as this is not expensive as in a dental office for whitening.</li>
            <li> It is a great maintenance product for those that have previously whitened their teeth and would like to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on many positive reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li> I have had a very positive experience with the product.</li>
            <li> This product provides quick, easy results and has given my teeth a whole new level of clean.</li>
            <li> really love the clean feeling you get in your mouth after using this product, it is so easy to use and not at all time consuming like other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this as I had been wanting to get my teeth whitened professionally for a while now but hadn&#x27;t had the time to do so.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say I recommend it for whitening because of my experience, but I will certainly recommend it for clean, fresh teeth.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the way it worked, but after using Crest 3D White my mouth and teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean and fresh as it did when I used Crest 3D White -</li>
            <li> I loved how clean my mouth felt and my teeth were a little whiter but</li>
            <li> The whitening polish left my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> i like that this is easy to use because you can just replace your normal toothpaste with this 2 step process.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use, Step 1 is a normal toothpaste</li>
            <li> My husband is even excited about using it and asked to make sure it is on the next grocery run.</li>
            <li> Does it whiten better than the original Crest 3D white toothpaste?</li>
            <li> about one shade whiter, which for me is great since other products have never seemed to really work with all of the hassle that you go through.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and while I did have some burning and irritation to my gums, that was normal.</li>
            <li> The brushing easily fits into a normal routine.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> and i certainly leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Achieving a whiter smile in two easy, refreshing and love that smile steps is possible, with the addition of Crest 3D White to your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> first step is the toothpaste, it does not have the super minty taste of most toothpaste, but it definitely makes your teeth feel clean, you do not rinse after, which takes some getting used to...</li>
            <li> Not the best tasting toothpaste, especially step 2 which is easily recognizable for the peroxide that it is, but much easier and quicker than white strips and at ~$12</li>
            <li> This 3D White Brilliance, by contrast, provides excellent whitening, in much less time, with a better freshness and great taste, and I have not experienced any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> less than super bright teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing white in areas I did not expect and my teeth continue to feel clean through most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I love how clean my mouth feels after using step one (The deep cleansing paste)</li>
            <li> This product really helped to make my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Omg i love crest 3D daily it leaves my mouth feeling so minty clean.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a very strong minty taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh for several hours and the whitening polish tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I used to much and my teeth felt kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a promotion through BzzAgent (great website) and as an avid coffee drinker and, now, ex-smoker I have always wanted whiter teeth and this helped a little.</li>
            <li> The price compared to other whitening products is also really good.</li>
            <li> At first i was not too sure of having to use a combination of 2 products but after using it for a week i saw results, It really works and its not so much fuss as it gets to become part of your brushing routine.</li>
            <li> The deep cleansing tooth paste is more abrasive than most normal toothpastes and people, including myself, have a tendency to brush too</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said the taste was disagreeable because of the sweetener, however I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> mouth stay pretty fresh for hours&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely effective in not only whitening but the protection of tooth enamel and gums</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for fast and satisfying results!!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I believe the product works well, since I noticed a difference almost right away.</li>
            <li> right...</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, that seems counterproductive.  </li>
            <li> After brushing with Step One you are supposed to spit, and start Step Two right away.  </li>
            <li> although, I would recommend not eating or drinking right after using the product&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> If I brush right after coffee or food,  I will see the color of the drink or food come off my teeth into what I spit into the sink.</li>
            <li> and then you go right into Step 2 (no rinsing) which is the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> This seemed like it was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> yeah right?</li>
            <li> I could not wait to get this product for being a bzzagent, #freestuff, I started using this right</li>
            <li> right I thought two min for whiter teeth right.</li>
            <li> The flavor is just right - not too minty and not to mild.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> That just doesn&#x27;t feel right to me.</li>
            <li> have really enjoyed the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System and am loving my new whiter, brighter smile!!</li>
            <li> I liked this better than the Crest Pro-Health stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Step 1, the minty cleaning toothpaste really leaves your mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I had no adverse reactions, and my mouth felt clean after using this 2 step product, but I was really hoping for noticeably whiter brighter</li>
            <li> So have to confess, after the initial week, I tried using my own toothpaste first</li>
            <li> It did clean my teeth really well, but I was hoping to notice a difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Even after eating my mouth still feels clean thanks to this system.</li>
            <li> Aside from those benefits though, it didn&#x27;t really leave my mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li> flavor of the blue toothpaste I used when I was a kid, and the gel has more of a cool mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I liked after spitting out the first paste how you can see what it is actually taking off your teeth.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference and it leaves your mouth feeling so clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth feels very refreshed and clean after every use.</li>
            <li> I really felt the difference in the two products and felt like my teeth were so clean when I was done using it.</li>
            <li> My first impression of the product was that I really liked the packaging (packaging is a big factor in my purchase).</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and instant results.  </li>
            <li> Very easy and did not add any extra time to my routine.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use; and did make a big difference in brightening my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Instructions are very clear and easy.</li>
            <li> receiving the box i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to open and excited  that the bottom portion of the box was recyclable  :)</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this new two step system.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White is hands down the best you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> As a Crest fan, I have used Crest’s other 2-step whitening system before (Crest ProHealth HD), and I liked the results as well as the squeaky clean feeling it gave my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest, and I could tell a difference after the first week, it wasn&#x27;t super noticeable but to me it was a big improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks now and am happy to say I&#x27;ve actually been able to notice a brighter whiter smile.</li>
            <li> /polish your teeth for a professional clean feeling!</li>
            <li> As a strips user before, I love that being able to brush on the polish really allows you to get into the cracks between teeth as well as the far back teeth so that the whiter smile looks more natural and consistent throughout!</li>
            <li> but hey you have to work hard to look beautiful</li>
            <li> I was lucky and got to tryCrest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System free from bzzagent!  </li>
            <li> I was so lucky to of received this product for free from BzzAgent and was really excited to try it since I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker.  </li>
            <li> I have been extremely impressed with Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System thus far.</li>
            <li> I received the kit complimentary from BzzAgent and Crest and have been singing its praises since the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li> I received this full size product to try thanks to Creat and Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> Worth using because it does really work!</li>
            <li> In addition the taste and smell was not the best, it kind left you with a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the toothpastes I’ve used have not made much difference in the shade of my teeth, and the whitestrips, while effective, hurt my sensitive gums and the process was very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get a full star rating because I really felt the tubes were a downside.</li>
            <li> I was able to use 3D white pain free and it really whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My smile was whiter and brighter after the first use.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity of testing a full size sample of this product thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> As did not have any problems with my teeth becoming sensitive after using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the strips as I don&#x27;t usually have time to do those during the day, and since I&#x27;m already there brushing,</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used Crest 3D Whitestrips and those worked great, but they were so unnatural for me.</li>
            <li> I use a pretty powerful electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; Pleasant Experience but no Significant Whitening</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as effective as white strips, but good for slight improvement and maintaining your pearly whites!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to continue using this and find out if this is my new HG product for my teeth!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to join this campaign to test out this new whitening system!</li>
            <li> It also made my mouth feel fresh and clean longer normal.</li>
            <li> As a mom, it can be hard to even find time to do the most basic necessities of cleanliness, so I am happy to have this product so that I don&#x27;t need to add anything more to my already busy day!</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t feel like it makes my mouth feel as minty fresh as normal toothpaste, but I do like how completely clean my teeth feel after I use it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend checking this system out especially if you want a super clean feeling and better looking mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a coffee loving, red wine drinking, smoker I&#x27;ll take any whitening I can get, and I certainly get it with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This power couple totally works and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> The of taste of the toothpaste (step 1) is very mild and actually enjoyed it compare to other toothpaste</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the step one toothpaste had a pretty good flavor, unlike the other system I had tried.</li>
            <li> and I rinse my mouth out right after the first step.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly encouraged me to brush longer!</li>
            <li> Step 2 tastes a little more like normal toothpaste, and both together leave your mouth feeling super super clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> The amazing part is that they last like that the whole day, no lie.</li>
            <li> The two step paste system was easy to use, and clearly explained on the package.</li>
            <li> Before getting this product I would have liked to know about the dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I received the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from BzzAgent (free from Crest) to try out for free and review.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s worth getting for simple ease of use and time efficiency.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this I was using a baking soda based toothpaste for the last 5+ years, which has helped me maintain my smile without using teeth whitening strips more than once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 Step System for free from BzzAgent to test out.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh feeling my mouth was left with!</li>
            <li> Fresh breath and white teeth for an affordable price, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System works great.</li>
            <li> I got a few comments about my smile being bright</li>
            <li> I got it for free in a trial thanks to Crest and am already buying my second round because it really works that great!</li>
            <li> and I overall was happy with results, which in my mind is ultimately what matters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though a bit more work using the 2-step system, I think the end result is worth the extra bit of effort.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> After brushing with this system my teeth definitely felt smooth and free of plaque, which lasted throughout the day even after eating.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I didn&#x27;t get movie star white teeth, but I did improve my smile.</li>
            <li> Ease of use is paramount, this product surprised me because it did work, and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Loved this product; simple and efficient way to get my teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li> I really liked the clean, polished feeling this left me with; like coming home from a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is super affordable and I got fast results.</li>
            <li> but I just wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work well enough to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest® and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember I have noticed that people seem to have a fixation with the appearance of their teeth.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first abut the 2 step process with this system, however, I think it is well worth the extra step.  </li>
            <li> I have not been the most consistent with using them day and night, but in just a week I&#x27;m already starting to notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> the first is a deep cleansing regular toothpaste that tastes great</li>
            <li> The first tube you use has a gritty feel to it and does a great job at cleaning your teeth, the second tube is like a silky gel that glides over your teeth.  </li>
            <li> two weeks later after consistently using the product I photographed my smile in my bathroom and found that my teeth looked more stained</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean all day long and the whitener has turned my pretty smile into a fabulous smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results I am seeing by using at night with my normal Crest toothpaste in the mornings, and I like that this is easier and less time consuming than the whitening strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - but my teeth did not whiten very much.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, with that being said, I have really enjoyed using the product so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to test out the Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and fresh as well because it is an actual toothpaste and not just a whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> Brushing with the deep cleansing paste leaves my teeth very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the crest 3d white free through buzz agent.</li>
            <li> It tastes fine to me, with no harsh chemical taste.</li>
            <li> The whitening part was fine, I had no trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try this whitening product thanks to crest.  </li>
            <li> After following this easy 2 step and wow, I love the results routine for two weeks I find I am flashing the pearly whites with confidence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall if you are a busy person who wants to have a whiter smile, this is an easy and pretty affective</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new tooth whitening paste.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited as I have wanted to try a new whitening product.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new teeth whitening product and was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Running my tongue over my teeth, they feel so smooth and clean and looking in the mirror - SO WHITE!</li>
            <li> but my teeth definitely feel consistently clean and smooth without plaque.</li>
            <li> I really feel this toothpaste gives my teeth that straight from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Step 1 really left my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> This combination (easy and quick) is key for me.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s 2 steps total) and is really quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Packaging was super easy to open and didn&#x27;t give me a workout.</li>
            <li> I am loving the clean, fresh feeling of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re really looking for a good clean, some pearly whites, and don&#x27;t mind paying extra for that, the product definitely does work.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it to find it refreshingly minty fresh tasting and leaving my teeth exceptionally clean feeling after only one use of step 1 of the two step system.</li>
            <li> Several shades whiter on my teeth makes me very ready for attending my best friend&#x27;s wedding in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Step one - the daily cleanser has a lovely sparkly pearl white color and the flavor is appealing.</li>
            <li> My smile thanks you as well.</li>
            <li> Other than that I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I think with continued use this product would have a lot of benefits, much more than a traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had a better taste.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s just two minutes total</li>
            <li> I would say over all I like Crest 3D I will for sure be buying it as an alternate system to whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee and tea drinker</li>
            <li> I think this product would definitely help most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> This product is one of the first</li>
            <li> This product is a lot better that Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> After the first use I could tell a difference and</li>
            <li> keeps away more yellowing but didnt quite get it all the way to shiny white.</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I have always used Crest whitening products since the first whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I did notice whiter teeth after the first week of use</li>
            <li> I found that using the 2-step process sometimes was more work than I wanted to put in, especially in the morning rush.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I think this actually worked better than the dentist polishing I go through twice a year.</li>
            <li> I did not mind the two step process at first.</li>
            <li> I think that my dentist needs to be consulted before I decide to use a hydrogen peroxide treatment daily as I don’t know what that chemical does to healthy bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for allowing me to try this product!  </li>
            <li> first step in the two part system, the toothpaste comes with a warning that the fluoride may cause staining.  </li>
            <li> I personally love crest toothpaste, but normally only gel.</li>
            <li> I used this item twice a day for as long as I could, but starting day 2 I experienced discomfort while using this product.</li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee drinker</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it enough to even see if it would whiten my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a whitening product as I have always been concerned about damage to my teeth, caused by the whitening ingredients.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product I read the instructions and the warning printed on the package to watch out for irritation and discomfort from using the product.</li>
            <li> I have only one thing to say and that is you will love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for inexpensive ways to whiten my teeth, but there is so much out there!  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product before it came out and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> As an avid coffee and tea drinker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% confident I&#x27;ll actually pay for another set when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> First-</li>
            <li> After just the first brushing, my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li> The whitening paste has a bit of a funny, chemical taste to it</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the Crest 3D White system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a very different experience using two products as most of us are used to one toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Way better than white stripes!</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> My husband and I had many stains and after only a week we could see quite a difference in our smiles</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for letting me be your guinea pig!</li>
            <li> This is the first toothpaste I have found that makes me say that.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> my reasons for most likely not purchasing this product in the future:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> me, the cost of the system prohibitive - around $25 for toothpaste that frankly won&#x27;t last more than a month is a lot to spend on toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say it was worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> The first step (tube 1) is cleansing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the minty fresh flavor of the toothpaste which lasts long after brushing.</li>
            <li> After the first week my spouse started to notice it</li>
            <li> As a coffee and red wine lover, I have tried many teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> not 100% sure if I am supposed to finish the entire contents before ending treatment?  </li>
            <li> I would definitely use this again, not as my standard toothpaste, but every so month for maintenance to keep my smile looking bright and sparkly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would actually see a difference in my teeth</li>
            <li> You definitely cannot skip step 2, skipping step 2 mades my teeth feel porous and possibly more prone to stains.</li>
            <li> (as at this point, if you&#x27;re competent enough to whiten your teeth, I doubt it&#x27;s necessary to explain how to brush them), but in this case, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a tad bit more detail as to prevent excess or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> our first teeth come in</li>
            <li> I used my first whitening strips when i was in the fifth grade and have found whitening pens in my stocking on Christmas morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the first step as I would any toothpaste, and that it what it feels like.</li>
            <li> It goes on similar to the toothpaste but seems somehow more liquidy.</li>
            <li> Like most toothpastes I believe that crest was likely going for a mint flavor, and because I do not like he taste of mint, this could be the reason the taste bothered me.</li>
            <li> Most mint lovers would probably not have a problem with the taste, but that is my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed results within a week of consistent brushing.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days after I tried the product, my gums seemed to be sore and almost felt like they were cut or burnt.</li>

            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> Being able to particularly address these areas (previously damaged by antibiotic treatment) did produce some results that even the dentist had not been able to achieve.</li>
            <li> The first paste feels like it dries my mouth out when using it</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I do run out.</li>
            <li> I think this product would work great for people who are regular coffee or tea drinkers or who have minor surface discoloration, but I guess I don&#x27;t have surface stains.  </li>
            <li> This 2 step system at first seemed like a bother to me</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use for a few days, my teeth aren&#x27;t as bright.</li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This time I tried it for 2 weeks, for the first week I used it twice a day as directed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the invite buzz agent!</li>
            <li> but my teeth feel better with this system than with just a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> first I had to get used to the two steps but after using it for a couple of days</li>
            <li> Like after going to the dentist when you have your teeth cleaned, stains and discolorations on my teeth are fading and they look a lot more white.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The whitening step two has a different taste but not terrible.  </li>

            <li> is not my first time using whitening toothpaste, however it is my first time using a whitening treatments.</li>

            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> At first I could see a brightness but they didn&#x27;t seem whiter.</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> Overall we are completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me remove coffee stains from my teeth and brightened my smile</li>
            <li> I found these products to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Plus, since you&#x27;re brushing and I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re doing that twice a day, you&#x27;re being consistent with your whitening routine.</li>
            <li> For me, the hardest part about using products like whitening strips is to keep consistently using the product to obtain results.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could not believe the stains it removed.</li>
            <li> The first tube (cleansing toothpaste) is purple and the directions say to brush with this paste for one minute, spit, but DO NOT rinse.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for it because it is written on the packaging as something to be aware of</li>
            <li> Now the real question!  </li>
            <li> I really like this!  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is this system takes 2 minutes</li>
            <li> First you brush with the included tooth paste for one minute.</li>
            <li> My first day of use, Step 1 felt like I was brushing my teeth with sand paper,  my gums started to bleed after Step 2.</li>
            <li> So if you are committed to using this product it really works!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> But it makes me teeth feel exactly like they do after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I am now a true believer and will definitely keep buying this product once my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I only use it at night when I have more time.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a product that works!</li>
            <li> It really did whiten!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>

            <li> I feel as if my teeth received a better overall cleaning than before I started using the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using Crest 3-D White toothpaste and whitener.</li>
            <li> They felt exactly like they do after a dental cleaning</li>
            <li> I felt like after 3 weeks my teeth actually looked better than after the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I think this worked better than crest white strips.</li>
            <li> You brush your teeth with the first part, which is the cleansing part, and then spit it out.</li>
            <li> Even if the texture wasn&#x27;t awfully gritty, I don&#x27;t think I would be able to accept the taste of this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they really were lighter!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give myself consistent time with this product before reviewing it.</li>
            <li> well I brush with the first paste (paste number1)</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I could rinse after Step 1!</li>
            <li> but I can only say that it was OK.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that you try this product because it won&#x27;t make your teeth any more yellow that they are!</li>
            <li> He is an occasional smoker so his teeth are more dis colored than mine.</li>
            <li> While I may not be able to definitively say my teeth look whiter, I can say they definitely feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth paste but at the same time, the two step part isn&#x27;t the most convenient.</li>
            <li> want to start off by saying that I have tried several at home teeth whitening systems and have never been completely satisfied.  </li>

            <li> I love the fact that you break up your time brushing your teeth with two different steps.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel healthier and a bit more white.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I used Crest 3D for the first time, I had to ask myself, &amp;#34;Did</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this product when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the brush time or the taste after the first use.</li>
            <li> the two part process is more than I would incorporate daily; I didn&#x27;t like the taste of either</li>
            <li> I love this kit, and definitely will be purchasing when this one is done, I really do think it works well at whitening, and brightening my smile.</li>
            <li> I panicked and thought I&#x27;d discontinue use for sure, but then later when I was driving to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to my teeth &amp; which products I use on them</li>
            <li> I would probably not use this product on a regular basis because of the sensitivity issues, but it might be okay for use along with a sensitivity toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed the refreshing feeling in my mouth following the daily cleansing system.</li>
            <li> This product makes a real difference on your mouth feeling fresh and whiter teeth.  </li>

            <li> Crest 3D White duo really helped me to smile more</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product my first thoughts were &#x27;what a pain this is going to be&#x27;.</li>

            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> On the first day of use I could tell that my teeth felt ultra-smooth and polished.</li>
            <li> My hygienist&#x27;s first comment was &amp;#34;Wow</li>
            <li> While the HD system is similar, I received amazingly better results with the 3D Brilliance System.</li>
            <li> I found the first step to be tolerable.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I believe the 3D Brilliance kit is an excellent kit and has the same if not better results than whitening strips or an office whitening system.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a two step process, first you brush with a paste followed by a whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any more whitening effect than when I was using the regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My canines are a bit more yellow than the rest of my teeth</li>
            <li> First, you brush with step 1.  </li>
            <li> Step one - the daily cleanser has a lovely sparkly pearl white color and the flavor is appealing.</li>
            <li> My smile thanks you as well.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for the first week</li>
            <li> and it REALLY DRIES your lips out!  </li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel and are noticeably cleaner, the two step process definitely makes my teeth cleaner and more</li>
            <li> One would definitely have to weigh the added steps with the benefits :)</li>
            <li> The color and look of the paste is pretty</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this Crest 3D White two step system.</li>
            <li> but once I did I was ready to get started!</li>
            <li> and I really did not notice a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> Unless you are willing to be in pain.</li>
            <li> While the first step does its job</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System through BzzAgent, and I am so glad I got to.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> However I follow the directions exactly, step 1 brush for 1 minute spit but don&#x27;t rinse then do step 2, and my teeth are not any whiter.</li>
            <li> I have always preferred Colgate toothpaste over Crest because I feel that overall Colgate has a more minty flavor which I like.  </li>
            <li> I was told to only use the product once a day and use a fluoride treatment once a day to make sure my sensitivity went down.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Step 2 burns a bit at first, but I got used to it after a couple of days use.</li>

            <li> Cleans and polishes really well!</li>
            <li> The taste was too hot for my liking.</li>

            <li> I love how well the deep cleansing toothpaste cleans.  </li>
            <li> also pretty put off by the cost.  </li>
            <li> Took a picture the first day and have compared it to now.</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I love how well the deep cleansing toothpaste cleans.</li>
            <li> I spend two minutes with each because I want to make sure all my teeth are cleaned properly but that then doubles my brushing time.</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say my teeth are blindingly white now, but they do look better.</li>
            <li> I also feel like the product helped prevent more stains from my constant coffee drinking.</li>
            <li> This is an old-school method of whitening because it essentially buffs away the stains...taking precious enamel with it.</li>
            <li> whitening gel in step two is nothing more than a peroxide-based gel on steroids; you should probably not actually brush with this.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive teeth, but want a nice white smile like everyone else....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold;).</li>
            <li> I love Crest 3D White Brilliance!  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to many people already and definitely think you should give it a try!</li>
            <li> I like this much better than the white strips.  </li>

            <li> I really enjoyed trying Crest 3D white.</li>
            <li> However, I can confidently say that I have definitely seen whiter teeth after using this for a month.</li>

            <li> I noticed a difference within the first five days.</li>
            <li> Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> Too much on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I love how white you can automatically see my teeth are after the usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> After the first use, began to see an improvement.</li>
            <li> AFTER JUST A FEW USES, I COULD SEE A GOOD IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> might as well make it just a few seconds longer for the good outcome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal but perhaps both products can be combined and still get good</li>
            <li> I found that my teeth felt extremely clean, more so than any other toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love my daily coffee and noticed this cleansing kit working right away thanks to the dual step system.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Crest and BzzAgent, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Go for it, its definitely worth the time, money and your new smile.</li>
            <li> As you are only brushing with this new system, I did not think it could possibly be as effective as WhiteStrips, but I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from Crest.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Crest and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> The two step process was easy to complete each day and it really freshens up your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While my teeth felt clean, I don&#x27;t feel like my entire mouth/breath was clean after using.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent, and have been using it for about a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the white strips and other brands by far Crest 3D is the best!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out how well this system works and that it was safe for my very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you right now - it is very wierd when you use the whitening part by itself</li>
            <li> - it has a bit of texture to scrub the teeth nice and clean without being overly coarse or gritty.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased by the long lasting clean feel as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System does effectively keep my teeth clean throughout the day -</li>
            <li> This is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried that says visibly whitens and ACTUALLY shows a significant difference!</li>
            <li> My teeth felt &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and much whiter than normal</li>
            <li> My only complain is that the toothpaste is incredibly minty, like so minty it burns a little bit.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because there aren&#x27;t many whitening toothpastes that taste good.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it every day because I have sensitive teeth, but when I wanted to whiten up my smile, I used it!</li>
            <li> I have had many great experiences with the Crest brand in the past, and this new product is no different!</li>
            <li> I most definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth any more money than any other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product I was using two different kinds of toothpaste applied to my toothbrush at the same time and the results are very good (much better than the Crest 3D White.)</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, The smell was pleasant, unlike other competitors.</li>
            <li> of my favorite parts was the foaming action because that gets deep down into the crevices that whitening strips could never reach and the micro cleansers polish away stains and leave my mouth feeling very fresh and clean, with clean fresh breath.</li>
            <li> When I think &amp;#34;3D White&amp;#34; I think of something that will be very obvious, a bright white.</li>
            <li> It may not be as quick or quite as perfectly white as a professional job, but it&#x27;s HUGE and still working!</li>
            <li> What I found to be really great about this particular whitener, is that it doesn&#x27;t stray me from my daily routine or add any extra time to getting ready.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product was simple and easy to use and didn&#x27;t take any more time</li>
            <li> This system is as easy as brushing your teeth, and provides even better results than more tedious options.</li>
            <li> My teeth are relatively white with few stains anyway, so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change with this product, but they did appear shiny and felt nice and clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you can get your teeth clean and whiten them at the same time in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I did start using it a few weeks after I finished my box of 3D Crest Professional Effects strips (best ever), but I could tell that it kept stains at bay and made sure my teeth were extra white.</li>
            <li> I have tried and used whitening systems in the past that have been pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not the same fast results as with the strips</li>
            <li> I have had my fair share of whitening products (especially after having braces back in the day).</li>
            <li> but I felt like my teeth were more sensitive to eating when not using this toothpaste instead of a sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was only using the system once a day since it seemed to irritate my gums, but since I&#x27;ve started brushing more gently</li>
            <li> Getting used to a 2 step process takes some time, but the system doesn’t really take up much more time than a traditional 2 minute brush.  </li>
            <li> Crest 3D White is overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a good difference when I switched to using this over Crest&#x27;s regular extra whitening paste, and think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while.</li>
            <li> now I have really grown to like it and love the lasting effects it has made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the deep cleaning really works and I love that.</li>
            <li> It not only tastes good, but it actually whitens!</li>
            <li> The paste has a tiny amount of grit in it to make your teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> Once I tried it, I realized that it didn&#x27;t really change my routine at all, which made me much more open to using it.</li>
            <li> But most importantly, my teeth are noticeably whiter (maybe a few shades?).</li>
            <li> After the very first trial ( both steps), my mouth felt really clean, cleaner than it had since my last dentist visit and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Less is more!</li>
            <li> It left your teeth feeling almost dental visit clean!</li>
            <li> Definitely ended up with a clean pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Not only that but the paste left my mouth feeling minty fresh, crisp and very clean!</li>
            <li> Mouth felt like a &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27;s office&#x27; clean feeling after each use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and use a special toothpaste for that purpose, so I probably will not purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Imagine my delight when the Crest 3D White system gave me whiter teeth after the first usage and it was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had a positive experience using this product.</li>
            <li> If you use it as directed I am positive that you will also see results.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, an awesome site that allows consumers to try and review products so that you don&#x27;t have to waste money on the &amp;#34;highly marketed-brain-washed-advertising-to-buy-it&amp;#34; items; I can share with you the truth of the new 3D white Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li> I LOVE a white smile and have been a loyal customer to the Crest 3D White brand.</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results so far and have only been using the product for few weeks.</li>
            <li> First of all, I really like the two step process...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say that consistent use of the product has made my teeth any whiter</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re becoming white again.</li>
            <li> Its much more convenient than using whitestrips or gels to whiten your teeth, and it takes just as long as it takes you to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was excited about the concept of being able to just brush my teeth to whiten them without using any messy trays, etc.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I did feel a bit of tooth/gum sensitivity, which made me think that the whitening product might really be working.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t say on the package exactly how much of each tube to use on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One of my recent products I was able to review is the crest 3d brilliance daily cleaning for free.</li>
            <li> At first, when I started using this 2 step system I didn&#x27;t really think I would like it.</li>
            <li> So I was able to try crest 3D white brilliance daily cleansing and whiting system for free.</li>
            <li> My first impression of the toothpaste was that I tasted a hint of baking soda and the polish was very tingly in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the product at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would cause too much extra work in my normal routine.</li>
            <li> I the past I have tried whitening mouth washes, which weren&#x27;t too helpful and didn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li> The product tastes good and is not harsh like other whitening strips I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is especially true for someone who is lazy in their routine or rushed.</li>
            <li> This is true, you will notice that if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Overall an incredibly simple and effective way to whiten and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li> After you rinse and see the kind of sparkling teeth shining back at you, a big smile is all you can do.</li>
            <li> the illuminating complex makes them very bright and lustrous like no other toothpaste or whitening system has done for me before.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt clean and fresh every time I brushed.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White product made my teeth feel really clean, shiny, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for ways to keep my smile clean and white.</li>
            <li> It left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> The only downfall you still need to used toothpaste for a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of the product - it felt sort of &#x27;chalky&#x27; and I prefer a more traditional minty toothpaste flavor -</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty sensitive, so I am always hesitant to try new whitening products, but I got to try this for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> This caused sensitivity more on my gums than the teeth directly though, which was really only noticeable when rinsing right after brushing.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling a little grimy after so I ended up brushing with my own toothpaste first (adding an additional step).</li>
            <li> You can really feel it polishing and brightening your smile , I definitely recommend it for any one looking for a brighter, whiter smiler, even those with more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first Deep Cleansing toothpaste was a nice refreshing mint and seemed like the Crest toothpaste I usually use.</li>
            <li> My teeth FEEL clean when finished and are much whiter than with my previous routine, and that&#x27;s a good enough answer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for someone that wants a whiter brighter and even cleaner smile without having to spend a ton of money on products or at the dentist.</li>
            <li> But I guess a little change is better than nothing!</li>
            <li> So I think it might be better with a programmable or normal toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not THAT hard to turn it off and on, and it&#x27;s worth it for clean, white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Crest, for giving me a free sample!</li>
            <li> : The process was easy and relatively convenient.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how mild the toothpaste was</li>
            <li> Not only does it really whiten your teeth, but it also leaves your mouth feeling extremely fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Bzzagent sent me a free sample of Crest 3D White to test out - and from the first try I have been hooked.</li>
            <li> whitening gel is really easy to follow and make a daily habit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple with easy to understand directions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> It is easier in this regard, but the second step feels easy to skip or forget altogether.</li>
            <li> The fact that the polish does not open easily (one-handed), adds to the issue.</li>
            <li> It is such an easy system.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easy to do while you are brushing you are cleaning your teeth and whiten them at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee, tea, and wine regularly, and using normal toothpastes with whitening agents in them seems to do ok for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; of the whiteness of my teeth, but gradually by my 6 month cleaning there are some stains that need attention.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and find whitening strips to bother me</li>
            <li> With Crest 3D White it was as easy as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time more than your normal twice a day, two minute brushing.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy, especially once you get used to the routine.</li>
            <li> The first step paste made my teeth and mouth feel squeaky clean (though it did take my gums a couple of days to get used to the formula-I normally use toothpastes for sensitive teeth).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of whitening products, but they all make my front teeth super sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This product is simple and easy, it&#x27;s just brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth became super sensitive while using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So simple, easy to use, and time</li>
            <li> This is such an easy process....</li>
            <li> but I actually prefer the Diamond strong whitening paste &amp; mouthwash</li>
            <li> Also, did not like the after taste, had to rinse several times to get rid of the strong taste.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you give Crest 3D white a try.</li>
            <li> were becoming a little more sensitive</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was super excited because I had been looking for something that would actually work on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Pro: It may get me to brush for longer (certainly closer to the 2 minutes you are supposed to)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m certain that Step 1 changes the pH balance in the mouth.</li>
            <li> This is one time that I cannot wait to go to the dentist and show off my new pearly whites!!  </li>
            <li> What I liked most was that all my teeth and to the gum-line was whitened, whereas with the trays I was usually using, I was only whitening the bottom parts of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> There have been several whitening products I have used in the past, but this was the best tasting by far.  </li>
            <li> The first step tastes ok, the 2nd step dries my mouth and makes my skin &amp; gums sensitive to temperatures.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I gave this product a chance after day 1 and am looking forward to seeing my new whiter teeth in the future!</li>
            <li> So this..this was a home-run and definitely part of our new routine :)</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The Crest 3D white system is easy to incorporate into your morning routine without adding much time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast acting product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about the new Crest 3D White toothpaste set!</li>
            <li> but I was relieved and excited to find out that you do the first step for one minute and then spit and add the second for another minute.</li>
            <li> My mouth actually feels healthier rather than more sensitive!  </li>
            <li> was excited to see if the Crest product worked differently and much to my surprise, it did!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a decent product that does give results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> So when I was offered the opportunity to try the new Crest 3D white toothpaste I was very excited.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the new crest 3d white brilliance daily cleansing toothpaste via BZZ agent and Crest for free.</li>
            <li> Now, the whitening product: Easy to apply without an extensive waiting time for the finish + no icky taste that makes one want to spit it all out and quit!</li>
            <li> There are no beads in it to get stuck under the gums; the smell is amazing and little burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the instructions, brushing with the purifying cleanser first - the taste is good, very similar to other Crest Pro Health® toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The second step paste tasted different than most toothpastes taste but is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommended this whitening system to anyone who wants quick results!</li>
            <li> This is the first time my teeth have that I just left the dentist clean feeling</li>
            <li> The concept is you first brush your teeth with a deep cleansing toothpaste to clean your teeth and then brush with whitening finisher to polish and whiten.  </li>
            <li> Once I applied too much product and hurt my gums but that was fully my fault and was fine to continue two days later.</li>
            <li> Still need to wait long enough to see a result, but my teeth feel super clean and fresh after brushing!</li>
            <li> I normally use an electric toothbrush, but recommend not turning it on for Step 2, as for me it spread the paste around too much, when I mainly want to whiten the teeth that show in a smile.</li>
            <li> Overall, I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing this on my own free will as there was little to no results.  </li>
            <li> One reason why I think that this product does a better job at whitening is that it is being brushed on with a bristle brush instead of the little rubber brushes that come with whitening pens, and is better than the strips because its not just sitting on your teeth.</li>
            <li> This Crest 3D White gave me a noticeable difference from the very first use!</li>
            <li> This has been hard for me to whiten because the whitening solutions have always made the spots brilliant white and</li>
            <li> It has the same texture as a regular whitening toothpaste with an amazing minty taste.</li>
            <li> Did I notice a HUGE improvement after using this product, no, but I did see an overall improvement in the health of my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a month now-- for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I got the Crest 3D White free thanks to Crest for being a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This product is great,been using it for a few weeks now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of effort which is huge for me and the results are definitely visible.  </li>
            <li> It left my teeth smooth and they felt really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention i received Crest 3D White for free Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a huge difference in whiteness per se, but I definitely think it&#x27;s noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a month now-- for free thanks to BzzAGENT.com.</li>
            <li> am only giving it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t see any HUGE improvements in the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li> and I can already tell my teeth are much whiter.</li>
            <li> Got the opportunity to try out Crest 3D White Brilliance kit via a free sample from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Paste is so much easier than strips or trays...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have much options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing it for 3 weeks and can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I have seen happen with this system.  </li>
            <li> and I was please at how gentle it was on the faux part of my tooth versus my real tooth.  </li>
            <li> and I really needed to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> Step 1 has some mint flavor,  but step 2 straight up tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li> but the results have much to be desired.</li>
            <li> The results are more gradual than the Crest Strips, but that&#x27;s to be expected from something that takes 2 minutes versus 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really like the results.</li>
            <li> tubes themselves don&#x27;t feel very sturdy,  but even with my toddler grabbing one off the counter</li>
            <li> I could see how much whiter my teeth were</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay money for this, especially since I can get tooth whitening gel at my dentist for free each time I go for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> My breath was much fresher as well.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t really notice much whitening.</li>
            <li> I really like the whitening system.</li>
            <li> It still whitened my teeth really well, even though I used it once per day.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I was brushing with the gel or if it had evaporated.</li>
            <li> It really did make my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I have spent more time brushing my teeth using these products than I ever have.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical since my teeth weren&#x27;t really very discolored to begin with, but I thought &amp;</li>
            <li> I really like the Crest 3D kit.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says -- it really does whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I found that it really helped me to take the time to brush</li>
            <li> These products really made a difference with the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I never thought any of them really worked.</li>
            <li> I received 3D White kit through Crest to try for free.</li>
            <li> But there really was no aftertaste, so that was okay.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> My teeth did not get much whiter.</li>
            <li> I received my Crest 3d white brilliance through bzzagent for free.</li>
            <li> ; I like it that much.</li>
            <li> Crest is much milder an experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know as much about mica.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really...</li>
            <li> After about 4 days of use I could really see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a paste that you could use to really prep your teeth for whitening strips</li>
            <li> (if maybe not as fast.)</li>
            <li> can bring so much of a difference.</li>
            <li> and I found that this was not a product I really cared for.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the toothpaste (Step 1),</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t wait to spit it out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this product would be of much help</li>
            <li> After about one week, I really started noticing a difference in the look and feel of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in my teeth coloration.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent</li>
            <li> This product really whitens.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li> While it may seem a bit cumbersome or a pain to have two tubes of toothpaste, it is a million times easier than waiting with white strips or painting a gel on your teeth and holding a light up to them, etc.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how much counter space two products took</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> My teeth look whiter, and feel much cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li> While I used the product as directed and did not mind the taste, I did not notice much of the whitening effect as promised.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Thank you Shopper Army for giving me the opportunity to try a free product of Crest 3D White for review.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Overall, I did enjoy testing this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to have much whiter teeth from using it- hoped for the results you would get from using gel trays but not having to use them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really helped me keep a cleaner, fresher, feeling teeth and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
            <li> I dont have time for whitening strips,and mouthwashes, and toothpastes dont really work to really whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> it really leaves my teeth looking whiter and healthier than just using toothpaste</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste system.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Having white teeth is extremely important to me</li>
            <li> I still find this to be a much easier system to use than using strips or going to the dentist to whiten, as it can be done at home.  </li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3d white kit to test out for free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> but I had so much discomfort on my gums from this product.</li>
            <li> really had high hopes for this as it wasn&#x27;t a tray or a leave on treatment too!</li>
            <li> All in all, I deem this a sufficient product that I would absolutely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Really brightens the teeth</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement to whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> kind-of like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste.</li>
            <li> This product really did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I was really worried before I started as I had tried a Crest Whitening toothpaste before</li>
            <li> This makes teeth whitening so much easier.</li>
            <li> really did see an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I really don&#x27;t like using fluoride-containing toothpaste, as it really can leech calcium out of bones.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel like there has been any change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> :&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the dreaded whitening strips, this product is a real pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this method of teeth whitening over the strips any day.</li>
            <li> Really whitened my teeth, use just a couple of times a week though.</li>
            <li> Did the whole process 2 day in a row</li>
            <li> Even though I do use the strips to whiten my teeth as well I much prefer this method.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s much easier than the whitening strips out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on using two products (don&#x27;t like to waste any more time :) )</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> I got to try Crest 3D daily cleansing and whitening system for free.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are visibly whiter thanks to this system and I will continue to purchase it for myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> Thanks to crest</li>
            <li> I was invited to try Crest 3D White by receiving a free sample.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a dentist and easier/ quicker than the strips.</li>
            <li> Hi received the Crest 3D White Brilliance for free through a  champaign with BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> and it did not foam as much as I like a toothpaste to foam.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> so I did not see much results and it burned my gums on occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does make your teeth feel like you just got them polished at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH easier to use than ill-fitting strips.</li>
            <li> Step 2 really whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks before I really noticed a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t really appear to be getting any whiter either.</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent for the opportunity to test and review this product.</li>
            <li> I was also amazed about how fast I got results.</li>
            <li> In addition, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeee it.</li>
            <li> I feel like the results are very comparable.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, people started noticing how much whiter my teeth were.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I felt that there were some days that my teeth looked whiter, but at the end of two weeks, I didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks straight now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to say that it really whitened them</li>
            <li> Thanks for adding this to your whitening lineup.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about trying yet another tooth whitener, but this one has really won me over.</li>
            <li> I found that very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I got to try out Crest 3D White Brilliance for free from Crest.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was too much for my gums.</li>
            <li> VERY  </li>
            <li> REALLY  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the Crest 3D White Brillance toothpaste system from #crest and #bzzagent.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than the trays or strips.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> (is it really a system or is it just two separate products bundled as one?)</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste in all.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very stained and porous.</li>
            <li> It really does work for whitening your teeth.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I really cannot see any noticeable changes to the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> But Crest makes that a much easier feat to accomplish.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste and the gel worked really well.</li>
            <li> but really it flies by</li>
            <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent and Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.</li>
            <li> My teeth do feel much cleaner and shinier after using the product.</li>
            <li> and that is when I really started noticing the difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li> This was much easier to use than whitening products in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for adding this to my whitening lineup.</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for a couple weeks now for free, courtesy of BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> You can see the edges of my teeth are much whiter in the bottom picture and my teeth are just whiter over all.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in my teeth coloration.</li>
            <li> Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  </li>
            <li> Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in terms of teeth whiteness.</li>
            <li> but I didn’t really expect it to be</li>
            <li> These two products works really well at cleaning and whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> After a week of use my teeth looked so much whiter.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended not using it because it caused too much sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and Bzzagent</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> There was too much of a mint flavor.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 product is really gooey.</li>
            <li> When I was getting ready for work the morning</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels really clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me having to basically brush my teeth twice seems to take too much time.</li>
            <li> However, the toothpaste is very abrasive.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt or cause discomfort really.</li>
            <li> It really does help to whiten the teeth</li>
            <li> I think this system has really helped maintain the whiteness of my teeth that I have achieved through using whitening strips.</li>
            <li> but really it hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D Brilliance through BzzAgent and was very eager to try it.</li>
            <li> My teeth might have been one shade whiter, but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I will say that after using the toothpaste, my teeth were VERY shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I noticed after day 1 that my teeth were much shinier - like after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the flavor of step one but step 2</li>
            <li> Thanks Bzzagent for allowing me to try out this product</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t very stained, so I had almost immediate results.</li>
            <li> I guess as much as they are going to whiten.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste really adheres to your teeth</li>
            <li> I have used the product for several weeks and enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I drink so much coffee that my teeth have been looking</li>
            <li> Tried it thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> To really tell I would suggested taking pics weekly.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Just received a Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with my white smile thanks to Crest 3d white.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I would absolutely purchase this product, unless the cost was too much for me to afford, like $25.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> but it really worked and made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> It really did whiten and remove some surface stains.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 2 step because you feel like your really cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Having white teeth is extremely important to me and after I tried the system I can tell it do it</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and brighter and the process is so much easier than using whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, my teeth were so much whiter</li>
            <li> They really require a time commitment</li>
            <li> I said I received the Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent for review.  </li>
            <li> I was recently chosen to try this product for free through Bzz agents.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li> this product I did not experience much sensitivity and my teeth after about 17 days were about 3 shades</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth whiting on the very 1st week.</li>
            <li> That means I review products for free and give back my opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I could not believe it that I really saw results after one use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely none, unless you count the &amp;#34;blue 1&amp;#34; coloring in the HD cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I really struggle with, though, are the two steps.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like the two steps.</li>
            <li> Since using Crest 3d white brilliance toothpaste I have gotten many complements on my pearly white smile</li>
            <li> I am not finishing the tubes since I am concerned what they are doing to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Crest 3D White Brilliance System through BzzAgent for free.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all whitening toothpastes with very lackluster results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in awe.</li>
            <li> My teeth really look</li>
            <li> It really dries out my mouth after use.</li>
            <li> I received the opportunity to try Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you really want to see results I wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit.</li>
            <li> It very evenly whites my teeth</li>
            <li> Your whole mouth will thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trialing this product for about two weeks now thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> but nothing so intense that I&#x27;d stop using it.</li>
            <li> Even with once a day, my teeth are very noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li> the whiting part didn&#x27;t really seem to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really like the taste of it</li>
            <li> A fantastic product that left my teeth whiter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and intend to continue using.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much, if any, improvement in the whiteness of my teeth while using this product.</li>
            <li> You brush with step one paste for one minute, spit but do not rinse and then brush with step two paste for one minute then spit, rinse and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of any difference in the whiteness of my teeth using this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth were very yellowed before I used the product.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Crest WhiteStrips from the very beginning.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> I have noticed a bit of whitening,not as much as I would like,but I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> But I did see a very noticeable difference in my teeth in 4weeks.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely blown away by the results.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily, and I am so pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> This is really nice in comparison to whitening strips which can be messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> (so be careful NOT to apply to your gums), but I was surprised at how much I liked</li>
            <li> I find that the toothpaste leaves an overall clean feeling in my mouth, but there is a lack of minty flavor or any real flavor for that matter, which is kind of odd.</li>
            <li> Really liked the performance of Crest 3 D white ,I will very definitely continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li> really liked the idea of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System since I’m already brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I really liked the Crest 3D White toothpaste overall -</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended for those with more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had done professional whitening and had a good experience</li>
            <li> I know they say if this happens, stop using it for a few days, but I have to wonder about the safety of the product itself when I have this kind of reaction to it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not whitening, you&#x27;re yellowing.&amp;#34; but when a product claims to be &amp;#34;99% as white as a professional polish&amp;#34; then I expect better results.</li>
            <li> I swapped out my Optic White toothpaste for this two step system and so far love the results.</li>
            <li> This was really gentle on my teeth and since I only used it at night, I was still able to use my sensitive toothpaste in the morning.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is very minty and makes my teeth feel very clean, but made my mouth very dry.</li>
            <li> When I tried the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to apply.  </li>
            <li> I actually really noticed a difference pretty quickly after using this two-step system, only after about a week!  </li>
            <li> I have finally found something that really works!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer a more minty toothpaste and this one was pretty  bland.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have super stained teeth and thought they were pretty much as white as they could get...until I started brushing with the 3D whitening toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> Upon testing I first notice the taste and texture of part 1, it was gritty and had a mild minty type taste.</li>
            <li> I drink tea and coffee on a regular basis so I was excited to get Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li> So when I received my free sample of Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System (THANK YOU, CREST and BZZAGENT!!), I had an open mind but was not expecting significant results.  </li>
            <li> I first started researching Crest’s new product</li>
            <li> I first started researching Crest’s new product</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the system is not very expensive.</li>
            <li> This product system only takes an extra minute of your time and it is well worth it for what it can do for your smile and your pocket book compared to dentist office whitening treatments!!</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D white has my teeth clean, smooth and white!  </li>
            <li> So while I do enjoy Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for its ability to keep my teeth squeaky clean and based on this would repurchase this product, I&#x27;m still holding out hope that I will see whiter teeth with longer use of this system...</li>
            <li> With that said, I do feel Crest 3D White left my teeth feeling smooth and clean and it may have lightened the color of my teeth a bit after two weeks of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> It took an opportunity, presented to me by someone other than myself or my dentist, to really pay attention more closely to the pearly whites!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel super clean, and not much whitening effect!</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel super clean in a way you can&#x27;t get from other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I did not see significant whitening from using Step 2, though I only used it once a day and didn&#x27;t have very stained teeth to begin with.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably brighter, shinier, and overall they feel very clean, similar to the way they feel right after a cleaning at the dentist’s office.</li>
            <li> The first time my teeth got very sensitive with use.  </li>
            <li> At first the toothpaste caused white spots on my gums (which I was warned of on the label).&lt;br /&gt;After a few days the brushing became more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I really like how clean my mouth feels after brushing and my teeth definitely do look whiter.  </li>
            <li> Another plus about this system is that my teeth feel really clean...almost as clean as they are after I have just left the dentist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two step process was a little more work, but since I&#x27;m using an electric toothbrush with 30 sec interval warnings, the timing portion was relatively easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> My teeth felt very clean, with no residue or pastey or bitter aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is not very minty it does leave my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I admit I do not use this product like it was directed (at least twice a day) because I am pregnant and have a strong gag reflex right now.  </li>
            <li> The Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is a two step process but is very easy to use -- you brush your teeth with the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste for one minute and then brush on the Whitening Finisher.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes of brushing my teeth has whitened better than any other toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It takes no longer than brushing your teeth with regular toothpaste,  with the added result of a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I will preface my review by saying that I was excited to have been selected to try the Crest 3D White program.</li>
            <li> think it would likely work better for me if I were willing to give up my morning coffee, but overall I like it as a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will say that after two weeks of using the product daily, one I absolutely had whiter teeth, but my teeth started becoming sensitive to sweets.</li>
            <li> This is a much more convenient way to whiten that other methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that I haven&#x27;t experienced the gum pain I had with whiteners in the past, but it still makes a visible difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 weeks of using Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, I noticed a significant difference in how my teeth felt and looked.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the step 1 product, my teeth feel cleaner than normal using this, but step 2 was a little too runny</li>
            <li> The first step is the toothpaste---it has a white color, mildly gritty consistency, and a refreshing mint flavor.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to see if this actually works for me.</li>
            <li> The flavor is okay, nothing offensive but the results are extremely noticeable within1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am madly in love with this toothpaste, I will never brush with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out but nervous that I would experience the same sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> It was more noticeable with my husband who has genetically slightly-yellow teeth, and after using this for a little while he&#x27;s teeth were much whiter!</li>
            <li> It is a bit more time consuming than other tooth paste</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Crest 3D White as part of my participation with BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This system has a better flavor, and texture, than other systems I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to see the final color.</li>
            <li> It even whitened the edges on the top and bottom which my other toothpaste wasn&#x27;t working on.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste is definitely better than any other that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> She also suffered with a tinge of sensitivity, but after switching to a softer toothbrush than her regular one, said that the sensitivity has lessened significantly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that excited to have to time my brushing, but it was manageable, especially with the hope of whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sure this is due to my reduced usage of step</li>
            <li> The taste is so much better than other whitening products I have experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this two step system had potential and was excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The thing that annoys me about the product with the packaging you are easily able to distinguish between step 1 and step 2 easily due to the labeling and color.  </li>
            <li> I love the first one I tried, the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System, but this one falls short.</li>
            <li> I got better results than I have with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System for the past 2 weeks, and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the whitening power, it leaves my teeth feeling extra clean, more so than with any other toothpaste I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> Crest, you have won me over with the amazing new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!!!</li>
            <li> Right away, I really noticed how white my teeth got after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li> I am continuing to use this daily and with every brush my teeth look whiter and professionally clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth are squeaky clean after I use it &amp; they are noticeably whiter and brighter after only using it for a week or so!</li>
            <li> My teeth actually felt clean &amp; polished - with that &amp;#34;smooth as a dentist polish&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used traditional whitening strips in the past and been happy with the results</li>
            <li> and it left my teeth somewhat whiter and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The two step process really left my teeth clean</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind using 2 different steps to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The deep cleansing step one makes your teeth feel amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> It had a gritty texture to it and after a minute I started getting a squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li> 1 min to deep clean &amp; 1 min to whiten...</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it once a week to keep that clean feeling going between visits to the dentist but daily use irritated my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> In fact my teeth actually stayed and felt clean ALL day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any benefits from the short time use from using this product, I used it for the full 4 week period</li>
            <li> Not only did I get the initial clean feeling, they stayed clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> While I did not experience any actual whitening of my teeth, I did like the clean look and feel, and they did seem to be brighter.</li>
            <li> I drink tea and have not been able to use whitening toothpaste in a long time because my teeth are so sensitive</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t particularly like the sucralose taste in Step 2, and it makes me very thirsty.</li>
            <li> I found that the product left my teeth feeling clean and polished</li>
            <li> Step one gives your mouth that just left the dentist clean feeling, while step two polishes</li>
            <li> This product not only works but it makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure about the taste at first, but it grew on me after a few days.</li>
            <li> It truly is a deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> No.1 really deep cleans my teeth and freshens breath-it&#x27;s a clean and a freshness you can feel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to do, and you can see results quick!</li>
            <li> When I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System free through Bzzagent, I was so excited to try a new whitening product.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations for this one either.</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through BzzAgent where it was sent to me to try for the next couple weeks and review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it because I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results after using whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My standard Crest toothpaste has a whitening component, and while I’m sure it helps prevent stains, over time certain habits (I drink coffee and red wine often) lead to</li>
            <li> There is very little foaming that occurs when using it and the flavor isn&#x27;t anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> I find that if you have really sensitive teeth, this may be a bit too strong for you (similar to what the dentist uses for whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to the other pastes I have used the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning paste leaves your teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I found the step 2 finisher would almost burn a little if I got it on my gums too much, but as long as I kept it mostly on my teeth it was fine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone looking to whiten your teeth, while getting a deep clean to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Start with the cleaning product: Crisp, clean, pleasant tasting paste with no burning or unpleasant mouth feelings.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to use and was hassle free.  </li>
            <li> The first day or two, it was quite tingly and sensitive to the gum line</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a full size product from Crest for a BzzAgent campaign but will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe that it is a good maintenance product, but not necessarily a good whitening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there was any whitening to be honest.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> first tube, the cleansing toothpaste, is nearly intolerable to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure to be honest with you.</li>
            <li> Try Crest Whitestrips or a similar product for TRUE whitening...</li>
            <li> Especially with a cool water rinse.</li>
            <li> However, when I learned what the 2 part process actually was, I realized it’s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> But honestly the first step just ruins the entire process for me, and makes it not worth paying more for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the clean, fresh feeling left in my mouth after using the Crest 3D, but I saw only a very slight change in brightness or whiteness.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural, quick, and easy way to get whiter teeth, I would recommend Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I thought the product had a very mild mint flavor, which was great for me because mint makes me sick to my stomach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a really easy 2step process; you first brush for a minute with the blue tube, spit (don&#x27;t rinse), and brush another minute with the white tube.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty simple and easy to use product which I like, but I do think if I want to get whitening done, the one step crest white strips once a week is just easier than the two step process.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy, at-home teeth whitening system that really works!</li>
            <li> I loved this toothpaste, it took a little while to actually see the benefits of the whitening</li>
            <li> Would really like to see the finisher have a little more substance and be in a flip</li>
            <li> I can live with that!).</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and clean when I&#x27;m finished brushing, and no weird after taste or filmy sensation is left behind. :)</li>
            <li> Then BzzAgent sent me a new and more gentle product - Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel</li>
            <li> gave me fresh clean breath and suprisingly noticed my teeth looking less dinghy</li>
            <li> There is a mild sensation of a brisk cool wind coming in my mouth during that final polishing step and during the final rinse, but I suffer no negative side effects from the whitening agent.</li>
            <li> I look at this as more of a treatment rather than typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth this morning?&amp;#34; My teeth felt so clean, and my breath was so fresh after using Crest 3D White that it felt like I had just brushed!</li>
            <li> But the more I used it the less it hurt.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this though buzzagent but have since given some out as gifts!</li>
            <li> The second step toothpaste was more of a gel and that definitely took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen silica in tons of toothpastes, including the ones recommended by my dentist, most of which do not advertise themselves as whitening and can still have low RDA (Relative Dentin Abrasivity) values.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush my teeth for a longer period anyway with my Sonic Care toothbrush, and the 2 step process is quick and simple for me because the toothbrush makes a noise after 1 minute and then stops after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I liked that I could see a difference in whiteness after a few days of using what I didn&#x27;t like was how sensitive this made my teeth.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was it made my gums super sore.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product from BuzzAgent to give it a try and tell what I thought!</li>
            <li> A toothpaste that promises to help a host of issues most people don&#x27;t even have and then fails at safely cleaning my teeth without causing pain is not one I can recommend.</li>
            <li> This is diffrent as its a quick way to polish your teeth white!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much staining to start out with (I actually started using this product the day after my routine cleaning at the dentist), but I did notice a brighter, whiter smile after 7 days.</li>
            <li> will most likely not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I will say that it did make my teeth feel smooth, but I did not notice a marked whitening, so overall, I did not like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, and the stains that often form between cleanings, on my lower teeth between gums, it has steadily been removing them.</li>
            <li> I only wish I took a before photo of my teeth to show you how quickly they whitened.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for obvious results and ease of use, the crest 3d white strips are much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am lucky enough to be trying this product through Crest and Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing and Whitening System is an innovative, easy-to-use product.</li>
            <li> I think that the only downside to this toothpaste is that I didn&#x27;t really feel like my mouth was minty fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> Even better, the steps come in the same package, so no buying multiple products!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this duo, and shocked by just how effective it is.</li>
            <li> However it did improve my teeth and will yours if you keep your expectations realistic.</li>
            <li> main drawback with this system is that I don&#x27;t always have time to use it.</li>
            <li> did not like this product, mainly for the taste/feel of it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Particularly after using it for 1 week, I compared side by side photos and my teeth looked brighter, cleaner, and felt smoother.</li>
            <li> Overall, my teeth do feel nice and clean as a result of using this system, but I think the whitening process has been a bit slow-</li>
            <li> I feel if you are really into your teeth and feel extra steps are worth the benefit, then this product for you.</li>
            <li> I have been on a constant search for a quick, inexpensive whitening system for a while now.</li>
            <li> Yes, the main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide</li>
            <li> I took my before photo the day the product arrived and my teeth looked surprisingly white in natural light.</li>
            <li> I was able to try out the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleaning % Whitening system.</li>
            <li> This system works so well because you have to brush it on with your toothbrush, so you are able to do the front and back of teeth, unlike with strips where only the surfaces with the strip will be whitened.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions properly and are really motivated to get a whiter smile - you have to commit 2 minutes to the brush.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products in the past and this is by far my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have had a positive experience so far.</li>
            <li> The process is pretty easy - you brush with one, then the second step, but it left my gums and teeth very sensitive after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> all know how much teeth whitening costs-- professionally in the hundreds and some over the counter can be a bit pricey!</li>
            <li> My whole mouth felt super-clean and fresh and I did notice the whitening, even though I normally use a whitening toothpaste regularly.</li>
            <li> and I love how white my teeth are just because I am doing my normal daily routine with brushing.  </li>
            <li> I love that there isn&#x27;t any strips to mess with or leave on paste.</li>
            <li> thought this product was a great alternative to professional whitening systems and white strips or trays, all of which I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest 3D White Brilliance for a few weeks now and (luckily) haven&#x27;t experienced any of the staining or abrasion mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay, the step one is not really strong or minty and the step 2 doesn&#x27;t really have any taste.</li>
            <li> The two-step process of the  Crest 3D Brilliance Cleansing and Whitening System turned out to be easier than I expected and was easy to work in to my normal tooth brushing routine.</li>
            <li> is so much more easy to do and to use than the whitening strips or other whitening systems because you don&#x27;t have to wait half an hour or longer to see the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I may have set my expectations too high thinking</li>
            <li> will continue to use Crest&#x27;s 3D Whitening toothpaste that I have used for years which I do highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My breathe was not only minty fresh but last, and my teeth were more radiant and white.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for your home.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations - Crest products always deliver -</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> I am not one to use Whitening products on my teeth, but was fortunate enough to receive a box of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System for free as a buzzagent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I had, and still have, high hopes for this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li> and I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I did not have high hopes for this one either.</li>
            <li> so I uphold them to a high level, and they succeeded.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little like the whitening strips, but still leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using whitening strips, toothpastes, and even light systems in the past When I received the cleansing and whitening system I was very excited to open it up and try it out.</li>
            <li> I love the new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening toothpaste but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> you have any significant staining or have not had your teeth professionally cleaned recently</li>
            <li> The upswing from this product clearly out ways the few minor flaws of this great new product</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth can be sensitive at times with certain products and this wasn&#x27;t an issue with this product.</li>
            <li> a little more sparkly after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could be a little more minty.</li>
            <li> I hope they will &amp;#34;deyellow&amp;#34; a little bit more, though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a complete freak about keeping them as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> I like the two steps so that I can target the whitening just on the fronts and backs of my teeth, but still know I got a complete and total clean.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other products where you need to leave the whitening substance on for five minutes or longer, this is a very quick and efficient process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and don&#x27;t take mass time out of your day like other whiting systems.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little more sensitivity in the area around my crown, but I think that is normal with any teeth-whitening product.</li>
            <li> and you can feel it not come off as easy as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use compared with other teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from whitening products because they seem to really bother my sensitive teeth, so I was very surprised that this did not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised, really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Daily kit (free through BzzAgent thanks to Crest) for about 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> What really sold me though was when I used my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous when I began using this product that it would aggravate the sensitive spots on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any stains or weird sensations.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and have yet to feel any real sensitivity or pain from using the product.</li>
            <li> it really whiten as well as a professional polish?</li>
            <li> but I was surprised how much whiter my teeth got.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t experienced any uncomfortable sensitivity.</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free from BzzAgent, but that has absolutely no impact on my opinions.</li>
            <li> I thought that would be tedious, but it was actually great.  </li>
            <li> One minute for the cleansing toothpaste and another minute for the whitening finisher; that&#x27;s all it really takes to achieve professional looking result from this system.</li>
            <li> I got to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It only last a few minutes, but it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give this a review of the whitening, but if your sensitive to a lot of whitening products this may not be the item to buy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li> Only 2 minutes required for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to notice an improvement within a few days.</li>
            <li> I plan to rotate this into my brushing routine a few times a year to maintain a healthy white smile.</li>
            <li> and then you brush with the step 2 tube and rinse like normal.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I no longer notice the numbness, but I also don&#x27;t see any more whitening either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gives you a white smile in days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price it is currently being sold at.</li>
            <li> I would normally get.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a brighter smile without the added cost or time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to give it a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving this product 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as fresh as I would want it too.</li>
            <li> and I actually saw a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> I am not in love with the taste and texture of the whitening gel (step 2) but it is very similar to the gel that is on whitening strips, so not unexpected.</li>
            <li> I would be likely to use this system maybe twice a year to renew my smile and re-whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> The box says this is normal and the spots went away, but it did make me wonder a bit about what caused that</li>
            <li> looking forward to continuing to use Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to see an even brighter smile.</li>
            <li> I find that my smile actually is brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mint wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and left your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The three products helped me brush longer and maintain a routine I hadn&#x27;t normally done.</li>
            <li> This makes a difference, if your gums can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;First you use Step One as you would a normal toothpaste for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works in two steps, step 1 is to brush normally, then without rinsing your mouth or toothbrush, add the step 2 gel to your brush and brush again for about 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> When brushing normally I like to brush three to four minutes</li>
            <li> All you have to do is brush with the paste and the gel for one minute each, twice a day, as you normally would.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for a week and my smile was as white as could be</li>
            <li> You whiten your teeth in the time that it normally takes to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that maybe the toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t give me as good of a cleaning as my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Then instead of rinsing, you brush with the step 2 toothpaste which is a whitening finisher for 1 minute and then rinse as normal.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I am not a fanatic about tooth whitening</li>
            <li> I wanted to brush with my normal toothpaste after I was finished this the Crest 3D system.  </li>
            <li> Now,  I only use it on the part of my teeth that show when I smile.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big improvement in the whiteness of my smile.</li>
            <li> I think the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System is more hype than action.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that anyone that is looking for a whiter smile pick it up at a local retailer or online today!</li>
            <li> but I did like how you replace your normal teeth brushing routine with this...rather than waiting with a mouthful of whitening strips for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> then I skip this system and use my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a tea fanatic, which is no Bueno for my chompers.</li>
            <li> My teeth were slightly sensitive at first, but I began to notice a vast improvement in the first 3 days of using this product.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White helped my smile to be brighter.</li>
            <li> Been using the Crest 3D white toothpaste for the past couple of weeks and it is really good.</li>
            <li> I at first didn&#x27;t think it would do much to my teeth but after a week i definitely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> When I first received Crest 3D White, I wanted to see if it would REALLY whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Second step surprised me with the cool minty flavor.</li>
            <li> I normally get teeth sensitivity from whitening toothpastes but ever since using this system, I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> to use two step process that replaces your normal toothpaste</li>
            <li> that I normally didn&#x27;t finish using it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It left my teeth whiter and the taste was fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> After so many years of drinking coffee, tea and soda, I thought it would be a waste of time</li>
            <li> I normally have problems with whitening toothpaste causing my teeth to hurt</li>
            <li> The strips normally do so</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, I don&#x27;t have to do anything out of my normal bedtime schedule.</li>
            <li> have tried a lot of different products to help whiten my teeth without much success.</li>
            <li> I hated it at first, made my mouth draw up inside, felt like I ate a lemon, the second one is good and taste good too.</li>
            <li> The step 1 tastes like the stuff they use at the dentist office, which was a little odd at first, but it really does make your teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant 2 paste&#x27;s man that&#x27;s going to be a lot of work, but it&#x27;s really not anytime then normal!!!</li>
            <li> but I feel like Crest&#x27;s line of single system toothpastes clean and whiten as well</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System through Bzz Agent to try.</li>
            <li> My teeth seem whiter, and clear and am very impressed that my teeth do not feel more sensitive, or painful due to using this product.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste, although a little gritty, seems to get rid of the gunk on my teeth and makes them feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I think if I continue to use this product that I will have eventually get the super white teeth like you would expect from a professional whitening.</li>
            <li> It works great and is not overly foamy making it less messy.</li>
            <li> The steps are easy to follow, just adding one extra minute to the daily process of brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> The two part system was easy to use and took no longer than my regular daily dental routine.</li>
            <li> The second time I used the product I could feel a slight tingling but no sensitivity which was nice.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; taste left in my mouth and after using the step 2 gel my teeth feel as though they have some of that product left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too strong, left temporary white spots on my gums.</li>
            <li> , now not everyone has strong white teeth to start with, so not everyone will get movie star WHITE, I was one of those people.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent, but when I received it, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the similarities in packaging to Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health HD two-step system, which I&#x27;ve been using thanks to a previous BzzCampaign.  </li>
            <li> was that im order to do this the right way you need to add an extra step to your bruahing routine.</li>
            <li> Basically you are now brushing your teeth for 2 mins total (which helps right off the bat)</li>
            <li> A few months ago I received another product from Crest that was very similar and that I liked just a little better because it did not give my gums that tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> It claims it can keep your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish!</li>
            <li> But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that evening though half of my normal brushing time was done with the whitener, my teeth still felt very clean.</li>
            <li> While using this product my mouth did feel clean and fresh, unlike those tried in the past</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great and easy product to use if you are trying to whiten your teeth and don&#x27;t like the taste of feel of white strips, or are unable to afford professional whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of two step toothpaste systems, but this one is definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> At the same time I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth looking much whiter, so I&#x27;m not sure just how effective this system has been for me.</li>
            <li> My gums have had a little sensitivity to step two, so I make sure to steer clear of them while brushing.</li>
            <li> Cu toothpaste and whitening agents are both light in flavor in Middle earth and foam very much especially compared to a normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> After using step 2, my teeth stared to get a little sensitive which I experience with most whitening systems.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a few weeks now, at first I really didnt care for the taste or smell, they were a tad strong for me.</li>
            <li> I was also feeling frustration about my new tea habit and the stains it has been leaving on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth just felt new again.  </li>
            <li> #34;You look different.&amp;#34; and you haven&#x27;t bought a new shirt or done anything new with your hair</li>
            <li> I wonder if that&#x27;s a replacement for the product I tried or a totally new product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new products to whiten my teeth, and I drink a lot of tea and soda</li>
            <li> The first step is a deep cleaning whitening toothpaste and there&#x27;s a clear improvement after this step, but the real improvement comes with the finisher in step 2, which Crest calls a &amp;#34;whitening finisher.&amp;#34; I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing.</li>
            <li> The taste of the product is minty and can be gritty, but it does leave your mouth fresh and clean, not like other toothpastes I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I mean your mouth feels like you just left the dentist type of clean!!!</li>
            <li> The first cleansing toothpaste has a great fresh taste--the second doesn&#x27;t seem to have a strong taste, but a very minor hint of the peroxide aftertaste--but not enough to be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My teeth did feel extra smooth after using like I left a dentist chair</li>

            <li> Sometimes brushing your teeth for 2 minutes straight can become cumbersome and I feel like I often rush and don&#x27;t always last the whole 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly how it helped me but knowing that it could help the enamel on my teeth made it sound beneficial.</li>

            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste had a good flavor and the only slightly negative thing would be</li>
            <li> I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing.</li>
            <li> My teeth are also very sensitive</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at my reaction to the Crest Toothpaste as I often use Arm &amp; Hammer that also has peroxide and baking soda with no problem at all.</li>
            <li> but.....my teeth are now very sensitive...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> This is very much like the HD white although they added a flavoring to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> his product comes in a very professional looking package.</li>
            <li> The tube labeled #1 was very abrasive to my gums and was not a smooth clean like my normal paste.</li>
            <li> Instructions are clearly labeled, I like the fact that each bottle has a big 1 and a 2, so you get the steps right, even if you are not wearing your glasses.</li>
            <li> I did have to stop after the 1 month because I developed sensitivity in my upper right molars.  </li>
            <li> Having dealt with not so white teeth my entire life I was excited to try out a new product.</li>
            <li> The experience was pleasant because it was not bad tasting nor did it leave a bad after taste.</li>
            <li> so it was fun at first and then became a slight chore.</li>
            <li> But, I only felt that sensitivity the very first use, and even with consistent use for several weeks, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little chemically and not super pleasant.</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned the less-than-stellar taste of the &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34; (kind of tastes like fennel), but it&#x27;s not that bad and my teeth feel VERY clean after brushing with both products.</li>
            <li> This one surprised me!  </li>
            <li> The other thing I love is that all of my teeth are whitened equally.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the 3D White</li>
            <li> Not only that bit within the first two uses</li>
            <li> first, I thought it was overly-strong, as it left my lips and gums</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it once a day or every other day.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, I bet you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised too!</li>
            <li> and when I first tried It I instantly saw a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> The directions tell you to brush with the Step 1 tube first, which is the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste that prepares your teeth, then spit -don&#x27;t rinse (which I would tend to forget a time or two)-</li>
            <li> This is my first whitening product that wasn&#x27;t a regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have mostly always used Crest products and have used different forms of the 3D white before such as the whitening strips, mouth rinse and the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The product does actually whiten over time and I can definitely see myself buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> You use the first one for one minute and then you use the second one for one minute as well</li>
            <li> It tastes very similar (if not identical) to Crest 3D White toothpaste (which it actually may be) and I have always found that product enjoyable and efficient.</li>
            <li> The second step, whitening finisher, really works well!</li>
            <li> The first tube is a deep cleaning toothpaste-use this for one minute.</li>
            <li> Instead, I opted to try breaking the top corner off - which resulted in a small cut to my finger.  </li>
            <li> Which is pretty simple - however -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other crest 3D white products and wasn&#x27;t  able to get these results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Process: With this product you first brush your teeth for one minute and then immediately following you brush the again with step 2 (the whitener)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive either!</li>
            <li> After brushing and rinsing I actually see the gross stuff in the sink and my smile looks so much whiter - not</li>
            <li> It is so much more convenient for me to use this over other whitening systems because I can do it at the same time I brush.  </li>
            <li> with the first deep cleaning toothpaste and 1 min.</li>
            <li> The “system” involves a 2 step process, where first you brush for one minute with a Deep Cleaning Toothpaste, followed by brushing for one minute with a Whitening Finisher gel (with no rinsing in between steps).</li>
            <li> It did leave some white spots on my gums after the first usage.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this Crest 3D White Brillance Daily Cleansing System compliments of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> First is your deep cleansing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The first tube you use for 1 minute and the second tube you use for 1 minute as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth were already pretty white when I started using this system, but I did see them brighten up from use.</li>
            <li> You simply have to brush your teeth first with the toothpaste and then with the whitener.</li>
            <li> My teeth were pretty white to start out with</li>
            <li> My teeth are normally somewhat sensitive -</li>
            <li> but the end result is well worth the minor discomfort.</li>
            <li> White, white and white love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Crest 3D White</li>
            <li> but once I started I noticed a complete difference!</li>
            <li> the system is paste that you can use just like regular toothpaste; much easier than strips or trays!</li>
            <li> It works if you&#x27;re willing to do the the two step process daily.  </li>
            <li> It made my teeth considerably whiter in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This two-step system works better than the whitening toothpastes I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> reviews mentioned gum sensitivity and their gums turning white which did happen to me the first two or three times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty simple procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> and it left my breath pretty minty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one thing I should mention: the first time I used this product, I saw a white spot on my gum on one side Immediately after using.</li>
            <li> so I brush my teeth pretty regularly</li>
            <li> However, the Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste and whitening gel combo really worked!  </li>
            <li> The kit is a two step process, the first step being a toothpaste and the second step being the whitener that you use on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think people instantly realize it&#x27;s because my teeth or whiter, but I know that has been why I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my smile lately.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for many years and never seemed to get my teeth white with other over the counter products.</li>
            <li> I first started using the product I followed the recommendation of brushing with this twice daily.</li>
            <li> and I’m willing to try anything by Crest, my trusted toothpaste brand, for a white smile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No nasty taste you usually have with whitening products.</li>
            <li> The first tube contains a fluoride toothpaste and the second contains a whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> Evidently, it has definitely made a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a Crest toothpaste or a teeth whitening product buyer</li>
            <li> The first step in this 2 part system is a deep cleansing toothpaste</li>
            <li> I like that this is incorporated in your normal brushing routine, no messy strips or trays.  </li>
            <li> first toothpaste is a cleanser that deep cleans, while fighting cavities.  </li>
            <li> My teeth normally respond well to whitening toothpastes and treatments, but I have never had my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> If this kid uses the original Crest 3D white as step one, followed by the whitening gel for part two, I would definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> Per the instructions, you first brush for 1 minute with the Step 1 toothpaste (which is for deep cleaning).</li>
            <li> Pretty simple</li>
            <li> I was really surprised, but after 3 weeks they are looking even whiter!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised!</li>
            <li> Given my age times a cup of coffee a day and several glasses of tea equals to 94524257822466 cups of staining liquid that have drenched my teeth in for over five decades and Crest 3D White was able to make them a bit whiter and not so yellow.</li>
            <li> I knew that I would love it, because I have used the crest 3D products in the past, and have also used the toothpaste booster as well, so</li>
            <li> There is a 4 step process with this kit, but it’s not difficult to get in the habit of doing it daily</li>
            <li> first you brush with the deep cleansing toothpaste &amp; then you spit (but do not rinse!) and use the whitening finisher.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and would definitely purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> mother on the other hand had pretty stellar results with the regimen.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the product might be too time consuming with multiple steps, but it ended up working out</li>
            <li> The first time I used my kit, my initial reaction was &amp;#34;this is like a car wash for my mouth!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> On the third day I knew that due to increasing sensitivity I would not be able to continue with this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, this has done a pretty job of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> First is a Deep Cleansing toothpaste that you use for one minute.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think that there would be any difference in using this product compared to regular whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li> Both step 1 and step 2 left a no-so-nice aftertaste after brushing which just made me want to switch back to my original crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but my teeth are pretty white anyways</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now really willing to shell out the $40+ to get quality results with Crest&#x27;s white strips system instead.</li>
            <li> At first I used daily and after 3 days my teeth bothered me.</li>
            <li> And, I think not only does it whiten, it cleans my teeth more thoroughly than any other toothpaste product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After all my teeth are 65 years old!</li>
            <li> However, the first time I used the product, it burnt the gums above my two front teeth.</li>
            <li> product has 2 steps, the first is for prepping your teeth by cleaning them, like a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because I have coffee stains and other staining on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The first step (the deep cleansing toothpaste)</li>
            <li> Then I used the Crest 3D White once a day and then brushed my teeth with my original toothpaste Crest Whitening.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is so much higher than regular toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is suggested to use first step for 1 minute then 2nd step for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> First is a Deep Cleansing toothpaste that you use for one minute.</li>
            <li> My teeth are generally pretty white, but they could always be whiter, and that just didn&#x27;t happen with this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay, just for the deep cleaning aspect.</li>
            <li> The first step tastes a lot like the blue sparkle tooth paste that I used as a kid.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant because I was adding a second tube of toothpaste to my brushing routine.</li>
            <li> In between the toothpaste and whitening gel, my teeth felt pretty gritty.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised though!</li>
            <li> I first used this product last Sunday, Aug. 31, 2015.</li>
            <li> and I could feel the cleansing action in my mouth!</li>
            <li> The first step is the deep cleansing paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, it seemed to make a whitening change to my teeth, but it&#x27;s not really for me.</li>
            <li> One of the lost teeth is an incisor, right there in the forefront of my smile, and with the dentures being porcelain, which doesn&#x27;t stain, and my real teeth staining regularly from my love of drinking tea, I have a hard time keeping my teeth white enough for my dentures to blend in.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this toothpaste I found it to be extremely strong and burned my mouth a little bit, but this went away by the third day of using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The first step DOES make my mouth a little dry, but  come step 2, it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little strong</li>
            <li> and I realized it might be a little too strong for that,</li>
            <li> I am a daily coffee drinker,  and the dual whitening system really helps keep staining at bay, and has erased some older staining on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the same because my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean enough like the system does for you.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White left me with a clean feeling mouth &amp; teeth.</li>
            <li> , my husband said my teeth look like I just left the dentist, all clean, white &amp; polished!</li>
            <li> I do realize I will never have a true white movie star smile but just less stains will be nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure getting your teeth professionally done will get your teeth stark white, but I was looking for a much more affordable option to give me teeth a little boost.</li>
            <li> have been using Crest products for a long time but Crest 3D White daily cleaning &amp; whitening system is really a new innovative way of cleaning and whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest #D White Brilliance for a few weeks (Free thanks to Crest) and I must admit I really like so far.</li>
            <li> The two-step process was easy to do, but a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I would switch up with my normal sensitive toothpaste every few uses and they were fine.</li>
            <li> The All day dry mouth just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I started to see results after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive teeth, so I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly; I have only been using it once a day</li>
            <li> I have recently visited my dentist, so I know I have a beautiful mouth, as they tell me, so this was definitely disturbing.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I brushed after my professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that it does not use the harsh chemicals that a normal dentist would be using on your teeth if you were to go in for a whitening with them.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it two stars because people with sensitive teeth do need to be aware that this toothpaste alone will make hell in your mouth.</li>
            <li> But to put that into perspective, I have what I would describe as a sensitive tongue; I don&#x27;t like hot sauce or red wines, etc., because of the taste they leave on my tongue or in my mouth.</li>
            <li> There are two steps involved in this process but that is the beauty, you will spend more time concentrating on brushing your teeth thoroughly rather than up down, back forward, spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I brushed with the “deep cleansing toothpaste,” a gentle plaque-blaster, first.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because I do have sensitive teeth that the whitening portion of the process would make my teeth more sensitive then usual</li>
            <li> , there really wasn&#x27;t a refreshing minty feeling one usually gets from regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth usually and had no issues with this system making my teeth any more sensitive which was one of my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flavor is not as minty as other Crest products I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> and honestly it’s not as bad as some other teeth whitening products I’ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that it may have made my teeth a slightly lighter shade of yellow and they appear to shine more</li>
            <li> and I think that the 2nd step should have been better tasting also, it was bland at best.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> super simple and only takes 2....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize something this simple could give you such quick results.</li>
            <li> By the way, even though you are brushing your teeth in two steps instead of one, it really doesn&#x27;t take more than a few extra seconds because each step takes one minute of brushing, and the general rule of thumb is to brush for two minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try Crest 3D White, but apprehensive as in the past whitening products didn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference after two to three days and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Having recently got my adult braces off, I have been on a constant search for a quick, inexpensive whitening system.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a good taste and is no more abrasive than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So my teeth aren&#x27;t exactly pure white.</li>
            <li> While the 2 step system takes longer, I definitely notice a much cleaner feeling than the regular one tube route, so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
            <li> I mean, no new stains/discoloration appeared so that&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not fully sold on the whitening function of this product.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I got the campaign invite through BzzAgent to try Crest&#x27;s new 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System, I signed up right away.</li>
            <li> feel that this whitening toothpaste could really benefit those who have moderate to severe staining on their teeth, but I&#x27;m not sure those who don&#x27;t have significant staining will see much of a result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day due to sensitivity in the past, but so far I haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> The Step 1 toothpaste made my mouth feel very dry by the time I was ready to start Step 2 and made me really want to rinse.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening results, I have not noticed a significant difference, maybe a slight change if anything.</li>
            <li> i noticed a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but it wasn&#x27;t significant.  </li>
            <li> and I made sure to get as little as possible on my gums or anywhere else besides the teeth.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a little liquidy) put it on toothbrush, screw top back on (or have finisher drip onto vanity), then brush!</li>
            <li> I actually like that it keeps me in check with spending a decent amount of time brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li> The kit seemed far more serious than my normal tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many whitening systems and have had little to no results until now!!</li>
            <li> If you have a busy schedule and don&#x27;t think you can devote the little bit of extra time to using this system, then you might be better off using another whitening system.</li>
            <li> As being part of the dental field its hard to trust brands on their products, as far if it works, how it taste, and if it&#x27;s safe for your teeth.</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s how it is supposed to work to give you that deep down clean?!</li>
            <li> I took a before and after photo the very first time I used the 3D White Brilliance Daily cleansing system, and I immediately saw major results!</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this new product to anyone,if only for the deep clean andfresh breath</li>
            <li> After a few applications I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I am very self conscious of my yellow teeth and always try to buy products that can approve their appearance.</li>
            <li> Clearly labeled Step 1 and Step 2....</li>
            <li> It is comparable to the residue left by the whitening strips of old and it makes me feel like the product is really working.</li>
            <li> Though only using it a couple days thus far, I am hopeful that I will see some real whitening results moving forward.</li>
            <li> Since I am a regular coffee drinker I really wanted this to work, I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait for a sensitive gums version.</li>
            <li> I like that this product doesn&#x27;t really change my morning routine, and I think that I will continue to use it, but only after I get my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to feel less clean because of this.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old toothpaste again!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Crest 3D white strips and this beats them by far, and at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have also used Crest Strips, which work really well, but those take 30 minutes and are an extra step after brushing.  </li>
            <li> second step is the whitening gel, it has no taste to it really</li>
            <li> you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it after a week because it caused my teeth to ache, I already have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> And much quicker than your white strips or trays</li>
            <li> I had to discontinue them because it was making my teeth overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Toothpaste system really lived up to its claims.</li>
            <li> The two step process really made each brushing feel like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> As far as whitening, I see brighter teeth, shinier teeth</li>
            <li> And lastly (and this is nit-picking really)</li>
            <li> I really like Crest 3D White tooth paste.</li>
            <li> The 2nd tube has peroxide, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it did not.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White dual cleansing &amp; whitening system - works really well as a cleaner of the teeth &amp; mouth</li>
            <li> For my natural front teeth, I did notice that they were whiter.</li>
            <li> I was rooting for this product-I really was, but after faithfully brushing twice daily for 2 weeks I saw no noticeable whitening results.</li>
            <li> This was a concern for me since the carbamide peroxide in my dentist’s professional products resulted in intolerable side effects for me.</li>
            <li> The multiple product tube stand upright and don’t take up much counter space.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this whitening system to anyone who wants whoter teeth, but without the harshness of whitening strips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no harsh taste to either paste and didn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> That may just be because I have a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You brush using the purple tube (marked 1) for one minute.</li>
            <li> but once you get step 2 on and spit and rinse it all out, your teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Also I like Red Bull that doesn’t really help to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I justify it as the whitening power in action.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped my teeth feel cleaner than regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li> have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I was surprised that i could see some results.</li>
            <li> convinced my husband to use the product with me because I professionally had my teeth bleached five years ago.</li>
            <li> Now I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My gum line was white and irritated the whole time I used this product</li>
            <li> My sensitive gums were not irritated by the product</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth are fairly sensitive, so it may not be an issue for others.</li>
            <li> daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 contains stannous fluoride, which can stain teeth, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble there.</li>
            <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t replace a professional whitening treatment, it&#x27;s probably the easiest thing to incorporate into your routine to get your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I just figured I was too sensitive for whitening products.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would criticize is that I wish it stated on step 2 (the whitening finisher) how much of the whitening product to put on the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> My fear was the regular teeth would look much whiter and brighter than the teeth with fillings.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised I was not one of them.</li>
            <li> For some reason, Crest uses something in their products that makes my gums and soft tissue slough off.  </li>
            <li> There are no messy trays to fill or strips to line up.</li>
            <li> Just old fashioned brushing.</li>
            <li> far, this is working well</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive mouth and the inside of my mouth wasn&#x27;t irritated at all by this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a week then took a break because my teeth were just too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My old toothpaste is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> So if you want to try a whitening product that will work and not make your teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> It seemed to take several days before the whitening even took effect, but yes, it did whiten, just not as much as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I just really like this two step system from Crest 3D White.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Since I never used whitening treatments before, my gums may be sensitive.</li>
            <li> It did make my gums sensitive</li>
            <li> Looking at the ingredients I was worried about the hydrogen peroxide in the whitening polish as i have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This is actually round two for me in terms of whitening toothpastes, courtesy of Bzz Agent and Crest who sent the toothpaste to me to try for free.  </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive teeth)</li>
            <li> have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> , therefore I thought my teeth would be sensitive to this, however, they were not.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li> far as results go, I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 weeks now</li>
            <li> The maximum results achieved really depend on how often you use the product and if you do so properly.</li>
            <li> After a week of use as suggested, my gums did indeed become sensitive.</li>
            <li> but I am still sticking with it to complete the tubes.</li>
            <li> They became sore and sensitive, and even bled from the whitening solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so far is the taste of step two.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not that sensitive but after doing this treatment for a couple weeks they started to become.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a professional whitening.  </li>
            <li> I was most concerned about the toothpaste being sensitive on my teeth, which it was not, at least so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort and the only reason I gave the product a 9 rather than a 10 is because the first two times I used the polish, I got some pretty noticeable white spots on my gums above my front teeth.</li>
            <li> Felt like I had just returned home from a professional teeth cleaning at the dental office.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> After using this product for a short time, my teeth are brighter, smoother, polished and ready for my 35th class</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> product promises that it keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish with daily use 4 weeks after a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a timer or clock near me when I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I did not experience any tingling or sensitive teeth which is another benefit of whitening gradually.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they are pearly white, but they are much brighter than they were before using this product.</li>
            <li> There are no miracles here so far</li>
            <li> I’m a mom to young kids</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth.</li>
            <li> thats really gets your teeth clean,then you move on to step 2 without rinsing,you apply the second product to your teeth and brush.</li>
            <li> affect sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> But cannot stand how sensitive my teeth are now.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this is just a marketing scheme to get users to use twice as much toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used this product thrice and the second tube caused me to gag each time-cannot use it safely-I really tried...</li>
            <li> My teeth do not seem to change color with any whitening products including professional.</li>
            <li> It claims that it deep cleans, and keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive gums and teeth</li>
            <li> Each time I use the system, my teeth feel like they do after a professional cleaning at a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to try the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System compliments of Crest and BzzAgent!  </li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> As a treat to myself since I stopped smoking 4 years ago, I&#x27;ve gotten my teeth professionally whitened once a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, I have extremely sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It was completely cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> I found I concentrated on really brushing my teeth for the entire length of time.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> This product is not for anyone with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really think that my teeth are getting a lot whiter from this Crest 3D White</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> was surprised it was a 2 step process</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Within a week my mom noticed and asked if I had to teeth professionally whitened.  </li>
            <li> maybe they can make it in a sensitive version but</li>
            <li> I tell everyone I know about the products I get to test, this by far has been one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again in the future!</li>
            <li> So , with this being said, I could possibly be expecting way too much.</li>
            <li> I noticed a considerable difference after just a week.</li>
            <li> While I like the results, I am a busy mom and the two step process</li>
            <li> but after a week, I looked at the before picture of my teeth and the after using Crest 3D White for one week and really see a difference.</li>
            <li> After the 2nd step the bottom front of my tongue was really stinging.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference after one use, but I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> , it makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> I think if I did it would absolutely make a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whiten but have used the crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li> At the same time, he is very diligent with his teeth and getting dental  cleanings,</li>
            <li> It did make my gums sensitive</li>
            <li> , i can see some of the result just within these couple of weeks, i will continue using them for the whole month and come back for a follow up result.</li>
            <li> I have never had professional whitening done in the dentists office.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really surprised at how well it whitens and how soon I started getting results - after using Crest 3D Brilliance for just a couple of days</li>
            <li> Then spit don&#x27;t rinse, put step two on your tooth brush and brush for at least one more minute.</li>
            <li> I followed the usage instructions, but didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the color of my teeth after using several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Much easier to use then the white strips and easier too.</li>
            <li> I would have to say I am not a fan of how sensitive it made my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> My gums were sensitive throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really simple, works really well</li>
            <li> The one problem I do have with it is my teeth seem overly sensitive now.</li>
            <li> The product promises that it keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish with daily use 4 weeks after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am definitely surprised that this product has worked so well for me.</li>
            <li> have no streaks, no discoloration and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> and WOW...</li>
            <li> My teeth are not as white as I would like, but I don&#x27;t care too much about whitening strips</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-step system is simple and very comparable to just brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> and my teeth were so sensitive it hurt to even breathe with my mouth</li>
            <li> however it made my teeth sensitive again</li>
            <li> So far none of that.</li>
            <li> Each product has left me unsatisfied-whether it was from the shade of my teeth or to how much my teeth hurt afterwards.</li>
            <li> I wish I was kidding with that, but that&#x27;s how sensitive my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a professional whitening done before, but I can almost bet by the time I&#x27;m done, it would be close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> It takes maybe 15 seconds longer than using regular toothpaste and its so much easier than the strips or gel to leave on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> it if would cause my teeth to be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whitened</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee drinker with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Of course my teeth are their whitest after brushing and not after drinking tea, but I see distinct benefits from doing a whitening regimen so regularly since I have this tea habit that is constantly staining my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes it feels like extra work to do the second step as well, but worth it if you want results.</li>
            <li> It has a gritty chemically taste but with time I did get used to it and can definitely see a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> Not through the four weeks yet so time will only tell if it actually works as promised and is worth the price (thankfully I #GotItFree).</li>
            <li> Although it takes dedication to use TWO different toothpaste products, the extra effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have heavily stained teeth, I do drink more than one hit of coffee daily</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White definitely whitens your smile.</li>
            <li> both felt that anyone who brushes their teeth for a minimum of 2 minutes each time they brush will likely see at least some kind of whitening regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li> In just the time it takes to brush my teeth, I&#x27;ve been not only deep cleaning my teeth, I&#x27;ve also been gradually whitening my smile.</li>
            <li> Noticed a change- not completely white but a definite brighter smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if someone in your family doesn&#x27;t have the patience for whitening strips this could be a good alternative, but for me, ill stick w whitening</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty gross, and my mouth feels a little dry after I brush with both tubes, but I think this toothpaste has more benefits to offer then drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on how white my teeth are &amp; people think I get them professionally whitened!!!</li>
            <li> I like that the whole process takes two minutes- certainly not too much time to ask.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this whitening system, but felt that the actual results fell a little flat.</li>
            <li> Left my teeth feeling very clean, with a little tingle of freshness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached a photo with before (left) &amp; after (right) photos to show my personal results.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to anyone looking to gradually whiten their teeth without the expense of a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> However, after using it 5 times (not even consecutively) I developed an extreme sensitivity in 2 teeth that is still present 2 week later (but it is getting better).</li>
            <li> I quickly found that the system didn&#x27;t lengthen my dental routine much longer than usual.</li>
            <li> For not having to do anything extra than just brushing for the 2 minutes you normally would anyway, I will take it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to whiten my teeth as they are a little stained just through all the sodas, coffees and teas that I drink.</li>
            <li> Pros so far: motivates me to brush for a full 2 minutes and twice a day, not bad tasting, gentle whitening, not messy, not an extra product or time spent (just usual teeth brushing which you should be doing anyway.</li>
            <li> size of the tubes are large enough to last an individual user for about 2-3 months (twice a day use)&lt;br /&gt;-Step 1 is pretty thorough in it&#x27;s cleansing power (makes teeth literally squeaky</li>
            <li> It is an easy 2 step system that takes no longer than your usual brushing time.</li>
            <li> I use other Crest 3D White products and I was very excited to try the Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, which I received from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Going to the dentist to get the trays and making special trips when you run out of the whitening gel can be a hassle and costly especially when there are options now like this Crest 3D White Brilliance Duo which delivers similar results.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference, and that motivated me to use it twice a day, which improved my previous tooth brushing routine.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was looking for a miracle working - magic toothpaste sent down from God above and expected way too much from two tubes...</li>
            <li> But once you get the system down it goes quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to give up coffee for whiter teeth, but I am always looking for a toothpaste that will brighten my smile.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren’t sparkling white, but I haven’t finished the total program yet, still have more than half a tube left, so I will update this later when I see the final results, but I just wanted to say it absolutely and quickly makes an obvious difference.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hate sucralose, have flawless, strong teeth, and only wish to lift everyday stains (like coffee), this may work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it hard in the past to find a whitening product that works and still has great</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about using two different products to clean my teeth, but after just the first use, I was hooked!</li>
            <li> The Credt 3D system also leaves my mouth and teeth feeling so clean and hasn&#x27;t caused any sensitivity as other whitening products have in the passed!!</li>
            <li> One other comment that I do have about this product is that it does take a little bit more time than just using a normal whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I received the brand new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for testing purposes thanks for Crest.</li>
            <li> My mouth always felt EXTREMELY clean, although a bit dry, after each brushing and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and look whiter after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Someone with less yellow or coffee stain could possibly have better results.</li>
            <li> I have tried the white strips before and they are super annoying, so this was a great product to try.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some people complain about sensitivity and problems using this particular system so users should be cautious, but I havee personally has no problems.</li>
            <li> Not being able to rise after brushing with the first step was really weird .</li>
            <li> The first seems like a standard Crest toothpaste and the second tube</li>
            <li> It worked especially well since I do not have &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; teeth - my lower incisors particularly overlap.</li>
            <li> which is exactly how the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System makes your teeth feel and look!!!</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a 2.3 ounce tube of &amp;#34;whitening finisher&amp;#34; that has several ingredients, but the main powerhouse is the Hydrogen Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think what it is mainly doing is zapping the bacteria in your mouth that can cause your teeth to go yellow -</li>
            <li> This is the first toothpaste-like product I&#x27;ve found that actually produces whitening results in over a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive some Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing cream to try.</li>
            <li> I regularly use a whitening toothpaste and felt like my teeth were pretty white.</li>
            <li> This product has some pretty big claims that definitely set the bar as how to how well it was supposed to perform.</li>
            <li> just starting up, I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee than usual.</li>
            <li> In addition, my normally non-sensitive teeth and gums were suddenly cut up and sensitive after using this product.  </li>
            <li> so usually when using a product like this I have to discontinue, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with Crest 3D White :)</li>
            <li> This is the first whiting product that I actually see results, but the it does turn my gums white and does hurt after brushing.</li>
            <li> I noticed a big improvement and with steady use for about three weeks now, my teeth are continuing to whiten and brighten -</li>
            <li> Not all &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; white better, but definitely a few shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White definitely held up to it&#x27;s claim; there was a noticeable difference within the first use.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the product, plus it didn&#x27;t bother my teeth like similar products have in the past.</li>
            <li> I would probably suggest you read through the ingredients and make sure that you are fine with all the active ingredients which may be a little harsh for sensitive teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy for me to just incorporate a little extra time for both steps.</li>
            <li> It does have a different taste compared to normal toothpaste, but I am willing to have a different taste for sparkly white teeth!</li>
            <li> After using this system for a few days I honestly have to say this is the only whitening system in which i have seen actual visual results of my teeth showing whiter in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> Step 1 provides deep cleaning and although it tastes a little gritty, it is worth the extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li> After the first week and a half, I did notice a little tenderness in my gums above my top two front teeth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it as your main whitening product, however, as someone who has used Crest White Strips in the past, this has proved t be a fantastic way to keep up the effects of the strips.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like and initially my teeth were sensitive but after a few uses were fine.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of just two minutes to help whiten my teeth due too drinking coffee and tea daily, however Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily &amp; Cleansing Whitening System is making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Luckily I got a free sample from Bzz Agent because I had given up trying them after 100 fails.</li>
            <li> Has a slight sandy texture that about really scrubs all of the gunk from your teeth, while still being gentle.</li>
            <li> It is hard to put in words just how THRILLED I am with the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in the color and could see that it was working, but my teeth got very sensitive and I ended up switching back to my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The first step left my mouth feeling dry, a bit dull, and like I really needed to brush my teeth with something that would clean them.</li>
            <li> Although this flavor was only in the first step, and the second had more of a neutral flavor, it was hard to reach for the second step and keep brushing when my tongue was screaming for some bubblegum flavored children&#x27;s mouthwash to neutralize the sting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to that flavor as I highly dislike it, but this was very minor here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you should really brush your teeth for that long anyway.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much product, either, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It was interesting to say the least, but it was a mental indicator that maybe it was working really well.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my teeth are a bit more sensitive than before using this product.</li>
            <li> It takes the same amount of time as my normal tooth brushing process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two step process seemed like a time consuming hassle at first, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> and my gums are going back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products in the past, and each had its own problems.</li>
            <li> I also am a heavy coffee drinker and that too has left a color to my teeth that I wasn&#x27;t able to get removed over the coarse of time.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a deep cleansing toothpaste that you brush with as you normally would for 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> it does not take any extra time during my normal morning and night time brushing routine.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried at first because my teeth are so sensitive and other products tend to hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the system is good, but i am not sure if i would purchase it, as it is slightly expensive for less than exceptional results.</li>
            <li> I normally use Aquafresh deep cleaning toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening products in the past and haven&#x27;t always liked them.</li>
            <li> It also hurt my gums the first week, so I would be careful to avoid brushing your gums as it can irritate them.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 (polish) can irritate the gums at first (I only used it every other day in the beginning until my gums were acclimated to being stimulated more than usual).  </li>
            <li> Its the same as many other similar Crest Pro-health or 3D series, it&#x27;s probably the taste of the specific ingredient</li>
            <li> It goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> People kept asking me how long it took to use, so I told them it takes less than 5 minutes, but you get very quick results.</li>
            <li> Now, the difference is not greatly dramatic, but it&#x27;s enough to make me purchase a second kit!</li>
            <li> I did notice, troublingly, that a tiny portion of my gums (the part right where my front two teeth meet) turned WHITE one day after I brushed.</li>
            <li> is a little harder to squeeze out and the  taste is not the most optimal.</li>
            <li> The whitener has a very mild taste which is hard to describe -</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, i was a little upset, because it cut my normal tooth</li>
            <li> There is not a true minty flavor that you are used to with regular toothpaste and step one is more gritty and step two is more like a thin gel.</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid that using a whitening product would make my already sensitive teeth MORE sensitive</li>
            <li> I am lucky because I have abnormally white teeth already, due to not drinking coffee, tea, wine, or smoking,</li>
            <li> I felt that the taste of the product was very tolerable, unlike other whitening toothpastes, but it did make my gums very sensitive, and I stopped using it after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Husband tried it and has noticed a new shade of white to his teeth.</li>
            <li> After using Crest&#x27;s new polish for only three weeks, my plaque and stains disappeared!</li>
            <li> Like I said that’s a big claim, and didn’t know if it would live up to that.</li>
            <li> I have a new staple in my daily routine and am beyond thrilledwith my results.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was chomping at the bit to try a new whitening product as a few months ago I had a negative experience with a professional whitening product purchased through a dentist’s office.</li>
            <li> They either only focus on whitening and your teeth don&#x27;t feel so clean or they are so harsh that they leave your teeth so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Even using just once a day, I still saw results within three days and after over month, my teeth definitely looked less yellow and more white.</li>
            <li> I really thought that it would be too much extra effort to do a second toothpaste twice a week</li>
            <li> When I saw the BzzAgent Campaign for the Crest #D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing system I was very eager because this is the product that I have been searching for.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush runs for an exact amount of time, so I have to stop it in the middle (after guessing how long it&#x27;s been) and then start it up again, whereupon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried had a very bleach-y tasting whitening gel, and it actually tasted a lot like Crest white strips.</li>
            <li> It made my teeth a shade whiter and added a slightly brighter smile.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it would be too much of a hassle to use two different tooth pastes</li>
            <li> I have had the privilege to use 3D Crest White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I drink several cups of coffee daily, so I need a realistic whitening solution that won&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really would recommend this product especially for anyone who drinks a lot of coffee, tea or red wine.</li>
            <li> have had professional whitening done by my dentist, followed up by the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; at home solutions used with my professional dentist tray to keep my teeth white as they do start to fade over time, regardless of whether you had it done at a dentist or not.</li>
            <li> Never happened again, especially when I realized that I had actually had too much of the gel on my brush that time.</li>
            <li> I started using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system and realized how much whiter my teeth could be.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the taste of the gel (2nd step).</li>
            <li> Step 1 seemed like regular toothpaste and had a similar &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; It did not seem to get very bubbly.</li>
            <li> Using this 2-step system is so much easier since all I have to do is just add a second tube to my daily brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that big of a difference is my teeth, I&#x27;d rather use crest white strips while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> I have hidden my teeth when I smile.</li>
            <li> As someone who wants to maintain a white smile, but not a huge fan of the cost of strips or professional systems, I am officially planning on using this system regularly, to maintain my pearly whites!</li>
            <li> taste is okay-its kind of plain and perhaps a little peroxide-y tasting.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled for the product at first because I have tried whitening my teeth with other products but never got much results and usually left my teeth very sensitive to cold stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with me, but I have not used it regularly because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I havent tried a product like this before because I have very sensitive and crooked teeth</li>
            <li> and I smoke, so I was very skeptical, however I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference, plus I&#x27;ve received many comments on how white my teeth look!!</li>
            <li> If possible, I would recommend using a small toothbrush to provide you with more precision (if such a thing exists).</li>
            <li> I do know that can be a major issue for some when using a whitening solution.</li>
            <li> I had negative experiences with tooth whitening products in the past and am happy to report that was not the case with Crest 3D White toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find it objectionable, neither did I have any major sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This takes about 1 minute longer than usual tooth brushing, because you are brushing with the toothpaste for 2 minutes, then the gel for about a minute, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> It is a really simple two step system: first you brush your teeth with the step 1 deep cleansing toothpaste which deep cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had no other problems with it after that.</li>
            <li> I do not usually use Crest Products and will not be using this one in the future either.</li>
            <li> This is the first teeth whitening product I have ever used, and I can&#x27;t compare it to any other whitening product out in the market.</li>
            <li> first few times I used it I did have some moderate whitening of my gums that really freaked me out.</li>
            <li> it is kind of hard to hold an already used toothbrush in one hand and try to get the cap off with the other.</li>
            <li> i enjoyed using the crest 3D white daily cleansing and whitening system and after a few days I actually saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Although whitening is a nice result, I found that having to brush in two steps daily was a bit tedious especially in the mornings when I was rushing to get ready for work.</li>
            <li> Other whitening products are a single step easy, simple, and done.</li>
            <li> At day ten, my gums started to get a little sensitive, so I went back to my regular toothpaste until they felt better, then returned to the Crest 3D White Brilliance Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that are far more expensive and don&#x27;t compare to the clean, white results that this product provides.</li>
            <li> The price may seem a little hefty, but I think it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> This by far is better than any other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It did seem to whitening my teeth a little but the accompanying teeth sensitivity wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I have seen a subtle change in my teeth color although believe with  continued use they will get more white.</li>
            <li> Though it may take a little longer than normal brushing, since you are using a two step process, I found that it really helped me to brush while watching tv....</li>
            <li> When I first received the product I was a little worried that it would make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> Typically, I use Crest 3D White Luxe (Diamond Strong) to not only keep my teeth white but to strengthen my enamel.</li>
            <li> No issues, and I generally have these with whitening products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather do minor maintenance daily than use whitening strips for 30 minutes per day.</li>
            <li> After a minute, and without rinsing, I brushed again for another minute with the “whitening finisher,” a clear gel polish.</li>
            <li> 2 is a clear gel like finisher that actually makes mouth wash</li>
            <li> I have only been using it about 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li> and I will purchase it in the near future when I am out of it!</li>
            <li> Then you use the white tube (marked 2) for one minute.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth as white as the whitestrips, but it doesn&#x27;t leave them as sensitive either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GoSmile for the longest time to maintain my teeth from getting too far on the yellow side.</li>
            <li> Now if theu decide to make one for sensitive teeth I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> Impressions: I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far</li>
            <li> As far as whitening goes, the idea is that the second whitening finisher has hydrogen peroxide in it, and that&#x27;s what giving you the whitening.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would completely replace my regular toothpaste but would use this instead of whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been trying to achieve a whiter smile and nothing I&#x27;ve tried seems to really give you any visual results</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest 3D White for about 9 days so far</li>
            <li> but I just wish they had this same product, but specifically for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The sensitivity was either from cut gums or related to the professional fluoride treatment I used.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will skip whitening immediately after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> So I was pleasantly surprised that Crest 3D White didn&#x27;t burn my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dentist prescribed trays but those left my teeth sensitive for days.</li>
            <li> So I stopped the treatment and went back to my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Just after a week it was such a noticeable difference that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all users especially those who suffer from genetic plaque build up and consumers who have naturally yellower teeth.</li>
            <li> but now they are white, and this is all thanks to Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System!</li>
            <li> The two step system only requires 2 minutes of brushing, which you should be doing already anyways, and is not messy like trays and whitening strips that take 30 minutes to work.  </li>
            <li> but I never expected it to.  </li>
            <li> far as whitening, it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I could see a marked difference in the shade of my teeth, within several days of use.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem, though, with the second step, the gel, making my gums sensitive after repeated use.</li>
            <li> and it seems I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a regular whitening paste that works anywhere near as well as this combo.</li>
            <li> So far, I can say how simple this system is to use.</li>
            <li> I will update with a before and after picture when I&#x27;m further into the process, but so far, pending results, I would recommend this system to anyone trying to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> When the Crest Pro Health HD system didn&#x27;t produce sparkling white results, I was really hoping that the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System would step it up.</li>
            <li> Four stars for MAINTENANCE whitening of your pearly whites... &amp;#34;Maintenance&amp;#34; being the operative word with this two step Crest 3D White Brilliance daily toothpaste and whitening gel because I have been using this product twice day day for 2 minutes EACH application and have really only noticed that it has kept my teeth as white as when I applied it for the first time almost 20 days ago.</li>
            <li> I found my teeth to be cleaner and whiter much quicker than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see such whitening results.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White helped, but didn&#x27;t completely whiten the stains.</li>
            <li> So I support this product, but people with naturally sensitive teeth need to find a different way to whiten.</li>
            <li> Its a two step processes that you brush then do not rinse til you complete the second step.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from using this product because I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips before and they are clumsy and inconvenient to use and not all that effective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any point in whitening teeth not visible especially since they became sensitive.</li>
            <li> Claiming to keep your teeth up to 99% as white as a professional polish/teeth whitening treatment, this product makes some tall claims.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use the Crest 3D White, my mouth feels like I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> It comes with two different toothpaste you use them in the order they are marked.</li>
            <li> As my two front teeth are veneers, I have a problem with keeping the teeth around them white enough to look normal.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste as my normal every day toothpaste and used it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> but I have pretty sensitive teeth and usually have to use a sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past few weeks once a day and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> I received a box of the Credt 3D whitening system and I was already kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li> But I feel like it&#x27;s removed a thin top layer of stain.</li>
            <li> That was not the case, the taste is kind of a faint Minty, chalky taste.</li>
            <li> Even after a few uses I noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I received a box of the Credt 3D whitening system and I was already kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li> The taste was ok but not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that when I first began using Crest 3D Whitening System, my teeth did not become overly sensitive, as was my experience in the past using whitening strips.</li>
            <li> The system also brightened and whitened my smile after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> but truthfully when I&#x27;m tired and want to go to bed, I just want to brush.</li>
            <li> I did notice a little more of a &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; feeling with this paste than my previous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit of a pain using two different pastes, but I got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I followed the easy two steps to a whiter smile but man that taste was hard to get past.</li>
            <li> It states right on the label that it may leave small white spots on the gums, but that&#x27;s normal and they will go away.</li>
            <li> As soon as I can afford the new crown, I will definitely use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a while now</li>
            <li> Definitely considering this as a new part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This new Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 tube system is simply put...AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> I was provided a box of the New Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Thus I am blown away by the new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to do a professional whitening system.</li>
            <li> My gums have gotten a few white spots which disappear quickly, but no sensitivity yet.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty sensitive and when I would use other whitening products, they would get SUPER sensitive to the point of avoiding anything cold or hot.</li>
            <li> It was odd to have to spit after using the first tube of toothpaste without rinsing.</li>
            <li> After trying this I noticed after the first couple of times that I could see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> At first the product irritated my gums in a couple of places, but with less vigorous brushing this problem went away.</li>
            <li> Crest 3d White Brilliance Daily Cleansing system DOES NOT MAKE MY TEETH SENSITIVE!</li>
            <li> I feel it worked better than other whitening products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and my teeth are pretty yellow and stained due to this.</li>
            <li> As I said, I am an avid user of other Crest 3D white line products, so I am not for or against this company in any way.</li>
            <li> My favorite part was that this didn&#x27;t hurt my gums like other whiteners have in the past.</li>
            <li> Strips and trays that I&#x27;ve used in the past also offer quick results, but this product was easier to use AND contributed to my dental health.</li>
            <li> The product provided me with a really deep down clean feeling that lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> The product was a little hard to get used to because it made my mouth kind of burn.</li>
            <li> The two step process is not a big difference from my regular one step brushing routine, and doesn’t really require any extra brushing time (2 mins total?</li>
            <li> The step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste like straight peroxide like other products.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste itself doesn&#x27;t really bother my teeth (other whitening toothpastes do)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing and Whitening System for the past two weeks since I received it from BzzAgent and Crest for free to try and provide feedback.</li>
            <li> So, then I skipped to every other day, and they still bothered me, but not as much.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that step two tastes a little bit too medicinal, but, overall the product still tastes better than other whitening solutions on the market.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after only a few times, but even after the first try my teeth felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> By incorporating into my daily brushing routine, I&#x27;m consistently whitening with minimal effort another big plus in my book.#GotitFree #PowerCouple</li>
            <li> set is nice because it&#x27;s completely manageable, takes hardly any extra effort, and doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth feeling raw from over-brushing.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very yellow due to being given high doses of antibiotics when I was young.</li>
            <li> So I got this for free thanks to bzzagent and crest and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I also was expecting a more dramatic difference in my teeth,  </li>
            <li> : The toothpaste texture is very similar to all of Crest&#x27;s toothpaste and the whitener is a clear gel that reminds me of the product on the back of Crest Whitestrips, but in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s safe and not as expensive as seeing a professional.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing about the same results I get from a regular whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have two boxes of different types of white strips collecting dust in my medicine cabinet because they make my teeth so sensitive they feel &amp;#34;see-through&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Prior teeth whiting treatments have led my teeth to become extra sensitive, but I have not noticed an increase in tooth sensitivity with use of this product.</li>
            <li> I still feel like my old whitening toothpaste is easier with the same results, but they are the same brand</li>
            <li> step 2, the whitener kind of left a weird taste in my mouth, but after rinsing, it went away.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s worth doing for a few weeks at a time and then going back to something else.</li>
            <li> but I have no complaints about the taste, had no burning or irritation and no dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has the same refreshing taste as you would expect from Crest, but the step 2 polishing agent has a strange taste and left my mouth feeling a little dry.  </li>
            <li> &amp; my teeth are already 2 shades whiter and aren&#x27;t super sensitive like other professional whitening systems I&#x27;ve used in the past from the dentist with the whitening trays and gels, or with the over the counter whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Crest cleansing kits in the past and was curious how effective this one would be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the crest white strips in the past and was excited to try something that seems along the same lines, and included in my routine already, but quicker than the strips.</li>
            <li> I did get a little gum tenderness the first couple of days</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re in separate tubes and there&#x27;s not the same amount of product in each tube, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using more of one than the other.</li>
            <li> The Crest took a little getting used to because it was rather abrasive on my gums at first.</li>
            <li> No other toothpaste has ever made me feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> On the first day, I did have a little sensitivity but have not had any since then.</li>
            <li> After the first day or two, I could only see minimal results and became even more skeptical but kept up with the two step brushing process.</li>
            <li> I have a crazy coffee habit and love tea and red wine, so even though they are pretty white, they could always use some help.  </li>
            <li> Usually I give up before I really see rests because my gums become very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I either did not want to be in pictures at all or did not smile in them very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not feel that the Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system whitened my teeth &amp;#34;99% as white as a professional polish.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I had to remind myself not to rinse the first few times after completing step 1.&lt;br /&gt;--Taste</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product i really noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> it caused or irritated a canker sore on my gum in the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> Have a whiter smile in just a few uses!</li>
            <li> At first, I found the product to be rather abrasive, leaving my gums sore, but after a few days of use, the soreness went away.</li>
            <li> and I have a soda everyday also, so my teeth where pretty stained when I started using this</li>
            <li> the first 2 days of using it that lasted just a few seconds after brushing.</li>
            <li> The first few days my gums had a stinging feeling.  </li>
            <li> it gives you a nice natural white without giving you that artificial glow.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this at first, because with lots of whitening systems, they can be harsh and abrasive to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that you need to be careful when using the whitening product,  try to avoid it touching your gums,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Colgate Total White which kept my teeth clean, but never very bright.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I have noticed much whitening over the last few weeks, but that being said, I still like this toothpaste based on the mint flavor and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of their other whitening products in the past, such as white strips and whitening mouthwash, but was excited to try this new</li>
            <li> The only down side is it may be a little strong for some to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> My teeth seem a little whiter after 3 weeks, but they were pretty white to begin with</li>
            <li> But other than that it was a decent product.</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty bad for toothpaste, barely minty, and it has a kind of bitter taste.</li>
            <li> It does seem to make my mouth somewhat dry but other than that it was not difficult.</li>
            <li> It does seem to make my mouth somewhat dry but other than that it was not difficult.</li>
            <li> When I was selected to receive this product I was so excited because I have only used whitening strips in the past and did not like how long that lengthened my cleaning routine each day.  </li>
            <li> every one has noticed the new whiter teeth and have asked if I spent a fortune at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> As a smoker and coffee drinker (by coffee drinker, I mean I drink a gallon a day), I&#x27;m in some serious need of a good teeth whitener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whose to blame for that, but it is a turn off right off</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White seems to be the answer, by adding a simple little step to my normal brushing routine, and with no harsh side effects.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a much cheaper alternative than professional teeth whitening which I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> I did have a slight burning sensation on my gums once or twice while using this, but not so much as to dissaude me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not super brighten fast.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight improvement in the whitening of my teeth but really didn&#x27;t care for the taste or side effects of the gel.</li>
            <li> After the first few weeks of using this product my teeth have become several shades whiter, which was what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I did not have any sensitivity or negative side effects, just not the quick results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> And I used step 2 (the whitening paste) only on my teeth visible when I smile (those usually covered by whitening strips).</li>
            <li> :  While brushing, I notice certain spots in my mouth hurt a little.</li>
            <li> However, I still only noticed minor color change, definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to professional dental whitening services.</li>
            <li> the crest 3d white really works and is easier to use than I previously thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Its only 2 steps so its not a very long time consuming routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a few weeks now and have nothing but positive things to say about it.</li>
            <li> It took a little over a week and before I noticed a difference, but even my husband remarked how much brighter my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> The flavor was a little intense for me</li>
            <li> This system is very much like the Crest HD system I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit gritty in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t get very foamy, but it does leave my teeth feeling</li>
            <li> At first it was a little strange to get used to a 2 part system, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> but if they smile really wide, you can see that the teeth a little farther back are discolored?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to tell them that it was less expensive than that and painless too!</li>
            <li> My teeth and usually very sensitive to whitening products, and this two-part system hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort or pain to my teeth like other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when first trying this product as all other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes I have tried in the past were less than great.</li>
            <li> After the first few days I noticed my mouth was absurdly dry, but kept shrugging it off as the weather.  </li>
            <li> I think the texture is very similar to regular toothpaste, but if you are sensitive to texture it might not be recommended due to the mixture of the taste and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only down side for me, is I have very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> did not have any issues with staining or sensitive due to this</li>
            <li> I have used professional whitening and other over the counter products.</li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to off tastes, so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t bother other folks.</li>
            <li> My mouth is quite sensitive to extremely minty toothpaste, so</li>
            <li> I do have confidence in this product, just use extreme caution if you have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The only negative of this product is that it is a little strong and tends to burn my mouth after completing both steps.</li>
            <li> The other problem that I had with past products was that I was concerned that my teeth were not being adequately cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency to brush hard, and learned within the first couple days of using the product that I definitely couldn&#x27;t continue to do that.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth that can&#x27;t handle much whitening, but this product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least bit!</li>
            <li> I mean super dry.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean after i use it, and i think i may see a slight improvement in whiteness, but i am not totally sure.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve never found whitening toothpastes to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was brushing too vigorously or wasn&#x27;t used to brushing for so long, but I had sore gums at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nervous about doing this too frequently because the active ingredient in the deep-cleansing toothpaste is known to stain teeth.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> So simply and didn&#x27;t take long to use daily.</li>
            <li> The tube labeled #2 did give me some white spots on my gums and made them tingle, but this did not last long.</li>
            <li> I mean put down toothbrush and unscrew the top to the finisher and carefully</li>
            <li> Following the instructions turned my upper gums white in the single minute I used to brush; this is indicative of tissue damage.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I had a hard time with step #1 drying my mouth out.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time at first remembering not to rinse my toothbrush between steps</li>
            <li> In just a few short weeks of using the system twice a day in place of my normal toothpaste, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic improvement in the color of my smile!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I got this product from BzzAgent, but I gave it a shot because it was a free product thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and was a previous smoker who quit 5 years ago, so my teeth are not as white as I would like for them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Step 1, the deep cleaning paste, made my teeth feel polished, however, it left my mouth dry and it had no flavor.</li>
            <li> and I find I get very sensitive teeth after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I will also admit that I did not use the toothpaste all the time, as sometimes my lazy butt even thought two steps was too much work.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion for total wonderfulness would be a flip top cap on tube 2 since it&#x27;s a bit awkward to have to unscrew the cap while holding the toothbrush before brushing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my teeth really got whiter</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of consistent use, her teeth are at LEAST 4 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> Have tried the whitening strips in the past but the upkeep and cost was too much.  </li>
            <li> I found that it really helped keep my teeth whiter than before, even when I would eat stuff that usually stained.</li>
            <li> It might sound silly but it definitely was a confidence boost, especially since I work with people</li>
            <li> ... Maybe they left it on too long?</li>
            <li> like the directions were lacking in terms of if you should replacing brushing twice a day with this product or just once (I have been doing at night only) and also how long you can/should continue use of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally yellow teeth and have been a long time drinker of coffee and tea</li>
            <li> The price is steep, however since it comes packaged like toothpaste it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the texture strange, but the taste is stranger.</li>
            <li> I would say the only minor drawbacks for this product is the tube for the whitener</li>
            <li> My results have been the same as the whitening strips, but without the sensitivity or need to leave anything on for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any whitening effects, But I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue to use it long enough to finish the kit off.</li>
            <li> Although the two-step process seemed daunting (and somewhat annoying) at first, it actually wasn&#x27;t much of a hindrance, and the deep cleaning step really felt like it was cleaning well.</li>
            <li> In order for this product to work, you must use it twice a day everyday, just like what you should already do as your normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m disappointed because of how much I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> The instructions on the back of the tube say to use each for one minute, but I probably do a little extra with step one and a little less with step two because my teeth have been pretty sensitive to the peroxide in the whitener.</li>
            <li> only take a little over 2 minutes to complete the process.</li>
            <li> The only downside is my teeth can sometimes be sensitive, and using it twice a day aggravated my teeth a little.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people who have sensitive teeth and want a little extra whitening boost.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was a little skeptical before trying this product.</li>
            <li> The 2 steps crest system works very well, however I found that it is very harsh on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is priced lower than the majority of other teeth whitening products and only requires you to brush your teeth for two minutes.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less harsh on your teeth then other whitening products, and leaves your mouth extremely clean.</li>
            <li> I am a little surprised that I have seen some whitening!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed only a very minor difference with the color  </li>
            <li> However, it made it so bad that I couldnt brush my teeth without feeling like I was taking a knife to the most sensitive parts of my mouth.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t think this product really freshens breath.  </li>
            <li> And it cost hundreds of dollars less than for the professional treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was previously using a sensitive toothpaste before switching to the Two Step system.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the dry mouth you get after brushing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t really see a noticeable change in whiteness.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am glad I didn&#x27;t spent the money on this.</li>
            <li> If the results are about the same as just brushing with a normal whitening tooth past then there&#x27;s no reason to use a two step system.</li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally “whitened” years ago, and it was a waste of money as it simply didn’t work.  </li>
            <li> I have previously tried a similar product from Crest, called HD White, that worked in a similar way - two tubes for two different steps.</li>
            <li> just used the kit for about 2 weeks, im a big coffee and tea drinker, i will say this product is not really whiten my teeth as it said but it definitely brighten up a lot</li>
            <li> As strange as it sounds, I would recommend this to people, as long as they could return it to wherever they purchased it if a problem such as mine would arise.</li>
            <li> I took before and after images of my teeth to try to see an improved whiteness to my smile, but my after actually looked worse.  </li>
            <li> As of today after 2 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any obvious whitening but I will continue to use it in hopes that the results are just slow to appear.</li>
            <li> My teeth were a little sensitive to begin with and this actually made my gums SO sensitive that they would bleed a little each time.</li>
            <li> I used them a few years ago and they made my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I would use the product in the future, but I don&#x27;t think I would use the whitening agent every single day...</li>
            <li> The first toothpaste initially makes your mouth a little dry and since you aren&#x27;t supposed to rinse until after the second paste, your mouth gets a little dry.</li>
            <li> The process was a little weird at first - use the deep cleaning paste first, spit, *</li>
            <li> What attracted me to the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system was I checked it out and didn&#x27;t see anyone complain about tooth pain due to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Crest Whitening products in the past and this is the first time i had this reaction</li>
            <li> I can also say I have yet to experience any sensitivity or discoloration with the Crest 3D White daily cleaning kit that some other people have been noticing.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviews say it left white spots on their gums</li>
            <li> Using the 2 step system is very simple, taking the same amount of time and other toothpastes - 1 minute per paste.</li>
            <li> I do not particularly care for the taste of the step 2 gel, but following up with a mouthwash helps take care of that for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was Leary at first because adding an extra step to anything seems just dumb.</li>
            <li> There was a slight sensitivity that occur when I first starting using product, but it was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> They will never become white again but this product definitely make them less yellow and shinier.</li>
            <li> The stains I had due to my daily coffee intake was starting to fade.</li>
            <li> They either moved, made my teeth very sensitive, or just plain didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like this way better than any of the strip systems I&#x27;ve used in the past, as I feel this seems less irritating to my sensitive teeth as the strips used to be.</li>
            <li> Also, my mouth felt very dry for about ten minutes after using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and so far after using this product for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> It also made the &amp;#34;chewing&amp;#34; part of my molars a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I often deal with sensitive teeth and was a little worried about using it twice a day, but I have had no pain with this product.  </li>
            <li> fake white but CLEAN</li>
            <li> My teeth are at least a few shades whiter and feel so clean.</li>
            <li> This on the other hand really is not that time consuming, as it only adds one extra step than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> During the first few days, I saw no significant changes.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel is a little icky, but it&#x27;s really not bad considering.</li>
            <li> The only cons I found was that the deep cleansing toothpaste is a little gritty</li>
            <li> This paste is a little grainer then regular toothpaste, but taste similar to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I first tried the HD White by Crest which was a major fail for me</li>
            <li> and then proceeding to the next step for another minute was a little much for everyday use.</li>
            <li> But, you do kind of get used to it, and when you rinse with mouthwash the bad taste is gone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t see a huge change since I began usin.</li>
            <li> I am an avid diet soda drinker and know that it is not good for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> whitening paste is very thin and can come out of the tube very fast so be careful if you&#x27;re brushing after showering or if you&#x27;re in a room with high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about it because I herd a lot of people complaining their teeth became sensitive after  using whitening products</li>
            <li> Zoom whitening done at my dentists office, and with regular cleanings, I consider myself  to have an average shade of white teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried teeth whitening strips in the past, and found them not only to be time consuming, but somewhat damaging to my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that they were whitened but the definitely had that polished feel you get after a professional teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> results are the whitest cleanest feeling teeth I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> how long they lasted like that.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use as long as I am seeing these results.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time crest user and they out did themselves with this product</li>
            <li> I did experience some minor discomfort in my gums about a week in.</li>
            <li> Not sensitive, but tingly.</li>
            <li> This product made a noticeable difference in just a few days and did not hurt my sensitive</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The second tube wasn&#x27;t as tasty, but I expected that considering it was the whitening tube.</li>
            <li> While it did whiten my teeth, I feel like it was only a minimal whitening.</li>
            <li> Requires twice the brushing of similar products and yielded minimal results after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t feel like reading a long review:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really whitens&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I would also question the safety of long term use and the effects on the enamel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other at-home whitening kits are cumbersome and take a really long time to apply and to see results.</li>
            <li> Will it do any damage to your teeth long term?</li>
            <li> I will say that after using the deep cleaning toothpaste your teeth will feel rough</li>
            <li> It also made my teeth alittle sensitive after using it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> however it took so long to do,</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any long term sensitivity doing it this way.  </li>
            <li> It is really difficult to tell the difference between my before and after, so ultimately, I can&#x27;t rate the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System higher than 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker with 4 young kids and the whiting system</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the taste, it was bitter.</li>
            <li> I still have a long way to go</li>
            <li> It requires two steps which takes a bit of extra time, but not much.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical that the 3D Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system was a ploy by P&amp;G to make twice the profit off of the same product they already sell in a smaller tube.</li>
            <li> I might have gotten results sooner if I used it twice a day, but I wanted some of the safety of what I usually use to keep my teeth used to the normal.</li>
            <li> Be careful around your gum line as white splotches can appear if you hold your brush there too long.</li>
            <li> Be careful around your gum line as white splotches can appear if you hold your brush there too long.</li>
            <li> I backed down to use only once daily and</li>
            <li> The whitening part left a very strange, bitter taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The only con for this product, and the only thing that kept me from giving it 5/5, is that it does cause slight sensitivity.</li>
            <li> As a previous poster said, I did get white on my gums but that only happened once.</li>
            <li> However, I had to use warm water when rinsing my mouth at the end of brushing because cold water hurt my teeth and mouth and my mouth had a slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> With other whiteners my teeth felt extremely sensitive the next few days but not with this kit.</li>
            <li> To start let me say that our family usually buys Colgate toothpaste products but once in a while we get Crest so this was a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> The process itself was tedious and my teeth never really felt clean the entire time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, the product has worked well getting my teeth not only whiter but fresher and without the added time or mess.</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening products, but they have not been long lasting for me.  </li>
            <li> The first step is the cleaning process you brush like any other toothpaste, brush for at least one minute.</li>
            <li> I continued use twice a day for the entire month, and every time after brushing I was left with a sour after taste which I chased with mouthwash &amp; a very dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of whitening strips and gels in the past, and while they work, they would also leave my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes fine and wasn&#x27;t bad on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is actually numb or if my teeth have become more sensitive with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get sensitive teeth using products like these but have had no sensitivity problems as of yet!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several whitening toothpastes (Colgate, Rembrandt and other Crest pastes.).</li>
            <li> The only thing that would keep me from purchasing it again would be price in relation to other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Crest whitening systems (HD) and this system follows the same pattern.</li>
            <li> and I was only doing it every other day.</li>
            <li> I received this set in the mail as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, and have found it to be quite comparable to other Crest 3D White products.</li>
            <li> I was a little taken back by the gritty feeling that I had from using the cleansing paste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening products ranging from the trays to strips, but the only difference I noticed with them was chemical burns on my gums.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally a little white, but this product has helped get them pearly white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> i can only use the products for a couple of days due to sensitivity - sore gums.</li>
            <li> Before the product was sent to me, I ws considering purchasing some white strips or some other type of whitening product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had that same experience with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Simple 2-step process; brush with one, then polish with the other.  </li>
            <li> The step 1 product is similar to other Crest mint toothpastes and the step 2 product is a gel product that tastes like hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> My second use cause extreme sensitivity for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> My teeth, and my husband&#x27;s teeth have not been whiter since long ago!  </li>
            <li> It is a little burdensome to have it in 2 different tube, especially if you have to travel.</li>
            <li> Anyone can whiten their teeth with this product as long as you have 4 minutes a day and a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> other reviews had concerns about possible staining when using this product</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is a little gritty- similar to what the dentist uses and the whitener is applied over the paste after brushing and spitting out the excess, but not rinsing.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ll be curious to see is whether I have enough toothpaste and whitener as I get down to the last of it.</li>
            <li> After brushing for one minute with the Step One toothpaste I have noticed that my mouth feels very strange.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get dry moth or plaque at night</li>
            <li> Step 2 does help with the dry mouth</li>
            <li> Just brush dry with the contents of tube 1 for a minute, spit and then brush with the contents of tube 2 for another minute and then spit and rinse.</li>
            <li> After using this product you can expect to have a DRY mouth.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it though your mouth gets really dry from the toothpaste alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this kit before a few big events or when I feel like I need an extra boost of whiteness and cleanness.  </li>
            <li> They usually only work for a few short hours, then wear</li>
            <li> However, the results only seem to last for a few hours after brushing, so you have to maintain use of both steps.</li>
            <li> In fact, the spots did go away in a few hours and they never came back with any later usages.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one complaint, if you&#x27;d call it that, is that (as you can see in the photo I added) one lid completely twists off and one pushes open.  </li>
            <li> I can eat &amp; drink hot &amp; cold things like I normally would.</li>
            <li> Having used Crest whitestrips to achieve a set of white teeth, I find this system maintains the whiteness through everyday use of tea and red wine.</li>
            <li> , the second step has been a waste is my time over the last 4 weeks that I&#x27;ve used the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After just a few uses I feel there&#x27;s definitely an improvement over my prior all-in-one (including whitening) toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a moderate to heavy coffee drinker and definitely noticed</li>
            <li> At first try I was not very impressed with the taste.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations that this product was going to remove or at least lighten a stain on one of my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Not good since the product made my gums hurt after only a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that testing this Crest really made me appreciate my regular toothpaste, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which never hurts my gums.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to do this instead of my normal brushing.</li>
            <li> You get to feel this every single day with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first about trying the new Crest 3D White – Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System as other whitening products (except toothpastes) in the past have severely irritated my gums and caused unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li> Step two - the whitening agent is clear and has a small after taste of peroxide.</li>
            <li> Step two - the whitening agent is clear and has a small after taste of peroxide.</li>
            <li> But that system was a bit too harsh on my sensitive gums, so I had to use it for one brushing every other day instead of twice a day.</li>
            <li> This two-step system was gentle enough that I can only recall one time where my teeth felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> (hey I get up early and have small children) and my teeth have paid the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble with gum sensitivity (I usually do)</li>
            <li> So far this product is easier to use than the whitening strips of the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to people that have teeth sensitivity issues as this doesn&#x27;t leave doesn&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive as strips have done to me in the past.  </li>
            <li> The whitening experience is not painful or complicated.</li>
            <li> and at first I thought that would be annoying, but it doesn&#x27;t take any more time than usual.  </li>
            <li> sensitivity is minor and not very noticeable</li>
            <li> I actually almost turned this campaign down</li>
            <li> Having to use my regular toothpaste routine in between slowed down my results a bit.</li>
            <li> Same with the fact that when you stand them on their &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;, the print is upside down on step 2.  </li>
            <li> I cut down from using the toothpastes from 2 times a day to only one, but it was still causing irritation.</li>
            <li> However, after using this system regularly, my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner than they have with any other toothpastes!</li>
            <li> I did find my gums were slightly sensitive to cold water after using both steps, but it was not painful, just odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little confusing first thing in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it more than a few days due to sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> teeth were very dark and very yellow because of all the cola and tea I drink all day long.  </li>
            <li> I till today compared to the one I took initially, the yellowing is significantly less visible.</li>
            <li> so my teeth are not super white.</li>
            <li> I can only tolerate using it once a day, typically at night.</li>
            <li> After trying it for 18 days, I find that it has whitened my teeth only slightly.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not a big difference.</li>
            <li> Basically, I replaced my usual toothpaste for the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.</li>
            <li> I would say, for a slight daily brightening, this product works.</li>
            <li> hurting my gums or my teeth, and my teeth are sensitive to hot and cold, but when I used this 3D Crest Brilliance</li>
            <li> both had slight sensitivity issues, but for her it was not enough to stop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Crest Whitestrips in the past, but it was always such a pain to set aside time for the strips in addition to my regular oral care routine.</li>
            <li> I used this for weeks with no particular improvement.</li>
            <li> It only slightly made my teeth whiter</li>
            <li> I only noticed a slight whitening of the teeth</li>
            <li> it will burn slightly and temporarily turn them white.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty big fail for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any sensitivity issues like I&#x27;ve had with previous whitening products and that&#x27;s a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> The Step 1 part left an odd feeling my mouth as I was using it.</li>
            <li> never super white anyway.</li>
            <li> The peroxide does not give me strong cold sensitivity.</li>
            <li> but this product merely caused a mild tingling.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use a mouth guard, it was super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Supposedly, this can be due to improper brushing, but I had been very careful with following the directions and even using a timer when brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as someone who has had professional whitening done a few years ago when I felt like no whitening products worked.</li>
            <li> I only use the toothpaste once a day and take a day off every few days to use my sensitive teeth formula toothpaste so I am not sure how my teeth would react if I was using it 2 times a day as recommended.</li>
            <li> Had some irritation while using and had to use less frequently for a few days then resume the process.  </li>
            <li> Why waste hundreds of dollars at the dentist?cost hundreds of dollars less than for the professional treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am currently 3 months pregnant, and suffered through some bad pregnancy gingivitis during my last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> and I already see a pretty dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> When you get to stage 2 there is a little tingling feeling, and I thought it would leave my teeth feeling sensitive, but that&#x27;s all it was - a little tingling probably from the interaction of the 2 parts mingling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried other whitening systems like strips but they usually leave my gums and teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> but they still seemed a little yellow.</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were a little whiter, but I started out with fairly white teeth to begin with.</li>
            <li> The second paste, I admit, made my gums a little tingly.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t just whiter, but my mouth overall felt a little bit fresher.</li>
            <li> and it was actually making my gums hurt a little</li>
            <li> However, my teeth were not significantly whiter- just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I even brushed a little longer and used my electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have always used a daily whitening toothpaste, but my teeth were still looking look a little blah because I drink a lot of coffee.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Crest 3D White brilliance system for a little over a week</li>
            <li> But, my teeth are whiter, so I can deal with a little gross aftertaste.</li>
            <li> When I am in a hurry in the morning, adding an extra step to my brushing routine was a little bit of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> The only downside I found was it was a little drying to the mouth</li>
            <li> I found that Crest 3D White made my teeth look brighter and a little whiter.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I found the Crest 3 D White a little lack luster.</li>
            <li> While trying the 1st step, I noticed that my teeth felt a little gritty and they burned.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the 2nd step that taster a little funky</li>
            <li> I did feel a little burning or tingling while using the second paste</li>
            <li> , you might use it every other day, as it did increase sensitivity to my teeth which are not normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I’ve probably been drinking a little too much coffee lately, so</li>
            <li> is to remove the extreme dry mouth feeling that appears after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use more but the sensitivity to cold foods is just not worth it!</li>
            <li> The cardboard bottom could have gotten wet and possibly torn, but that is a little thing.</li>
            <li> I noticed around week 2 a slight whitening, not a major difference.</li>
            <li> I received the crest 3d white brilliance to try for free, the product isn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
            <li> The size of the product is enough to last at least 30 days (if used 2 times per day as instructed)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I like this so much more than messy, awkward strips or trays.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want that fake white look, or uneven whitening because my teeth are crooked, and I really didn&#x27;t want the baking soda taste.  </li>
            <li> Only a few minutes of brushing required.  </li>
            <li> : Whitening gel has a slightly bitter taste, but the mint overpowers it, so it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with the products I use.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that my teeth were brighter after only using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> There was a bit in the beginning and not much after that.</li>
            <li> Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected</li>
            <li> In a few short weeks my teeth are visibly whiter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed it actually whitening my teeth as I&#x27;ve continued to use it even though I drink coffee everyday</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product to people who do not enjoy the whitening strip method.</li>
            <li> Maybe I had to build up a tolerance, but my teeth have definitely whitened a few shades.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> The product was easier to use than expected.</li>
            <li> Only a few days after using this product I noticed my teeth getting whiter.</li>
            <li> When I saw that is was a 2 step system I thought that it was going to be complicated, but I was really surprised that it was simple and that you only had to brush with each product for 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> I started seeing a noticeable difference after only a few days.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had used an earlier Crest Whitening product, the Gel Strips.</li>
            <li> roughly so when doing it with this type of toothpaste it can cause gum abrasions.</li>
            <li> However, BE CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> My mornings are already so jammed pack</li>
            <li> Be careful when you brush this on because it can cause sensitivity and redness in your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a daily heavy coffee drinker so that may have something to do with it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using it for a few weeks now and we can definitely see a difference in the color of our teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for roughly four weeks.</li>
            <li> but if you use it for a few weeks you will definitely see and even feel a difference.</li>
            <li> They look whiter and brighter, and I noticed a difference after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I expected my teeth to be whiter but found that was not really the case.</li>
            <li> few last thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Heavy smokers or wine drinkers probably would have to use somewhat longer for the same results.</li>
            <li> so I would discontinue after only a few days.</li>
            <li> but you need to get all the tooth, not to mention your trying to obtain perfection on a wet surface.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days and tried again, with the same results.</li>
            <li> I however, do my dental cleanings, but i&#x27;m also rough on my teeth, I smoke, drink beer and wine, so this had something to work against.</li>
            <li> Not sure I needed to read instructions on a tooth paste tube, but apparently I do.</li>
            <li> My wife mentioned it to me a few days ago so that is a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my teeth with only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I expected that because I have problems with it anyway.</li>
            <li> so I expected that.</li>
            <li> That being said, maybe that is not what this product is designed to do, but it is part of what I expected from a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> only con would be it takes a few uses to get used to leaving step one on without rinsing before step two.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the taste of this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> I also found the second step to taste horribly and the consistency not so good.</li>
            <li> the 2 tube thing gets kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth will fill a little strange and dry like you need a drink of water for a bit after you use the kit.</li>
            <li> I have long term illnesses that have left me with moderate periodontal disease, which has led to weak gums and five lost teeth.</li>
            <li> When it came down to the whitening portion of my teeth, I discovered that my teeth only slightly whitened.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Crest in a long time previous to trying this product.</li>
            <li> The whitening was less noticeable for me, personally, although I do feel my teeth look brighter and less</li>
            <li> less and less white</li>
            <li> The toothpaste (first bottle) wasn&#x27;t all that bad, but the second finishing treatment made my mouth burn and left my cheeks with irritated patches inside.</li>
            <li> I have a front tooth that is partially plastic due to an accident over 10 years ago</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strips in the past and they worked to make my teeth a little whiter, but my teeth always got so sensitive afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge change, but noticeable to me (apparently, no one else).</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The only negative is having to time and figure out how long I had to brush with each paste.</li>
            <li> My sensitivity is only during cleaning, not to hot or cold.</li>
            <li> , I am grateful for BuzzAgent and Crest for providing this product free of charge as I would be extremely disappointed to pay $24.95 for basic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> burns a little like mouth wash, but in long run does whiten your teeth .</li>
            <li> I also worry a little about the abrasiveness of the paste and long term wear on my enamel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but makes my entire mouth feel sort of dry or evaporated.</li>
            <li> Though on the other hand it was a little strange to use because of the 2-step part .</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the taste left in my mouth afterward, but that is nothing that a little mouthwash can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> but it has gotten a little too expensive for regular use when one use doesn&#x27;t show much of a result.</li>
            <li> After a few days I tried this product through bzzagent and noticed a slight different.</li>
            <li> However it is not really good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued that the package included two tubes; one to focus on cleaning, removing both plaque and gingivitis and the other is for whitening and polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most inconvenient when your hand is covered in toothpaste!</li>
            <li> The only other whitening product I have used in the past were the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> so it is doing something other toothpaste doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products</li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand is still using this without any problem</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and asked around if anyone had used a Crest whitening product.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other teeth whitening products, I do prefer this one.</li>
            <li> In the past I had tried the white strips but needed something to keep up with the whitening.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use for 2weeks due to irritation.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product because I&#x27;ve always used white strips, and I drink multiple cups of coffee daily.</li>
            <li> So I changed use to every other day and have had no sensitivity issues since.</li>
            <li> In the month or so I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve come to find, a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It removes tartar buildup EXTREMELY well</li>
            <li> When I saw that this was a toothpaste product I was curious, plus it said it took just 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> The other 2 step system by Crest</li>
            <li> other problem is the taste.</li>
            <li> I also did not experience the extreme sensitivity with this product as I had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend being careful not to brush any gum areas which does produce sensitivity in the areas brushed.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try Crest 3D White because of past experiences with the Crest brand.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as any other whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> probably every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to try it because of the fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> Those steps are easy-peasy compared to other whitening products on the market!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to do these steps twice a day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing dangerous (and not painful or anything either).</li>
            <li> I included a before and after photo, absolutely no editing has been done to enhance the color in either photo!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non time consuming from using other toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my teeth are visibly whiter, especially my canine teeth which usually have the yellowish tint to them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product every other day and am not experiencing those sensitivities anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to whiten well, but I am not sure about the medical implications regarding enamel safety.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind the two step process, and i have not noticed any gum sensitivities from using this product as other users have stated.</li>
            <li> I cannot use whitestrips or any other &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; whitening product.  </li>
            <li> I have used other whitening systems, specifically trays.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure you couldn&#x27;t achieve the same results buying two separate products.</li>
            <li> I now use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wait hours with whitening gel on your teeth like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Due to this, don&#x27;t expect results overnight....</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers....</li>
            <li> This may be due to the fact that I have always used a whitening toothpaste and my teeth aren&#x27;t all that discolored to begin with.</li>
            <li> It also caused extreme sensitivity and outright pain.  </li>
            <li> Easier to use than other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Small parts of my gums even temporarily turned white (from the bleaching whitener?)</li>
            <li> With my old toothpaste, my teeth and gums would feel dirty and gross shortly after I ate something.</li>
            <li> Anything too cold or too sweet immediately sets my nerves on end (literally).</li>
            <li> both had some concern about long term use as an everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received my whitening kit, my first thought was, this must be really expensive.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over other whitening treatments.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any burning or stinging due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> i have tried white strips in the past but did not like the feeling of tooth sensitivity</li>
            <li> so why not really whiten while I do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the price is too crazy, since whitening strips are far more expensive.  </li>
            <li> other reviews state</li>
            <li> I did not experience any sensitivity issues which I have with other whitening</li>
            <li> However, it was difficult for me to use at first due to the product reaction to my tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two weeks, and though I have forgotten to brush with it a second time a few days, it&#x27;s still working!  </li>
            <li> I think it compares to other whitening products you can buy at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> have lost some enamel on my teeth and due to flouride in the water I drank as a child, there are marks on my teeth that always seem to brighten when I use whitening products and then my teeth look weird.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other brands have caused lots of pain and headaches even.</li>
            <li> This product is like other teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any burning or stinging due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is of selling a product under two different names, and that bothers me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took time to watch the clock and brushed longer than I usually do.</li>
            <li> At first glance I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews that I have read,  I don&#x27;t mind the taste at all.</li>
            <li> But the product did not cause increased oral sensitivity or weaker teeth unlike a lot of other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> It was not a cure all extreme teeth whitening product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this whitening system for the past several weeks.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it removes tartar that usually builds up in back of the bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li> Whitening products I&#x27;ve used in the past have worked well enough but they always took the shine away from my enamel- making my teeth look chalky.</li>
            <li> My advice is to use plenty of water on your toothbrush in between steps because the peroxide or whatever is in each tube can make your mouth a little dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt a little dry and pucker.</li>
            <li> /lips feeling dry for a little while after brushing</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my mouth feels very dry afterwards but nothing a glass of water can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative I noticed is that after rinsing after step 2 the inside of my lips and mouth felt very very dry.</li>
            <li> I personally used it once a day because it felt a little harsh when used</li>
            <li> The same thing happened after a few days of usage, irritation and a little bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> The toothpaste left my mouth feeling unbelievably fresh and neither the toothpaste nor the whitening finisher left a bad taste in my mouth (as past whiteners have).</li>
            <li> but it is very minimal.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is toothpaste in a 4 ounce tube, the active ingredient of which is stannous fluoride.</li>
            <li> While I love having white teeth, I hated the sensitivity caused by whiteners and worried it was eroding my enamel.  </li>
            <li> However, since the packaging does not list the percentage of active ingredients in this step, I have some concerns over the amount of chemicals that are being used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee or other dark beverages</li>
            <li> I did experience very slight sensitivity my first week of use, nothing too bad, but if you are overly sensitive to some of the ingredients contained in this product, I would be cautious.</li>
            <li> for the product doing its job, it did make my teeth a little bit whiter, though not much.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I never had any problems with sensitivity and/or burning in my mouth that some of the other testers had.</li>
            <li> and this does not bother my teeth half as much as other whitening products.</li>
            <li> The teeth lightened slightly, but due to my age and the amount of coffee and tea I drink there wasn&#x27;t a lot of whitening.</li>
            <li> Step 1 feels a little weird at first when you&#x27;re done brushing because you can&#x27;t rinse your mouth out</li>
            <li> I have only noticed that reaction though, when I&#x27;ve had a cut from brushing too hard</li>
            <li> so there’s hardly any extra work to do at all.  </li>
            <li> The trays and white strips worked well for me, but depending on what product you get you have to leave them on your teeth for up to an hour or two, and it&#x27;s hard to talk with them in.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my teeth actually were.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste seems thicker than regular toothpaste, and the whitening paste tastes pretty bad, though I realize all whitening products have this issue.</li>
            <li> The only negative with the product is the medicinal aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it could really whiten</li>
            <li> I am a daily coffee drinker and my teeth seem at least 2 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the taste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not noticed much of a difference in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li> The instructions state to use the product twice daily, and keep step 2 on your teeth for at least 1 minute each time.</li>
            <li> I felt like my teeth were whiter but the pain around my gums was not fun.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> did, however, start having sensitivity when used twice daily - which is a fairly common problem I have with whitening products.</li>
            <li> I also found it cumbersome to use two separate products, especially when running late in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t know that I would use this product 365 days a year, but I would definitely use this system at least twice a year to brighten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are at least one shade whiter, but it&#x27;s only been a week</li>
            <li> of effort for an average product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, some nights when I&#x27;m tired, I&#x27;d rather just slap the old Crest on my toothbrush and get myself to bed</li>
            <li> Also, when I&#x27;m half-asleep before bed, I commonly forget the second step altogether.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t whiten much and it&#x27;s just too expensive for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint about it.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots where my they are stained.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the taste of the toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the flavor of the second component.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday seems to be a bit rough on my teeth</li>
            <li> so it took me a few times to get used to the reduced amount of time and mentally feeling</li>
            <li> The two step process isn&#x27;t as annoying as I thought it would be, but I will admit that I don&#x27;t love the taste.</li>
            <li> I have been using at least once a day for about 2 weeks and can notice a slight difference in how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> brushing time from 2 minutes (with 30 seconds in each quadrant) down to 1 minute of tooth brushing and 1 minute of whitening.</li>
            <li> To get down to i.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super annoying, 2 tubes, 2 caps, stop in the middle, etc...</li>
            <li> I mean I was only using it for a couple of days</li>
            <li> My teeth are somewhat stain due to caffeine so they will not become the &amp;#34;pearly white&amp;#34; teeth that one would hope for.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> but other people did too!</li>
            <li> With the other whitening toothpaste I tried, it was so abrasive that I could not stand hot or cold foods which of course led to me not using the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, using the usual whitening products produces limited results.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I did not enjoy having to apply toothpaste to my brush twice during each brushing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the system is that it beats my gums up a little.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as harsh as other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it got rid of bad breath a whole lot faster than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> While I did have slight whitening thanks to the product, it wasn&#x27;t enough to warrant the bad taste or side effects.</li>
            <li> My gums bleed less when I brush</li>
            <li> took before and after pictures at the same time of the day in the same location after two weeks of use and I am sorry to say that I did not noticed any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> my teeth always have an ever so slight tint of an off-white-ish color.</li>
            <li> It improved the look of my teeth in the two and a half weeks</li>
            <li> Began to see some slight results after about a week.</li>
            <li> They have gotten slightly whiter but have not progressed since then.  </li>
            <li> When I used the Crest White Strips I had serious sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> As the days went on, I gradually saw my teeth slightly become whiter and whiter.</li>
            <li> I did retain slight irritation to the gums, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> Less?</li>
            <li> I prefer a stronger mint taste, and less salty.</li>
            <li> Trying to time the various steps is a bit of a hassle as I am used to merely timing the entire process from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> There was a slight lightening in color.</li>
            <li> Previous to this</li>
            <li> and i have used it less then the recommended amount</li>
            <li> There is a disclaimer on the product which I hadn&#x27;t noticed until I got a slight brownish color (almost like a coffee stain) on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After three weeks of use I have noticed my teeth appear slightly whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a Crest 3D 2 bottle set, so I had gotten used to the two-step process.</li>
            <li> After a minute of brushing and rinsing, I did feel a slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the strips  and this product tastes the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using and can tell a slight difference</li>
            <li> I typically drink 2-3 cups a day to survive life with my 3 kids.</li>
            <li> Using this Crest gel system was completely different and so much easier and less painful.  </li>
            <li> but I did see a slight difference</li>
            <li> What I found to be the case is while my teeth didn&#x27;t digress from my previous whitening, they are not any whiter either.</li>
            <li> Herbal tea, iced tea, black tea...</li>
            <li> I have always disliked mouthwashes, (hate that medicine taste) but I must say I actually enjoy using this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and I do see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> With that said, however, I do feel like my teeth are cleaner than with my previous toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It has whitened my teeth slightly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are slightly whiter</li>
            <li> started using the product and while it felt a bit odd brushing my teeth with 2 products I noticed an immediate difference.  </li>
            <li> After 3 and a half weeks of use, I will say that my teeth are about 1 1/2/ shades whiter than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels weird until I finally get to Step 2 which seems to stabilize everything and brings back the moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a deal breaker at all however, it&#x27;s just an odd feeling.</li>
            <li> I expected at least a minimal change in the color of my teeth,</li>
            <li> When I received my package, one of the tubes was opened and had leaked out slightly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they could be, so in addition to my regular whitening toothpaste I resort to OTC whitening treatments from time to time.</li>
            <li> They are whiter to me and i&#x27;m noticing less build up when I go to floss.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a slight whitening after a couple of weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I have used other teeth whitening products in the past and have found them to be expensive and take too much time.</li>
            <li> Also, when I drink hot or cold liquids after doing it I don&#x27;t notice any pain or sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> It increased my sensitivity to hot and cold after just a week of trying to use it, I couldn&#x27;t use it 2 times a day either.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening products in the past with not much luck.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that sometimes I just forget to do the second step when I&#x27;m tired</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with strips or trays.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening products in the past with not much luck.</li>
            <li> I usually use a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste, so I assumed any difference would be minimal.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the taste at first but got accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> When I got it it was skeptical because I have tried whitening products in the past that either did not work or took a long time to see the effects, or made my teeth really sensitive.</li>
            <li> After using the product everyday for a week my teeth did whiten a few shades brighter than any other whitening technique I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was annoyed by how one is a  flip cap and thebanother one is a twist cap, plus the lables are in the opposite position as the other.  </li>
            <li> The 1st Step is a little odd and grainy when scrubbing your teeth.</li>
            <li> It worked slightly on whitening my teeth, however it causes a burning sensation that makes not very appealing.</li>
            <li> Like I said , I&#x27;ve tried other things in the past, but had previously found nothing worked like the at home whitening trays from  the dentist  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think that this tooth cleaning and whitening system doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its marketing.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried to be careful, I always had toothpaste running down my mouth when using this product.</li>
            <li> Not enough to make me stop using the product but not a pleasant feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Some complained about the taste, burning, and dry mouth</li>
            <li> He seemed to notice a slight difference after just a few days.</li>
            <li> The system runs just under $15 and seems like it will last at least 2 months, if not more.</li>
            <li> I have only one small complaint.</li>
            <li> feel numb the first few times, but my teeth did look a little whiter.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the 2-step system, but quickly discovered that it wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> I also want to add that I have very sensitive teeth, but this product never hurt, or stung or felt weird in any way.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product for a little over a week now and the whiteness hasn&#x27;t worn off, it just keeps getting</li>
            <li> NOT FUN!</li>
            <li> and I can visibly see a little difference in the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> When using step 1 the texture is a bit grainy, which can be a little harmful to your teeth</li>
            <li> It did cause my gums to swell a little</li>
            <li> Whitening was also a little blotchy.</li>
            <li> is that it does not significantly lengthen my dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> If you review the product ingredients and do a little research, there are no abrasives in the whitening polish.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little hesitant on trying this product.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimated by the 2 part system, thinking that it was going to be too time consuming and in the end a product that I would not continue with.</li>
            <li> After using the Crest HD I did notice that my teeth felt cleaner and maybe a little whiter.</li>
            <li> and I found using two products a little bit time consuming.</li>
            <li> It also made my teeth a little whiter</li>
            <li> And for what it was, it took little to no time at all to use.</li>
            <li> It whitened but not a significant amount if you have a lot of discoloration.</li>
            <li> I think it did whiten my teeth a little.</li>
            <li> what with two tubes of toothpaste and minutes having to wait - a little too time consuming.</li>
            <li> I usually try and do other stuff while I brush my teeth for one minute with each step.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about using</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening products in the past, and found them to be time consuming.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit of a difference</li>
            <li> I did start to notice a little sensitivity after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I notice my teeth being any whiter since I&#x27;ve been using this product, but I notice they are a lot smoother throughout the day than they used to be with other products.</li>
            <li> the paste was a little runny.</li>
            <li> While I was excited to try this product, I was disappointed at my results .</li>
            <li> I think my husband&#x27;s teeth look a little whiter, but he says he doesn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my teeth are a little whiter</li>
            <li> But it was a little concerning.</li>
            <li> I think it may have whitened them a little</li>
            <li> and I can see a little difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for a little over a week</li>
            <li> so I was hoping it would make a difference, but there was no significant change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tooth paste for a little over 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> is a little added time.</li>
            <li> The flavors of both products could do with being a little mintier in my view.</li>
            <li> I have gotten somewhat conditioned to it, but am not sure if this is due to how I use it or numbing of the senses.</li>
            <li> I have done multiple different kinds of whitening systems in the past, including one that is prescribed by my dentist and is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> It just tastes a little too tangy for me.  </li>
            <li> Having two steps is a little bit of a hassle, but hopefully this 2-step process was tested.</li>
            <li> little lack</li>
            <li> I used the product as recommended each day with a little skepticism.</li>
            <li> My teeth do look a little whiter though.</li>
            <li> My teeth are a little whiter.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I had used the Crest Whitening Strips in the past with success but HATED how sensitive it made my teeth.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, the taste was awful, but I guess I&#x27;ve built up to it now and doesn&#x27;t bother me quite as much as it did when I started using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to continue using this product long enough to see clear results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dried out my mouth a little.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I received the product to try from BzzAgent and Crest because I&#x27;d heard the toothpaste caused some sensitivity and discoloration for a few people.</li>
            <li> The packaging was tough to open.  </li>
            <li> I was wary to try this because whitening products make my teeth a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It was a chance to brighten my smile from all the years of bad habits i have accumulated over the years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second tube, which is what whitens your teeth, is a clear gel that doesn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad to me.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using Crest 3D White toothpaste, I have found a slight whitening of my teeth but not as dramatic as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> After brushing with this system for a few weeks now, there had been a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and after two weeks of continued use you would never know i was addicted to coffee and red wine!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> but if I could make a few changes, it would be to improve the taste a bit.</li>
            <li> It is a lot of trouble to use the two step process.</li>
            <li> but it dissipated after a few times.</li>
            <li> may not enjoy taste</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that even after several weeks of using the product I never experienced any sensitivity problems.</li>
            <li> However, I took a few days off from this toothpaste and when returning to it, the discomfort was gone.</li>
            <li> I have to use it every few days or give up sweets....</li>
            <li> I like using tooth pastes that have a heavy foam when bushed on, this product didn&#x27;t seem to do that.</li>
            <li> Step 2 of the system is a whitening gel that you brush on for a minute after using the toothpaste and while it is not fantastic tasting</li>
            <li> My teeth are a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve taken a few days off.</li>
            <li> That being said, my teeth have gotten whiter using this system for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few days I could already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I also did not enjoy the taste.</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately I did not notice and difference as far as whitening.</li>
            <li> Although Crest 3D White did whiten my teeth, as promised, I found it irritating.</li>
            <li> but it made my gums sore when used everyday.</li>
            <li> I already have to brush my teeth everyday</li>
            <li> when I stopped using it for a few days on the road.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee everyday.</li>
            <li> The second week I decreased it to once a day hoping that would help.  </li>
            <li> It burnt my gums and has a harsh smell.</li>
            <li> I received my sample in the mail a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for few weeks now and feel like a can form an opinion to share with others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have not tried this yet you are missing out on whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee everyday</li>
            <li> have, and it&#x27;s not overly harsh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the system once a day as a precaution to sensitivity but after a few days I realized I had nothing to worry about began using morning and night.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used it for a few weeks now and likes it.  </li>
            <li> FROM  CREST FOR  A FEW  WEEKS</li>
            <li> After a few days, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, my teeth looked whiter after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> The product made my teeth noticeable whiter within a few days.</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re missing enamel could be abrasive.  </li>
            <li> and I drink coffee and diet cola everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any sensitivity in my teeth but have noticed that my teeth are whiter than when I started using this product daily.</li>
            <li> Why waste hundreds of dollars at the dentist?</li>
            <li> but I did not enjoy it.</li>
            <li> dentist cleaned everyday.</li>
            <li> but I think you get use to it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I felt it was messy.  </li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of those whitening strips, too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Dried out my mouth and irritated the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> (these fade away after a few minutes)</li>
            <li> noticed a difference in my teeth after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical thinking it would just waste more time and would just be annoying.  </li>
            <li> My teeth could be whiter, but I drink coffee and tea everyday.</li>
            <li> I drink a few glasses of tea each day, and was hoping to brighten up my teeth from that habit.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I could its whitening effects.</li>
            <li> Although there are lots of pros, there are a few cons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few uses, the whitening system did begin to hurt my gums when brushing.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, I could already tell a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> It lasted for quite a few hours and did not go away no matter what I did, but after my gums got used to the toothpaste it stopped happening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (these fade away after a few minutes)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of doing each step for a minute, because I feel like I&#x27;m rushing through on both minutes and missing spots.  </li>
            <li> But this makes my overall brushing regimen take longer, which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I drink tea everyday this Crest product will help prevent from stain</li>
            <li> I have tried whitening products in the past with no success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I did notice my teeth getting whiter after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use these everyday</li>
            <li> After using the product for a few days I felt as if my teeth looked whiter but that could have been my imagination.</li>
            <li> This is the part I disliked.</li>
            <li> In just after a few days my teeth were a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> it sometimes seemed a bit harsh in my gums.</li>
            <li> A product from Crest has to be great!&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e been using Crest 3D for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product when I began using it as I am prone to sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It went away, and my teeth are a smidge whiter (not a huge coffee drinker</li>
            <li> This product from crest does not leave my mouth feeling raw or pealing like some other brands have done to me in the past.  </li>
            <li> This product never produced any burning sensation or any other negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, after 2 weeks of using the product (while drinking red wine throughout, which normally stains my teeth terribly), I can notice a difference and my teeth are not only not stained from the wine, they are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> After a few uses, it did start to make my tongue and lips just a bit numb and tingly, but the sensation does not last long.  </li>
            <li> However, you will not get as dramatic a result as what you get at the dentist, and it&#x27;s probably equally comparable to the strips for whitening power.</li>
            <li> Not only were my visible teeth whiter but the inside of my teeth had a dramatic reduction in the stains that my coffee/tea habit causes, as well as my molars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still only using this toothpaste/whitening system once a day and have noticed a dramatic difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meh:&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect to get the same results as you&#x27;d expect at the dentist&#x27;s office for whitening, though this is significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> The first step felt grittier, which to some might seem like a bad thing</li>
            <li> and then my teeth started to get real sensitive to cold items, my tea, my pops and so on.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed myself after a couple weeks of use reverting back to my old toothpaste here and there to not have to deal with the awful taste.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and there is a small noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also worried that using the two products would slow my morning routine down</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try Crest 3D White Brilliance.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a whitening system that only involved toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It just felt raw and sore after brushing--</li>
            <li> I even tried using mouthwash after I brushed but the bad taste still came back.</li>
            <li> I thought the gel in Step 2 tasted gross, but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to make me stop using the product.</li>
            <li> The product had me a bit nervous as I had the infamous white spots on my gums a few days in.</li>
            <li> With the crest 3d whiting two step daily cleansing treatment I was shocked to read that it only takes one minute for each step.</li>
            <li> However, after a few uses I discovered I was wrong and began using the 2 step system every time I brushed.</li>
            <li> On average this system is about $15!!</li>
            <li> The step 2 tastes just like other whitening products, not good, but tolerable (and it isn&#x27;t like you are swallowing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hard core tea drinker, my teeth aren&#x27;t overly yellowed, but they could stand to be a little whiter.</li>
            <li> I personally thought it had an unpleasant odor and felt as if it was not a normal minty type toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I saw very little change in my teeth,</li>
            <li> I had very little problems with sensitivity using Step 2.</li>
            <li> Then comes whitening pastes and mouthwashes one they usually taste TERRIBLE and don&#x27;t seem to yield results very fast, until Crest 3D white brilliance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had bad experiences with whitening kits in the past without seeing much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> The system also had a weird aftertaste to it and took longer to use than my regular toothpaste routine.  </li>
            <li> but I sure wish that would add some mint to the toothpaste it tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would be harmful to my teeth and gums or that it would be too abrasive and make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> Overall works for whitening my teeth just wish it didn&#x27;t leave the weird feeling when done brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay $20 for it</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after just a few days!</li>
            <li> but I was totally proven wrong.  </li>
            <li> After using this system for about a week, I noticed my teeth were sensitive to cold things I drank or ate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I notice a ton of whitening</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure my teeth have whitened yet</li>
            <li> but I was being lazy.  </li>
            <li> Then rinse as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a small change in my teeth</li>
            <li> It made a difference in just a few days and worked so well and applied evenly!  </li>
            <li> This product whitened my teeth, but I was not able to use the product as recommended.</li>
            <li> and I was not able to do this.</li>
            <li> I actually notice (sorry if TMI) stains come off of my teeth into what I spit into the sink.</li>
            <li> Then, I use a small amount of the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I was a bit disappointed that it&#x27;s a 2 step system, however, the results have changed my mind.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t stand the taste of fluoride.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has used Crest Whitestrips in the past will recognized the flavor of the gel (basically, hydrogen peroxide).</li>
            <li> like I have in the past with the WhiteStrips, but I did get some gum soreness and bleeding.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used the gel whitening trays you get made at the dentist</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried teeth whitening strips and they made my gums burn.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used any teeth whitening agent in the past you&#x27;ll recognize the flavor</li>
            <li> Well I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which tube caused that though.</li>
            <li> That I&#x27;m not sure of.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> It left a weird taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> Occasionally this process got tedious when I was dying to crawl into bed, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for brighter</li>
            <li> I usually get the one hour</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive alternative to whitening and have a few weeks to allow the changes to take place, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Whitening strips usually irritate my gums and this product did not irritate my teeth or gums at all!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> photos on Facebook and others said they saw a difference, but I&#x27;m really not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips in the past but found the price, length of time it takes, and an issue with sensitivity to be against me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I feel I should say I&#x27;ve tried I think about every form of whitening in the past and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is</li>
            <li> The box was a bit difficult to get open</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want them pearly white as that looks so fake.</li>
            <li> It is gritty and pastey with a fake sugar taste.</li>
            <li> The white on my gums goes away after a couple of mins but still uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I will continue using the product, but at this price point, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not adventurous when it comes to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes in the morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips in the past but found the price, length of time it takes, and an issue with sensitivity to be against me.</li>
            <li> The only downside would be that this toothpaste causes minor gum irritation which can be painful</li>
            <li> is, if you can get past the taste.</li>
            <li> fluoride this product contains for anti-cavity purposes is not the usual one we see, sodium fluoride.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Crest whitening product in the past but could not use it because of the taste.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this for anyone who is too lazy to sit with those strips on your teeth all day.  </li>
            <li> I have used the whitening strips in the past and always use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything out of the ordinary, like wait 30 minutes, then peel the whitestrips off.</li>
            <li> You just squeeze a small amount from number one bottle and brush for a minute.</li>
            <li> Then you do not rinse, and add a small amount from number two bottle and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li> no strips to stick on the teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add I do not smoke or drink excessive amounts of soda.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a dry feeling in your mouth after using but overall the taste is not too bad for a whitening product.</li>
            <li> And the taste is still there when I wake up in the middle of the night due to a child crying or bathroom needs, and again it makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> The step one tube was a little too flexible and the step two tube was awkward to open and store.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that I did not get the foam feeling like normal toothpaste do</li>
            <li> The taste of the whitening gel isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected but it does seem to make my gums feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but I have had a few people comment</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I can whiten my teeth without gel tape that felt weird or trays that felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> You do get a faint taste of the traditional whitening strip (you know what I mean if you&#x27;ve used them)</li>
            <li> it was hard to get past</li>
            <li> Due to genetics, I have yellow teeth...not too bad...</li>
            <li> I tried professional whitening, which not only stung like crazy but also gave disappointing results.</li>
            <li> I also have to say that I read some of the other product reviews and saw the negative comments people were saying about the ingredients in the product which is a little scary and makes me not want to use the product again.</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint which really isn&#x27;t that bad at all is it feels really cold on step 2.</li>
            <li> I have just bad teeth all around, in the past I&#x27;ve tried bleach and Whitening toothpastes and they made my teeth sensitive and &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Crest whitening products in the past and my teeth always became so sensitive (bleeding, painful gums)</li>
            <li> have very sensitive teeth, and it has not been painful.  </li>
            <li> timing anyway with brushing your teeth isn&#x27;t the easiest; cutting it down to 2 one-minute increments was even harder (my electric toothbrush for example has a timer but is automatically set to two-minutes, there&#x27;s no mechanism for me to change that).</li>
            <li> Also the finisher is loose, goopy and runny and feels weird.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to want to use it.  </li>
            <li> It was also hard on my gums, making them sore.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to</li>
            <li> The packaging is a hard plastic of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> That was hard for me, but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I do like the two-step process, but it&#x27;s hard with my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to notice it within a day, so you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> but I find it hard to brush for one minute without rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but have a hard time finding the time to use the strips.</li>
            <li> and there is hardly any noticeable</li>
            <li> Oddly, it hardly bothers my gums at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but have a hard time finding the time to use the strips.</li>
            <li> Hard to complain about that.</li>
            <li> I think the product whitened them some, but it&#x27;s hard for me to tell these days.</li>
            <li> It can get a little messy and finding the time to wear the trays for 15 to 20 minutes can be difficult.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how many other people noticed the bad after taste just like I did!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> do drink a lot of coffee: at least three cups a day.</li>
            <li> I know that my teeth are at least two tones whiter than they were before</li>
            <li> The only inconvenient part of using this system is remembering not to rinse between step 1 and 2.</li>
            <li> and I havent noticed any negative issues using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So, if you are on the fence about whether or not you want to try the whitening system, at least if you buy this you can still use the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Now on to the whitening, I&#x27;ve been using the system for probably at least 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I drink at least one cup of coffee a day</li>
            <li> My teeth have become at least 2 shades</li>
            <li> Not a nice way to leave my mouth.</li>
            <li> twelve days of use, at least twice a day, I feel my teeth got one shade whiter.</li>
            <li> thought that the product did whiten my teeth, although not spectacularly so.</li>
            <li> I found that the product worked slowly, but eventually it did whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day for over a month, and I have not experienced any sensitivity, and my teeth are a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker and for the approximate month I used this product my teeth didn&#x27;t appear to be getting any yellower.</li>
            <li> I plan to slowly increase to the recommended twice a day to see if it improves the whitening results.</li>
            <li> very little whitening.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> It is a very simple process and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad like the other whitening products that I have tired.</li>
            <li> The second step is the whitening gel and although it didn&#x27;t have a minty flavor it did not have a nasty bitter flavor like other whitening products.  </li>
            <li> No more coffee stains for this girl!</li>
            <li> I mean who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune??</li>
            <li> and I always have concerns of a product leaving a burning sensation or having other uncomfortable side effects.</li>
            <li> No increased sensitivity and the shade of my teeth after just a couple of weeks is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> The second step polished your teeth with a whitening gel, and if you&#x27;ve ever used another expensive whitening gel, you can tell they didn&#x27;t skimp on this one!</li>
            <li> If you can get past that, it does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> I mean who has 30 minuets to just wait around with trays in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really satisfied with the performance!</li>
            <li> It feels weird on your teeth if you use one product and not the other</li>
            <li> It works, by what i mean it cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> but my teeth are not too bad in general.</li>
            <li> All you need is a very small dab of this stuff to work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because all of the other whiting treatments I have used are either nasty tasting, very time consuming or messy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a really bad taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle</li>
            <li> Sort of numb and tingly, parched and dry</li>
            <li> Seriously, when you are done with the two part system and wipe your mouth, you want to do that</li>
            <li> It could get a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I had tried other whitening strips and toothpaste in the past, and never really noticed a difference and hated how they felt.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the two-step process a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a a little weird after taste</li>
            <li> With that being said, I was a little skeptical to try this out.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this product would deliver its promised results.</li>
            <li> Improved my teeth not feeling as bad every time I brushed.</li>
            <li> Plus the taste was so bad, that after using the product, I had to brush with a regular product and use mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste feels gritty, and the gel tastes bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with gels and such in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product in the least.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, because I have used whitening toothpastes before that were worthless.  </li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t leave my mouth dry or leave an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for someone who is afraid to use the whitening strips due to sensitivity (like me).</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would show some improvement from the first time I used it but was very disappointed, did not see any.</li>
            <li> They are the hard to get to regions of your teeth!</li>
            <li> Your flavor was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I still had the sensitivity issues I usually have with whitening products.  </li>
            <li> (I know it says 12 and up) try it and they refused to use it after the first time because they said it tasted nasty.  </li>
            <li> but overall I was still disappointed.</li>
            <li> One thing I dislike about most whitening toothpastes is the nasty taste they have and the nasty aftertaste left in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I had recently tried the Crest ProHealth HD whitening system and was disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that anything could make my teeth look whiter since I have tried other whitening products that I had to leave on my teeth for up to an hour to no visible results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit tough to remember to use step 2.</li>
            <li> You don’t have to make a tough decision and choose between the stains or whitening.</li>
            <li> We both drink tea coffee and soda, so we are tough in our teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very unhappy and will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t horribly stained, but they certainly did brighten using this system.</li>
            <li> The concerning part is that my teeth felt a little numb after using.</li>
            <li> I found the 2 stages to be a little awkward to do.</li>
            <li> I definitely have a little bit of tea staining on my teeth, but nothing terribly</li>
            <li> The two step process isn&#x27;t so bad but after the second week, it got tiresome.</li>
            <li> I tired to use a lot on the gum line</li>
            <li> ; rather, I would say that they haven&#x27;t gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> I also never experienced any staining issues or sensitivities that tend to come along with whitening products.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s annoying to me personally.</li>
            <li> it is not great.</li>
            <li> I admit that the taste is not great</li>
            <li> but I found it a bit annoying that the tubes were different.</li>
            <li> I also was not happy with the chemicals and ingredients in these products.</li>
            <li> that its a 2 step system and the taste of the whitening product is not great.  </li>
            <li> : Not great...</li>
            <li> alas, there was no visible</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kinda annoying when you have to use two different products to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product works, but is not great.</li>
            <li> Only downside was an annoying aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I usually feel like someone is stabbing me with pins and needles after whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes to the color of my teeth</li>
            <li> Step 1 was just like any regular tooth paste, but step 2 made my gums burn so bad that I was afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> you will not see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> so I was not expecting a dramatic change for myself.  </li>
            <li> It was a little painful even.</li>
            <li> I was terribly concerned that it would make my sensitive teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> I hated the gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried teeth whitening systems in the past but my tooth sensitivity made it impossible to stay with any.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the unpleasant sensations made it a negative experience.</li>
            <li> I received this as a trial for my buzz campain , I was a little doubtful  at 1st</li>
            <li> It was definitely a weird feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to say if it would have succeeded in making my teeth whiter as I discontinued use after experiencing sore gums.</li>
            <li> I powered through it and sadly, after 4 weeks it still didn&#x27;t make a difference in the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Expensive for mediocre results.  </li>
            <li> The sensitivity was just too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that is where I went wrong</li>
            <li> so unfortunately my teeth suffer the consequences.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terrible, but I definitely notice it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird</li>
            <li> I also like that this doesn&#x27;t have that weird taste a lot of whiteners</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste.</li>
            <li> I do find it difficult as I like to brush my tongue</li>
            <li> I found that it worked well and was simplistic to use.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptical of this because it seemed like a lot of work, a 2 step prices and timing things, like I have time for that</li>
            <li> I felt a cooling sensation, but nothing that uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have a silly problem with the lids though.</li>
            <li> and I found using the product tedious.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was too concentrated or just hit that area wrong?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to happened, but the inside of my mouth felt weird afterwards.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash left a horrible taste in my mouth that spoiled the taste of food and beverages for hours after use.</li>
            <li> I again did not experience any ill affects with step two.</li>
            <li> You could faintly smell/</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wary of Step 2 when it smelled like bleach.</li>
            <li> However I never had any ill effects from it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use this product for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I am not really impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> But not as expensive.</li>
            <li> I again did not experience any ill affects with step two.</li>
            <li> There is one big negative in my eyes, and that is the awful after taste that the product leaves in my mouth after brushing, almost making me feel sick.</li>
            <li> I have always hated that with other toothpastes my mouth would feel like I need to brush again after eating anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whitening step seemed very thin and runny and it didn&#x27;t feel like I was accomplishing anything.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using the whitening systems that taste terribly and while this wasn&#x27;t terrible, tolerable actually,</li>
            <li> It almost leaves my tongue feeling numb.</li>
            <li> All that I can say now is that it does freshen breath and the two steps aren&#x27;t inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the taste of either of the pastes.</li>
            <li> The peroxide did give me some cold sensitivity</li>
            <li> I continued to use it for about 4 days that&#x27;s when I had to stop using it because I noticed a sensitivity to cold</li>
            <li> I was afraid that step 2 or the whitening gel was going to cause sensitivity in my teeth</li>
            <li> But it still did not stop my sensitivity to cold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use it on children, because it is a whitening product and could potentially be dangerous.</li>
            <li> The two-part process is a bit awkward.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments from random people about my teeth!</li>
            <li> Just because other whiteners I have tried had a horrible taste :(.</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t horribly dingy but because I am a heavy tea drinker they do get noticeably stained!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste also gave me a terrible dry mouth after each use, very unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> The chemicals used to flavor and sweeten this toothpaste leave a slightly unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> The step 2 tube contains the whitening agent, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> so bad I can&#x27;t even suck in cold air after I use them.  </li>
            <li> I found it very tedious to have to switch midway from the toothpaste to the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about how well it would work but after a week I started noticing that my teeth were looking whiter.</li>
            <li> I am very sorry to say that this product did not whiten my teeth and my mouth burned when I rinsed with the mouthwash I use.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, this isn&#x27;t a review to bash crest or say I hate the product.</li>
            <li> and this is nearly impossible with the taste.</li>
            <li> I am very sad that it has to be a bad review.</li>
            <li> Neither step tastes bad, in fact I had no issues with brushing with either product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up with bad breath</li>
            <li> The taste is not that bad</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never worry about bad breath while using this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a smoker (bad, I know).</li>
            <li> paste and polish didn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The two step process isn&#x27;t too bad to deal with; one minute with step one, rinse, and one minute with step two.</li>
            <li> Now for the bad part.</li>
            <li> After using it it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> but it hurt my gums really bad</li>
            <li> After that day, I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> product, bad flavor</li>
            <li> so using the strips is actually painful.</li>
            <li> so painful that I could not continue using</li>
            <li> Step 2, oh Step 2, you disappointed me.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any crazy effects happen to my teeth&#x27;s sensitivity or enamel that I&#x27;ve felt or witnessed!</li>
            <li> That being said, I was disappointed with the claims of this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the way my mouth tasted.</li>
            <li> The strips are very awkward and don&#x27;t cover all the teeth and toothpastes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for years with those annoying strips.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth 2X is annoying.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I have tried A LOT Of whitening products!</li>
            <li> I also thought the taste would be horrible, but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t taste quite as bad as the gel on the strips!</li>
            <li> I was so shocked that I did not mind the taste!</li>
            <li> I hated the step 2 screw cap.</li>
            <li> I also really hated the taste...</li>
            <li> However I hated the taste.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and let me tell you, I am obsessed!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting an awful nasty taste</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find that the finisher (step 2) had any awful smell or taste.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars not because it didn&#x27;t work, but because the taste was so terrible.</li>
            <li> I was terribly concerned that it might contain plastic beads.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say the taste is terrible, there is just a lack of minty-ness.</li>
            <li> The taste is terrible, though.</li>
            <li> The biggest reason I never whiten with peroxide is because it tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> Tasted terrible.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that nasty taste when you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard awful things about self whitening kits.</li>
            <li> Both tasted terrible</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste awful, and you&#x27;re gonna brush your teeth anyway.  </li>

            <li> What a great product to get your teeth cleaned.  This is a 2 step product that works great and turn my teeth whiter than they have ever been.  It is a very simple process and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad like the other whitening products that I have tired. I receive this product by Crest to use and tell my opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have been using it for 2 weeks and I can already tell my teeth are much whiter. I do not have sensitivity while using this product.  Would recommend to anyone wanting an easy whitening product! No trays or strips needed!</li>
            <li> This dynamic duo is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it does whiten your teeth a lot, so it&#x27;s perf to me.&lt;br /&gt;My mom leaves thieving the kit from me XD it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try Crest 3D White Brilliance. I have tried every whitening toothpaste and product available. They either only focus on whitening and your teeth don&#x27;t feel so clean or they are so harsh that they leave your teeth so sensitive. I was intrigued that the package included two tubes; one to focus on cleaning, removing both plaque and gingivitis and the other is for whitening and polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions, brushing with the purifying cleanser first - the taste is good, very similar to other Crest Pro Health® toothpastes. The instructions say to spit but not to rinse before applying the perfecting gel. I do not rinse my mouth but I do rinse my toothbrush to apply the perfecting gel. Be careful with this stuff - a little goes a long way! All you need is a very small dab of this stuff to work. It tastes a lot like the stuff that&#x27;s on a Crest WhiteStrip, so definitely not the greatest taste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are the whitest cleanest feeling teeth I have had in a long time. Running my tongue over my teeth, they feel so smooth and clean and looking in the mirror - SO WHITE! 2 minutes of brushing my teeth has whitened better than any other toothpaste I have ever used. I have continued to use this product for a little over a week now and the whiteness hasn&#x27;t worn off, it just keeps getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from Crest. Although I did not pay for this product my review is completely my own thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Got the opportunity to try out Crest 3D White Brilliance kit via a free sample from BzzAgent.  I have been using this religiously for two weeks now and I gotta be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I had taken a picture the day I started and decided to take another one today and post up my review. It wasn&#x27;t until I looked at the two pictures that I noticed the difference.  I had yellowing towards the bottom part of my upper and lower canines and bicuspids. When you look at the picture I till today compared to the one I took initially, the yellowing is significantly less visible. I&#x27;m surprised, really. I&#x27;ve bought &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes before and they have never worked so I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations for this one either. But lo and behold, it actually does work. It&#x27;s subtle so I suggest doing what I did and take pictures so you can see the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So aside from the whitening, one thing I noticed from day one was how clean my teeth felt and how long they lasted like that. I have never had any toothpaste leave my teeth feeling this smooth and clean.  The amazing part is that they last like that the whole day, no lie. I loved that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is also easy to use. It brings both tubes and you brush your teeth with each one for one minute, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s extending your brushing routine or anything. All in all, I love it and I&#x27;m still in shock that the whitening actually worked!</li>
            <li> This two step daily cleansing and whitening system is a product that does seem to be effective at whitening your teeth. Step one - the daily cleanser has a lovely sparkly pearl white color and the flavor is appealing. Step two - the whitening agent is clear and has a small after taste of peroxide. As a duo they work well together. I think there could be a bit more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; teeth feel after using the product but as a whole if you are looking for a product to clean and whiten your teeth this could be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest for the option to try this product as part of a promotion from the brand! My smile thanks you as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I was fortunate enough to receive this through BzzAgent and was able to give it a try. I was very skeptical as I have tried A LOT Of whitening products! I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and I have to say I am IMPRESSED!  My teeth are pretty sensitive and when I would use other whitening products, they would get SUPER sensitive to the point of avoiding anything cold or hot. NOT FUN! Crest 3d White Brilliance Daily Cleansing system DOES NOT MAKE MY TEETH SENSITIVE! Paste is so much easier than strips or trays... My ONLY complaint which really isn&#x27;t that bad at all is it feels really cold on step 2. Other than that I LOVE IT! You can tell a difference in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth in just a couple weeks use, and I began to notice a difference within the first couple of brushings.  I received a free sample of this product from Crest, and I have really been thrilled with the results.  My teeth and usually very sensitive to whitening products, and this two-part system hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort or pain to my teeth like other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried.  You can really feel it polishing and brightening your smile , I definitely recommend it for any one looking for a brighter, whiter smiler, even those with more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this thing really works! I noticed my teeth were whiter instantly! However... it did cause some sensitivity around my gums especially. If possible, I would recommend using a small toothbrush to provide you with more precision (if such a thing exists). I also wish the results lasted longer. Using it everyday seems to be a bit rough on my teeth so I use it for special occasions and then my basic Crest 3D white toothpaste for everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I did receive this product for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was picked to get a free sample of Crest 3D white brilliance from Crest via BzzAgent! I have never tried any teeth whitening products because I have had so many horror stories. I actually almost turned this campaign down but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. I have been using this product almost 4 weeks now and my teeth are whiter and I actually see them sparkle! It&#x27;s a simple to step process. 1 brush teeth with toothpaste and rinse 2 go over teeth with whitener and rinse! Can&#x27;t get any easier then that. I was expecting an awful nasty taste but it&#x27;s not bad at all. I also don&#x27;t see any discoloration spots on my teeth anymore either. I love being able to smile and show my teeth proudly. I also love getting compliments on my teeth and smile! If you are looking for whiter sparkley teeth but don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune or be in pain, this product Is a must for you! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System free through Bzzagent, I was so excited to try a new whitening product. I have been like all others and been trying to get my teeth whiter for a while now. I didn&#x27;t really have much options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the easiest whitening system ever. Its as easy as brushing your teeth. I didn&#x27;t have to leave a strip or gel on my teeth for 20 minutes or so. I never felt more comfortable to whiten my teeth. I noticed a difference within 2 days. I love how easy it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this and I have already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, fast and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt. I&#x27;ve been doing it for 3 weeks and can really tell the difference. So happy I found it!</li>
            <li> I really like the results I have seen happen with this system.  The toothpaste has the same refreshing taste as you would expect from Crest, but the step 2 polishing agent has a strange taste and left my mouth feeling a little dry.  I am impressed with the results enough to work through that problem though.  After brushing with this system my teeth felt incredibly clean.  I didn&#x27;t buy this item, I received it as part of a promotion from the brand, but I will be buying it when these tubes run out.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Crest cleansing kits in the past and was curious how effective this one would be.  I received this to try from Bzzagent.  Right away, I really noticed how white my teeth got after the first brushing.  I was not a fan of not being able to rinse between step 1 and 2 however, temporary discomfort is worth getting these kinds of results.  I have a front tooth that is partially plastic due to an accident over 10 years ago and I was please at how gentle it was on the faux part of my tooth versus my real tooth.  It lightened both proportionately.  I have used this kit before a few big events or when I feel like I need an extra boost of whiteness and cleanness.  I love how smooth and clean my teeth feel after brushing without any sensitivity.  Will continue using, love this!</li>
            <li> I was so lucky to of received this product for free from BzzAgent and was really excited to try it since I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker.  The of taste of the toothpaste (step 1) is very mild and actually enjoyed it compare to other toothpaste and I didn&#x27;t find that the finisher (step 2) had any awful smell or taste.  When I used the product the 1st day I did get  white spots all over my gums but they did disappear after 15 minutes or so and it didn&#x27;t happen again after the 1st brushing.  My teeth did feel extra smooth after using like I left a dentist chair but after using this product 3 weeks I do not feel my teeth look any whiter.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received a full-size sample of this item to try courtesy of Crest and Bzzagent. I was not compensated in any way for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said,  this whitening system is great!  It takes no longer than brushing your teeth with regular toothpaste,  with the added result of a whiter smile! I am a daily coffee drinker,  and the dual whitening system really helps keep staining at bay, and has erased some older staining on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would expect the deep cleaning paste (Step 1) to be gritty,  but it&#x27;s not at all. It has the same texture as a regular whitening toothpaste with an amazing minty taste. The finishing gel  (Step 2) gives you that extra kick off whitening power that sets this product apart from the rest. After brushing with this system for a few weeks now, there had been a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the packaging.  Step 1 has a flip cap,  but Step 2 has a screw-top cap.  Most inconvenient when your hand is covered in toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I am a member of BZZAGENT and I got this product for free to try and give my honest opinions about.  First of all, I really like the two step process...I feel that I brush longer and better because I am following the detailed instructions for the two-step process. Neither step tastes bad, in fact I had no issues with brushing with either product.  I drink a lot of coffee and I have noticed a brown tint on my teeth especially when I would look at pictures and I really needed to do something about it.  Did I notice a HUGE improvement after using this product, no, but I did see an overall improvement in the health of my teeth and gums.  My gums bleed less when I brush and I do think I notice a brighter smile.  I think with continued use this product would have a lot of benefits, much more than a traditional toothpaste would and I would def. continue using this product for long-term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of two step toothpaste systems, but this one is definitely worth it!  I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Daily kit (free through BzzAgent thanks to Crest) for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my smile.  As a daily coffee drinker (and a weekly red wine drinker), I am no stranger to stains on my teeth.  I&#x27;ve found it hard in the past to find a whitening product that works and still has great taste- this one has both.  Step 1, the minty cleaning toothpaste really leaves your mouth feeling clean.  Step 2, the whitener, gives you that extra oomph to help eliminate the look of stains from, well, life.  My only gripe is that step two tastes a little bit too medicinal, but, overall the product still tastes better than other whitening solutions on the market.  When I smile in pictures I see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Crest® and BzzAgent.  Overall, I would not recommend this product.  I took before and after images of my teeth to try to see an improved whiteness to my smile, but my after actually looked worse.  The system also had a weird aftertaste to it and took longer to use than my regular toothpaste routine.  I only made it through the 2 week trial period with this system before I passed it over to my husband.  Perhaps he&#x27;ll have better luck!</li>
            <li> I am loving the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System that I received from BZZAgent for review. This product is great! Made a remarkable difference in my teeth without any added sensitivity. The product was easy to use and results were noticeable right away.  Only a few minutes of brushing required.  Only 2 minutes required for a brighter smile.  #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free, thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent!!&lt;br /&gt;I have really enjoyed the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System and am loving my new whiter, brighter smile!! This power couple totally works and is easy to use! The instructions are easy to follow, brush with step 1, spit, brush with step 2, spit and rinse and done. I like this way better than any of the strip systems I&#x27;ve used in the past, as I feel this seems less irritating to my sensitive teeth as the strips used to be. I&#x27;m a coffee/tea drinker and I noticed almost immediate results using this system. My teeth are so much whiter and brighter and that makes me happy! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had a better taste. Step 1 has some mint flavor,  but step 2 straight up tastes like peroxide. The first few times I used it, the taste was awful, but I guess I&#x27;ve built up to it now and doesn&#x27;t bother me quite as much as it did when I started using it a few weeks ago. The results make it worth it, and I&#x27;ve just tried to avoid getting step 2 on my tongue to alleviate the taste. Overall I&#x27;m loving this system and plan to keep using it!! I&#x27;m thrilled with my cleaner smile, and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have people tell me all the time that my teeth are white. I used this for a week  mand my teeth started to look yellowish.  During brushing my teeth they looked really white but when I got to work and checked(haven&#x27;t eaten only drank water ) they weren&#x27;t white. The second step got on my gums so I had white spots on my gums that hurted.( the spots didn&#x27;t last)  I do want to continue to use it to see if it works better but I don&#x27;t want yellow teeth. I&#x27;ll just stick with what I know. Thanks crest for the free product to review!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a big fan of the 3D whitening toothpaste, so I was really excited when I received a free trial kit from Bzzagent. It seemed to be a really easy 2step process; you first brush for a minute with the blue tube, spit (don&#x27;t rinse), and brush another minute with the white tube. The toothpaste did seem to make my teeth a tad whiter....but I love when my teeth and breath feel fresh. I didn&#x27;t feel like this toothpaste did that. It also dried out my mouth a little. I have only been using it about 2 weeks so far and I will finish out what I have, but I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I give the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System a 5/5 stars for sure!!! I have noticed a huge difference after using for 2 weeks! I waited to review to see if it really lived up to it&#x27;s name, and to my shock and excitement, it did!! My teeth are noticeably brighter and whiter, and I feel so confident with my smile! No more coffee stains for this girl! I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments from random people about my teeth! Thank you to Crest and bzzagent for sending me this product to try out for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Whitens your teeth! Has a super fresh, minty taste! Makes your mouth feel so clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Whitening gel has a slightly bitter taste, but the mint overpowers it, so it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Reminds me of Crest&#x27;s white strips.</li>
            <li> I use other Crest 3D White products and I was very excited to try the Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, which I received from BzzAgent. I am very self conscious of my yellow teeth and always try to buy products that can approve their appearance. My teeth are also very sensitive so I have to be careful with the products I use.  The Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is a two step process but is very easy to use -- you brush your teeth with the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste for one minute and then brush on the Whitening Finisher. Unlike other products where you need to leave the whitening substance on for five minutes or longer, this is a very quick and efficient process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this system for a month and I have noticed only a very minor difference with the color  I have yet to receive any compliments or remarks from others and have also felt some sensitivity when using the Whitening Finisher.  I like the ease of use and I like the taste and consistency of the toothpaste but the results have much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure to try this product for free from Bzz Agent.  I have tried teeth whitening systems in the past but my tooth sensitivity made it impossible to stay with any.  So all these years of seeing advertisments for teeth whitening I missed.  What attracted me to the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system was I checked it out and didn&#x27;t see anyone complain about tooth pain due to sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;So now I brush for my minute of blue and then of white.  I am already seeing a difference in some staining on my teeth, mind you I&#x27;m 48 a former smoker a coffee, tea and wine drinker so I have plenty of damage to fix, but I belive if I stick with this product after I finish the bottles and continue on it on my own, I will have a whiter and younger smile.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four starts deducting the one for taste.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I have sensitive teeth and was a previous smoker who quit 5 years ago, so my teeth are not as white as I would like for them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started researching Crest’s new product I was terribly concerned that it would make my sensitive teeth hurt. Fortunately this product does not. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very pleased with the results. So far this product has not really affected my sensitivity and I can visibly see a little difference in the shade of my teeth. I will continue to use as long as I am seeing these results.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use. You will get the best results if you follows the directions on the box. Everyone notices how nice my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I am trying the product for free thanks to Crest® and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am diet cola addict, so I definitely depend on a whitener to keep my teeth looking nice.  I the past I have tried whitening mouth washes, which weren&#x27;t too helpful and didn&#x27;t taste good. I have also used Crest Strips, which work really well, but those take 30 minutes and are an extra step after brushing.  This Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing system is just the ticket. I get my extra whitening in while I brush my teeth. The results are more gradual than the Crest Strips, but that&#x27;s to be expected from something that takes 2 minutes versus 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you brush with the step one for 1 minute and then you brush with step 2 for one more minute. It&#x27;s that easy and it takes just as good as any regular toothpaste. The price compared to other whitening products is also really good. I expected it to be twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been using the product for three weeks now and I have to say that I really like the results. My teeth are definitely brighter and whiter. I drink coffee and tea on a regular basis so I always need a whitening product. Whitening strips just aren&#x27;t my thing as they seem like a chore. This is a great product because it&#x27;s just my normal brushing routine. I love that it&#x27;s just two minutes total and I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m going to keep using the system and see how much better my teeth can look after a longer time.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the crest 3d toothpaste and whitening gel through Bzzagent for Free to provide my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the box i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to open and excited  that the bottom portion of the box was recyclable  :)&lt;br /&gt;The tubes themselves don&#x27;t feel very sturdy,  but even with my toddler grabbing one off the counter, they held up nicely  :)&lt;br /&gt;The first step is the toothpaste, it does not have the super minty taste of most toothpaste, but it definitely makes your teeth feel clean, you do not rinse after, which takes some getting used to...&lt;br /&gt;The second step is the whitening gel, it has no taste to it really which is nice that it isn&#x27;t bleachy tasting like some of the whitening products i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you are a busy person who wants to have a whiter smile, this is an easy and pretty affective product.&lt;br /&gt;The Crest 3D white system is easy to incorporate into your morning routine without adding much time.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth, you might use it every other day, as it did increase sensitivity to my teeth which are not normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I was first offered this campaign from BzzAgent. It was a chance to brighten my smile from all the years of bad habits i have accumulated over the years. I had braces for years and put my teeth through a lot of abuse during that time. I use to be a smoker and I would drink a lot of coffee. By the time my braces came off, I had visible yellowing around all where my braces use to be. I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist to whiten my teeth yet and now I&#x27;m glad I didnt. Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System has whiten my teeth several shades in just 2 weeks. As you can see from the picture, I&#x27;m no longer self concious about smiling. I feel way more confident now then I have since my braces came off. What an inexpensive and easily accessible alternative, then going to the dentist to whiten your teeth. I have only used this for 2 weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do in 2 more! I encourage anyone who has problems like I have, to try this inexpensive option before going to the dentist to get them whitened. Thank&#x27;s BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Received this free fir testing from bzzagevnt. I didn&#x27;t use this the recommended amount of time so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it whitens. I had to stop using it after a week because it caused my teeth to ache, I already have sensitive teeth. So, I&#x27;m not a fan of this product myself.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign in which I share my honest feedback with others.  I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve never found whitening toothpastes to work very well.  This one surprised me!  It works great and I noticed that my teeth were brighter after only using it a few times.  The other thing I love is that all of my teeth are whitened equally.  Have you ever noticed that some people have bright front teeth but if they smile really wide, you can see that the teeth a little farther back are discolored?  That&#x27;s what happens when you use white strips.  No skunk teeth with this whitening system!</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest! All opinions are 100% my own!&lt;br /&gt;We all know how much teeth whitening costs-- professionally in the hundreds and some over the counter can be a bit pricey! On average this system is about $15!! With just one use I could see such a big difference! I however did not like the feeling of the whitening finisher on my teeth, but after using it my mouth was fine. I could see how much whiter my teeth were and that was more important. I am continuing to use this daily and with every brush my teeth look whiter and professionally clean. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product free to try from Bzzagent. Unfortunately, I think that this tooth cleaning and whitening system doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its marketing. I had high hopes for it, but after 4 weeks of use, my teeth don&#x27;t look that much better. I even took a picture so I would be able to compare my before and after shots.  The whitening part left a very strange, bitter taste in my mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t pay money for this, especially since I can get tooth whitening gel at my dentist for free each time I go for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest 3D for free from BzzAgent. As being part of the dental field its hard to trust brands on their products, as far if it works, how it taste, and if it&#x27;s safe for your teeth. When using step 1 the texture is a bit grainy, which can be a little harmful to your teeth but yet i see its use to removing surface stain which i liked. After using step 2, my teeth stared to get a little sensitive which I experience with most whitening systems. I would say over all I like Crest 3D I will for sure be buying it as an alternate system to whitening my teeth. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I was very excited to try the product as I had not used any whitening products for almost a year in an attempt to give my teeth a break. I am an avid coffee and tea drinker so my teeth could definitely use the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial reaction to the two-step process was a concern for the amount of time this may add to my daily routine. However, it only requires you brush with each product for 1 minute. 1 + 1 &#x3D; 2 minutes... Easy. And much quicker than your white strips or trays (15-30 mins).  The minty freshness is great and there is very minimal after taste from the whitening portion. Overall, this was very pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, the results! I have generally always had good results with whitening products.  This was great because it feels effortless to use and I was able to notice an improvement within a few days. Would definitely recommend. I plan to rotate this into my brushing routine a few times a year to maintain a healthy white smile.</li>
            <li> I, like many others received a free trial from Crest and Bzz agent. The only other whitening product I have used in the past were the whitening strips. I had to discontinue them because it was making my teeth overly sensitive. The first time I used the 3D White I was a bit turned off by the gritty feeling of Step one.  I also am used to lots of bubbles and that wasn&#x27;t happening. I thought to myself &#x27;ok it may written them,  but is it cleaning them? &#x27; However, I continued to step 2. When all was said and done,  my teeth have never felt more fresh and clean before.  Not only that bit within the first two uses I could see the improvement. It only got better from there!  I highly recommend it and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Love this! Saw results instantly. I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for years with those annoying strips. This toothpaste lessens that hassle...and shortens my morning routine. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand but I would have tried it on my own. And I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through BzzAgent and Crest. I had the chance to try it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my teeth are not the whitest they are also not that &amp;#34;yellowed&amp;#34; so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to help improve the color at all. At the end of my month trial - I did notice some improvement - not a lot. But some. I think this product would definitely help most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked was that it didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity to my gums or teeth while I was using it. I do know that can be a major issue for some when using a whitening solution. I would probably suggest checking with yiyr dentist before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like in the beginning was that im order to do this the right way you need to add an extra step to your bruahing routine. You need to brush with the step 1 tube and then spit  (no rinsing) and then you brush with the step 2 tube and rinse like normal. This can be time consuming if you are in a rush or running. After a while you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price - if it was just me, it is fine as I won&#x27;t use it that quickly but if you are having you and your family use it - it does tend to add up.</li>
            <li> Seriously...........my teeth looked whiter after one use....and after two weeks of continued use you would never know i was addicted to coffee and red wine!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the affordability of this product and the ease of the use :)&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this though buzzagent but have since given some out as gifts!</li>
            <li> I believe the product works well, since I noticed a difference almost right away. However, I have a cracked tooth and the peroxide has found its way to the most sensitive part of that tooth. Yikes! As soon as I can afford the new crown, I will definitely use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Lived Up to Its Claims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest 3D White Toothpaste system really lived up to its claims. I feel that my teeth are very clean and smooth, and also whiter and brighter than they were before using the two step system. The two step paste system was easy to use, and clearly explained on the package. I enjoyed the taste of the Step 2 polish more than the Step 1 cleanser. That&#x27;s fine, though, because you finish with Step 2 anyway! I did notice a little more of a &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; feeling with this paste than my previous. But, hey! Who doesn&#x27;t need to drink more water?&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I think this was fantastic at getting my teeth and mouth clean. The two step process really made each brushing feel like I just got back from the dentist. My breath was much fresher as well. The minute on each product was easier with my electric toothbrush. However, I didn&#x27;t really notice much whitening. There was a bit in the beginning and not much after that. However, I&#x27;d still buy this product just for the cleaning alone. I thought the product had a very mild mint flavor, which was great for me because mint makes me sick to my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> although I have not noticed a remarkable change in the color of my teeth, and the pictures were not sent as there was no obvious difference, I welcomed the opportunity to try this product as I had been considering the purchase of a whitening system for some time</li>
            <li> I will preface my review by saying that I was excited to have been selected to try the Crest 3D White program. I take good care of my teeth but I tend to over-brush and my teeth are a grayish color.&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging: I would like to see recycled and recyclable outer packing. It would be wonderful if Crest could use a completely recyclable tube - including the cap.&lt;br /&gt;-Application/Process: The process was easy and relatively convenient. The instructions were clear/concise/easy to understand. I timed myself &amp;#34;1-100, 2-100, 3-100 . . .&amp;#34; . I had to remind myself not to rinse the first few times after completing step 1.&lt;br /&gt;--Taste: It is very refreshing and it has a fresh, minty taste. No complaints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;-Teeth Whitening/Cleaning: My teeth have an almost &amp;#34;post-dental office: cleaning feel. I love this! As far as whitening, I see brighter teeth, shinier teeth, that are maybe a touch whiter in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Yes, I would definitely purchase this product because of the qualities listed above, but not for whitening. They will not replace my whitening strips.

Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt; I really like the whitening system. I couldn&#x27;t use it twice a day because I had sensitivity issues. It still whitened my teeth really well, even though I used it once per day. Love the fact that the packaging is paper and can be recycled. I truly impressed with the product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Great product for a whiter smile..as spoken by a member of Shopper army</li>
            <li> I received this cleaning system as a free trial from crest and I actually really liked it! I was skeptical at first as someone who has had professional whitening done a few years ago when I felt like no whitening products worked. However, after using this system regularly, my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner than they have with any other toothpastes! My only complaint is the taste left in my mouth afterward, but that is nothing that a little mouthwash can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I hated it at first, made my mouth draw up inside, felt like I ate a lemon, the second one is good and taste good too. I have noticed my breath smells better so it is doing something other toothpaste doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t wake up with bad breath but I sure wish that would add some mint to the toothpaste it tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a mission for the shoppers army. The product was a little hard to get used to because it made my mouth kind of burn. After a couple of days my mouth got used to the feeling. I noticed that it made my teeth feel squeaky clean and my teeth did look whiter.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using Crest 3D White toothpaste, I have found a slight whitening of my teeth but not as dramatic as I had hoped. To be fair, I&#x27;ll continue using the product longer and am hopeful that overtime, I will see a more significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives: I did feel that the toothpaste is starting to work and I would still recommend it to friends and family to try. I believe it will be much more effective after longer use. I was afraid that it would be harmful to my teeth and gums or that it would be too abrasive and make my teeth sensitive but I did not have those problems at all. I was surprised at how mild the toothpaste was and I had no issues using it. I had negative experiences with tooth whitening products in the past and am happy to report that was not the case with Crest 3D White toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-as-positives: The toothpaste didn&#x27;t taste minty like you would expect most toothpaste to taste like. It was not off-putting but if I could make a few changes, it would be to improve the taste a bit. And it also didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bubble up&amp;#34; like traditional toothpaste so even though I knew the toothpaste was effective, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fee&amp;#34; like it was working b/c of the lack of lather. The second step toothpaste was more of a gel and that definitely took some getting used to. I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I was brushing with the gel or if it had evaporated. Again, I think it&#x27;s because it didn&#x27;t have that traditional &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of toothpaste foaming while you brush that made me think I was only brushing with water. But I must of been using the product, because I was starting to notice a difference! I also brushed a bit longer than the recommended minute for each paste. And lastly (and this is nit-picking really), I still wish it could have been just one step, instead of two. It was odd to have to spit after using the first tube of toothpaste without rinsing. I still haven&#x27;t quit gotten used to that. It&#x27;s not a huge deal but perhaps both products can be combined and still get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I may have set my expectations too high thinking I would see a vast improvement in the whitening of my teeth so soon so I&#x27;ll stick with it since I did see results. (I just have to be a bit more patient). Again, I would purchase this product and recommend this to people to try.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really like Crest 3D White tooth paste. This product is one of the first that after reviewing I wanted to purchase after. It really did make my teeth whiter. I usually get sensitive teeth using products like these but have had no sensitivity problems as of yet! This product is a lot better that Crest White Strips. I love the way this product makes my teeth feel smooth and not gritty. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product really cleans and whitens your teeth,giving you confidence of a great smile, and fresher breath.</li>
            <li> I have spent more time brushing my teeth using these products than I ever have. It took an opportunity, presented to me by someone other than myself or my dentist, to really pay attention more closely to the pearly whites!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received this kit for free as part of a BzzCampaign. I was sceptical since my teeth weren&#x27;t really very discolored to begin with, but I thought &amp;#34;what have I got to lose?&amp;#34; And gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit tough to remember to use step 2. Not used to doing more than 1 step!&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it was overly-strong, as it left my lips and gums feel numb the first few times, but my teeth did look a little whiter. After a few uses, I no longer notice the numbness, but I also don&#x27;t see any more whitening either.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would likely work better for me if I were willing to give up my morning coffee, but overall I like it as a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After the first use I could tell a difference and my teeth/mouth felt cleaner. As I continued to use the product I liked the way my teeth looked and felt. What really sold me though was when I used my old toothpaste. Before trying Crest 3D White I was happy with the way it worked, but after using Crest 3D White my mouth and teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean and fresh as it did when I used Crest 3D White - I won&#x27;t go back again!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really like the Crest 3D kit. I am super OCD when it comes to making sure my teeth are clean and white. I was concerned because I do have sensitive teeth that the whitening portion of the process would make my teeth more sensitive then usual and I am happy to report that the added sensitivity was very minimal. Because my teeth were already fairly white, I didn&#x27;t notice a change, but my family asked if I had been to the dentist for a cleaning. I would recommend this toothpaste/whitening combo pack and I am going to continue buying it once my sample is gone.</li>
            <li> It removed stains and my teeth whitened up! Made me feel like I had a youthful smile again!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This product does what it says -- it really does whiten teeth. The issues I have are with the 2-step process and the taste. Brushing teeth 2X is annoying. It would be better to combine this into one toothpaste. (But I&#x27;m assuming the ingredients can&#x27;t be mixed, or else Crest would have done that.) The taste is pretty bad for toothpaste, barely minty, and it has a kind of bitter taste. The 2nd tube has peroxide, so I didn&#x27;t expect much. It mostly tastes like peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;[Free product review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> i like that this is easy to use because you can just replace your normal toothpaste with this 2 step process. No need to leave a gel or patch on your teeth and wait. It&#x27;s quite strong, but it does work to some extent. keeps away more yellowing but didnt quite get it all the way to shiny white. it also makes your teeth sensitive, so i would probably use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks Crest and Bzzagent for this free sample!</li>
            <li> It is a lot of trouble to use the two step process. It is time consuming and bothersome. Prior to using this product I was using two different kinds of toothpaste applied to my toothbrush at the same time and the results are very good (much better than the Crest 3D White.) I do not feel that the Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system whitened my teeth &amp;#34;99% as white as a professional polish.&amp;#34; The product is good and I had no problems with the product. However, I feel that there are better teeth whitening toothpastes/products available. (Tested as part of a Shopper Army mission.)</li>

            <li> I gave this product three stars not because it didn&#x27;t work, but because the taste was so terrible. I have always used Crest whitening products since the first whitening strips. When I got the opportunity to try this through BzzAgent I was super excited. I followed the easy two steps to a whiter smile but man that taste was hard to get past. I saw results within the first two days but after brushing my mouth didn&#x27;t feel very clean maybe it was just because the texture of the finishing paste. Good product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat the results.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gives you a white smile in days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I received this from BzzAgent to try and boy am I impressed!!</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the clean feeling you get in your mouth after using this product, it is so easy to use and not at all time consuming like other whitening products. I did notice whiter teeth after the first week of use but I haven&#x27;t seen any change since. I will definitely keep using this product if only for the great clean healthy feeling in my mouth. The only negative with the product is the medicinal aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was really nervous when I began using this product that it would aggravate the sensitive spots on my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised that it did not. I found that using the 2-step process sometimes was more work than I wanted to put in, especially in the morning rush. I did notice some basic brightening and whitening happening with my front teeth, but never had any comments from others.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> These products really made a difference with the whiteness of my teeth. The first day or two, it was quite tingly and sensitive to the gum line but it dissipated after a few times. The taste is not bad but there could be improvement. The lack of mint makes it &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as if your teeth are not clean.&lt;br /&gt;The #2 tube could use a flip top like the #1 tube.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product was just OK. I didn&#x27;t see huge whitning results. It did, However, make my teeth feel very clean, I experienced some mild sensitivity with the &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; routine. I was only able to use it once a day or every other day. I didn&#x27;t see any noticable &amp;#34;whitning difference.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; [you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt; Not Bad but didn&#x27;t see huge results.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt; I have tried other teeth whitening products but I never thought any of them really worked. I liked this two part system as I really do believe my teeth are two or three shades lighter just after a couple of weeks. I am a tea and coffee drinker so I am aware of how easy it is to stain my teeth. I think this actually worked better than the dentist polishing I go through twice a year. It did cause my gums to swell a little but that went away as soon as I rinsed after using the polisher. Strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received 3D White kit through Crest to try for free. I didn&#x27;t have big expectations but I&#x27;m happy to report that it really works! I haven&#x27;t experienced any stains or weird sensations. I was using the 3D Brilliance toothpaste before and was happy with that, but this is even better! Give it a try, I bet you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised too!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White dual cleansing &amp; whitening system - works really well as a cleaner of the teeth &amp; mouth but the whitening part isn&#x27;t so great. I did not see any visible results after two weeks of use that I already got from using Crest Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Whitening toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about using two different products to clean my teeth, but after just the first use, I was hooked! The Crest products make your mouth feel tingly and clean, and I can see the difference in the whiteness of my teeth after just 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> For my natural front teeth, I did notice that they were whiter. But the crowns do not match now. Whitening was also a little blotchy. I tired to use a lot on the gum line but they still seemed a little yellow. Perhaps it has always been this way, but was noticeable when I looked so closely.&lt;br /&gt;I preferred the cap on the #1, until it snapped part way off. The flavor for was #1 was nice - but not for the #2. But there really was no aftertaste, so that was okay.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> i enjoyed using the crest 3D white daily cleansing and whitening system and after a few days I actually saw a difference. It&#x27;s easy to use and tastes great. It takes a lot to impress me and I&#x27;m impressed. I have been a long time crest user and they out did themselves with this product</li>
            <li> Great Whitening Product!  Very easy to use and instant results.  Worked better than the whitening kit I got from my dentist</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product free thru crest and bzzagent. I did not mind the two step process at first. Step 1&#x27;s tube I loved-the flip cap was great. I hated the step 2 screw cap. The first couple days my gums hurt but that got better quick. My teeth did not get much whiter. I do drink lots of caffeine (pepsi and sweet tea) so that could be the problem. I will continue to use this toothpaste because it was free, but I do not think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I thought that my Crest 3D White toothpaste was a good product. I&#x27;ve used whitening strips before and not only are they a slimy hassle, but they are also an extra step in your day and I find I get very sensitive teeth after only a few days of use. The toothpaste is convenient because I already brush my teeth several times a day. I did find my gums were slightly sensitive to cold water after using both steps, but it was not painful, just odd. I noticed my teeth were a little whiter, but I started out with fairly white teeth to begin with. What I really liked about the toothpaste was how clean my mouth felt, even after waking up the next morning. I will also admit that I did not use the toothpaste all the time, as sometimes my lazy butt even thought two steps was too much work. However, I would say it was still easier to brush twice than to use the strips!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received my Crest 3d white brilliance through bzzagent for free. When I got it it was skeptical because I have tried whitening products in the past that either did not work or took a long time to see the effects, or made my teeth really sensitive. After trying this I noticed after the first couple of times that I could see a slight difference. I am very impressed. Also, when I drink hot or cold liquids after doing it I don&#x27;t notice any pain or sensitivity issues. Love that!! Will definitely purchase and use again!!</li>
            <li> I received the system as part of a promotion from Crest and fell in love! I did start using it a few weeks after I finished my box of 3D Crest Professional Effects strips (best ever), but I could tell that it kept stains at bay and made sure my teeth were extra white. I&#x27;m so much more confident with my smile now (goodbye, yellow teeth) and will def be using the system in between the whitening strips. Thank you, Crest!</li>
            <li> I was rooting for this product-I really was, but after faithfully brushing twice daily for 2 weeks I saw no noticeable whitening results. I had no adverse reactions, and my mouth felt clean after using this 2 step product, but I was really hoping for noticeably whiter brighter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the crest 3d white free through buzz agent. I have been using at least once a day for about 2 weeks and can notice a slight difference in how white my teeth are. The whitening is definitely working but I do not like the feel it leaves in my mouth once I am done brushing. It almost leaves my tongue feeling numb. Overall works for whitening my teeth just wish it didn&#x27;t leave the weird feeling when done brushing.</li>
            <li> I really thought that it would be too much extra effort to do a second toothpaste twice a week but I was relieved and excited to find out that you do the first step for one minute and then spit and add the second for another minute. It&#x27;s only one rinsing process and it&#x27;s just as simple as using a regular one step process. I&#x27;m so thankful for crest giving me a free trial! My only complaint is that my mouth feels very dry afterwards but nothing a glass of water can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for 10 days and I love it.  You simply brush your teeth with the included toothpaste and follow up with the whitener and use each one for only one minute!  It tastes great, is easy to use and best of all, my teeth are definitely whiter!  At day ten, my gums started to get a little sensitive, so I went back to my regular toothpaste until they felt better, then returned to the Crest 3D White Brilliance Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to use strips or anything else, this easy and quick process works perfectly all by itself!  I got to try this product for free from Crest, but I will buy it when I use this one all up; I like it that much.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was chomping at the bit to try a new whitening product as a few months ago I had a negative experience with a professional whitening product purchased through a dentist’s office. The more, eh, intense dentist&#x27;s product had created so much sensitivity in my teeth that I thought I was feeling disheartened and pessimistic about whitening products. I was also feeling frustration about my new tea habit and the stains it has been leaving on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started researching Crest’s new product I was terribly concerned that it might contain plastic beads. Fortunately this product does not.  The primary ingredients of interest are stannous fluoride in the step 1 cleanser and hydrogen peroxide in the step 2 whitening polish. The only concerns with these chemicals is a possible teeth staining from the fluoride formula and tooth sensitivity from the peroxide. Crest addresses these by 1) warning the user about the possibility of fluoride staining and 2) leaving cleansing paste on your teeth during the polish step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the 3D White System for over two weeks now. I find that the concerns about fluoride staining and peroxide sensitivity are not an issue for me. I have experienced no staining or strange discoloration in my teeth or gums and that makes me happy. The peroxide does not give me strong cold sensitivity. There is a mild sensation of a brisk cool wind coming in my mouth during that final polishing step and during the final rinse, but I suffer no negative side effects from the whitening agent. This was a concern for me since the carbamide peroxide in my dentist’s professional products resulted in intolerable side effects for me. Crest is much milder an experience. As to the whitening effects, I have seen my teeth lighten 1-2 shades. Of course my teeth are their whitest after brushing and not after drinking tea, but I see distinct benefits from doing a whitening regimen so regularly since I have this tea habit that is constantly staining my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the product is that it does not significantly lengthen my dental hygiene regimen. It keeps my teeth whitened regularly in spite of my regular tea habit. The multiple product tube stand upright and don’t take up much counter space. The whitening experience is not painful or complicated. I like the taste of the products (almost fruity or bubble gum like). From what I can tell, the system is not very expensive.So would I continue to use this product? Yes, with a caveat. I think that my dentist needs to be consulted before I decide to use a hydrogen peroxide treatment daily as I don’t know what that chemical does to healthy bacteria in the mouth. Last time I checked the bottle of peroxide in my medicine cabinet it said it was for dental debridement and I believe it functions as an antiseptic. The dose may be inconsequential for that purpose. I will ask during my appointment later this month. I am very glad I got to try this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**To address another reviewer&#x27;s claim, I&#x27;m pretty sure that abrasion is not the method Crest uses to whiten in this product. If you review the product ingredients and do a little research, there are no abrasives in the whitening polish. The only whitening agent is hydrogen peroxide (which may or may not be good as all the spendier products I&#x27;ve seen on the market seem to use carbamide peroxide). The only &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; ingredients I can find are in the deep cleansing toothpaste are hydrated silica and mica. I&#x27;ve seen silica in tons of toothpastes, including the ones recommended by my dentist, most of which do not advertise themselves as whitening and can still have low RDA (Relative Dentin Abrasivity) values. I don&#x27;t know as much about mica. A quick google search suggested that both of those substances are included to help scrape plaque off your teeth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I received it as part of a promotional opportunity from Crest &amp; BzzAgent. My teeth are squeaky clean after I use it &amp; they are noticeably whiter and brighter after only using it for a week or so!</li>
            <li> I received this amazing whitening system from BzzAgent, thanks to Crest! I was hoping it would whiten as well as Crest Whitestrips, but without the tooth sensitivity, and IT DID! I was so impressed with the ease of use and gentle whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this whitening system to anyone who wants whoter teeth, but without the harshness of whitening strips. Although this did not cause tooth sensitivity in me, it may still cause sensitivity in others, but I am happy to report it didn&#x27;t - and Whitestrips cause my teeth to hurt &amp; become super sensitive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use (brush as normal)&lt;br /&gt;Decent tasting&lt;br /&gt;Whitens quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Gently whitens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;MAY cause tooth sensitivity (didn&#x27;t for me)&lt;br /&gt;Some may not enjoy taste</li>
            <li> Crest 3D is Amazing!! My teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been. I&#x27;ve tried the white strips and other brands by far Crest 3D is the best!! I was given this product free from Buzz agent and Crest 3D.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past few weeks once a day and am loving the results. It&#x27;s not the best tasting, but it isn&#x27;t horrible. I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little hesitant on trying this product. Just because other whiteners I have tried had a horrible taste :(. However, these amazing 2 products are great! I started to see a difference after the fourth application. My teeth were never yellow, but they weren&#x27;t as white as I would like them to be. I use this product twice daily, and I am so pleased with the results so far. Oh wait!, did I mention I got to try this product for free? Thanks Crest!&lt;br /&gt;~ CaSandra</li>
            <li> I have been trying this free thanks to Crest and I love it. My teeth are whiter and my mouth feels fresher for longer! It is a fantastic</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a few weeks now and have nothing but positive things to say about it. My teeth have never been as white as I&#x27;d like them to be and I&#x27;ve used an assortment of different methods to try and go up a shade or two. Nothing has worked this easily and quickly before. This combination (easy and quick) is key for me. I like low maintenance and I like quick results, both of which Crest has nailed with this system.&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned the sucralose taste being unbearable, but I don&#x27;t find it all that noticeable. I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to that flavor as I highly dislike it, but this was very minor here.&lt;br /&gt;So grateful to Crest and Bzzagent for letting me try this for free. I&#x27;ll gladly continue to purchase it going forward.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much! I got It free from crest and bzzagent and when I first tried It I instantly saw a difference in my teeth. My teeth are whiter and more healthier looking!</li>
            <li> This is awesome and easy!  People are noticing literally everywhere I go.  Thanks Crest for allowing me to try this product!  I&#x27;m telling everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Its super simple and only takes 2....thats right...2 minutes.  Clearly labeled Step 1 and Step 2....its totally fool proof.  I use it with my popular brand electric toothbrush that runs a two minute cycle...really...everybody has time for this!!!  No strips...no pens....just brush yo dang teeth!  AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Crest and BzzAgent.  Based on the price, I don&#x27;t believe that I would have purchased it to try on my own otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step in the two part system, the toothpaste comes with a warning that the fluoride may cause staining.  Right off the bat, that seems counterproductive.  The chemicals used to flavor and sweeten this toothpaste leave a slightly unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth for quite a while.  Step one has a very gritty texture, but none of the tiny plastic beads that tend to get caught under the gums causing irritation.  After brushing for one minute with the Step One toothpaste I have noticed that my mouth feels very strange.  Sort of numb and tingly, parched and dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second step is a peroxide sort of gel.  After brushing with Step One you are supposed to spit, and start Step Two right away.  I had no problems with the second step, there was no bleaching of my gums or insides of my cheeks.  I experienced no increased sensitivity even after a week or more of use.  I do find myself wondering if I could just mix step one and step two in order to save time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took before and after pictures at the same time of the day in the same location after two weeks of use and I am sorry to say that I did not noticed any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the campaign invite through BzzAgent to try Crest&#x27;s new 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System, I signed up right away. I mean who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune?? I was a little intimated by the 2 part system, thinking that it was going to be too time consuming and in the end a product that I would not continue with. However, when I learned what the 2 part process actually was, I realized it’s not bad at all. I tend to brush my teeth for a longer period anyway with my Sonic Care toothbrush, and the 2 step process is quick and simple for me because the toothbrush makes a noise after 1 minute and then stops after 2 minutes. The directions tell you to brush with the Step 1 tube first, which is the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste that prepares your teeth, then spit -don&#x27;t rinse (which I would tend to forget a time or two)- and then last use the Step 2 tube for the second minute being the Whitening Finisher. The product states the system together is supposed to keep your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish. There is one big negative in my eyes, and that is the awful after taste that the product leaves in my mouth after brushing, almost making me feel sick. And the taste is still there when I wake up in the middle of the night due to a child crying or bathroom needs, and again it makes me feel sick. I even tried using mouthwash after I brushed but the bad taste still came back. I actually noticed myself after a couple weeks of use reverting back to my old toothpaste here and there to not have to deal with the awful taste. For this reason I will not be purchasing the item in the future. I also noticed that after using the product my mouth felt tingly and parched. It was definitely a weird feeling. As for the whitening results, I have not noticed a significant difference, maybe a slight change if anything. I asked my husband if he noticed a difference and he said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. So all in all, I was bummed about the productand will continue to use Crest&#x27;s 3D Whitening toothpaste that I have used for years which I do highly recommend. I also have to say that I read some of the other product reviews and saw the negative comments people were saying about the ingredients in the product which is a little scary and makes me not want to use the product again. I was shocked to see how many other people noticed the bad after taste just like I did! Sorry Crest, but still happy I was able to try it for free :)</li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent. I am currently in DAY 26 using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System. Just after the first day I noticed a difference! My breathe was not only minty fresh but last, and my teeth were more radiant and white. I would definitely recommended this whitening system to anyone who wants quick results!</li>
            <li> I received a box free from Crest and love it! I feel my teeth are cleaner and can see they are whiter! I realize my lighting is different in the pictures but you can see a difference!</li>
            <li> I personally love crest toothpaste, but normally only gel. This toothpaste however is great it&#x27;s a two step 2 min routine. I have been using it for a week now and should have taken a beginning pic as to have something to compare it to. All that I can say now is that it does freshen breath and the two steps aren&#x27;t inconvenient. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay $20 for it but it does beat the dentist lol. I was able to try this product for free on smiley 360 for a review.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Crest the week before it came out. Been using it for almost three weeks now and my husband notices a difference. The system is easy to follow and I think the second step sort of tastes like honey. This is my first whitening product that wasn&#x27;t a regular toothpaste and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a month now-- for free thanks to Crest®.  In the beginning I was super excited to start as whiter teeth is always a good thing.  After the first few days I noticed my mouth was absurdly dry, but kept shrugging it off as the weather.  I continued use twice a day for the entire month, and every time after brushing I was left with a sour after taste which I chased with mouthwash &amp; a very dry mouth.  Overall, I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing this on my own free will as there was little to no results.  Before getting this product I would have liked to know about the dry mouth.  I&#x27;ve attached a photo with before (left) &amp; after (right) photos to show my personal results.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I have used many different products in the past and this is by far my new favorite. Not only does it really whiten your teeth, but it also leaves your mouth feeling extremely fresh and clean. Another bonus is that even after several weeks of using the product I never experienced any sensitivity problems.</li>
            <li> I was given a Crest 3D White Brilliance kit to try courtesy of Bzz Agent to try and test so these are my own honest opinions, I used it for a couple days and it was good but i didnt see much result for whitnening after using it for a week but toothpaste is nice and fresh making my mouth fresh., If i was to do it longer maybe i would have seen white on my teeth. Very simple and easy to use Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> i had the privilege of trying the product free thanks to Crest. i was super excited and still am. I used this item twice a day for as long as I could, but starting day 2 I experienced discomfort while using this product. This product cause pain on contact with the space where my teeth and gums meet and also left a white stain on my gums. the discomfort became unbearable so i started using it only once a day. i noticed a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but it wasn&#x27;t significant.  over all, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this product again, but i would try it again if the formula was changed. I&#x27;ve used other Crest Whitening products in the past and this is the first time i had this reaction</li>
            <li> I was given a Crest 3D White Brilliance kit to try courtesy of Bzz Agent so I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose or gain by trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several whitening toothpastes (Colgate, Rembrandt and other Crest pastes.). Compared to the other pastes I have used the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning paste leaves your teeth feeling very clean. My teeth felt as though they had been flossed after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening paste is very effective in lifting moderate stains fairly quickly. After about 4 days of use I could really see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no harsh taste to either paste and didn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a couple of cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening paste is very thin and can come out of the tube very fast so be careful if you&#x27;re brushing after showering or if you&#x27;re in a room with high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is a paste that you could use to really prep your teeth for whitening strips but I feel like Crest&#x27;s line of single system toothpastes clean and whiten as well (if maybe not as fast.)</li>
            <li> I was given this product for free to try and review from crest, all opinions are my own. I liked that I could see a difference in whiteness after a few days of using what I didn&#x27;t like was how sensitive this made my teeth. I was unable to use it more than a few days due to sensitivity issues. My husband on the other hand is still using this without any problem and I can definitely notice a difference in the whiteness of his teeth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I am an avid coffee drinker so my teeth are not as white as they could be. I received a full sized sample to review from BzzAgent. I noticed a difference after just a few days! It actually cleans your teeth so well you can hear them squeaking! I wouldn&#x27;t say the taste is terrible, there is just a lack of minty-ness. Step 1 is more an abrasive/cleaner. Step 2 is a polish which has a better taste.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and daughter, who are not the best brushers, even started using this to help whiten their teeth. My daughters teeth I think it made the biggest improvement on. She is hooked too! So now they are brushing like they should have been all along because the results have been so impressive. For not having to do anything extra than just brushing for the 2 minutes you normally would anyway, I will take it! I have tried whitestrips before and they are just not for me. My smile has never been this impressive, and my family is brushing now more than ever. This has definitely become a staple in out home.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this FREE in the mail from Bzz Agent. I started using it immediately. The two step process doesn&#x27;t take any longer than regular brushing. Each step only takes 1 minute. The product is refreshing and leaves me with a fresh, clean feeling. After just a few days I was able to see an amazing difference in the brightness of my teeth. This product does what it says it does. The only problem I had was it made my gums super sore. That may just be because I have a sensitive mouth. I wish it didn&#x27;t do this because I love it so much I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty simple and easy to use product which I like, but I do think if I want to get whitening done, the one step crest white strips once a week is just easier than the two step process.  I also really hated the taste...it was hard to get past so it was hard to want to use it.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, it seemed to make a whitening change to my teeth, but it&#x27;s not really for me.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System from Bzzagent and I #GotItFree so that I could test it. So far, I have had good results. I have been using it for a few weeks now and there is a small noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I am excited to continue using this product to whiten my teeth even more! It is easy to use, you just have to brush your teeth with both the paste and the gel. Overall this is a great and easy product to use if you are trying to whiten your teeth and don&#x27;t like the taste of feel of white strips, or are unable to afford professional whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li> I got the Crest 3D White free thanks to Crest for being a BzzAgent. I have fairly sensitive teeth but would love to find a whitening product I can use. I was happy to receive this sample to try, as whitening products can be spendy. Needless to say I am glad I didn&#x27;t spent the money on this. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it enough to even see if it would whiten my teeth at all. It increased my sensitivity to hot and cold after just a week of trying to use it, I couldn&#x27;t use it 2 times a day either. It was also hard on my gums, making them sore. The taste is okay, the step one is not really strong or minty and the step 2 doesn&#x27;t really have any taste.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a whitening product as I have always been concerned about damage to my teeth, caused by the whitening ingredients. My teeth are fairly white teeth but they could definitely be whiter. When I was offered a free sample of the product from Crest, I decided it was time to do a bit of research. I read other reviews and asked around if anyone had used a Crest whitening product. Most everything I heard was positive, so I agreed to try out the free sample. I am so glad I did. When I first received the product I read the instructions and the warning printed on the package to watch out for irritation and discomfort from using the product. I did experience some minor discomfort in my gums about a week in. However, I took a few days off from this toothpaste and when returning to it, the discomfort was gone. I have used the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System now for about a month. My teeth are definitely whiter and the toothpaste alone is a great product. My teeth feel clean all day long and the whitener has turned my pretty smile into a fabulous smile. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I Got this Product free , Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest. At first i was not too sure of having to use a combination of 2 products but after using it for a week i saw results, It really works and its not so much fuss as it gets to become part of your brushing routine. I am now using it for more than 3 weeks and my friends have asked me about my Whittier teeth and honestly i smile more often since i am more confident in my self, who knew white teeth can bring so much of a difference. I have only one thing to say and that is you will love it.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free through BzzAgent and I found that this was not a product I really cared for. I didn&#x27;t really like the toothpaste (Step 1), No matter how many times I&#x27;ve used it now, it always burns my gums and lips and I really can&#x27;t wait to spit it out. The whitening polish (Step 2) is definitely much better than Step 1, but I noticed it would leave me with &amp;#34;cotton mouth&amp;#34; and I would have a weird after-taste in my throat. After Step 1 I had an after-taste of peroxide and then once I was done with Step 2 the peroxide after-taste was stronger. I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth appearing any whiter than before I started the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System. I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price it is currently being sold at. I think I will try the Whitening Strips next time!</li>
            <li> As a smoker and coffee drinker (by coffee drinker, I mean I drink a gallon a day), I&#x27;m in some serious need of a good teeth whitener. I have tried every kind of whitening toothpaste there is. Crest 3D White is hands down the best you can buy at the store. Luckily I got a free sample from Bzz Agent because I had given up trying them after 100 fails. Step one, literally had my teeth feel so clean, I felt like I had just left the dentist. I kept running my tongue over them, they felt so smooth. I will say that after two weeks of using the product daily, one I absolutely had whiter teeth, but my teeth started becoming sensitive to sweets. I had the same issues with my whitening trays that I got from the dentist. That alone is why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I cannot use it as a daily toothpaste. I have to use it every few days or give up sweets.... I saw in some of reviews that some people had issues while brushing, I did not have any issues while using the product. Step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest, but it works.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product from BuzzAgent to give it a try and tell what I thought! I have mostly always used Crest products and have used different forms of the 3D white before such as the whitening strips, mouth rinse and the toothpaste. When I got this I was expecting the toothpaste (step 1) to be similar to what I have used before. However once I tried it, it didn&#x27;t seem the same. I like using tooth pastes that have a heavy foam when bushed on, this product didn&#x27;t seem to do that. One other comment that I do have about this product is that it does take a little bit more time than just using a normal whitening tooth paste. To use this regimen, you would need to sit out about an extra 5 minutes of brushing time. Besides that, after using step 1 and step 2 I noticed that my teeth did look a lot whiter. After the first few weeks of using this product my teeth have become several shades whiter, which was what I was hoping for. In comparison to other teeth whitening products, I do prefer this one. I have also tried whitening pens and still think that this product does a better job. One reason why I think that this product does a better job at whitening is that it is being brushed on with a bristle brush instead of the little rubber brushes that come with whitening pens, and is better than the strips because its not just sitting on your teeth. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity after using this product which was a surprise to me because I have experienced that with other teeth whitening brands. Being that I drink a lot of coffee I didn&#x27;t think that this product would be of much help but I absolutely love it and I will purchase it in the near future when I am out of it!</li>
            <li> Lucky me! I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  I have been looking for inexpensive ways to whiten my teeth, but there is so much out there!  This is a great product and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You brush using the purple tube (marked 1) for one minute. You can spit, but do not rinse! Then you use the white tube (marked 2) for one minute.  Rinse and spit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a tea and coffee drinker, I noticed results within a couple weeks. My teeth are brighter and I love the minty taste it leaves in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and a great price for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product before it came out and would definitely purchase it again! It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth as white as the whitestrips, but it doesn&#x27;t leave them as sensitive either. It is easy to use and makes your mouth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price! I was wary to try this because whitening products make my teeth a little sensitive. This product, however, made my teeth white without the sore feelings I would normally get. The first toothpaste initially makes your mouth a little dry and since you aren&#x27;t supposed to rinse until after the second paste, your mouth gets a little dry. The second paste, I admit, made my gums a little tingly. Not sensitive, but tingly. Kind of like the tingly feeling I get when using Listerine. The product does actually whiten over time and I can definitely see myself buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to give the Crest 3D Daily Whitening System a try and after about two weeks of use, I can say I&#x27;m definitely impressed. I was a little nervous when I received the product to try from BzzAgent and Crest because I&#x27;d heard the toothpaste caused some sensitivity and discoloration for a few people. I&#x27;ve also had bad experiences with whitening kits in the past without seeing much in the way of results. Not at all the case with Crest 3D Whitening System. After the first day or two, I could only see minimal results and became even more skeptical but kept up with the two step brushing process. Some people may be leery of the two step process, but it&#x27;s actually really simple. You use the step one cleanser and brush for 1 minute than simple add the whitening agent and continue brushing for another minute.. spit, rinse and you&#x27;re done! After about one week, I really started noticing a difference in the look and feel of my teeth. They weren&#x27;t just whiter, but my mouth overall felt a little bit fresher. Two weeks later, the change continued and my teeth were visibly whiter. What I found to be really great about this particular whitener, is that it doesn&#x27;t stray me from my daily routine or add any extra time to getting ready. This is really nice in comparison to whitening strips which can be messy and time consuming. Overall, the product has worked well getting my teeth not only whiter but fresher and without the added time or mess. I can also say I have yet to experience any sensitivity or discoloration with the Crest 3D White daily cleaning kit that some other people have been noticing. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a brighter smile without the added cost or time.</li>
            <li> I received a box of the Credt 3D whitening system and I was already kind of skeptical. I have used whitening products in the past with not much luck. But since Crest sent me it for free I said why not! I had my mom try it out with me. After using it for several weeks, along with my Sonicare toothbrush, I must say I like it. I really noticed a difference in my teeth coloration. My mother enjoyed the product as well... Commenting how her teeth were looking healthy and glowing!!!!! I would recommended this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent I had the opportunity to try this for free.  I have tried and used whitening systems in the past that have been pretty good.  After using this system for a few days I honestly have to say this is the only whitening system in which i have seen actual visual results of my teeth showing whiter in a matter of days.  By using the system twice a day and for only a week, the difference looking through the mirror was noticable.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the taste of this cleansing system.  I have a hard time using the whitening systems that taste terribly and while this wasn&#x27;t terrible, tolerable actually, it is not the best one I have had in terms of medicinal tasting.  It is effective and if you can bare the taste, this product is great!!!</li>
            <li> I have been considering teeth whitening regiment but I did not not want to spend a fortune. In the past I had tried the white strips but needed something to keep up with the whitening. As an avid coffee and tea drinker I was concerned that my teeth were not as white as I would like them to be. When I saw the BzzAgent Campaign for the Crest #D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing system I was very eager because this is the product that I have been searching for. It is very simple to use, twice a day. I have noticed results after the first week and have not had to stop drinking coffee!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll start by saying that I drink TONS of coffee and tea and my teeth always have an ever so slight tint of an off-white-ish color. I&#x27;ve been using GoSmile for the longest time to maintain my teeth from getting too far on the yellow side. I brush my teeth once, twice a day and I&#x27;m a complete freak about keeping them as clean as possible. But when BzzAgent sent this magical product out, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope for it at first. I started out using it twice a day and it was actually making my gums hurt a little so I went to just using it in the mornings and using a regular 3D crest toothpaste at nights. Step 1 feels a little weird at first when you&#x27;re done brushing because you can&#x27;t rinse your mouth out but once you get step 2 on and spit and rinse it all out, your teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally whitened. After three days, I noticed a HUGE difference. My teeth weren&#x27;t yellow before, but now they&#x27;re so white I actually have people asking if I just had them whitened. My advice is to use plenty of water on your toothbrush in between steps because the peroxide or whatever is in each tube can make your mouth a little dry afterwards. But all in all, this is by far the best teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m 100% confident I&#x27;ll actually pay for another set when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, The smell was pleasant, unlike other competitors. For the cost, convenience, and ease of use I would recommend. I have had a positive experience so far. I will probably repurchase.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from BzzAgent (free from Crest) to try out for free and review. I loved the easy 2 step system that you can complete in just 2 minutes! First- brush for 60 seconds with Step 1 to leave your teeth feeling clean. Second- brush for 60 seconds with Step 2 to whiten/polish your teeth for a professional clean feeling! I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks and have already seen results. My teeth are noticeably whiter and feel so smooth and clean. The only negative of this product is that it is a little strong and tends to burn my mouth after completing both steps. However, the effects are temporary (less than 15 seconds) and are worth the great results! I would highly recommend the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to anyone looking to gradually whiten their teeth without the expense of a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> WHITENS FROM THE FIRST DAY! I GOT THIS FREE TO TRY FROM BZZAGENT.COM AND IT WHITENED FROM THE FIRST DAY! I WILL BE BUYING THIS ALL THE TIME NOW. MANY PEOPLE WHO SAW ME THOUGHT I HAD HAD MY TEETH WHITENED BY A DENITIST.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth.  This product really whitens.  However it is not really good for sensitive teeth.  Now if theu decide to make one for sensitive teeth I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing toothpaste from Crest for free to try.  I was skeptical that it could really whiten but I was totally proven wrong.  After just the first brushing, my teeth were whiter.  After two weeks, they are more noticeably whiter.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t think this product really freshens breath.  I&#x27;ve found I need to brush my teeth with a different toothpaste to freshen my mouth and then this to whiten.  I look at this as more of a treatment rather than typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and Crest I was able to try this product for free. In this set you get two tubes. You use the first one for one minute and then you use the second one for one minute as well (let me tell you, it does discipline me and make me brush my teeth for the full two minutes).&lt;br /&gt;I do drink a lot of coffee: at least three cups a day. Also I like Red Bull that doesn’t really help to whiten my teeth. To be honest I was a little skeptical before trying this product. I have tried so many whitening toothpastes that I can’t even put a count on it. The last one that I had been using was Rembrandt. I cannot say I loved it-I was satisfied with it. Until I tried Crest 3D brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system. With Rembrandt you have to choose: either you buy the kind that works with your stains or the one that whiten your teeth. With Crest you get two in one. How awesome is that? You don’t have to make a tough decision and choose between the stains or whitening. You just buy one.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret now that I didn’t take a picture of my teeth before trying this product (well, it’s because I didn’t think I was going to get any results). I know that my teeth are at least two tones whiter than they were before but it would be nice to see it on the picture.</li>
            <li> I received this duo for free from BzzAgent. Step 1 is basically like a regular whitening toothpaste. Yes, it is a bit gritty or abrasive. All good toothpastes are and whitening toothpastes are even more abrasive so they can reive debris and help remove surface stains from your teeth. I didn&#x27;t, however, find it to feel overly gritty. I thought that it had a really nice flavor also. Step 2 tastes is similar to the whitening gel you find in whitening strips. It tastes the same to me, but I don&#x27;t think the taste is unbearable. It isn&#x27;t great either though. This duo produces great results. I think that this could be used as a maintenance product if you use whitening strips or on its own. The results are noticeable, and I&#x27;ve had people comment on how white and beautiful my teeth are. The price may seem a little hefty, but I think it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic whitening product. While it may seem a bit cumbersome or a pain to have two tubes of toothpaste, it is a million times easier than waiting with white strips or painting a gel on your teeth and holding a light up to them, etc. It is literally an instant result that gets even better with more use and probably the fastest whitening product I&#x27;ve used. I love this product and it&#x27;s worth getting for simple ease of use and time efficiency. It&#x27;s also something you&#x27;re already going to use, so you&#x27;re not buying &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; teeth products.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue with this system.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely impressed with Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System thus far. I received the kit complimentary from BzzAgent and Crest and have been singing its praises since the first day I tried it. The actual toothpaste is gritty yet tasty and makes you feel like it is really deep cleaning. It tastes very similar (if not identical) to Crest 3D White toothpaste (which it actually may be) and I have always found that product enjoyable and efficient. I will admit that for the price, the actual tube of toothpaste, which I tend to use more of, is on the smaller side, but with a sale or a coupon, this would be a great investment. The whitening paste has a bit of a funny, chemical taste to it but I justify it as the whitening power in action. It is comparable to the residue left by the whitening strips of old and it makes me feel like the product is really working. I have sensitive gums and have yet to feel any real sensitivity or pain from using the product. Though only using it a couple days thus far, I am hopeful that I will see some real whitening results moving forward. I can see this as a daily maintenance kit if I can find it on sale! Can&#x27;t wait to give it a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about the new Crest 3D White toothpaste set! I was so excited when I received my BzzAgent complimentary trial set  from Crest and BzzAgent and had to try it right away! The packaging is bright and is eye catching. I like that the whitening finisher is in a white tube because it is a teeth whitener. The tubes are easy to apply to your toothbrush and the deep cleansing toothpaste has a great tasting mint flavor. The second step, whitening finisher, really works well! After I brush my teeth with the set, I feel as though I just left the dentist. My teeth feel polish and look super clean! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the Crest 3D White system. My mouth felt clean and fresh every time I brushed. It improved the look of my teeth in the two and a half weeks I have been using it for sure. The two step process was easy to complete each day and it really freshens up your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a very different experience using two products as most of us are used to one toothpaste. I adapted easily and my teeth felt cleaner and more refreshed after both steps were complete.</li>
            <li> After using the Crest HD I did notice that my teeth felt cleaner and maybe a little whiter. However I hated the taste.</li>
            <li> I received this full size product to try thanks to Creat and Bzz Agent. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled for the product at first because I have tried whitening my teeth with other products but never got much results and usually left my teeth very sensitive to cold stuff. But these two together are great and easy to use. I had no issues with sensitivity and didn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing my teeth regularly. It&#x27;s a easy two step two minute brush. My teeth were noticeably whiter In about 5 days. The only reason why I am giving this product 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as fresh as I would want it too. But I think that&#x27;s just me liking super duper minty breath. But I just follow up with mouthwash and that seems to do the trick. So yes this a great product and I definetely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Crest products and I am always whitening my teeth so Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System are the perfect products for me. The reason I gave this product 3 out of 5 stars is because it made my gums feel tingly after using it and I found using two products a little bit time consuming. I also didn&#x27;t like how much counter space two products took up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive things about this product is that it made my teeth feel clean and I really liked the flavor. It also made my teeth a little whiter but my teeth are so white to begin with that it wasn&#x27;t very noticeable. You can see how white my teeth are from my picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free from Crest as a BzzAgent. A few months ago I received another product from Crest that was very similar and that I liked just a little better because it did not give my gums that tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me feel better about smiling in pictures. Having yellow teeth I either did not want to be in pictures at all or did not smile in them very often.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh and clean! and My teeth are beginning to be whiter. It&#x27;s removing stains that have been there for years. I wish it didn&#x27;t take weeks to see a difference but it&#x27;s safe and not as expensive as seeing a professional. I received this for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent but opinions are my own. Thank you Crest for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Tested this system as part of &amp;#34;Shopper Army&amp;#34; in-home testing mission. Overall Rating [out of 5]: 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Not good since the product made my gums hurt after only a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that testing this Crest really made me appreciate my regular toothpaste, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which never hurts my gums. Simpler is often better.  A toothpaste that promises to help a host of issues most people don&#x27;t even have and then fails at safely cleaning my teeth without causing pain is not one I can recommend. I&#x27;m unable to say if it would have succeeded in making my teeth whiter as I discontinued use after experiencing sore gums.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! I have tried many products though out the years and this one did better than most. And for what it was, it took little to no time at all to use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use for 2weeks due to irritation. I think this product would work great if it could be used properly.</li>
            <li> I thought this product worked well. It made my teeth feel really smooth and clean, but I didn&#x27;t like having to use two separate products to do the job. It would have been nice if I could just use one tube and get the same results.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for about a month now and both love it!  It is super easy to use...you brush with step 1 for one minute, spit, and then brush with step 2 for one minute before rinsing.  It takes the same amount of time as my normal tooth brushing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product tastes great.  There aren&#x27;t any of the gross beads or anything in the paste, which I like.  My breath is fresh and my teeth are noticeably whiter after using this product.  I have tried the white strips before and they are super annoying, so this was a great product to try.  My teeth are probably about one to two shades whiter now that I have used the product for a month.  I drink a fair amount of tea, so the daily use of this product has helped my teeth immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full size product from Crest for a BzzAgent campaign but will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped my teeth feel cleaner than regular tooth paste. My teeth felt like they do when I have them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I found that this product had great results and much easier to use that the trays. I saw results as soon as the 3rd use~&lt;br /&gt; - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The two step approach seemed like a good idea and an easy fit into my daily regime.</li>
            <li> The best whitening tooth paste ever.  It whitened my teeth by 2 shades.  Buy it Try it.  You will love it</li>
            <li> I received the box awaiting for me outside my door one evening and I was excited to try the product. After reading the instructions, I proceeded. I used it over the next week and I actually saw a difference in my smile. My teeth were looking better, believe it or not. I actually like product because it works. My smile can use all the help it can get and this works. The taste of the paste was OK, and there is a noticeable difference after a week&#x27;s use. Way to go Crest. My teeth look I went to the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> My teeth look whiter, and feel much cleaner after using this product. I believe it encouraged me to brush longer and improve my overall dental hygiene. And I don&#x27;t need to photoshop my teeth now!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I loved the product, made my teeth feel so clean that after using it I keep wanting to run my tongue across my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White product made my teeth feel really clean, shiny, and fresh. At first the product irritated my gums in a couple of places, but with less vigorous brushing this problem went away. While I used the product as directed and did not mind the taste, I did not notice much of the whitening effect as promised.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that this toothpaste made my teeth feel really clean, squeaky clean as a matter of fact! The two-step process was easy to do, but a bit messy. You have to resist the urge to rinse your hand and mouth when toothpaste is all over them! I&#x27;m a former smoker and while I did see some whitening, it wasn&#x27;t earth shattering. I&#x27;m sure a non-smoker would see even more whitening, so I would definitely encourage folks to try it, they&#x27;ll like it!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> great product would buy again !</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White delivers! This product promises a clean mouth and whiter teeth. After using this twice daily for five days, my smile looks awesome! My mouth feels clean, refreshed and my teeth are whiter. Every time I use Crest 3D White, I feel like I have just taken a trip to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how easy it is to use. No strips, no applying a paste! Just brush your teeth for one minute with each product and in five days, a brighter and healthier smile. The results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and I always have concerns of a product leaving a burning sensation or having other uncomfortable side effects. This product never produced any burning sensation or any other negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! I highly recommend this product for your home. Thank you Shopper Army for giving me the opportunity to try a free product of Crest 3D White for review.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BZZAgent, I had the opportunity to try this product for FREE!! I started using this treatment about 4 weeks ago and have mixed feelings about this.  1) the taste of the Cleansing and Whitening System is awesome!! I felt like I had the cleanest, freshest mouth ever! I also noticed that it got rid of bad breath a whole lot faster than regular toothpaste. I enjoyed the cleansing portion because I felt like my teeth were a lot cleaner after completing the system with each brushing.  2) I don&#x27;t mind using two different tubes. The instructions were very simple to follow and well written.  Brushing for one minute per treatment is simple enough and isn&#x27;t time consuming like those using whitening trays. 3) When it came down to the whitening portion of my teeth, I discovered that my teeth only slightly whitened.  I did not notice a drastic change in the color of my teeth at all. I would follow the instructions and even brush longer trying to achieve faster results.  I also tried brushing after each meal with this, but still didn&#x27;t obtain whiter teeth. 4) Before I started using this system, I did not having any sensitivity with my teeth.  After using this system for about a week, I noticed my teeth were sensitive to cold things I drank or ate.</li>
            <li> I drink red wine and coffee...um...often. Therefore, I am always looking for ways to add teeth whitening into my regular routine. I liked this simple to incorporate two step system. I&#x27;m not sure if I notice a ton of whitening but my teeth definitely feel consistently clean and smooth without plaque. As a result they must be whiter because there is nothing for my coffee or wine to cling to :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks. After the 1st few days I experienced sensitivity so I cut back from using product twice a day to once in the evening; which helped somewhat. The instructions were easy to understand and system was easy to use. The system left my mouth feeling exceptional fresh and clean which I really liked. I saw very little change in my teeth, very little whitening.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was surprised that i could see some results. I was happy the producted not only whitened but also cleaned my teeth. It was true to the crest name!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected</li>
            <li> Similar Results Achieved with the 3D White Toothpaste and 3D Mouthwast.</li>
            <li> Overall, I did enjoy testing this product. The taste was pleasant, and I liked both the color and texture of both tubes of paste. On the other hand, I did not enjoy having to apply toothpaste to my brush twice during each brushing. I would also prefer a stronger, cleaner taste than the taste in both tubes.</li>
            <li> I was lucky and got to tryCrest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System free from bzzagent!  I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about  it just yet... I&#x27;m not seeing any big change in the whiteness of my teeth...  But I guess a little change is better than nothing! My teeth do feel clean and fresh after each use though! The taste isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s easy to use. Way better than white stripes! #gotitfree</li>

There was much more significance on his teeth than on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00ZKLLZAI Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System, 2.3 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it Four Stars out of Five.</li>
            <li> this product works very well and is very easy to use. It does cause gum sensitivity - rinsing with mouthwash after using cause discomfort. Worth using because it does really work!</li>
            <li> I believe the product will show definite whitening results if used regularly over several weeks.  [you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product because I&#x27;ve always used white strips, and I drink multiple cups of coffee daily. This product made a noticeable difference in just a few days and did not hurt my sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product worked well overall. The toothpaste step made teeth very very clean. Dentist office clean. Step two applies a tingly peroxide. It was hard to get used to but you do.&lt;br /&gt;It took longer to brush my teeth using the two-step process, but that&#x27;s a good thing I guess.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do look whiter.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I had hoped it would be. I was hoping to have much whiter teeth from using it- hoped for the results you would get from using gel trays but not having to use them. However, my teeth were not significantly whiter- just a tiny bit. I don&#x27;t know if I would have used it longer if I would have seen greater results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>

            <li> Great taste. left my breath fresher and cleaner teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This toothpaste not only whitens in just two short weeks, the polish makes them shine like diamonds. My husband and I had many stains and after only a week we could see quite a difference in our smiles</li>
            <li> I got a free trial of this product to test and I must say that it was really easy to use and I noticed a difference pretty quickly.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a easy way to whiten their teeth and not spend a ton of money to do it.</li>
            <li> Received this to try for free as a Bzzagent! Thanks to Crest for letting me be your guinea pig! I love the way the system makes my teeth feel shiny clean and as far as whitening toothpastes go this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. However, I still only noticed minor color change, definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to professional dental whitening services. I noticed other reviews say it left white spots on their gums but I didn&#x27;t notice that... Maybe they left it on too long?</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;It really helped me keep a cleaner, fresher, feeling teeth and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!&lt;br /&gt;It worked, my teeth are whiter but I actually prefer the Diamond strong whitening paste &amp; mouthwash</li>
            <li> Began to see some slight results after about a week. The taste of the whitening gel isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected but it does seem to make my gums feel a little dry. Overall pretty great alternative to bleaching.</li>
            <li> I love this system. I recieved this free to try from BzzAgent an incredible app! I dont have time for whitening strips,and mouthwashes, and toothpastes dont really work to really whiten teeth. This is diffrent as its a quick way to polish your teeth white! Its really great amazing results!</li>
            <li> I did like this product. I didn&#x27;t have much staining to start out with (I actually started using this product the day after my routine cleaning at the dentist), but I did notice a brighter, whiter smile after 7 days. I used once a day for 7 days, and on the seventh day, I did notice some sensitivity. So I changed use to every other day and have had no sensitivity issues since. I thought the gel in Step 2 tasted gross, but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to make me stop using the product. This is a much more convenient way to whiten that other methods.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Crest 3D white toothpaste system. I was able to try it free as a member of Shopper Army but all opinions remain my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste comes with two different tubes. It is a two step process. The first tube is a deep cleaning toothpaste-use this for one minute. The second step is a whitening gel that is intended to brighten and whiten your teeth. Immediately I noticed my teeth felt cleaner-after one use. Its like after a trip to the dentist clean. This is the first toothpaste I have found that makes me say that. The whitening was less noticeable for me, personally, although I do feel my teeth look brighter and less yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two step process can be a pain-you have to open and close two different tubes of toothpaste and brush separately for one minute a piece. So, it seems longer but in essence is only two minutes. I think I have two minutes each time after I have seen the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is okay-its kind of plain and perhaps a little peroxide-y tasting. But, for how clean my teeth feel I don;t miss the stronger mint flavor of regular toothpaste. I think this is a great system. I have seen some people complain about sensitivity and problems using this particular system so users should be cautious, but I havee personally has no problems. I highly recommend checking this system out especially if you want a super clean feeling and better looking mouth!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a month now.  I don&#x27;t find the 2 steps to be &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; for my morning brushes.  I actually like that it keeps me in check with spending a decent amount of time brushing my teeth!  Step 1 is the cleanser and I feel a great clean when I use it. Step 2 is the whitening gel which I like to use and see my teeth look a little more sparkly after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  After using for about a month I don&#x27;t notice tremendous differences in the coloring of my teeth.  They have gotten slightly whiter but have not progressed since then.  I feel that this stuff is only good until a certain extent of whiteness.  If you are looking for tremendous changes you won&#x27;t find it here.  If you are looking for a shade or 2 difference, then this stuff works.  Once I got to my whiteness level, I&#x27;ve been able to maintain with the use of this product.  My guess would be that this would be a really great after-care product if you had your teeth whitened professionally as it would probably maintain really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity:  While brushing, I notice certain spots in my mouth hurt a little. I think that means I have to go to the dentist honestly and have a cavity filled.  Otherwise, I have not felt any sensitivity afterwards or throughout the day AT ALL.  When I used the Crest White Strips I had serious sensitivity issues.  Not with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product did its job and I am happy.  If I could improve it, I would make the whitening results more intense, but for what it does it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Crest®. #GotitforFree</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Brilliance daily cleansing and whitening system is a great product! I am a coffee and soda drinker, and I used to smoke. After a month of using the system for a month I am very pleased with the results! Several shades whiter on my teeth makes me very ready for attending my best friend&#x27;s wedding in a few weeks! I will absolutely purchase this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system for free - as a promotion for the brand - and my opinion is 100% my own - based on my personal experience using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 3 stars - or an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; rating after following the instructions and using the product for 26 days (twice per day).&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) The instructions are easy to understand&lt;br /&gt;2) The size of the product is enough to last at least 30 days (if used 2 times per day as instructed)&lt;br /&gt;3) The taste - no horrible after-taste - although, I would recommend not eating or drinking right after using the product&lt;br /&gt;4) My teeth actually felt clean &amp; polished - with that &amp;#34;smooth as a dentist polish&amp;#34; feel.&lt;br /&gt;5) I did see improvement in regards to whitening - but only a shade or two - nothing dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;And my reasons for most likely not purchasing this product in the future:&lt;br /&gt;1) The packaging was tough to open.  Yes, I could have tried using scissors but I was being lazy.  Instead, I opted to try breaking the top corner off - which resulted in a small cut to my finger.  The packaging is a hard plastic of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;2) The directions tell you to brush using tube #1 - and NOT to rinse - then to use tube # 2 and brush.  Which is pretty simple - however - I could not break the habit of rinsing after brushing.  Which may have resulted in me not seeing better whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;3) While my teeth felt clean, I don&#x27;t feel like my entire mouth/breath was clean after using.  In fact, I had to follow up with mouthwash an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I am a regular coffee/Red Bull/soda drinker, and I have been using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for several weeks now. Unlike others, I am finding that concerns regarding fluoride staining and peroxide sensitivity are not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say that consistent use of the product has made my teeth any whiter; rather, I would say that they haven&#x27;t gotten worse.  This leads me to believe that it is a good maintenance product, but not necessarily a good whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the cost of the system prohibitive - around $25 for toothpaste that frankly won&#x27;t last more than a month is a lot to spend on toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I was pleased to see that the product did NOT contain any plastic beads that would be harmful to the environment--and my gums.  Good on crest for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a sample for review purposes, but I believe that all reviews should provide honest feedback.  All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent I received a free set of the crest 3D whiting 2-step toothpaste. I would say it was worked pretty well. You do have to use it day and night so that u see results . Though on the other hand it was a little strange to use because of the 2-step part . Not being able to rise after brushing with the first step was really weird . In addition the taste and smell was not the best, it kind left you with a weird aftertaste. I personally thought it had an unpleasant odor and felt as if it was not a normal minty type toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Since I drink lots of diet cola anything whitening is welcome!  Crest 3D White Brilliance has made such a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Basically there are two tubes of toothpaste. The first step (tube 1) is cleansing. Brush with that and then don&#x27;t rinse. That was hard for me, but I got used to it. Then immediately use step 2 ( tube 2) which is the whitening product. Then rinse as usual. This is a great product to use when it&#x27;s not quite time for white strips again. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product as a bzz agent, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product i got to try it from bzzagent and it&#x27;s amazing it really leaves my teeth looking whiter and healthier than just using toothpaste i will buy this product when i run out purchase this you will not regret it</li>
            <li> I drink tea and coffee on a regular basis so I was excited to get Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review. I hated the gritty feeling. It was hard for me to do this instead of my normal brushing. Now I have extremely sensitive teeth so because of that this stuff is not for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never switching back to regular toothpaste. EVER! It is that amazing. Bzzagent sent me a free sample of Crest 3D White to test out - and from the first try I have been hooked. What I love the most is the lasting super clean feeling I have. When I wake up in the morning, and I&#x27;m having a cup of coffee, my teeth still feel clean! It&#x27;s amazing. I have been using this for a month and my teeth are noticeably whiter! I also want to add that I have very sensitive teeth, but this product never hurt, or stung or felt weird in any way. 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> I liked this better than the Crest Pro-Health stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past. The first step felt grittier, which to some might seem like a bad thing but I felt like it got my teeth cleaner because it was more abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two was comparable to Crest Pro-Health. I do like the two-step process, but it&#x27;s hard with my electric toothbrush. My toothbrush runs for an exact amount of time, so I have to stop it in the middle (after guessing how long it&#x27;s been) and then start it up again, whereupon it runs for another two minutes. So I think it might be better with a programmable or normal toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not THAT hard to turn it off and on, and it&#x27;s worth it for clean, white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Crest, for giving me a free sample!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try this product for free. Overall, I am pleased with this toothpaste. My teeth feel super clean all day - none of that fuzzy feeling that I have experienced with other toothpastes. The two step process did take some getting used to. Step 1 is super minty, which I liked. Step 2 is the whitening part with a bit of a peroxide flavor. I&#x27;m not sure that I have noticed much whitening over the last few weeks, but that being said, I still like this toothpaste based on the mint flavor and clean feeling. I do think that I have experienced quicker and more drastic whitening from professional whitening - but that comes with a bigger price tag. The only thing that would keep me from purchasing it again would be price in relation to other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now, morning and night, and I have to say I love it! My teeth look and feel amazing. After only using it for about a week, I was getting compliments on how nice my teeth looked. When I first started using it, I used to much and my teeth felt kind of sensitive. In the month or so I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve come to find, a little goes a long way!  I recommend this product to everyone. Its a must buy!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free through BzzAgent and want to say thank you BzzAgent and thank you Crest. I love my smile!</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  I have tried other whitening products, but they have not been long lasting for me.  They usually only work for a few short hours, then wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how easy the two step process worked.  Brush with step 1 for 1 minute, spit, brush with step 2 for 1 minute, spit and rinse and you’re done.  Very easy and did not add any extra time to my routine.  I tend to drink a fair amount of soda and tea and this product has worked for me.  In a few short weeks my teeth are visibly whiter.  Of course they look the best right after I brush, but they are still atleast 1 if not 2 shades whiter than “my normal” all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any issues with staining or sensitive due to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this product for testing courtesy of Crest and bzzagent. I was skeptical at first because there aren&#x27;t many whitening toothpastes that taste good. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it to find it refreshingly minty fresh tasting and leaving my teeth exceptionally clean feeling after only one use of step 1 of the two step system. I would happily use it as an everyday toothpaste it&#x27;s that good! Step 2 of the system is a whitening gel that you brush on for a minute after using the toothpaste and while it is not fantastic tasting it&#x27;s better than any other whitening treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried and it is so easy! I&#x27;ve even noticed it actually whitening my teeth as I&#x27;ve continued to use it even though I drink coffee everyday and I am a smoker. I will definitely be buying more when I run out. #GotItFree can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> It may not be a huge impact, but you can notice the difference. It&#x27;s hard to notice it within a day, so you have to be patient. In order for this product to work, you must use it twice a day everyday, just like what you should already do as your normal brushing routine. It literally only takes 2 minutes, 1 per step (there&#x27;s 2 steps total) and is really quick and easy. As the days went on, I gradually saw my teeth slightly become whiter and whiter. After about a month, I noticed that the biggest thing the 2-step cleaning product did was get rid of the yellow plaque buildup in between and around my teeth! They are the hard to get to regions of your teeth! It&#x27;s so convenient when you haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in a while. The taste of the product is minty and can be gritty, but it does leave your mouth fresh and clean, not like other toothpastes I&#x27;ve been using. One day, I had an instance where I didn&#x27;t have access to my cleaning system and had to use a different toothpaste, and oh my, it felt so different. It wasn&#x27;t the same because my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean enough like the system does for you. I can&#x27;t imagine living without this product. I&#x27;m so glad I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest®. All opinions stated in this review are my own!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance daily cleansing toothpaste and whitening gel system free from bzzagent. I have been using it faithfully for 3 weeks and absolutely love the results. I am a daily coffee drinker and my teeth seem at least 2 shades whiter. I absolutely love the minty fresh flavor of the toothpaste which lasts long after brushing. The step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste like straight peroxide like other products. It doesn&#x27;t foam too much while brushing either which is nice. I really like this toothpaste system. I&#x27;ve tried other crest 3D white products and wasn&#x27;t  able to get these results. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this whitening kit for free, and I must say, I&#x27;m in love. I can tell a difference in my teeth. They&#x27;re becoming white again. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I must say, I am a fan. Although after using the product for a couple of weeks now, I don&#x27;t have any drastic results, but I can personally tell the difference in whiteness of my teeth since I started using it. I think if I continue to use this product that I will have eventually get the super white teeth like you would expect from a professional whitening. The two step process seemed like a time consuming hassle at first, but it&#x27;s really not. only take a little over 2 minutes to complete the process. I also thought the taste would be horrible, but it&#x27;s not that bad. The whitening gel is a little icky, but it&#x27;s really not bad considering. I will continue to purchase this product in the future and have recommended it to lots of people.</li>
            <li> I have been using crest for a while and when I started using this when I got it for free to try out it made my mouth break out into sores. I had to go to the dentist and they said it was an allergic reaction to something inside of it.</li>
            <li> Recieved this procuct as part of a promotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. My teeth are a few shades lighter. I drink coffee &amp; soda so this was just what I needed to brighten up my teeth. It&#x27;s easy to use, my husband has even started using it as he was impressed with my results.</li>
            <li> I have used this duo set for 2 weeks now.  The first couple times I had a hard time with step #1 drying my mouth out.  I&#x27;m used to it by week 2.  Step 2 does help with the dry mouth but I find it hard to brush for one minute without rinsing.  I&#x27;ve seen a small change in my teeth but overall I think I&#x27;ll stick with Crest White Strips.  I received a free sample of this product as part of a promotion from the brand.  All opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> Having white teeth is extremely important to me so I was so excited to receive this product from Bzzagent.  Before I started using this I was using a baking soda based toothpaste for the last 5+ years, which has helped me maintain my smile without using teeth whitening strips more than once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get: 2 generous tubes of product.  The first seems like a standard Crest toothpaste and the second tube is gel whitener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Process: With this product you first brush your teeth for one minute and then immediately following you brush the again with step 2 (the whitener)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: The toothpaste texture is very similar to all of Crest&#x27;s toothpaste and the whitener is a clear gel that reminds me of the product on the back of Crest Whitestrips, but in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions: I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far and I like it.  It removes tartar buildup EXTREMELY well and though I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the coloring of my teeth they have maintained their shade and I hope to see whitening after a full use of the product.  The downsides to this product (for me) is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as clean as I am used to.  There isn&#x27;t a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; taste left in my mouth and after using the step 2 gel my teeth feel as though they have some of that product left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to continue using this and find out if this is my new HG product for my teeth!</li>
            <li> I had the please of trying out this product free thanks to Crest® and BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used traditional whitening strips in the past and been happy with the results but I could never seem to get the strips to stick well enough to stay on for 30-45 minutes. When I saw that this was a toothpaste product I was curious, plus it said it took just 2 minutes! Sounds too good to be true, right? No. This stuff is awesome. I tend to have sensitive teeth, so I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly; I have only been using it once a day and I&#x27;ve taken a few days off. I could see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth in just a couple days! My gums have gotten a few white spots which disappear quickly, but no sensitivity yet. You do get a faint taste of the traditional whitening strip (you know what I mean if you&#x27;ve used them) but it is very minimal. Fast, Easy, Results. Two thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free thanks to Crest. #GotItFree. I have tried other Crest whitening systems (HD) and this system follows the same pattern. Brush with toothpaste 1 for 1 minute, brush with polish for 1 minute. Couldn&#x27;t get any easier. I found this system tastes a lot better than the (HD) system, so it actually made the whole experience a lot more pleasurable. As far as whitening goes, the idea is that the second whitening finisher has hydrogen peroxide in it, and that&#x27;s what giving you the whitening.  I still find this to be a much easier system to use than using strips or going to the dentist to whiten, as it can be done at home.  However, you will not get as dramatic a result as what you get at the dentist, and it&#x27;s probably equally comparable to the strips for whitening power.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great! It doesn&#x27;t take long to do, and you can see results quick! I already brush my teeth twice a day, so it doesn&#x27;t take any extra time out of my day. I don&#x27;t have to worry about stripes sliding around or keeping my mouth shut with trays in. My teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive either! That was for sure a plus for me. Anything else I ever used would make my teeth ache for hours! With this, you brush once, spit, brush again, and spit and rinse! So easy!</li>
            <li> This product provides quick, easy results and has given my teeth a whole new level of clean. GROSS ALERT After brushing and rinsing I actually see the gross stuff in the sink and my smile looks so much whiter - not fake white but CLEAN white.&lt;br /&gt;The two step system is super easy and is much more pleasant than strips or gels. Definitely worth a buy!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Crest of their 3D white brilliance toothpaste through BzzAgent and was impressed with it. It&#x27;s easier for me than using strips, and I could tell it was working after one use. I don&#x27;t think I would completely replace my regular toothpaste but would use this instead of whitening strips. I found the step 2 finisher would almost burn a little if I got it on my gums too much, but as long as I kept it mostly on my teeth it was fine.</li>
            <li> Works great. I was leary at first but after using it for a week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> A shout out to Crest for sending me this to review and to be honest I thought it would work somewhat but WOAH!  When I use the whitening strips I often get some splotchy spots on my teeth but this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t do that.  It made a difference in just a few days and worked so well and applied evenly!  It is so much more convenient for me to use this over other whitening systems because I can do it at the same time I brush.  I&#x27;m so happy with it I would definitely purchase it when mine runs out.  Now I can drink my coffee and have white teeth too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing now for 3 weeks and it truly does whiten your teeth.  I will say its more of a gradual whitening instead of the more powerful effect you get with the strips.  After the first week my spouse started to notice it and my friends noticed in about two weeks.  Basically you are now brushing your teeth for 2 mins total (which helps right off the bat), 1 min. with the first deep cleaning toothpaste and 1 min. with the whitening system.  This product from crest does not leave my mouth feeling raw or pealing like some other brands have done to me in the past.  Overall I am impressed with it and will buy it again; however maybe not all the time.  I will say its more work than doing the whitening strips, but its also not as expensive considering replaces your regular toothpaste and overall cost is lower.  I would recommend it for anyone to at lest try if you have a big event coming up (just leave yourself 4 weeks advance time).  Thank you to Crest for allowing me to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> As a coffee and red wine lover, I have tried many teeth whitening products. Crest 3D white brilliance has made my teeth visibly brighter and whiter in just a couple of short weeks. I received the product free with BZZkit but cannot wait to purchase more for friends and family to have a professionally whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I received a free box of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System via BzzAgent.  When I was selected to receive this product I was so excited because I have only used whitening strips in the past and did not like how long that lengthened my cleaning routine each day.  I was nervous after reading the instructions that this product may cause white spots on the gums or tooth sensitivity; however, after using the product for almost three weeks now I have not had any of these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product tastes great and fits in with my regular dental care routine without adding any additional time, which I love.  The two step process, 1) cleaning toothpaste and 2) whitening gel is really easy to follow and make a daily habit.  The product tastes good and is not harsh like other whitening strips I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt like the directions were lacking in terms of if you should replacing brushing twice a day with this product or just once (I have been doing at night only) and also how long you can/should continue use of the product.  I a not 100% sure if I am supposed to finish the entire contents before ending treatment?  After 3 weeks I have seen a subtle change in my teeth color although believe with  continued use they will get more white.</li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent, I was able to try this toothpaste and teeth whitening system. I hadn&#x27;t used Crest in a long time previous to trying this product. Compared to other whitening toothpastes, I do think this two-step system is more effective in whitening and brightening my teeth. However, the results only seem to last for a few hours after brushing, so you have to maintain use of both steps. I am not in love with the taste and texture of the whitening gel (step 2) but it is very similar to the gel that is on whitening strips, so not unexpected. The only inconvenient part of using this system is remembering not to rinse between step 1 and 2. Sometimes it feels like extra work to do the second step as well, but worth it if you want results.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3d white kit to test out for free from bzzagent. I am impressed with how white it does get your teeth in a short amount of time but I had so much discomfort on my gums from this product. My gum line was white and irritated the whole time I used this product and I was only doing it every other day. Great product just be leary if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> When it comes to toothpaste, I am a dedicated Crest user and have been for years. My standard Crest toothpaste has a whitening component, and while I’m sure it helps prevent stains, over time certain habits (I drink coffee and red wine often) lead to less than super bright teeth. Enter Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system. The “system” involves a 2 step process, where first you brush for one minute with a Deep Cleaning Toothpaste, followed by brushing for one minute with a Whitening Finisher gel (with no rinsing in between steps). As a Crest fan, I have used Crest’s other 2-step whitening system before (Crest ProHealth HD), and I liked the results as well as the squeaky clean feeling it gave my teeth. But that system was a bit too harsh on my sensitive gums, so I had to use it for one brushing every other day instead of twice a day. Having to use my regular toothpaste routine in between slowed down my results a bit. So when I was offered a free trial system of Crest 3D White Brilliance as part of a promotion from Crest, I was happy to try it out and see if I could use it more frequently to get a faster whitened smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After using the product for about 3 weeks, I am happy with my positive results, with no gum sensitivity problems! My teeth are noticeably brighter, shinier, and overall they feel very clean, similar to the way they feel right after a cleaning at the dentist’s office. I would be likely to use this system maybe twice a year to renew my smile and re-whiten my teeth. The two step process is not a big difference from my regular one step brushing routine, and doesn’t really require any extra brushing time (2 mins total? I can live with that!). The Deep Cleaning toothpaste in the step one tube is a good consistency - it has a bit of texture to scrub the teeth nice and clean without being overly coarse or gritty. Without water, it does not foam a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t feel that much different than regular toothpaste. The step 2 tube contains the whitening agent, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant taste. The other 2 step system by Crest I&#x27;ve tried had a very bleach-y tasting whitening gel, and it actually tasted a lot like Crest white strips. The Whitening Finisher gel that comes with the Crest 3D White Brilliance system is a much more pleasant experience. One other thing I did notice with this system is that when I used it the very first time, I had white spots develop on my gums in a few areas. The instructions with the system indicated that this is not abnormal and temporary. In fact, the spots did go away in a few hours and they never came back with any later usages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the pros of the product:&lt;br /&gt;1. It left my teeth and mouth feeling especially clean, like it feels right after a cleaning at the dentist&lt;br /&gt;2. It made my teeth noticeably whiter and shinier&lt;br /&gt;3. My sensitive gums were not irritated by the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con:&lt;br /&gt;1. It did leave some white spots on my gums after the first usage. The box says this is normal and the spots went away, but it did make me wonder a bit about what caused that and if it was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, this product did exactly what it claimed to do, and I am enjoying my newly brighter and whiter teeth! I would definitely use this again, not as my standard toothpaste, but every so month for maintenance to keep my smile looking bright and sparkly.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I am a big coffee and sometimes wine drinker so my teeth are not super white. After a few weeks of using this product i really noticed a difference! My teeth seem whiter and I like the 2 step process in my routine. The taste is not that bad and I havent noticed any negative issues using this toothpaste. I love it and love that my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 3 weeks into using it and I&#x27;m pleased! It&#x27;s gentle enough that I haven&#x27;t experienced the gum pain I had with whiteners in the past, but it still makes a visible difference. It&#x27;s subtle, but I have had a few people comment so I can tell there is a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure that I did get mine free as a trial through BuzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System through Bzz Agent to try. I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products before and with the exception of whitening tooth pastes, most whitening products make my teeth unbearably sensitive. I was excited to try this product since it seemed like it would be a stronger and more effective paste treatment and I was hopeful I could tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is I don&#x27;t  have any sensitivity after using this product daily for over three weeks. At the same time I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth looking much whiter, so I&#x27;m not sure just how effective this system has been for me. So far I&#x27;m seeing about the same results I get from a regular whitening toothpaste. It&#x27;s for that reason I&#x27;m unsure if I would recommend this product. If the results are about the same as just brushing with a normal whitening tooth past then there&#x27;s no reason to use a two step system. I&#x27;m also not overly fond of the texture of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this Crest 3D White Brillance Daily Cleansing System compliments of BzzAgent. Lately I have been trying to achieve a whiter smile and nothing I&#x27;ve tried seems to really give you any visual results but this actually works! It&#x27;s a two step system. First is your deep cleansing toothpaste. You brush with this for one minute then you brush with the whitening polish for one minute. It&#x27;s very simple with easy to understand directions. The toothpaste has a very strong minty taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh for several hours and the whitening polish tastes like peroxide. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks now and am happy to say I&#x27;ve actually been able to notice a brighter whiter smile. This by far is better than any other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I received this whitening kit from BzzAgent as Crest promotion. It is much easier to use than trays or strips, so I love the convenience as a coffee and wine drinker. My only complaint about the system is that it beats my gums up a little. My gums and teeth are fairly sensitive, so it may not be an issue for others. That being said, my teeth have gotten whiter using this system for a few weeks. I can only tolerate using it once a day, typically at night. I&#x27;m sure it works quite well if you follow the directions and use it twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 contains stannous fluoride, which can stain teeth, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble there. I suppose immediately following it with the step 2 whitening gel negates that effect.</li>
            <li> It was a good product.  It made my teeth a shade whiter and added a slightly brighter smile. i would definitely recommend this product.  I was able to try this product for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the crest white strips in the past and was excited to try something that seems along the same lines, and included in my routine already, but quicker than the strips. Although this takes an extra step than regular brushing, it doesn&#x27;t actually take any longer than brushing. You are supposed to brush with step 1 for 1 minute, and then step 2 for 1 minute. I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would actually see a difference in my teeth but I have. After about a week I noticed them lightening. Although this doesn&#x27;t replace a professional whitening treatment, it&#x27;s probably the easiest thing to incorporate into your routine to get your teeth whiter. As a mom, it can be hard to even find time to do the most basic necessities of cleanliness, so I am happy to have this product so that I don&#x27;t need to add anything more to my already busy day! I got this free from Bzzagent to try!</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky people who got to try this for free through BzzAgent and Crest.  Unfortunately, I was unable to continue using this product long enough to see clear results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love my teas during the day and red wine in the evening and was hoping this would be a good solution to keep my teeth white.  Sadly, I still had the sensitivity issues I usually have with whitening products.  The process is pretty easy - you brush with one, then the second step, but it left my gums and teeth very sensitive after 2 weeks of use.  I (surprisingly) had a cleaning scheduled during the period where I was testing this product and had no cavities, but have hot/cold sensitivity around two of my existing fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really had high hopes for this as it wasn&#x27;t a tray or a leave on treatment too!</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. After about a month I have noticed that my teeth appear brighter. I do not mind the taste or the feel of my teeth after I brush with the product. You definitely cannot skip step 2, skipping step 2 mades my teeth feel porous and possibly more prone to stains. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again is the fact that it comes in two containers. Less is more!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several teeth whitening methods, from whitestrips to toothpastes.  I have to say that the toothpastes I’ve used have not made much difference in the shade of my teeth, and the whitestrips, while effective, hurt my sensitive gums and the process was very time consuming.  So when I received my free sample of Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System (THANK YOU, CREST and BZZAGENT!!), I had an open mind but was not expecting significant results.  When I tried the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to apply.  The Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is a 2 step process, and takes a minute of brushing for each step.  Step 1 is the Deep Cleansing Toothpaste.  It is an opaque paste, similar in texture to regular toothpaste.  I brushed for one minute it, and then spit out the paste (no rinsing needed!).  Then I applied Step 2, the Whitening Finisher, to my toothbrush and brushed for 1 minute.  The Finisher was more minty in flavor and was more like a gel in consistency.  After 1 minute, I rinsed my mouth and was done!  My teeth felt very clean, with no residue or pastey or bitter aftertaste.  I loved how easy it was to use, and took so little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of using Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, I noticed a significant difference in how my teeth felt and looked.  My teeth felt clean, my breath felt fresh, and most importantly, my teeth looked whiter!  What I loved most about Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is the confidence it gave me when I smiled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m looking forward to continuing to use Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to see an even brighter smile. I love my results and how easy and convenient it was to obtain professional whitening results in the comfort of my own home.  Thank you, Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!!!rilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product free from BzzAgent to try it and review it, and I was excited to try it. It&#x27;s easy enough to use. The first tube you use for 1 minute and the second tube you use for 1 minute as well. Since you&#x27;re supposed to brush for 2 minutes total anyways it didn&#x27;t add time to my morning routine. As for how well it worked, I noticed a visible change after the first use which is awesome. It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but I did notice it. After a couple of weeks my teeth are whiter. I&#x27;m sure whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office would give better results but the cost is perfect for the quality. As a coffee loving, red wine drinking, smoker I&#x27;ll take any whitening I can get, and I certainly get it with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I received this free product from BzzAgent.  I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but have a hard time finding the time to use the strips. I love that I am already brushing my teeth so now I can do both at the same time. I have sensitive teeth and this does not bother my teeth. I have used it for a couple of weeks and can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product from Crest for free to try. After trying it for 18 days, I find that it has whitened my teeth only slightly. It does make my teeth feel EXTREMELY clean and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any sensitivity or make my mouth burn. It tastes fine to me, with no harsh chemical taste. Maybe with longer use it might whiten my teeth more. #GotItFree #Crest</li>
            <li> I received this product free of charge - thanks to Crest and BzzAgent -to evaluate its effectiveness. I used it twice a day as recommended. One minute for the paste and one minute for the gel each time. I even brushed a little longer and used my electric tooth brush. My teeth were a little sensitive to begin with and this actually made my gums SO sensitive that they would bleed a little each time. I powered through it and sadly, after 4 weeks it still didn&#x27;t make a difference in the shade of my teeth. Unlike some pictures of the results shown in the reviews, I took the pictures in the same spot of my bathroom and didn&#x27;t use a filter!!! See for yourself- top is before, bottom is after 4 weeks of use. I&#x27;m not happy with this product in the least.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first about trying the new Crest 3D White – Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System as other whitening products (except toothpastes) in the past have severely irritated my gums and caused unnecessary pain. I just figured I was too sensitive for whitening products. I decided to give it a shot again with this product, and it didn&#x27;t hurt that I was trying it for free (thank you Crest!). After a few weeks I am pleasantly surprised. I did retain slight irritation to the gums, but nothing unbearable. The toothpaste left my mouth feeling unbelievably fresh and neither the toothpaste nor the whitening finisher left a bad taste in my mouth (as past whiteners have). The only thing I would criticize is that I wish it stated on step 2 (the whitening finisher) how much of the whitening product to put on the tooth brush. Is it the same amount as you would toothpaste? Less? I do like how the directions are not overtly descriptive (as at this point, if you&#x27;re competent enough to whiten your teeth, I doubt it&#x27;s necessary to explain how to brush them), but in this case, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a tad bit more detail as to prevent excess or lack thereof. All in all, I deem this a sufficient product that I would absolutely repurchase.</li>
            <li> The whitening effect was great but I&#x27;m not fond of the taste and the fact that it made my teeth. Quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest® and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember I have noticed that people seem to have a fixation with the appearance of their teeth. My mother always told me that people judge you on the appearance of your teeth. As soon as my brother and I had our first teeth come in she obsessively cared for them. I have seen a plethora of teeth whitening products in the media and in my own life. I used my first whitening strips when i was in the fifth grade and have found whitening pens in my stocking on Christmas morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my life has become busier, i have preferred to use the simplest solutions for tasks such as whitening my teeth. In theory this product does seem like a simpler solution to this problem. It should be more effective and easier than the other products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit simpler. I use the first step as I would any toothpaste, and that it what it feels like. The second step is a gel. It goes on similar to the toothpaste but seems somehow more liquidy. I appreciate that there is no waiting time and I can just go on immediately from it. It is nice yo not have to wait like i would with strips or a pen. It is easier in this regard, but the second step feels easy to skip or forget altogether. This is especially true for someone who is lazy in their routine or rushed. After I brush my teeth, I do not feel like brushing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other problem is the taste. For me the taste, is honestly similar the way a skunk smells. It is in no way pleasant for me and something I want to get out of my mouth immediately after I put it in. This may have contributed to my tendency to be tempted to skip the second step. Like most toothpastes I believe that crest was likely going for a mint flavor, and because I do not like he taste of mint, this could be the reason the taste bothered me. Like any mint flavor, this made my mouth burn. Although this flavor was only in the first step, and the second had more of a neutral flavor, it was hard to reach for the second step and keep brushing when my tongue was screaming for some bubblegum flavored children&#x27;s mouthwash to neutralize the sting! My mother did not have this problem. When I made her taste it, she said that it tasted like candy canes. Most mint lovers would probably not have a problem with the taste, but that is my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it really whiten as well as a professional polish? I can&#x27;t say for sure because ice never had a professional polish, but I can say at it does work. After a few days I could already notice a difference. My teeth look whiter and shinier. They don&#x27;t look black light white, but that&#x27;s probably for the best. As with any whitening product I worry about the safety, but for now I&#x27;ll have to trust that Crest knows what it&#x27;s doing. I give it 3/5 stars. It works, but is not something that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste free and tried it excitedly. It is somewhat of a commitment to brushing for a period of time each time you use it since it is 2 steps and they both must be done. I found that it had a good taste, consistency wasn&#x27;t so pasty but more gel like. It whitened but not a significant amount if you have a lot of discoloration.</li>
            <li> I received this set in the mail as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, and have found it to be quite comparable to other Crest 3D White products. I have also tried the mouth wash, polisher toothpaste, regular toothpaste, and white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is nice because it&#x27;s completely manageable, takes hardly any extra effort, and doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth feeling raw from over-brushing. I noticed results within a week of consistent brushing. It&#x27;s not quite as effective as white strips, but good for slight improvement and maintaining your pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  Each day my smile got brighter and brighter and my confidence grew with my smile every day!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will buy all the time. Easy to use in the morning. Really brightens the teeth</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product through Shoppers Army. I am always looking for ways to keep my smile clean and white. I have used bleaching kits that I&#x27;ve purchased from the dentist, but the cost seems to add up. Generally, I liked the Crest 3D White product. The positives: I felt that I was doing something good for my teeth. The toothpaste, although a little gritty, seems to get rid of the gunk on my teeth and makes them feel smooth and clean. The polish was easy to use and I think I saw an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. The taste on both was fine for me. I was concerned about increased sensitivity due to the peroxide, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I did not experience any! The negatives: Even though overall brush time is still 2 minutes, the 2 product/2 step process makes brushing time a bit longer. Having to stop and then do a second step may discourage me from using the 2nd product if I&#x27;m in a rush. The fact that the polish does not open easily (one-handed), adds to the issue. Maybe a pump style dispenser similar to what Mentadent used to have, but tat keeps the 2 product separate, would be helpful. However, seeing good results from the product would encourage me to continue using the system.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really liked the step 1 product, my teeth feel cleaner than normal using this, but step 2 was a little too runny and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement to whitening my teeth. I&#x27;m not sure there was any whitening to be honest. The two step process was a little more work, but since I&#x27;m using an electric toothbrush with 30 sec interval warnings, the timing portion was relatively easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Let me start with - this is a great toothpaste. So, if you are on the fence about whether or not you want to try the whitening system, at least if you buy this you can still use the toothpaste. It has a fine taste to it as well. Here is my review on the whitening part - #1 - do not make the same mistake I make (twice even). You are not supposed to rinse the toothpaste before you use the whitening - you are supposed to let them mix together. Let me tell you right now - it is very wierd when you use the whitening part by itself - it is kind-of like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste. If you use the system properly (like I did on my third try) then you don&#x27;t have that problem. My teeth were already pretty white when I started using this system, but I did see them brighten up from use. I got this product free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It is easy to use, no strips, no trays.  You simply have to brush your teeth first with the toothpaste and then with the whitener. Noticed a difference in just a few days.  And my teeth feel like they have just been cleaned and polished. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the sucrose leaves an aftertaste.  Try it!</li>
            <li> My teeth were pretty white to start out with but I was surprised how much whiter my teeth got. The taste of the first tube was good. The second tube wasn&#x27;t as tasty, but I expected that considering it was the whitening tube. I was really impressed with how clean my teeth felt! Squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product to people who do not enjoy the whitening strip method. It is so easy to use. Do not be thrown by the 2 steps, super easy. I was able to see results in a weeks time. No tooth sensitivity at all  and pleasant taste. Like anything else, if you drink liquids that stain make sure you keep on top of using the product.</li>
            <li> This product really did what it said it would do. I have used professional whitening and other over the counter products. Crest did as good as the professional whitening. I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I used it for a couple of weeks and found that it did not whiten my teeth. It did, however make my gums bleed every time I used it. I have recently visited my dentist, so I know I have a beautiful mouth, as they tell me, so this was definitely disturbing. I also did not enjoy the taste. I prefer a stronger mint taste, and less salty. I will say that it did make my teeth feel smooth, but I did not notice a marked whitening, so overall, I did not like this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This product whitened my teeth, but I was not able to use the product as recommended. The instructions say to use twice daily and I was not able to do this. The product seemed to burn my gums. The first couple of days after I tried the product, my gums seemed to be sore and almost felt like they were cut or burnt. I did use this product every couple of days and I made sure to get as little as possible on my gums or anywhere else besides the teeth. This is working and it is not bothering my gums now, so I have started increasing the amount of times I use the product. Maybe I had to build up a tolerance, but my teeth have definitely whitened a few shades.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I believe that it may have made my teeth a slightly lighter shade of yellow and they appear to shine more and i certainly leaves my mouth feeling clean. I was really worried before I started as I had tried a Crest Whitening toothpaste before and it made the inside of my cheeks and lips bleed (No, I do not brush those areas) but this product merely caused a mild tingling. I was very surprised at my reaction to the Crest Toothpaste as I often use Arm &amp; Hammer that also has peroxide and baking soda with no problem at all. Trying to time the various steps is a bit of a hassle as I am used to merely timing the entire process from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the 2 step process. I did notice that my teeth looked brighter and felt smooth after brushing. I have weaker enamel so I&#x27;m hoping that my teeth are also being strengthened.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> improved the cleanliness and shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Improved my teeth not feeling as bad every time I brushed. noticed a brighter shine or glossiness to the teeth. Noticed a more willing manner to wanting my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 Step System for free from BzzAgent to test out. I had used the Crest Whitening Strips in the past with success but HATED how sensitive it made my teeth. I was a bit hesitant seeing how this was a 2 step system thinking it would make my morning and evening routine longer and possibly cause sensitivity again.  I have been using the system for over 4 weeks now with success. I quickly found that the system didn&#x27;t lengthen my dental routine much longer than usual.The only downside that I did find is that I don&#x27;t care for the flavor of tube 2. It has a gritty chemically taste but with time I did get used to it and can definitely see a difference in my smile. It works!</li>
            <li> Great over all product. Very easy to use and not messy either.</li>
            <li> First the good: I definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. The concerning part is that my teeth felt a little numb after using. I am not sure if it is actually numb or if my teeth have become more sensitive with this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> liked this product quite a bit. It was easy and quick to use, made my mouth feel healthier and did what it promised- whitened my teeth. And did it more effectively than any whitening strip I have tried. Not only were my visible teeth whiter but the inside of my teeth had a dramatic reduction in the stains that my coffee/tea habit causes, as well as my molars. I also liked how easy it was. No positioning, no waiting. Just brush and brush again and I&#x27;m done. Love it. It didn&#x27;t get a full star rating because I really felt the tubes were a downside. The step one tube was a little too flexible and the step two tube was awkward to open and store.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really liked how this product made my mouth feel clean and fresh. The minty taste was also very nice. I would use it again.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does not cause any tooth or gum sensitivity.  No strips involved, just brush your teeth with 2-step process.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Crest 3D White system. I have naturally yellow teeth and have been a long time drinker of coffee and tea so my teeth are invariably dingy looking, I think. When I used this product I immediately felt a deep clean feeling and a tingle of freshness but best of all I actually noticed that my teeth looked, dare I say, whiter. I have been using Crest 3D White for about 9 days so far and you&#x27;ve made a believer out of me. I was very skeptical that anything could make my teeth look whiter since I have tried other whitening products that I had to leave on my teeth for up to an hour to no visible results. Imagine my delight when the Crest 3D White system gave me whiter teeth after the first usage and it was so easy to use. Just brush dry with the contents of tube 1 for a minute, spit and then brush with the contents of tube 2 for another minute and then spit and rinse. Voila, clean, fresh mouth and a whiter looking set of teeth. The only suggestion for total wonderfulness would be a flip top cap on tube 2 since it&#x27;s a bit awkward to have to unscrew the cap while holding the toothbrush before brushing. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product and I will definitely continue to use it and purchase it for myself. Thank you for the opportunity to avail myself of the benefits of Crest 3D White.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I really loved being able to test these products ! The toothpaste and whitener each had a different yet nice flavor and really made me feel that my teeth were as clean as if I were at the dentist getting a cleaning ! Then the mouthwash came and, although reluctant at first after reading reviews from others, I finally tried it and loved it ! The mouthwash made my whole mouth tingle and it has a really nice flavor ! Thank you for the opportunity to try these products !&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt; LOVED IT !</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt; 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t use the toothpaste, every time I tried to use it, it made me gag and cough. The whitening part was fine, I had no trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt; easy to use</li>
            <li> Expensive for mediocre results.  Had some irritation while using and had to use less frequently for a few days then resume the process.  Not worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li> Great experience with a teeth whitening product</li>
            <li> First I have to say I did like how well it cleaned my teeth, they feel smoother than using regular toothpaste. Second I didn&#x27;t like the mint flavor and I could only use it once a day because it would burn my gums and make my teeth ache. I think it did whiten my teeth a little. I just wish it came in a different flavor.</li>
            <li> This makes teeth whitening so much easier. There isn&#x27;t a huge difference but there is a gradual difference. You will notice a bigger difference if you use strips but this regimen helps boost whitening. It makes it easier and more convenient to whiten rather than waiting 30 minutes for a strip.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when first trying this product as all other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes I have tried in the past were less than great. While using this product my mouth did feel clean and fresh, unlike those tried in the past but, unfortunately I did not notice and difference as far as whitening. My theeth are not badly stained though so maybe that is why. I also did not experience the extreme sensitivity with this product as I had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I found that using two steps with an electronic toothbrush was cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> My whole mouth felt super-clean and fresh and I did notice the whitening, even though I normally use a whitening toothpaste regularly. step 2, the whitener kind of left a weird taste in my mouth, but after rinsing, it went away.</li>
            <li> Although Crest 3D White did whiten my teeth, as promised, I found it irritating. It actually abraded the skin on the inside of my lips, and there were white areas between my teeth from the peroxide in the product. Plus the taste was so bad, that after using the product, I had to brush with a regular product and use mouthwash. It was as if I was using a homemade baking soda/peroxide concoction. Is it not possible to have a minty flavor whitening product?&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> i liked how clean it made my mouth feel but it made my gums sore when used everyday.</li>

Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I really did see an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Not a huge change, but noticeable to me (apparently, no one else). However, I really don&#x27;t like using fluoride-containing toothpaste, as it really can leech calcium out of bones. So have to confess, after the initial week, I tried using my own toothpaste first and then the whitener and got same results as with the test product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the toothpaste to use from a shopper army mission. I used it as directed. The product was easier to use than expected. I initially thought it would be too much of a hassle to use two different tooth pastes but once I started using it, it was OK. I did not have stains in my teeth so I did not notice any whitening in my teeth after using this product.This would be a good toothpaste for someone who is trying to get rid of stains in their teeth.</li>
            <li> interesting product - give it a try!</li>
            <li> I found that this teeth whitener did not meet my expectations. It did clean my teeth really well, but I was hoping to notice a difference in the color of my teeth. I thought it&#x27;s a whitener, shouldn&#x27;t my teeth be whiter?&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice a day for almost 2 weeks. I think it does an excellent job of getting my teeth clean. I like the minty taste and the way my teeth feel after I&#x27;ve brushed. Now to the whitening...disappointed. I really don&#x27;t feel like there has been any change in the color of my teeth. My husband hasn&#x27;t noticed any difference either.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the dreaded whitening strips, this product is a real pleasure to use. I loved the whitening toothpaste. It had a great flavor and it did a good job. The whitening polish left my teeth feeling very clean and smooth. This is a simple 2 minute process that did a pretty good job and it left my teeth somewhat whiter and feeling clean. I didn&#x27;t mind having to use 2 different tubes for trying to get whiter teeth. I much prefer this method of teeth whitening over the strips any day. I have to say that I did not care for the taste of the whitening polish. If that could be improved, it would be so much more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Simple, efficient and effective teeth cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> I liked that I could whiten my teeth without adding extra steps to my routine. It seemed to whiten my teeth a shade after a couple weeks of use with no side effects like sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;[Tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Results were amazing and very quick and noticeable</li>
            <li> Love the fresh feeling my mouth was left with! Also saw results quickly. The only downside to the product is that in my opinion brushiing for one minute is not enough time to get a deep clean&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that the product worked slowly, but eventually it did whiten my teeth. The taste was unlike your standard teeth whiteners. It actually had a pleasant taste. The only negative is having to time and figure out how long I had to brush with each paste. It is a great maintenance product for those that have previously whitened their teeth and would like to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Did a shopper Army review. I like the 2 step process but better texture and flavor would have got me to give more stars.</li>
            <li> Really whitened my teeth, use just a couple of times a week though. Did the whole process 2 day in a row and it hurt my mouth.</li>
            <li> I find that my smile actually is brighter and whiter. However, I find the process - what with two tubes of toothpaste and minutes having to wait - a little too time consuming. It&#x27;s also a little confusing first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The two step process really left my teeth clean a polished (think after dentist visit clean) - but my teeth did not whiten very much. I did not experience any gum sensitivity or irritations - and the product is easy to use as you brush with each product for one minute (very easy if you have an electric toothbrush) - I liked that the gels did not foam too much - and that the tooth paste (step 1) has a nice minty feel.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I am really impressed with my results. However, what I like best is that it is easy to use. Even though I do use the strips to whiten my teeth as well I much prefer this method. I already have to brush my teeth everyday so it&#x27;s easy for me to just incorporate a little extra time for both steps. I usually try and do other stuff while I brush my teeth for one minute with each step. It&#x27;s a no brainer and I would totally recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;You can trust this review, I tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very effective and noticed a whiter smile after just a week of use. I had no sensitivity issues, which held me back from trying this product earlier. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest whitening toothpaste set. After using this product for a couple weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my teeth. They appear whiter and cleaner. My breath also stays fresh for longer. Using the 2 step system is very simple, taking the same amount of time and other toothpastes - 1 minute per paste. The only negative is the taste. The toothpaste seems thicker than regular toothpaste, and the whitening paste tastes pretty bad, though I realize all whitening products have this issue. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for cleaner, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste chalky and the polishing cream left an aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not a big difference. I did not like the 2 step process.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really loved this product! I had high expectations - Crest products always deliver - but this product truly exceeded even my expectations! The process was a little weird at first - use the deep cleaning paste first, spit, *DON&#x27;T RINSE*, and then use the whitening gel. After all of this, I rinsed and looked at my smile, and it already looked whiter! Amazing! I didn&#x27;t realize something this simple could give you such quick results. The only con for this product, and the only thing that kept me from giving it 5/5, is that it does cause slight sensitivity. My teeth are normally somewhat sensitive - some days are better than others - and out of about 10 uses, I&#x27;d say this product made my teeth feel sensitive about 2 or 3 of those. Not bad, but I just wish they had this same product, but specifically for people with sensitive teeth. Overall though, awesome product, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Shopper Army and had the opportunity to test this product. I found this product to be one of the easiest home whitening products out there, as well as the most effective. It&#x27;s a simple two step process that builds on the daily tooth brushing routine you already have established. I think it&#x27;s much easier than the whitening strips out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a while now and I am loving it. I have tried at home-whitening before but haven&#x27;t ever tried anything like this. It is so easy to use and I am so thrilled that it doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity for me. I was able to try the product for free thanks to Crest. I will continue to use/buy this and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product did seem to improve the whiteness of my teeth. It worked especially well since I do not have &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; teeth - my lower incisors particularly overlap. For this reason, using the usual whitening products produces limited results. Being able to particularly address these areas (previously damaged by antibiotic treatment) did produce some results that even the dentist had not been able to achieve. The taste is a mixed bag. I did not find it objectionable, neither did I have any major sensitivity. I would recommend being careful not to brush any gum areas which does produce sensitivity in the areas brushed.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really liked the feeling the products left in my mouth. I feel like I have very fresh and clean breath. My teeth appear shinier than they used to although I don&#x27;t believe they are any whiter. The first paste feels like it dries my mouth out when using it but the end result is well worth the minor discomfort. I&#x27;m not big on using two products (don&#x27;t like to waste any more time :) ) but it is a quick process overall.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> White, white and white love this toothpaste. Crest did it again! I received a free sample from bzzagent thanks to Crest®. I really liked how it brightens my smile!</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me this product for free to test it. I started using this Crest whitening set on 08/01/15. There was a slight lightening in color. If I had to guess I would say they are about two shades lighter. That is not a lot of change for a month of use, but I appreciate that my teeth all look the same color. My fear was the regular teeth would look much whiter and brighter than the teeth with fillings. Some whiteners irritate my teeth or gums, because they are too strong. This two-step system was gentle enough that I can only recall one time where my teeth felt uncomfortable. It was the first time I brushed after my professional cleaning. The sensitivity was either from cut gums or related to the professional fluoride treatment I used. Who knows! Next time, I will skip whitening immediately after a professional cleaning. While I appreciate the opportunity to try this product, it is nothing I would purchase. It technically worked, but it did not show me enough results to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this whitening system for about 4 weeks and I can honestly say I am impressed. Only a few days after using this product I noticed my teeth getting whiter. I have used other teeth whitening products in the past and have found them to be expensive and take too much time. Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is priced lower than the majority of other teeth whitening products and only requires you to brush your teeth for two minutes. The only cons I found was that the deep cleansing toothpaste is a little gritty and I&#x27;d prefer more of a mint flavor. Even though it is not very minty it does leave my mouth feeling very clean. Overall I am very happy and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent I got to try Crest 3D daily cleansing and whitening system for free.  I was a little concerned about the 2-step system, but quickly discovered that it wasn&#x27;t so bad and you should really brush your teeth for that long anyway.  There have been several whitening products I have used in the past, but this was the best tasting by far.  Step 1 was a nice minty flavor that left my mouth tasting really fresh and clean.  The second step is the whitening gel and although it didn&#x27;t have a minty flavor it did not have a nasty bitter flavor like other whitening products.  I really appreciated the pleasant taste.  As for the whitening I noticed within a week the difference it was making.  The price is steep, however since it comes packaged like toothpaste it will last a long time.  Definitely considering this as a new part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have had the privilege to use 3D Crest White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I have been using whitening strips, toothpastes, and even light systems in the past When I received the cleansing and whitening system I was very excited to open it up and try it out. I was a little taken back by the gritty feeling that I had from using the cleansing paste. However, when I followed it with the whitening paste as directed my mouth felt amazing and the gritty feeling was gone. Even after eating my mouth still feels clean thanks to this system. I have always hated that with other toothpastes my mouth would feel like I need to brush again after eating anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and left your mouth feeling fresh. I had a hard time at first remembering not to rinse my toothbrush between steps but eventually I got the swing of it and it worked great! I also never experienced any staining issues or sensitivities that tend to come along with whitening products. This has turned out to be a great product! My teeth are visibly whiter thanks to this system and I will continue to purchase it for myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Crest 3D White I was really impressed by its power, I received it in the mail to test for free from Crest through BzzAgent. At first I was skeptical about it because I herd a lot of people complaining their teeth became sensitive after  using whitening products but I was pleasantly surprised I was not one of them.It&#x27;s a great product it works great.My teeth are significantly whiter and they stay that way.I love how easy the two step process worked. Brush with step 1 for 1 minute, spit, brush with step 2 for 1 minute, spit and rinse and you’re done. Very easy and did not add any extra time to my routine and you get a great result.I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> My mornings and evenings are so hectic with kids, dogs and responsibilities from all over. I tried this Crest 3D White product and it made me feel like I was doing something nice for myself. I really loved the clean feeling in my mouth as if I just came from the dentist. I&#x27;m pretty impressed and even more than the cleaning and polishing, I love the sense of taking care of me for a change. Not through the four weeks yet so time will only tell if it actually works as promised and is worth the price (thankfully I #GotItFree). So far so good though!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent. I noticed a difference within a week of using the product. It&#x27;s super easy to use. All you do is brush for a minute with the deep cleansing toothpaste then add the whitening gel and brush for another minute without rinsing in between. For me, it&#x27;s easier than the strips. I wish the step 2 tube had a flip top like step one did. I had no issues with sensitivity at all. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> Ive been currently using this power couple! I was a little hesitant about using but once I started I noticed a complete difference! My teeth are white ! And not to mention my mouth feels cool, fresh! Thanks to crest I&#x27;ve gotten mines free! So happy great power couple!</li>
            <li> I am the biggest skeptic of teeth whitening products. I inherited yellow teeth from my mother even though I do not drink coffee, ever! I have tried so many products over the years and nothing helps. I got this product for free form bzzagent and decided to give it a try. I am beyond happy with the results. I smile more, I talk more and I am much more confident. I have been using this product for about 4 weeks and I still have so much left in the tubes. I will definitely buy more when I do run out. Trust me, I am such a skeptic, but I am beyond happy with the results. Are my teeth hollywood white?.. no, but they are noticeably whiter to me, my spouse and my friends. All of my close friends keep asking what I have been using. Thanks Crest!!</li>
            <li> This is not a horrible product, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was invited to try Crest 3D White by receiving a free sample.  I was hesitant to try Crest 3D White because of past experiences with the Crest brand.  For some reason, Crest uses something in their products that makes my gums and soft tissue slough off.  However, I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 5 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t had any sloughing effects.  I&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening products ranging from the trays to strips, but the only difference I noticed with them was chemical burns on my gums.  So I was pleasantly surprised that Crest 3D White didn&#x27;t burn my mouth.  Aside from those benefits though, it didn&#x27;t really leave my mouth feeling clean and I saw no visible difference in the look of my teeth.  I think this product would work great for people who are regular coffee or tea drinkers or who have minor surface discoloration, but I guess I don&#x27;t have surface stains.  Overall, the product was simple and easy to use and didn&#x27;t take any more time than it does to brush my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest I get to try this product for free! After using the product 4 times I could already see a difference. When I am done with this, I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I was one of the ones chosen by BzzAgent to receive a free box of the Crest 3D White cleansing and whitening system to try.  I have used it two months now and I have truly seen some results.  As my two front teeth are veneers, I have a problem with keeping the teeth around them white enough to look normal. I have always looked for ways to brighten those outer teeth up.  This 2 step system at first seemed like a bother to me but the more I used it, the more I liked it and liked the results.  I&#x27;m seeing white in areas I did not expect and my teeth continue to feel clean through most of the day.  I would definitely suggest using this product.  The only thing I would say that I don&#x27;t like about it is there are times when I don&#x27;t want to use the two steps, like when I am traveling.  However, I felt like I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;backtrack&amp;#34; when I stopped using it for a few days on the road.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months. I received it free as a promotion. It is such an easy system. Just 2 steps and 2 minutes and your mouth is fresh &amp; clean and your smile is whiter &amp; brighter. There is no rinsing. You just brush with the toothpaste, spit, then brush with the whitening, spit. If your looking for a whitening system that works and is easy then this is the #powercouple for you. There are no messy trays to fill or strips to line up. Just old fashioned brushing.</li>
            <li> I was sent this cleansing and whitening system from Crest through BzzAgent for free. I was so excited to receive this package. I love trying out new oral health products so my mouth/teeth can be in tip top shape. With this system my mouth has never felt cleaner or fresher. Seriously, when you are done with the two part system and wipe your mouth, you want to do that (ha) thing kind of like you&#x27;d do in the winter to warm your hands. Your mouth just feels so intensely clean and minty, it&#x27;s great. You&#x27;ll never worry about bad breath while using this. Now on to the whitening, I&#x27;ve been using the system for probably at least 3 weeks and I think they look a bit whiter. I drink at least one cup of coffee a day and I&#x27;m a smoker (bad, I know). But I feel like it&#x27;s removed a thin top layer of stain. I think with continued use it&#x27;ll keep making my smile brighter. I definitely plan on repurchasing this system. I highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> I drink several cups of coffee daily, so I need a realistic whitening solution that won&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;So far, this is working well is a maintenance whitening routine.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any uncomfortable sensitivity. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee everyday. Sometimes twice per day. I&#x27;m not willing to give up coffee for whiter teeth, but I am always looking for a toothpaste that will brighten my smile. I&#x27;ve tried dentist prescribed trays but those left my teeth sensitive for days. Through BzzAgent, I was able to try Crest 3D White for FREE! This is my second time trying out 2-step system that you do at home. Basically, I replaced my usual toothpaste for the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System. I use it morning and night. The first step is the toothpaste---it has a white color, mildly gritty consistency, and a refreshing mint flavor. I use this to brush my teeth. After 2 full minutes of brushing, spit. I actually notice (sorry if TMI) stains come off of my teeth into what I spit into the sink. If I brush right after coffee or food,  I will see the color of the drink or food come off my teeth into what I spit into the sink. Then, I use a small amount of the whitening gel. This is a clear gel, it doesn&#x27;t have as pleasant a taste as the toothpaste gel, but it is not off-putting. After using this for 2 minutes, I&#x27;m done. I experience no sensitivity and noticed brighter, whiter teeth after about 5 days of use.  With consistent use, I find my teeth staying bright. If I don&#x27;t use for a few days, my teeth aren&#x27;t as bright. This takes about 1 minute longer than usual tooth brushing, because you are brushing with the toothpaste for 2 minutes, then the gel for about a minute, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System free from Crest and Bzzagent.  When I saw that is was a 2 step system I thought that it was going to be complicated, but I was really surprised that it was simple and that you only had to brush with each product for 1 minute.  This product also has a nice minty taste which was a nice surprise as some whitening products do not taste well at all.  I have noticed a difference in my teeth with multiple uses and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an at home whitening system.</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample by the company to review but the opinions are my own. In fact, I am heading out to buy my own today. This product is everything I&#x27;ve come to expect from Crest. Gentle, effective and affordable. This kit comes as two tubes. You use the first tube as a regular toothpaste and brush normally for about a minute. Then spit but don&#x27;t rinse. Then add the gel from the second tube to your brush and brush again for about a minute. The toothpaste itself isn&#x27;t overly minty but it leaves a fresh clean feeling in your mouth. I have a sensitive mouth and the inside of my mouth wasn&#x27;t irritated at all by this product. I noticed results almost immediately. Fresh breath and white teeth for an affordable price, what&#x27;s not to love? Much cheaper than a dentist and easier/ quicker than the strips.</li>
            <li> Hi received the Crest 3D White Brilliance for free through a  champaign with BzzAgent. I have tried other whitening products in the past, and found them to be time consuming. This on the other hand really is not that time consuming, as it only adds one extra step than regular brushing. Overall I was pleased with the results. I feel it worked better than other whitening products I have used in the past. Definitely will be purchasing another one when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have tried Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System twice now.  The first time my teeth got very sensitive with use.  I tried it for a week then took a break because my teeth were just too sensitive.  So, I tried it again after a break hoping that the sensitivity would be better this time.  It wasn&#x27;t.  This time I tried it for 2 weeks, for the first week I used it twice a day as directed.  The second week I decreased it to once a day hoping that would help.  It didn&#x27;t.  The sensitivity was just too uncomfortable.  It was disappointing.  I didn&#x27;t mind using 2 different steps to clean my teeth.  I loved the deep cleansing toothpaste.  My teeth felt so clean afterwards.  The whitening finisher burned sometimes.  It could get a little uncomfortable.  It did seem to whitening my teeth a little but the accompanying teeth sensitivity wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> i was fortunate enough to receive a set of the daily cleansing system through Bzzagent and I was excited to see if this actually works for me. I have some teeth that are stained. I have always been a coffee and tea drinker so I know that contributes to my problem. I was hoping to find something that actually would work. I will recommend the deep cleansing polish from this set. My teeth have never felt so clean after brushing with this polish! My old toothpaste is going in the trash. This is the first time my teeth have that I just left the dentist clean feeling and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have whitened maybe one or two shades and I was concerned about possible sensitivity but fortunately that didn&#x27;t happen. So if you want to try a whitening product that will work and not make your teeth sensitive this is the one you want to try.</li>
            <li> This works as well as any other whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve tried. The taste is terrible, though. There are more effective, better tasting products out there.</li>
            <li> I am a buzz agent and was invited to trial this product. I have never used a whitening system before so I was excited to try it. I used the product and immediately my mouth felt cleaner. I was a little disappointed that I did not get the foam feeling like normal toothpaste do (but some people don&#x27;t like the foam). The product does what it says it will and leaves you mouth feeling great! Thanks for the invite buzz agent!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White was a great experience to use. My teeth felt super clean and polished. The mouthwash was the brillance on the bright! The three products helped me brush longer and maintain a routine I hadn&#x27;t normally done. I would recommend these products to everyone. I will continue to happily use them.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzReport, I received a free sample of Crest 3D White Brilliant Daily Cleansing and Whitening System. I liked that fact the system is paste that you can use just like regular toothpaste; much easier than strips or trays! I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the taste of either of the pastes. I didn&#x27;t get that fresh, clean teeth feeling I get with regular toothpaste. Because of that, I only used the system once a day, rather than every time I brushed. Even using just once a day, I still saw results within three days and after over month, my teeth definitely looked less yellow and more white. Overall, I would recommend this system because it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require lots of extra effort, but still provides great results.</li>
            <li> Step 1 was a good cleaner but thinner consistency than what I like and it did not foam as much as I like a toothpaste to foam.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 may whitening but I continue to drink my stain causing coffee so I did not see much results and it burned my gums on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;It does encourage the user to brush for two full minutes which is good.</li>
            <li> Nice product easy to use, gradual improvement</li>
            <li> It worked slightly on whitening my teeth, however it causes a burning sensation that makes not very appealing.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two full weeks. Each time, after brushing, my teeth and mouth felt extremely clean. This product&#x27;s claim to fame, however, is that it has 3D whitening power. While it did whiten my teeth, I feel like it was only a minimal whitening. When I think &amp;#34;3D White&amp;#34; I think of something that will be very obvious, a bright white. It seemed to take several days before the whitening even took effect, but yes, it did whiten, just not as much as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Great whitening toothpaste! Better than whitestrips because it whitens all your teeth.</li>
            <li> First off, I received a free sample of this product from Crest through Bzzagent! I absolutely LOVE how this system makes my teeth feel. It really does make your teeth feel like you just got them polished at the dentists office. I have an electric toothbrush so that helps but my teeth feel better with this system than with just a regular toothpaste. Unfortunately I have not noticed much of a difference in the color of my teeth but I love how clean they are.</li>
            <li> I found the product easy to use. If brushing your teeth is part of your daily routine, then you don&#x27;t have to remember to use it. For those of us who don&#x27;t have straight perfect teeth, this product works better than anything else on the market. It is MUCH easier to use than ill-fitting strips.</li>
            <li> It works if you&#x27;re willing to do the the two step process daily.  I saw a difference after only one week.</li>
            <li> have been using Crest products for a long time but Crest 3D White daily cleaning &amp; whitening system is really a new innovative way of cleaning and whiten your teeth. It is a really simple two step system: first you brush your teeth with the step 1 deep cleansing toothpaste which deep cleans your teeth. It’s a fluoride toothpaste for anticavity and antigingivitis. No rinsing afterwards. Step 1 is immediately followed by step 2 by adding the whitening gel to your toothbrush and brush for about one minute. Step 2 really whitens your teeth. After those two steps you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;This is so much more easy to do and to use than the whitening strips or other whitening systems because you don&#x27;t have to wait half an hour or longer to see the results. It&#x27;s just easy to do while you are brushing you are cleaning your teeth and whiten them at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;At first I had to get used to the two steps but after using it for a couple of days my teeth and mouth felt a lot more clean and smooth. Like after going to the dentist when you have your teeth cleaned, stains and discolorations on my teeth are fading and they look a lot more white. I can&#x27;t wait what the results will be after using it for a longer period of time. I just really like this two step system from Crest 3D White.Easy to use and fast results! I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a fair review, so I used the product for 10 days before giving my review. The taste of the toothpaste was clean and refreshing. The whitener had a bit of a &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; taste to it. I used the products as directed. I did notice a change in the whiteness/brightness of my teeth after using it for 7 days. However, my gums were a bit sensitive after using it for that many days. I kept using it for 3 more days and my gums are still very tender. I believe the tenderness is being caused by the whitening agent, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure about that fact. I would use the product in the future, but I don&#x27;t think I would use the whitening agent every single day...probably every other day. Overall, I think it is a great product that does what it says it will do. Thank you for the opportunity to use and review it.</li>
            <li> Got this free from crest, it works great! Would recommend using.</li>
            <li> The deep cleansing step one makes your teeth feel amazingly clean.  The whitening step two has a different taste but not terrible.  Over the last month of using this system, I have noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  The one drawback? I could NOT use this twice a day.  I attempted to work up to it, but it would cause a sore on my gum line.  I stuck to once per day and seemed to well.  I also have sensitive teeth so perhaps that added to the stress of the paste on my gums.  I am grateful I got to experience this amazing product, but getting it from Bzzagent for free made it EVEN BETTER!</li>

Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I found that the Crest 3D White toothpaste works great. You can actually feel it cleaning your teeth with it&#x27;s texture and cleaning power. I noticed that my teeth felt really clean and my gums felt great. However the whitening gel did not perform to my expectations. I have included a day one picture and then after two weeks and there is hardly any noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> It made my teeth considerably whiter in 2 weeks! though the pain to get there may not have been worth it... it caused or irritated a canker sore on my gum in the first few days of use. It burnt my gums and has a harsh smell. The concept is nice though and a lot easier than whitening strips. I received the product as a promotion from Crest through BuzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I received my Crest 3D White Brilliance courtesy of BzzAgent. At first glance, I was a bit disappointed that it&#x27;s a 2 step system, however, the results have changed my mind. My teeth are not only whiter, but shiny and polished. It doesn&#x27;t take much product, either, so it lasts a long time. I&#x27;m very pleased and will remain a customer.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> I got this as a trial sample from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;This is not my first time using whitening toothpaste, however it is my first time using a whitening treatments. This treatment comes with two tubes of toothpaste (Step 1 &amp; 2). The treatments seems to work better then normal whitening toothpaste, as I never see a difference with those. This makes a difference, if your gums can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;First you use Step One as you would a normal toothpaste for 1 minute. This paste is a little grainer then regular toothpaste, but taste similar to regular toothpaste. After you are done brushing you spit, but don&#x27;t rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Then you start Step Two, which is a tart tasting paste for 1 minute. I think this is the whitening treatment. After the 2 minutes you can spit and rinse. I had to gurgle a couple of times to get the Step Two taste out, but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;After each brush my teeth felt cleaner and whiter, however after two weeks of use my gums started to inflame. Since I never used whitening treatments before, my gums may be sensitive. So I stopped the treatment and went back to my old toothpaste. It&#x27;s been almost a week and my gums are going back to normal. Since I am a regular coffee drinker I really wanted this to work, I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait for a sensitive gums version.</li>
            <li> I received my sample in the mail a few weeks ago. I am an avid coffee and tea drinker. I found that it really helped me by using this product it kept my teeth looking white and bright. The only thing I did not care for was the taste. Other than that I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way Step 1 tasted and how clean my teeth felt. Step 2, oh Step 2, you disappointed me. Your flavor was not pleasant. There needs to be more minty, refreshing flavor like Step 1. Fix that and you&#x27;ve got a winner!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Made teeth feel clean and polished.  Loved using this duo.  No sensitivity and great results.</li>
            <li> I received a full size trial for free through BzzAgent &amp; Crest. I was skeptical at first to try it because of the fluoride in it. I usually can&#x27;t stand the taste of fluoride. But this cleaning system actually has a good taste. My teeth feel really clean after using it. The only thing that I would change is the fact that it is a 2 step process. I would love to just have 1 step.</li>
            <li> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed it. I would have liked more impute from you as most of the sites you asked us to use didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I found the taste good, not overly minty. The polish was not as tasty but gave my teeth a cool feeling. It took about 2 weeks before I really noticed a difference in my teeth. At first I could see a brightness but they didn&#x27;t seem whiter. But after about 2 weeks I did see the difference. I wouldn&#x27;t make this my regular toothpaste because after about 3 weeks my teeth are getting more sensitive to cold. It may have nothing to do with it but I think I will give it a break for a while. Maybe use it for a couple of weeks every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Crest and BzzAgent, and I really like it! I have tried other teeth whitening products in the past, and each had its own problems. They either moved, made my teeth very sensitive, or just plain didn&#x27;t work. Crest&#x27;s 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System works great. I have been using it every day for over a month, and I have not experienced any sensitivity, and my teeth are a few shades whiter. My only complaint is that it has a really bad taste. But, you do kind of get used to it, and when you rinse with mouthwash the bad taste is gone.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It tasted great; it was effective and worked very quickly. It did make my gums sensitive (so be careful NOT to apply to your gums), but I was surprised at how much I liked this.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was given Crest 3D White to try as a member of BzzAgent.  I used the toothpaste for 4 weeks and actually noticed a difference in my teeth!  Previous to this I&#x27;ve tried Colgate Total White which kept my teeth clean, but never very bright.  It took a little over a week and before I noticed a difference, but even my husband remarked how much brighter my teeth were.  It&#x27;s a little bit of a pain using two different pastes, but I got used to it quickly.  I did have to stop after the 1 month because I developed sensitivity in my upper right molars.  So it&#x27;s worth doing for a few weeks at a time and then going back to something else.</li>
            <li> I loved how clean my mouth felt and my teeth were a little whiter but after 5 days I had to stop using because of mouth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Promising, but maybe it needs more time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this combination product, but I was expecting more from it on the whitening front. It gave me very fresh breath and I liked the way it made my teeth and mouth feel -- clean and fresh. I do think I saw a bit of whitening effect after two weeks of use but, obviously since I&#x27;m not even 100% sure myself, it was underwhelming at best. I do feel optimistic that with more time, there will be more pronounced whitening results. And, since I find using the product pleasant, I will continue to use it and await bigger -- and brighter -- results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast acting product. The texture of this toothpaste is a bit different but it otherwise looks, feels, and smells like regular toothpaste. I did not find it to strong and it didn&#x27;t burn I did not notice any sensitivity in my mouth . My teeth also feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I received this to try from Bzz agent.  I love this product! I already used crest 3D white toothpaste as my go to toothpaste but I&#x27;m way more impressed with this system. It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take any extra time out of your day and my teeth feel super clean and look amazing. I started seeing a noticeable difference after only a few days.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had used an earlier Crest Whitening product, the Gel Strips. While it was largely effective, it had a strong peroxide taste, took noticeably longer, and left me with significant sensitivity in my teeth. This 3D White Brilliance, by contrast, provides excellent whitening, in much less time, with a better freshness and great taste, and I have not experienced any sensitivity. My teeth are whiter, and the stains that often form between cleanings, on my lower teeth between gums, it has steadily been removing them. The first cleansing toothpaste has a great fresh taste--the second doesn&#x27;t seem to have a strong taste, but a very minor hint of the peroxide aftertaste--but not enough to be unpleasant. I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything but a water rinse to cleanse my mouth afterward. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, and without causing sensitivity, I&#x27;m able to use this much more consistently than the old gel whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee, tea, and wine regularly, and using normal toothpastes with whitening agents in them seems to do ok for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; of the whiteness of my teeth, but gradually by my 6 month cleaning there are some stains that need attention. The Crest 3D White is taking care of that without the dentist visit. I have found sometimes, that just brushing twice in a row with regular whitening toothpastes can also make noticeable progress on visible stains. Overall we are completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest, and I thought it was a great maintenance whitener. I am a heavy coffee drinker and for the approximate month I used this product my teeth didn&#x27;t appear to be getting any yellower. That being said....they didn&#x27;t really appear to be getting any whiter either. It is really easy to use, Step 1 is a normal toothpaste and then you go right into Step 2 (no rinsing) which is the whitening gel. Anyone who has used Crest Whitestrips in the past will recognized the flavor of the gel (basically, hydrogen peroxide). The instructions state to use the product twice daily, and keep step 2 on your teeth for at least 1 minute each time. Maybe that is where I went wrong, I am only a once daily brusher and it was a minute(ish) of using the gel on only my front teeth. I didn&#x27;t experiance any of the white spots on my teeth like I have in the past with the WhiteStrips, but I did get some gum soreness and bleeding. I like that this product doesn&#x27;t really change my morning routine, and I think that I will continue to use it, but only after I get my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> I am loving the clean, fresh feeling of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System I trying the product for free!!! I love going to the dentist because you come out having clean, slippery, shinning teeth feeling which is exactly how the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System makes your teeth feel and look!!! I will defiantly continue using this system to keep my teeth feeling there best!</li>
            <li> I liked how this product cleaned my teeth and made my mouth feel clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening though. I would like to see this product in one tube instead of 2 different tubes.</li>
            <li> I liked the taste and zingy feeling in my mouth when I used the Crest 3D White. At first the toothpaste caused white spots on my gums (which I was warned of on the label).&lt;br /&gt;After a few days the brushing became more comfortable. My teeth appear brighter than before using this product but did not whiten as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I am sure to continue to use it- you can tell an immediate difference and my mouth feels so super clean. Best part is it only took 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> I was offered to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I have been trying this product for few weeks now and feel like a can form an opinion to share with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the time i received the product i heard about blue plastic beads in some crest toothpaste and was concerned if this was did. I checked and Crest 3D White does not has them. Looking at the ingredients I was worried about the hydrogen peroxide in the whitening polish as i have sensitive teeth. The peroxide did give me some cold sensitivity and i have used it less then the recommended amount and it was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all i feel my teeth are brighter and for people with no sensitivity may like it better. It is a good product to maintain the whiteness of your teeth form daily tea and coffee discoloration.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant 2 paste&#x27;s man that&#x27;s going to be a lot of work, but it&#x27;s really not anytime then normal!!! The directions on the back are very user friendly!!! I noticed a difference after only a few times, but even after the first try my teeth felt cleaner! I did not have any problems with gum soreness.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent for the opportunity to test and review this product. Crest 3D is a two step brushing routine that does a great job of clearing surface stains. My teeth look great! The steps are easy and not time consuming. I was also amazed about how fast I got results. I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great and whitens as it claims. I used this whitening system as directed for about a month and I see a difference in the color of my teeth. I drink ALOT of coffee so whitening toothpaste is a must for me. I am happy to report this did make a difference. Although it takes dedication to use TWO different toothpaste products, the extra effort is worth it. This two-step system works better than the whitening toothpastes I have tried in the past. I did receive this product free for review purposes but this review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me remove coffee stains from my teeth and brightened my smile</li>
            <li> I found these products to be exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a toothpaste am that cleaned and offered cavity protection but also one that whitens and fights stains and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found Crest 3D white easy to use and was happy with the results. My teeth felt cleaner and were definitely whiter.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this great freebie from Crest and bzzagent!  I started using it immediately...after about a week or so the 2 tube thing gets kind of annoying.  In addition, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference.  I hope that with continued use it does change!  But it defiinitely leaves a fresh breath feel.</li>
            <li> I got the pleasure of trying this product FREE! Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. It works great and is not overly foamy making it less messy. I was hoping it would taste as good as it worked. That was not the case, the taste is kind of a faint Minty, chalky taste. All in all it&#x27;s a good product and I would defiantly purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried this yet you are missing out on whiter teeth. I recieved this free for testing purposes and I am so impressed. I started using this and with in a week could tell the difference. I absolutely loveeee it. It works amazing well. It&#x27;s so simple and cleans your teeth as well as whitens. Try it today!!</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week, and I have noticed a brighter smile! I love the texture of step one. Has a slight sandy texture that about really scrubs all of the gunk from your teeth, while still being gentle. Step two makes your breath super fresh and your teeth feel like they just had a dental cleaning. Over all, I&#x27;m very satisfied! Thank you to BzzAgent and Crest for the free sample!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to write this review for those who are looking for a gentle, yet effective whitening system! I was fortunate to receive this product free to try through Crest and BzzAgent. I was so excited to join this campaign to test out this new whitening system! I&#x27;ve used all kinds of whitening strips and gels in the past, and while they work, they would also leave my teeth very sensitive. This Daily cleansing and whitening system has not given me any side effects whatsoever. Even after the first use, your mouth feels sqeaky clean, and already a shade whiter. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results! I love that I can use it twice a day with zero sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side for me, is I have very sensitive gums. It states right on the label that it may leave small white spots on the gums, but that&#x27;s normal and they will go away. This is true, you will notice that if you have sensitive gums. I have only noticed that reaction though, when I&#x27;ve had a cut from brushing too hard and then it stains that area. It does go away shortly after, however. Just brush gently, and be patient, and you will love the results. Plus, it tastes great! The biggest reason I never whiten with peroxide is because it tastes horrible. The whitening agent in this system is peroxide, but it tastes good! I hope this review helped, I&#x27;m glad I gave this whitening system a try! This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;-Melissa</li>
            <li> This product is great,been using it for a few weeks now and the results are amazing. Easy to use and starts working immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to bzzagent and crest 3D for allowing me to try this product as part of a promotion, absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Brilliance for about 3 weeks now. The package says results after 2 weeks but truthfully I could see results after just a couple uses. I drink coffee everyday so unfortunately my teeth suffer the consequences. Crest 3D White Brilliance is the way to go for removing those coffee and tea stains. Have a whiter smile in just a few uses! Thank you Crest for allowing me to try this great product for free!</li>
            <li> This is actually round two for me in terms of whitening toothpastes, courtesy of Bzz Agent and Crest who sent the toothpaste to me to try for free.  I first tried the HD White by Crest which was a major fail for me (I have sensitive teeth) so when the 3D White came in, I was a bit worried that the results would be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can happily say, that in terms of sensitivity, this toothpaste was a big improvement for me.  With the other whitening toothpaste I tried, it was so abrasive that I could not stand hot or cold foods which of course led to me not using the toothpaste.  This time around, I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks now and haven&#x27;t had any issues with sensitivity to my teeth.  Additionally, I really like how clean my mouth feels after brushing and my teeth definitely do look whiter.  While I don&#x27;t have heavily stained teeth, I do drink more than one hit of coffee daily (hey I get up early and have small children) and my teeth have paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works in two steps, step 1 is to brush normally, then without rinsing your mouth or toothbrush, add the step 2 gel to your brush and brush again for about 1 minute.  It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of effort which is huge for me and the results are definitely visible.  Not the best tasting toothpaste, especially step 2 which is easily recognizable for the peroxide that it is, but much easier and quicker than white strips and at ~$12 for the system in stores, it&#x27;s definitely more wallet friendly as well.  Plus, since you&#x27;re brushing and I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re doing that twice a day, you&#x27;re being consistent with your whitening routine. For me, the hardest part about using products like whitening strips is to keep consistently using the product to obtain results.  By incorporating into my daily brushing routine, I&#x27;m consistently whitening with minimal effort another big plus in my book.#GotitFree #PowerCouple</li>
            <li> I received this Crest 3D White Brilliance Duo free in the mail from Bzzagent.com to try out and share my honest opinion. In the past I have used the gel whitening trays you get made at the dentist and so far after using this product for a little over two weeks I feel like the results are very comparable. I actually prefer the Crest 3D White method because it takes no extra time out of your routine to use like bleaching trays which are an extra 15-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews mentioned gum sensitivity and their gums turning white which did happen to me the first two or three times. The deep cleansing tooth paste is more abrasive than most normal toothpastes and people, including myself, have a tendency to brush too roughly so when doing it with this type of toothpaste it can cause gum abrasions. After realizing this I started to brush more lightly and for no longer than a minute which is plenty of enough time. I&#x27;ve been setting a timer on my phone for two minutes which is helpful for not over-brushing. When brushing normally I like to brush three to four minutes so it took me a few times to get used to the reduced amount of time and mentally feeling like they were getting just as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really would recommend this product especially for anyone who drinks a lot of coffee, tea or red wine. Just after a week it was such a noticeable difference that I was pleasantly surprised. Going to the dentist to get the trays and making special trips when you run out of the whitening gel can be a hassle and costly especially when there are options now like this Crest 3D White Brilliance Duo which delivers similar results.</li>
            <li> I love this system! After 2 weeks, people started noticing how much whiter my teeth were. At work, everyone kept asking me what I was using, to whiten my teeth, so I told them that I&#x27;d been using this, since I got it as a free gift from Bzzagent! People kept asking me how long it took to use, so I told them it takes less than 5 minutes, but you get very quick results.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  I actually really noticed a difference pretty quickly after using this two-step system, only after about a week!  Now that I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening for a while now, I can see its power.  It has removed some staining and my teeth appear to be whiter overall.  The only negative I can think of is that sometimes I just forget to do the second step when I&#x27;m tired and I rinse my mouth out right after the first step.  Other than that, would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to do a professional whitening system.</li>
            <li> I received a kit for free from BzzAgent and Crest for testing purposes.  At first, I loved this kit and couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about the simplicity, convenience, price, and pain-free, instantaneous results.  All you have to do is brush with the paste and the gel for one minute each, twice a day, as you normally would.  In that regard, this is one of the easiest whitening systems I&#x27;ve ever used.  However, BE CAREFUL.  This product contains stannous fluoride which can cause staining.  There is a disclaimer on the product which I hadn&#x27;t noticed until I got a slight brownish color (almost like a coffee stain) on my teeth.  Supposedly, this can be due to improper brushing, but I had been very careful with following the directions and even using a timer when brushing my teeth.  At this point, I&#x27;m disappointed because of how much I loved this product.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with this staining and I don&#x27;t know how to make it go away.  It isn&#x27;t terrible, but I definitely notice it.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with Crest 3D white! I got mine to try from Crest for FREE. The first time I used it I could not believe the stains it removed. To be honest the first use was when I really noticed the most change, however it&#x27;s still whiting! It&#x27;s easy to use and don&#x27;t take mass time out of your day like other whiting systems.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System from BzzAgent to try. I really love this product. You have to use the Step 1 toothpaste for 1 minute and then use the Step 2 cleanser for 1 minute. The flavor is okay, nothing offensive but the results are extremely noticeable within1-2 weeks. My teeth have become at least 2 shades whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth, therefore I thought my teeth would be sensitive to this, however, they were not. I just replace these 2 steps with my regular toothpaste. I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had professional whitening done by my dentist, followed up by the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; at home solutions used with my professional dentist tray to keep my teeth white as they do start to fade over time, regardless of whether you had it done at a dentist or not. Usually whitening toothpaste keeps the whiteness going for a good while longer than regular toothpaste, but I found this to be absolutely the best whitening product I&#x27;ve tried. After a brush in the morning, I feel there&#x27;s definitely an improvement over my prior all-in-one (including whitening) toothpaste. The first step is a deep cleaning whitening toothpaste and there&#x27;s a clear improvement after this step, but the real improvement comes with the finisher in step 2, which Crest calls a &amp;#34;whitening finisher.&amp;#34; I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing. I don&#x27;t think this is intended to whiten teeth that haven&#x27;t been treated before, but as a touch up for previously treated teeth and as a followup to the excellent Crest 3D Luxe whitening strips, this is a great product and one I&#x27;m definitely keeping in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this new two step system. I received it from BzzAgent and Crest to try for free #GotItFree. I have sensitive teeth and gums so using the strips is actually painful. This seemed like it was right up my alley. It&#x27;s a pretty simple procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 - brush with the deep cleanse toothpaste for one minute. Don&#x27;t rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 - brush with the whitening gel for one minute. Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one was interesting. I felt like it did a really good job of cleaning and it left my breath pretty minty. It had a gritty texture to it and after a minute I started getting a squeaky clean feel. It was interesting to say the least, but it was a mental indicator that maybe it was working really well.&lt;br /&gt;Step two was nice because it cleaned off all of that gritty toothpaste from step one. It left my teeth smooth and they felt really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening, meh. I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed. I felt that there were some days that my teeth looked whiter, but at the end of two weeks, I didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference. Maybe a shade or two lighter but it wasn&#x27;t really enough for me to be like, &amp;#34;Oh! I see the white!&amp;#34; I will keep using it to see where it takes me, but after two weeks I&#x27;m not all that optimistic. I think it did a great job cleaning but that was about it. I DO drink a lot of tea and periodically have a diet soda so maybe there is just too much staining on my teeth already for the product to do a good enough job.It was also nice that it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums like the strips do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. These two work together so well. The toothpaste made my mouth so fresh and clean feeling and the whitener made my smile so bright. I used the product for a week and my smile was as white as could be and I had no trouble with gum sensitivity (I usually do) I am so pleased with this product and so happy I was able to try it for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The CREST 3D WHITE BRILLIANCE DAILY CLEANSING AND WHITENING System is absolutely awesome! I am not one to use Whitening products on my teeth, but was fortunate enough to receive a box of the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System for free as a buzzagent. This stuff blew me away! I have just bad teeth all around, in the past I&#x27;ve tried bleach and Whitening toothpastes and they made my teeth sensitive and &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;  feeling. The CREST 3D WHITE BRILLIANCE DAILY CLEANSING AND WHITENINg System does NOT make me feel like my teeth are going to fall out at all! My teeth honestly feel like I am leaving my dentist office every morning, and the Whitening power is awesome! But not overly white like paint. allowing me to start my day feeling bold, fresh and confident! I am madly in love with this toothpaste, I will never brush with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothpaste, it took a little while to actually see the benefits of the whitening but i could definitely tell a difference in how my teeth felt. My teeth felt like i had just had them cleaned. The flavor was good as well and it also makes you brush for the recommended 2 min for optimum oral health :) Not to mention i received Crest 3D White for free Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I received two full-sized tubes (one tube of &amp;#34;Step 1&amp;#34; and one tube of &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34; and they&#x27;re color-coded!) in the mail for free from BzzAgent as a promotion from Crest brand. The first tube (cleansing toothpaste) is purple and the directions say to brush with this paste for one minute, spit, but DO NOT rinse. Then brush with the second tube (a white tube, the whitening gel) for one minute, spit, rinse with water. Those steps are easy-peasy compared to other whitening products on the market!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to do these steps twice a day. If you&#x27;re like me and brush at lunch time or additional times throughout the day, I&#x27;ve just been using the step one tube without the gel for those additional times.&lt;br /&gt;Both the paste and the gel taste pretty good, which was a surprise to me! Most whitening products don&#x27;t taste so pleasant. The toothpaste kind of reminds me of that &amp;#34;bubble mint&amp;#34; flavor of the blue toothpaste I used when I was a kid, and the gel has more of a cool mint flavor. My mouth feels fresh and clean when I&#x27;m finished brushing, and no weird after taste or filmy sensation is left behind. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing I should mention: the first time I used this product, I saw a white spot on my gum on one side Immediately after using. I was prepared for it because it is written on the packaging as something to be aware of but I know some people don&#x27;t always see things like that so I want to let you know it&#x27;s nothing dangerous (and not painful or anything either). I had used it at night that time, and it disappeared by morning. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results go, I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 weeks now and I have noticed a difference in the brightness of my smile. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a huge difference in whiteness per se, but I definitely think it&#x27;s noticeably brighter. I think the best part isn&#x27;t the whitening power but the squeaky clean feeling in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love love love this toothpaste combo!  The taste the look!  It&#x27;s weird but I like it when companies make a product look really appealing.  Now the real question!  Does it work?  According to the packaging it&#x27;s supposed to whiten teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks straight now and I&#x27;m not going to say that it really whitened them but it&#x27;s not like I had yellow teeth to begin with. I do believe the toothpaste prevented stains from forming though. I do drink a lot of coffee and wine so I brush my teeth pretty regularly plus I love having fresh breath!  I do recommend this product to others who are looking to keep their pearly whites clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try the product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> Thanks for adding this to your whitening lineup. It&#x27;s making a difference in my overall tooth appearance and health. Thanks Crest for allowing us BZZ AGents to try this for free. This is a dynamic duo.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  I have always used a daily whitening toothpaste, but my teeth were still looking look a little blah because I drink a lot of coffee.  i received this free as part of a promotion.  I love using this in two steps -- first the brightening paste, which has a good, not overly minty taste and is kind of sparkly.  Then the second tube is the peroxide-based whitening gel.  I like the two steps so that I can target the whitening just on the fronts and backs of my teeth, but still know I got a complete and total clean.  I noticed a definite difference after just one week!  I also like that this doesn&#x27;t have that weird taste a lot of whiteners have, and it&#x27;s not overly harsh.  Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!</li>
            <li> This new Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 tube system is simply put...AMAZING!  have been using Crest 3D White Brilliance system for 3 weeks. I was super excited to try this after receiving it to test through Bzzagent. You have to keep in mind that these toothpaste products do not work overnight. The maximum results achieved really depend on how often you use the product and if you do so properly. I find that if you have really sensitive teeth, this may be a bit too strong for you (similar to what the dentist uses for whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 2 step system to clean, polish and brighten. Step 1 is toothpaste in a 4 ounce tube, the active ingredient of which is stannous fluoride. Step 2 is a 2.3 ounce tube of &amp;#34;whitening finisher&amp;#34; that has several ingredients, but the main powerhouse is the Hydrogen Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are simple: Brush with the toothpaste for a minute, then spit but don&#x27;t rinse. Then you brush for another minute with the whitening finisher, after which you should spit and then rinse. The recommendation is to use this system twice a day for maximum whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it is working way more than my expectations were for an over the counter product! Yay on saving money by not having to have the dentist whiten my &amp;#34;pearly whites&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting or ready for the products to work as well as they did.  I&#x27;ve been using this Crest 3D White brilliance system for a little over a week &amp; my teeth are already 2 shades whiter and aren&#x27;t super sensitive like other professional whitening systems I&#x27;ve used in the past from the dentist with the whitening trays and gels, or with the over the counter whitening strips. 1 min to deep clean &amp; 1 min to whiten...that&#x27;s it!  This system is cost efficient and just as effective as getting your teeth deep cleaned &amp; then whitened at the dentist.  I only wish I took a before photo of my teeth to show you how quickly they whitened.  I hope amazon puts this on subscribe and save soon for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the products to try for free through Crest and bzzagent &amp; gave my honest feedback about the quality &amp;  effectiveness of the whitening system.</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to get to try this two step whitening product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I had my doubts about trying yet another tooth whitener, but this one has really won me over. I&#x27;m a coffee, tea and soda drinker. Most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t give me the results I want, and bleaching gels make my teeth so sensitive that I have to stop using them before they even have a chance to work. I tried professional whitening, which not only stung like crazy but also gave disappointing results. So needless to say, I didn&#x27;t expect to fall in love with this either. However, the Crest 3D White Brilliance toothpaste and whitening gel combo really worked!  In one week my teeth where shades lighter, and they just kept getting lighter, brighter, and whiter every time I brushed. I&#x27;ve been using the two step system for several weeks now and my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been!  And the best part is, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no pain or sensitivity from it whatsoever!  I can&#x27;t rave about this product enough. I am just floored by the results!  By the way, even though you are brushing your teeth in two steps instead of one, it really doesn&#x27;t take more than a few extra seconds because each step takes one minute of brushing, and the general rule of thumb is to brush for two minutes anyway. Thank you, Crest, for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several at home whitening kits over the years. Usually I give up before I really see rests because my gums become very sensitive. I had the opportunity to test the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System free through Crest and BzzAgent. The kit is a two step process, the first step being a toothpaste and the second step being the whitener that you use on your toothbrush. You use it twice daily as your brushing regimen. I found that very convenient. After a week of use as suggested, my gums did indeed become sensitive. I scaled back to using the step two only once a day. After three weeks of use I have noticed my teeth appear slightly whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste/whitening duo. It is very easy to use and makes my teeth very smooth and clean. I like that it doesn&#x27;t cause me any tooth sensitivities like whitening strips do. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes to the color of my teeth but then again I am only using the whitening stuff about once a day when they recommend two. I like though that it only takes two minutes to use. I got this product for free thanks to Crest through BzzAgent and am really happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and find whitening strips to bother me so bad I can&#x27;t even suck in cold air after I use them.  When I received this system as a promotion from the brand in the mail I was so excited to try it out but nervous that I would experience the same sensitivity.  The first thing I noticed is this system takes 2 minutes so it&#x27;s no additional time added to your brushing routine.  My mornings are already so jammed pack this was a big bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the system once a day as a precaution to sensitivity but after a few days I realized I had nothing to worry about began using morning and night.  Within a week I noticed I was smiling more.  My mouth just felt new again.  Sure it&#x27;s not the same fast results as with the strips but it&#x27;s also results without the problems of sensitivity and time of having white strips on your teeth!  For me this two step system is a no brainier!</li>
            <li> I love this new product!! In the past I have tried teeth whitening strips and they made my gums burn. I have also tried pastes and always end up with the burning effect. This product is so fast and easy to use. You whiten your teeth in the time that it normally takes to brush your teeth. First you brush with the included tooth paste for one minute. Then without rinsing you brush with the paste for one minute. My teeth were noticeably whiter and it didn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Got it as a free sample from Crest and BuzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I was fortunately chosen to try and review crest 3d white brilliant daily cleansing from bzzagent for free! I have been using this system for just over 3 weeks and I love it! Family has already noticed a whiter smile from me! I included a before and after photo, absolutely no editing has been done to enhance the color in either photo!</li>
            <li> I received the product free from Crest to try as a promotional product and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  However, it my mouth itchy for about 3 days after using it once. My husband has used it for a few weeks now and likes it.  He hasn&#x27;t noticed if his teeth are any whiter though.</li>
            <li> At first I was excited about the results I saw on Day one. I got a few comments about my smile being bright so I shared with family and friends how I got this awesome product for free from BzzAgent and how I would keep them posted of my final results. The two step process isn&#x27;t so bad but after the second week, it got tiresome. My results never got any better than the first day I tried it but I am still sticking with it to complete the tubes. As a previous poster said, I did get white on my gums but that only happened once. I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or anything so that&#x27;s a plus for me. I would say, for a slight daily brightening, this product works. However, if you are looking for obvious results and ease of use, the crest 3d white strips are much better, in my opinion. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product but I&#x27;m glad I got to try it for free as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest #D White Brilliance for a few weeks (Free thanks to Crest) and I must admit I really like so far. I was previously using a Crest 3D 2 bottle set, so I had gotten used to the two-step process. I really like this product. It makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste. I have noticed the my teeth are whiter, but what&#x27;s even better is when people compliment me on my smile! I don&#x27;t think people instantly realize it&#x27;s because my teeth or whiter, but I know that has been why I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my smile lately. I&#x27;ve very happy with the results just after a short time.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free by Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this whitening product better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. I was skeptical at first that maybe the toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t give me as good of a cleaning as my normal toothpaste. This toothpaste was great. It left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh. After the paste I applied the polish. I instantly noticed my teeth looked whiter. After using the product everyday for a week my teeth did whiten a few shades brighter than any other whitening technique I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;The paste and polish didn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in my mouth. I didn&#x27;t have staining or sensitivity. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! After I brush with the Crest 3D White I feel like I just left the dentist chair! And I can definitely tell my teeth are whiter and brighter! Thanks BzzAgent for sending me this product for free to review. I will keep buying this cleaning and whitening system when my free set runs out!</li>
            <li> I got to try out Crest 3D White Brilliance for free from Crest. My first day of use, Step 1 felt like I was brushing my teeth with sand paper,  my gums started to bleed after Step 2. I felt like my teeth were whiter but the pain around my gums was not fun. Its also a bit tedous brushing with a 2 steps system. My husband who is a smoker and coffee drinker, his teeth do look whiter, he said it doesn&#x27;t bother his gums like mine. I do like Crest products but this is not one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I received Crest&#x27;s 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system courtesy of #BzzAgent for #GotItFree. I have to admit I was a little skeptical. I was a smoker for many years and never seemed to get my teeth white with other over the counter products. I also am a heavy coffee drinker and that too has left a color to my teeth that I wasn&#x27;t able to get removed over the coarse of time. My teeth are naturally a little white, but this product has helped get them pearly white. I mean I was only using it for a couple of days and I and others could see the significant difference. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or make them feel any different when using the product as some people have stated. I myself will continue using this product since I am a true believer in it. It&#x27;s non time consuming from using other toothpaste and I get the perk of it making my teeth white again.</li>
            <li> I am a big red wine fan and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they used to be.  I was a little skeptical when I got this product from BzzAgent, but I gave it a shot because it was a free product thanks to Crest.  This toothpaste combo definitely exceeded my expectations and I will be sure to buy some more when my sample runs out. I don&#x27;t mind using the 2 toothpastes because of the results it delivers. I really feel this toothpaste gives my teeth that straight from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample of Crest 3D white brilliance daily cleansing and whitening system from Crest via BzzAgent.  I have been using the product for about 4 weeks now and I love it!  Step 1 is a deep cleansing toothpaste that you brush with as you normally would for 1 minute.  Then instead of rinsing, you brush with the step 2 toothpaste which is a whitening finisher for 1 minute and then rinse as normal.  This toothpaste combo leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  I like that it does not take any extra time during my normal morning and night time brushing routine.  I have noticed that my teeth are visibly whiter, especially my canine teeth which usually have the yellowish tint to them.  This 2 step toothpaste product is so great to use at home in between dentist visits to give you that deep clean  feeling.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am lucky enough to be trying this product through Crest and Bzz Agent. This whitening system is amazing, in just 2 easy steps you are on your way to whiter, brighter teeth. I have seen a huge reduction in my plaque build up and my breathe stays fresh much longer. I would recommend this product to all users especially those who suffer from genetic plaque build up and consumers who have naturally yellower teeth.</li>
            <li> I was able to try 3D White for free.  I was a bit worried at first because my teeth are so sensitive and other products tend to hurt my teeth.  Not this product.  I was able to use 3D white pain free and it really whitened my teeth.  My parents even asked if I had gone for a cleaning because my teeth looked so fresh.</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2 part system after receiving a sample from Crest. I&#x27;ve used some of their other whitening products in the past, such as white strips and whitening mouthwash, but was excited to try this new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 is a simple toothpaste. The flavor is not as minty as other Crest products I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not bad. It feels a little bit gritty in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t get very foamy, but it does leave my teeth feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 2 is the whitening solution. If you&#x27;ve used any teeth whitening agent in the past you&#x27;ll recognize the flavor immediately-- it&#x27;s a little chemically and not super pleasant. I avoid tasting this by just brushing on the front of my teeth that you can see (why do I need bright white molars, right!?).  Be careful when you brush this on because it can cause sensitivity and redness in your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using the product I followed the recommendation of brushing with this twice daily. This was too much for my gums. They became sore and sensitive, and even bled from the whitening solution. I&#x27;ve started using this product every other day and am not experiencing those sensitivities anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the unpleasantness of parts of the whitening process, I really am happy with the results. I feel like this product leaves my teeth feeling polished and shiny. I&#x27;d much rather do minor maintenance daily than use whitening strips for 30 minutes per day. This is good for maintenance, rather than trying to start whitening your teeth from your natural stained color. I think if you were to use a product like white strips, this toothpaste system would be an easy way to keep up your brilliant white smile.</li>
            <li> I  DRINK  A  LOT  OF  DIET COKE  WHICH  ISN&#x27;T  VERY  GOOD  FOR  THE COLOR  OF  YOUR  TEETH.I  HAVE  BEEN  USING  THE  3DWHITE  FROM  CREST FOR  A FEW  WEEKS NOW  AND  THE  DUO  HAS  REALLY  MADE  A  DIFFERENCE  IN  THE  APPEARANCE  OF  MY  TEETH. THE COLOR  HAS CHANGED TO  A PEARLY  WHITE,I  COULDN&#x27;T  BE  HAPPIER.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product for free for being a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two or three weeks, and so far I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it. The two step process isn&#x27;t too bad to deal with; one minute with step one, rinse, and one minute with step two. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I&#x27;ve had so far is the taste of step two. Yuck. Step one-way minty. Step two tastes like a standard whitening product. Not a nice way to leave my mouth. But, my teeth are whiter, so I can deal with a little gross aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Great Awesome product instantly cleans and polishes your teeth. Also a great whitening system that have my friends staring at my teeth. I love this combination. I am very pleased by the long lasting clean feel as well. #Product was given to me free by BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> I revived this product to try from bzzagent. I have been using it for about a week now and my teeth are visibly more whiter. I am a coffee drinker and my teeth are pretty yellow and stained due to this. I did try not using this for a day and my teeth went back to yellow. So if you are committed to using this product it really works!</li>
            <li> Seems to whiten well, but I am not sure about the medical implications regarding enamel safety. The system is super easy to use on a twice daily basis, tho, and I am happy with the results so far! I received this as a Buzz Agent promotion to try, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed sampling it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a month now-- for free thanks to BzzAGENT.com. I was excited to start using this product, because who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the two step process, and i have not noticed any gum sensitivities from using this product as other users have stated. My teeth feel clean after i use it, and i think i may see a slight improvement in whiteness, but i am not totally sure. Overall, the system is good, but i am not sure if i would purchase it, as it is slightly expensive for less than exceptional results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  The Crest 3D white has my teeth clean, smooth and white!  I am so impressed that it made my teeth whiter!  I don&#x27;t drink coffee or other dark beverages so I don&#x27;t have super stained teeth and thought they were pretty much as white as they could get...until I started brushing with the 3D whitening toothpaste!  I have used whitening strips in the past and they worked to make my teeth a little whiter, but my teeth always got so sensitive afterwards.  This toothpaste seems to work just as well or better than the whitening strips without any sensitivity.  I highly recommend it!  Thank you Crest and BzzAgent for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Quick, clean and easy to use. Works great. It says to use every day but I forget... I have been using for a week now (prob 4 of the 7 days). I have noticed a change in color in my teeth. I also feel my teeth are clean and my breath is fresh after using it. Doesn&#x27;t taste like a minty toothpaste at all but flavor is still good. I would highly recommend!! #gotitfree from bzz agent</li>
            <li> #GotItFree with BzzAgent! It was awesome for about the first 2 weeks, then I started having major build-up on my back teeth at the top. Its a great product for those who already have white teeth and want to keep them that way...</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through BzzAgent where it was sent to me to try for the next couple weeks and review. When you clean your teeth with this product it feels strong like it is really working. The flavor was a little intense for me but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it overtime using it. And the final purpose: it whitens! It was more noticeable with my husband who has genetically slightly-yellow teeth, and after using this for a little while he&#x27;s teeth were much whiter! So, besides the strong flavor I would say I like this product and it does actually whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try this whitening product thanks to crest.  I was so excited when the package came in the mail.  I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Seemed pretty simple to use for best results use twice a day and each bottle for only one minute each.  My teeth are not that sensitive but after doing this treatment for a couple weeks they started to become.  It is a great product that I will continue to use but not as often as I was maybe every two days or so.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AHHH-MAZING!!! I got it for free in a trial thanks to Crest and am already buying my second round because it really works that great! It honestly is the best whitening stuff that I have used and this is including strips, pastes, gels, etc. Do yourself a favor and try it! And for the price, how could you not?! It really is a power duo that&#x27;ll get your pearly whites sparkling in no time &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of this kit from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste can be a bit to swallow. But it makes me teeth feel exactly like they do after a visit to the dentist. It makes them feel extremely smooth and clean. No buildup of any kind. I do find it difficult as I like to brush my tongue and this is nearly impossible with the taste. The performance of the toothpaste outweighs the taste issues for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the Crest 3D White Brillance toothpaste system from #crest and #bzzagent. I&#x27;ve tried many whitening systems and have had little to no results until now!! Not only are my teeth whiter than they were 3 weeks ago, but my teeth look and feel cleaner than they have in months!! I drink lots of coffee and I smoke, so I was very skeptical, however I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference, plus I&#x27;ve received many comments on how white my teeth look!! The Credt 3D system also leaves my mouth and teeth feeling so clean and hasn&#x27;t caused any sensitivity as other whitening products have in the passed!! I am now a true believer and will definitely keep buying this product once my free sample runs out. Thank you Crest and Bzzagent for giving me back my old smile....I haven&#x27;t felt this confident in years!!</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  It works pretty quickly and is quite effective.  It&#x27;s also incredibly easy to use and the taste is okay.  I am a religious coffee drinker, and I saw a noticeable difference within 3 days.  However, I did have to take one star off.  I have pretty sensitive teeth.  I cannot use whitestrips or any other &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; whitening product.  I found there was a bit of pain after the third day of using it 2x a day.  I now use it once every couple days for &amp;#34;upkeep,&amp;#34; and I have no problems.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this whitening system.  I have used just about every whitening toothpaste out there so when i got invited to try this for FREE from Crest and Bzzagent.com, I was pumped!  I have never had a professional whitening.  To be honest my teeth are naturally very white.  I have a crazy coffee habit and love tea and red wine, so even though they are pretty white, they could always use some help.  I really love this product.  It is two steps and at first I thought that would be annoying, but it doesn&#x27;t take any more time than usual.  I always stick to the 3 minutes to brush, but with this you use each step for one minute and I followed the directions.  My teeth are bright and shiny.  They may not be shades whiter (again, I don&#x27;t need to whiten really) but they seem so much shinier and my mouth stays clean All Day, which is awesome.  A lot of days I will brush in the middle of the day bc my mouth starts feeling gross, but since starting this regimen I haven&#x27;t needed to do that.  On top of that, my mouth is still fresh in the morning, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with staining or sensitivity since starting this product.  I don&#x27;t mind the taste, it does stay with you for awhile, but I brush after eating so if doesn&#x27;t bother my taste buds.  I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this new system!! I have been using this for awhile now and I will definitely be investing in this product in the future. Teeth feel clean and look whiter after just a few uses. It is much easier to use than the trays or strips. Highly recommend this product. My husband is even excited about using it and asked to make sure it is on the next grocery run. :) thanks BzzAgent for introducing my family to this great product and the opportunity to try for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a little over a month now. Overall, I have seen improvement. I feel like there is definite change from week 1 to week 4. I am happy with the results and will continue to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is really quite convenient. I have used other whitening systems, specifically trays. It can get a little messy and finding the time to wear the trays for 15 to 20 minutes can be difficult. I also have experienced gum tenderness with the tray system. With Crest 3D White it was as easy as brushing my teeth. You did have to use two different types of pastes but for only 1 minute each. I did get a little gum tenderness the first couple of days but it didn&#x27;t persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen an improvement on the whiteness and brightness of my teeth. I don&#x27;t think it is as good as getting your teeth whitened at the dentist, but I do think it was better than my tray system. It could be that it was more convenient and that I used it more consistently. I am overall impressed! Thanks Crest for letting me try this product for free.</li>
            <li> Preface: I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System as a free promotion from BzzAgent, in return for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was a bit put off by the two tubes. The kit seemed far more serious than my normal tube of toothpaste. But, I’m a self-professed fresh breath junkie and I’m willing to try anything by Crest, my trusted toothpaste brand, for a white smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step process is simple. I brushed with the “deep cleansing toothpaste,” a gentle plaque-blaster, first. After a minute, and without rinsing, I brushed again for another minute with the “whitening finisher,” a clear gel polish. Easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth felt “fresh from the dentist” clean after two minutes, instead of 30 minutes in the dental hygienist chair. After a few days, my teeth are noticeably whiter. I have noticed a little more sensitivity in the area around my crown, but I think that is normal with any teeth-whitening product. Even my dental hygienist noticed my whiter teeth and pinker gums during my dental cleaning last week. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> burns a little like mouth wash, but in long run does whiten your teeth .</li>
            <li> Its a great product and works great. I only use it at night when I have more time. It is a bit more time consuming than other tooth paste but it works and that is what I like about it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Crest 3D White as part of my participation with BzzAgent. The 1st Step is a little odd and grainy when scrubbing your teeth. After a minute of brushing and rinsing, I did feel a slight burning sensation. However, the second time I used it there was no burn feeling, just the strongest mint smell ever. I love now how clean my mouth is, as comparable with the kind of clean after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;After two days I can physically see that my gums are pinker and my teeth are whiter. I am glad I gave this product a chance after day 1 and am looking forward to seeing my new whiter teeth in the future!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the product from bzz agent.  This stuff is awesome.  No nasty taste you usually have with whitening products. Within 1 week I noticed whiter shiner teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am not a fanatic about tooth whitening but I guess I draw the line at walking around with bright orange teeth!  This &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; (is it really a system or is it just two separate products bundled as one?) does a pretty good job.  The first tube contains a fluoride toothpaste and the second contains a whitening gel.  The gel contains hydrogen peroxide and I think what it is mainly doing is zapping the bacteria in your mouth that can cause your teeth to go yellow - but a second function is that hydrogen peroxide also works as a bleach.  Neat - but I&#x27;m not sure you couldn&#x27;t achieve the same results buying two separate products.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste in all. I think it makes my teeth look great and my mouth feeling fresh. I noticed a little bit of a difference but my teeth are not too bad in general. I dont use any whitening products but this and I get compliments all the time on my smile. I would definitely recommend this product. I really enjoy the fact that it does not use the harsh chemicals that a normal dentist would be using on your teeth if you were to go in for a whitening with them. I will continue to use this product. Crest supplied me with a free sample to try.</li>
            <li> Got this product to try as a bzzagent and have loved it!! Husband tried it and has noticed a new shade of white to his teeth. Thanks for a product that works!</li>
            <li> I found this product to remove stains from smoking and tea and coffee drinking...This product is really easy to use and does whats it says.I highly recommend it to all to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of whitening of some sort when this opportunity came up to give this product a try. I am happy that I gave it a shot. After the very first trial ( both steps), my mouth felt really clean, cleaner than it had since my last dentist visit and cleaning. At the end of the day, they still feel remarkably clean. After 2 weeks I took a good look at the color, and could absolutely see a difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent member, I was able to try this new product free thanks to Crest.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, I do notice a difference in the whitening effects.  The best thing about this product is that you basically just have to do what you currently do, brush your teeth.  With this, you just do it twice, once with each product.  No after taste, no trays, no one knows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, if you&#x27;d call it that, is that (as you can see in the photo I added) one lid completely twists off and one pushes open.  I don&#x27;t know why but that irriates me.  Same with the fact that when you stand them on their &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;, the print is upside down on step 2.  Won&#x27;t keep me from buying this though.</li>
            <li> I had, and still have, high hopes for this toothpaste. As of today after 2 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any obvious whitening but I will continue to use it in hopes that the results are just slow to appear. I find that the toothpaste leaves an overall clean feeling in my mouth, but there is a lack of minty flavor or any real flavor for that matter, which is kind of odd. Although whitening is a nice result, I found that having to brush in two steps daily was a bit tedious especially in the mornings when I was rushing to get ready for work. I did not have any sensitivity or negative side effects, just not the quick results I was hoping for. I will continue using it until I run out and hope to finally see cleaner, whiter teeth smiling back at me in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> great clean mouth but strong mint taste</li>
            <li> I have had a very positive experience with the product. I have had no sensitivity and my teeth have become whiter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> I tried this from Shoppers Army for free&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting the results I got from a toothpaste. My teeth are very stained and porous. After five days there was actually a difference and I have started showing my smile again. I liked the flavor. It is very mild and something you wouldn&#x27;t gag on. I liked the consistency of it too because when you put it on your toothbrush it stays there, with one exception. I was so sleepy one night I forgot to turn off my brush and some flew in my eye. It&#x27;s a blonde thing trust me. I liked after spitting out the first paste how you can see what it is actually taking off your teeth. Brown was in the paste. Now for the bad part. I don&#x27;t like having to use two different products. I don&#x27;t like brushing my teeth as it is, but once twice a day is enough for me. I also think it needs a different name. 3D doesn&#x27;t do anything for me&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product did a good job of cleaning my teeth and making my mouth feel fresh. When I ran my tongue over my teeth they felt smooth. Did not notice an appreciable difference in color.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D is just okay!  Didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel super clean, and not much whitening effect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and I can see a difference in my smile. Not a glow-in-the-dark white, but noticeably improved. The two step process isn&#x27;t as annoying as I thought it would be, but I will admit that I don&#x27;t love the taste. I tend to be sensitive to off tastes, so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t bother other folks. Regardless, I can endure the taste for the prettier teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was most concerned about the toothpaste being sensitive on my teeth, which it was not, at least so far. After using the product I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are whiter and brighter. The product didn&#x27;t leave my mouth dry or leave an unpleasant taste. What I&#x27;ll be curious to see is whether I have enough toothpaste and whitener as I get down to the last of it. Since they&#x27;re in separate tubes and there&#x27;s not the same amount of product in each tube, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using more of one than the other. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with the product and I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This is the first toothpaste-like product I&#x27;ve found that actually produces whitening results in over a short period of time. Pros: no strips or trays that you have to wear in your mouth, good whitening results, no sensitivity, no change to your normal routine...just brush. Cons: it took about 2 weeks for noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. It really does work for whitening your teeth.  I have previously used the strips  and this product tastes the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 2 tooth pastes, 1, the cleaner and polish and 2, then whitener.  You brush for 1 minute each.  It really did whiten!  However it did not give me that fresh feeling you get after you brush your teeth.  I felt like I had eaten whitener.  I wanted to brush with my normal toothpaste after I was finished this the Crest 3D system.  It also made the &amp;#34;chewing&amp;#34; part of my molars a little sensitive. Now,  I only use it on the part of my teeth that show when I smile.  I used it 2 times a day for a week and it looked great but did give my teeth a bit of sensitivity. I now use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  I enjoyed using the 2-step process of the Crest 3D Whitening toothpaste. It&#x27;s certainly more comfortable than the thought of placing &amp;#34;strips&amp;#34; on my teeth. It&#x27;s very easy to use and the change is gradual.</li>
            <li> i can only use the products for a couple of days due to sensitivity - sore gums. I have been using it 2 days on, 2 days off. I&#x27;m hoping that the sensitivity will improve so I can use it daily. My teeth appear whiter &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> The product was very interesting. I found it to be a bit &amp;#34;shocking&amp;#34; at first.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The quality we have come to expect from Crest products can be found in Crest 3D White. The two step brushing process fit well into my routine while providing noticeable results. And using the product every day helped me stay on track - no checking the calendar or trying to find 30 minutes where I didn&#x27;t have to have a conversation with someone.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have tried the Crest 3D White for about  two weeks and have been using the product as instructed. At first, I found the product to be rather abrasive, leaving my gums sore, but after a few days of use, the soreness went away. After two weeks of use, I really cannot see any noticeable changes to the shade of my teeth. Does it? Well I am not sure. I will continue to use the product for another week or so. Maybe then, I will see a difference.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System is simply fantastic. The deep cleansing toothpaste leaves your teeth and gums feeling clean and refreshed and the whitening finisher leaves your smile shining bright. I have long term illnesses that have left me with moderate periodontal disease, which has led to weak gums and five lost teeth. One of the lost teeth is an incisor, right there in the forefront of my smile, and with the dentures being porcelain, which doesn&#x27;t stain, and my real teeth staining regularly from my love of drinking tea, I have a hard time keeping my teeth white enough for my dentures to blend in. But Crest makes that a much easier feat to accomplish. I can once again smile without worry and, yes, Shopper Army, I can &amp;#34;let my freak flag fly, &#x27;cause I feel like I owe it to someone.&amp;#34; Thanks Crest!!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product for about 2 weeks now and I can see a visible difference in my teeth. They are bright, white and shiny. They feel great, almost as good as when I have my teeth cleaned by the dentist. I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort and the only reason I gave the product a 9 rather than a 10 is because the first two times I used the polish, I got some pretty noticeable white spots on my gums above my front teeth. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation of pain, just white spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing to use this product and when I run out, I intend to go out and purchase the product. Before the product was sent to me, I ws considering purchasing some white strips or some other type of whitening product. I will definitely purchase this product after I run out. My husband even noticed my teeth and he doesn&#x27;t even notice when I get my hair cut or colored. Evidently, it has definitely made a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the product because it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product had me a bit nervous as I had the infamous white spots on my gums a few days in. Never happened again, especially when I realized that I had actually had too much of the gel on my brush that time. My mouth always felt EXTREMELY clean, although a bit dry, after each brushing and lasted a long time. In my opinion, my teeth looked whiter after just a few days. After that point, I don&#x27;t think the whiteness changed, but I will keep using as I love the clean feeling and have recommended the product to everyone I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product gave me noticeable whitening after a week of use. It also made my mouth feel fresh and clean longer normal. The two step process was a bit unhandy, but the results were good.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was given this product through Bzzagent to try out. It&#x27;s easy to use ad it works! I cannot use it every day because I have sensitive teeth, but when I wanted to whiten up my smile, I used it! And,  I would use it again! I don&#x27;t use it too much on my back teeth because of sensitivity. It makes my teeth look great and is quick to use on my way out of the house!</li>
            <li> ***I am a bzz agent and  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product took some getting used to, but the results are worth it.  I had my 14 and 8 year olds (I know it says 12 and up) try it and they refused to use it after the first time because they said it tasted nasty.  So this product is definitely for adults.  I admit I do not use this product like it was directed (at least twice a day) because I am pregnant and have a strong gag reflex right now.  Even with the amount I do use it I can tell a huge difference in the color of my teeth.  They look a lot whiter!</li>
            <li> I liked how clean my teeth felt after I used this product. The toothpaste and the gel worked really well. I didn&#x27;t like how runny the toothpaste was. No matter how hard I tried to be careful, I always had toothpaste running down my mouth when using this product. I haven&#x27;t had that same experience with other toothpastes. I also didn&#x27;t like that this was a two step process. When I am in a hurry in the morning, adding an extra step to my brushing routine was a little bit of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that this product helped my mouth feel fresh and clean but I do not feel it helped in whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product. Easy to use and tastes great with no after-taste. It cleans and polishes as if you have just come from the hygienist chair!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing and Whitening System is an innovative, easy-to-use product. It includes a deep cleansing toothpaste and a hydrogen peroxide whitening finisher. The toothpaste has a light minty taste, and really scrubs the teeth. I found that my teeth stayed cleaner all day and all night using this toothpaste. The whitener has a very mild taste which is hard to describe - I thought maybe it tasted like butterscotch. After using the system for two weeks, I found my teeth to have a brighter look all day. They seem to be somewhat whiter, but as I have &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; teeth, I wasn&#x27;t expecting movie-star pearly whites. That said, I am satisfied with the color change, and very pleased with the look of my teeth. I would continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. I got this for free from Crest, to try and review. So far I&#x27;m happy with it! It&#x27;s quite easy to use despite being a 2 step kit. It&#x27;s seems like a lot to have to use each step for 1 minute each but really it flies by and actually I find myself using it for longer. It&#x27;s easier than going to the dentist for a good cleaning. My mouth feels so fresh and clean after each use and the whitening benefit of it is great. I saw a difference almost inmediatly!! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great job at  cleaning my teeth, they felt wonderful after brushing and the whitener was fast and easy to use, with good results.</li>
            <li> Cleaner, brighter, fresher! I really liked this product for cleaning, I didn&#x27;t get the whitening results I had hoped for but they are certainly whiter. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how quickly it worked. Almost immediate whitening experienced. Good taste as well.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest, and I could tell a difference after the first week, it wasn&#x27;t super noticeable but to me it was a big improvement. And as I continue to use it my family and friends definitely noticed a difference. This is a great product for brightening up your smile. I&#x27;m sure getting your teeth professionally done will get your teeth stark white, but I was looking for a much more affordable option to give me teeth a little boost. I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Works but low on convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product and overall felt like it worked. There were a couple of things though; timing anyway with brushing your teeth isn&#x27;t the easiest; cutting it down to 2 one-minute increments was even harder (my electric toothbrush for example has a timer but is automatically set to two-minutes, there&#x27;s no mechanism for me to change that). So having it be two toothpastes made the timing aspect more nuanced and complicated. The Step 1 toothpaste made my mouth feel very dry by the time I was ready to start Step 2 and made me really want to rinse. Not being allowed to rinse after Step 1, but just spit didn&#x27;t quite come naturally.&lt;br /&gt;All that said, a part of me also liked the idea of a two-step process; the packaging for it looked great and I overall was happy with results, which in my mind is ultimately what matters.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, i was a little upset, because it cut my normal tooth brushing time from 2 minutes (with 30 seconds in each quadrant) down to 1 minute of tooth brushing and 1 minute of whitening. I thought I was going to feel less clean because of this. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that evening though half of my normal brushing time was done with the whitener, my teeth still felt very clean. And, after 2 weeks of using the product (while drinking red wine throughout, which normally stains my teeth terribly), I can notice a difference and my teeth are not only not stained from the wine, they are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Great taste. Not sure if my teeth really got whiter</li>
            <li> Really liked the performance of Crest 3 D white ,I will very definitely continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent and Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System. My husband and I have both been using this 2 step system for a couple of weeks now and have seen a great difference in our smiles. I love that it&#x27;s a whitening system that you do not have to leave on your teeth, as the taste of most whitening systems make me gag. This system has a better flavor, and texture, than other systems I&#x27;ve tried. However, I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the burning. Step 1 was just like any regular tooth paste, but step 2 made my gums burn so bad that I was afraid to use it again. I immediately asked my husband if he had the same reaction, and he did, so I figured it was part of the whitening process and continued to use the system. I give this product a 4 star review only because of the burning, otherwise I would have given 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I feel as if my teeth received a better overall cleaning than before I started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Since I drink a fair amount of coffee each day, the results were quite surprising. Everyone around me noticed the difference. Though a bit more work using the 2-step system, I think the end result is worth the extra bit of effort.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;The product was easy to use. I feel that it helped somewhat in getting my teeth whiter then they had been. My teeth are somewhat stain due to caffeine so they will not become the &amp;#34;pearly white&amp;#34; teeth that one would hope for.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I used the product for a 2-week trial period. Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t see a huge change since I began usin. (As a disclaimer, my teeth weren&#x27;t that discolored to start with.) Luckily, I never had any problems with sensitivity and/or burning in my mouth that some of the other testers had. My teeth do feel much cleaner and shinier after using the product. Felt like I had just returned home from a professional teeth cleaning at the dental office.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Simple to use. Pleasant tasting. The best part was I noticed a change in the color of my teeth within days of using.  I initially used this system twice a day and after about a week switched to the mornings only.  I love the way my mouth felt after using this and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using this product. My teeth felt &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and much whiter than normal&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that it worked well and was simplistic to use. The product did not cause sensitivity like some products for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly this product worked. My teeth were quite stained from smoking cigarettes and drinking gallons of coffee. I saw a difference each time I brushed my teeth. It&#x27;s quite easy, just two steps and dedication to sticking with it. I would definitely buy this product. And I would definitely recommend it to others. When co-workers come up and say.. &amp;#34;You look different.&amp;#34; and you haven&#x27;t bought a new shirt or done anything new with your hair and they are starring in your mouth.. Well, you know Crest 3D White is working..lol.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I loved this product. The product made my teeth noticeable whiter within a few days.</li>
            <li> So I got this for free thanks to bzzagent and crest and was skeptical. I had tried other whitening strips and toothpaste in the past, and never really noticed a difference and hated how they felt. I was a skeptical of this because it seemed like a lot of work, a 2 step prices and timing things, like I have time for that, we&#x27;re my initial thoughts. We&#x27;ll after the second day of using it didn&#x27;t become a big deal at all, and I could feel my breath fresher and it felt like it was working in my mouth! After a week there was a noticeable difference in my breath and my teeth were definitely whiter! It&#x27;s easy for me to see the change as I have an implant, that doesn&#x27;t change color so I can visibly see my teeth getting back to white, to match my implant. It&#x27;s been a month now and my teeth and white and sparkl. Like I said , I&#x27;ve tried other things in the past, but had previously found nothing worked like the at home whitening trays from  the dentist  that were way overpriced. This is such a great affordable, alternative,</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me to have whiter teeth and better gum health.  My mouth and breath felt clean and my teeth were smooth.  The product did not irritate my mouth or gums.  I felt confident when using this product.  ( You can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!)</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to try this product out free of charge with Bzzagent. I was really excited when it came in the mail and I read what all it was supposed to do. I loved how clean the first paste made my teeth clean when I first used it and without rinsing I used the 2nd bottle which was a gel. I used this paste for a week and that is when I really started noticing the difference in my teeth color. They really were getting whiter and that made me more and more excited to keep using this product. I would highly recommend this product for someone that wants a whiter brighter and even cleaner smile without having to spend a ton of money on products or at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Amazing toothpaste that deep cleans your teeth and whitens them! I seriously love this toothpaste. I received this whitening system from Bzz Agent to try for free</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using Crest 3-D White toothpaste and whitener. I noticed a big improvement in the whiteness of my smile. I&#x27;ve been using that toothpaste system consistently for 10 days both morning and night and feel like the product is a great toothpaste, gives a deep clean, makes my teeth stronger and also really whitens my smile. My smile was whiter and brighter after the first use.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free through Crest and BzzAgent. Although the two-step process seemed daunting (and somewhat annoying) at first, it actually wasn&#x27;t much of a hindrance, and the deep cleaning step really felt like it was cleaning well. I did notice a difference in the whiteness after using for about a week, even with my daily coffee intake working against me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, start having sensitivity when used twice daily - which is a fairly common problem I have with whitening products. This caused sensitivity more on my gums than the teeth directly though, which was really only noticeable when rinsing right after brushing. I backed down to use only once daily and this greatly reduced my sensitivity (although slowed the whitening progress).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were super clean after the very first use! They felt exactly like they do after a dental cleaning and they STAY clean overnight! I have been using the Crest 3D White for 2 weeks and my teeth have never felt cleaner and I am beginning to notice my teeth looking whiter also. This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was selected to try Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free from Crest courtesy of BzzAgent. I&#x27;m not usually a Crest toothpaste or a teeth whitening product buyer so I was excited to try this product. I used this system twice a day for 1 week before I decided to stop. It did leave my teeth feeling clean and I could tell my teeth looked whiter but overall I was still disappointed. The first step in this 2 part system is a deep cleansing toothpaste and I found it to be very gritty and the mint flavor too overpowering. The second part is a gel whitening finisher which you add to the gritty toothpaste which just prolongs the gross gritty feeling in my mouth. I usually love brushing my teeth but I found myself cringing before using this product which lead me to stop using it. If you really want a brighter smile and don&#x27;t mind gritty, overpowering toothpaste then its a great product because I did start to see results of its whitening power but this product just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> After using Crest&#x27;s new polish for only three weeks, my plaque and stains disappeared! As my tea use increased, I noticed a definite staining on my teeth. After using this product for a short time, my teeth are brighter, smoother, polished and ready for my 35th class reunion!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This was much easier to use than whitening products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System through a free bzzagent campaign. I&#x27;ve used this system for over two weeks now, and I have recognized a noticable difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth. I&#x27;ve used photos to keep track of my progress as well as my husband&#x27;s opinion. He seemed to notice a slight difference after just a few days. I have to say this is a all around good product. It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time or effort. It just like brushing your teeth for two minute. Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity like I&#x27;ve experienced with other whiteneing products in the past.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive some Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing cream to try. I was skeptical at first. I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would really work but I was pleasantly surprised. My teeth are a lot whiter. It only takes a couple of minutes in the morning at evening to get great results. I especially like that I just have to brush my teeth to get them whiter. I don&#x27;t have to mess with strips or trays.</li>
            <li> Thanks for adding this to my whitening lineup. It&#x27;s making a difference in my overall tooth appearance and health. Thanks Crest and BzzAgent for allowing us to try this for free. This is a dynamic duo.</li>
            <li> This works extremely good! I was amazed by the results and I would recommend it to anyone! I was lucky enough to try it for free and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier!!</li>
            <li> Great product. They come side by side in a cute box step 1 the cleaning paste. And step 2 the whitening gel. At first try I was not very impressed with the taste. After using it it&#x27;s not so bad. My teeth are discolor ex from being an ex smoker and just daily life.  I was excited to re I&#x27;d&#x27;ve this from Crest and Bzz Agent. I&#x27;ve been using and can tell a slight difference it says six weeks for full results so I&#x27;m excited to see the final color. All in all very pleased with this and record it highly.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try this product for free thanks to Crest and BZZagent. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now. So far this product is easier to use than the whitening strips of the past. My teeth do not hurt using this system. It comes with two tubes one of toothpaste and one of gel. It leaves a bit of a dry feeling in your mouth after using but overall the taste is not too bad for a whitening product. I have not had good results with this product. I don&#x27;t think my teeth have lightened at all. I am a daily heavy coffee drinker so that may have something to do with it. Since this product is replacing my daily tooth paste I am going to continue to try it and see if in 3 more weeks I have better results.</li>
            <li> It’s been years since I’ve whitened my teeth. While I love having white teeth, I hated the sensitivity caused by whiteners and worried it was eroding my enamel.  Then BzzAgent sent me a new and more gentle product - Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product promises that it keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish with daily use 4 weeks after a dental cleaning.  I like that this is incorporated in your normal brushing routine, no messy strips or trays.  Just 1 minute per step twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first toothpaste is a cleanser that deep cleans, while fighting cavities.  It has a minty taste that I loved, but the gritty polish took awhile  to get used to and if you&#x27;re missing enamel could be abrasive.  The second product is a gel that whitens and polishes teeth by removing surface stains.  I felt a cooling sensation, but nothing that uncomfortable.  After several days I didn&#x27;t notice it at all.  My teeth looked and felt clean for hours after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just happened to get a cleaning before I started using this product.  I felt like after 3 weeks my teeth actually looked better than after the dentist.  My teeth looked a shade whiter and just as shiny and bright.  Don&#x27;t expect a big change in whiteness.  I was so pleased when my spouse noticed the change.  And best of all, no sensitivity!  My teeth and gums felt great.</li>
            <li> I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first abut the 2 step process with this system, however, I think it is well worth the extra step.  I think this worked better than crest white strips. It has a great taste and does not irritate whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a daily user of Crest 3D white toothpaste, and have been for years. So if you&#x27;re looking to decide if you should switch from the regular Crest 3D White toothpaste, to this two step Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening toothpaste, this review may help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, this toothpaste is a two part process. You brush your teeth with the first part, which is the cleansing part, and then spit it out. Do NOT rinse your mouth, only spit. After that, brush your teeth with the second tube. When you finish with that part, you can rinse it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tube, the cleansing toothpaste, is nearly intolerable to me. To aid in the cleansing (I assume), they made this paste EXTREMELY gritty. It feels like sand in my mouth. Not only is the texture strange, but the taste is stranger. I can barely last with this toothpaste in my mouth. Even if the texture wasn&#x27;t awfully gritty, I don&#x27;t think I would be able to accept the taste of this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second tube, which is what whitens your teeth, is a clear gel that doesn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad to me. My mouth is quite sensitive to extremely minty toothpaste, so while using this two step process, my mouth felt like it was on fire. I&#x27;m not sure which tube caused that though. The gel is much more tolerable than the cleansing paste though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, does this toothpaste whiten your teeth? I believe so. I do see my teeth whiter, because this toothpaste is probably removing some surface stains. Does it whiten better than the original Crest 3D white toothpaste? That I&#x27;m not sure of. My teeth normally respond well to whitening toothpastes and treatments, but I have never had my teeth professionally whitened. If this kid uses the original Crest 3D white as step one, followed by the whitening gel for part two, I would definitely consider purchasing. But honestly the first step just ruins the entire process for me, and makes it not worth paying more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free from BzzAgent, but that has absolutely no impact on my opinions. As I said, I am an avid user of other Crest 3D white line products, so I am not for or against this company in any way. This is just not the toothpaste for me!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from bzz agent #lovefreestuff! To get down to i. it works! I haven&#x27;t used any whitening products for about a year. I have two kids which equals me drinking lots of caffeine in all forms. I wanted a before and after but couldn&#x27;t get a true one because I saw results after 3 uses! I thought for sure it would take longer. I tried for about 5 minutes to get different angles and lighting but they really were lighter! The directions are simple brush for 1 minute with each spitting after the cleanse then rinse at the end. I have a silly problem with the lids though. I prefer flip tops and th whitener is a screw. Maybe it&#x27;s for safety reasons...? I don&#x27;t know but that&#x27;s annoying to me personally. Wish the kids were the same. I did start to notice a little sensitivity after 2 weeks. I do like the results but may have to alternate using between regular paste. I am also torn with the simplicity of simple instructions and steps and not enough info on usage. I wonder if it is meant for ling term.</li>
            <li> I received this Crest 3D whitening system on behalf of Crest and being a BzzAgent! I wanted to give myself consistent time with this product before reviewing it. It was been 3 weeks now and I can honestly say I see a difference! Now, the difference is not greatly dramatic, but it&#x27;s enough to make me purchase a second kit! I&#x27;m a hard core tea drinker, my teeth aren&#x27;t overly yellowed, but they could stand to be a little whiter. I believe this product does help to brighten the color of the teeth and does a great job at cleaning and freshening! I did experience very slight sensitivity my first week of use, nothing too bad, but if you are overly sensitive to some of the ingredients contained in this product, I would be cautious.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try this product for free as a Bzzagent. I have not been the most consistent with using them day and night, but in just a week I&#x27;m already starting to notice a whiter smile. I particularly love the whitening polish. As a strips user before, I love that being able to brush on the polish really allows you to get into the cracks between teeth as well as the far back teeth so that the whiter smile looks more natural and consistent throughout!</li>
            <li> I think the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System is more hype than action.  I followed the instructions and after i used the entire tube of toothpaste (unequal toothpaste to whitening gel ratio), my teeth were barely different than when i began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if someone in your family doesn&#x27;t have the patience for whitening strips this could be a good alternative, but for me, ill stick w whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was given this product to review for free by BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been using this 3D Crest Brilliance for about two weeks now. I don&#x27;t have a timer or clock near me when I brush my teeth so I kind of just count to 60 well I brush with the first paste (paste number1) then I do the same with the second one(paste number 2) because this is what the instructions tell you to do, is brush for one minute with one paste, then one minute with the second paste. At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if I was seeing any whiting but after about 4 or 5 days of using this 3D Crest, my husband could even tell that yes my teeth are getting much whiter. So that&#x27;s great it does work and I wasn&#x27;t having any problems with it hurting my gums or my teeth, and my teeth are sensitive to hot and cold, but when I used this 3D Crest Brilliance their was no pain. I drink coffee all the time and I have a soda everyday also, so my teeth where pretty stained when I started using this but now they are white, and this is all thanks to Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System! I did get this product free from Crest via BzzAgent to test and review, this is my my 100% true opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for a couple weeks now for free, courtesy of BzzAgent and Crest. Step 1 provides deep cleaning and although it tastes a little gritty, it is worth the extra clean feeling. Step 2 seemingly erases that feeling and polishes your teeth while adding whitening care. It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time more than your normal twice a day, two minute brushing. It&#x27;s great for people with a busy lifestyle and you are able to get that dentist cleaning feeling right at home. So far, I am impressed with the product removing stains and yellowing. I have used other products that are far more expensive and don&#x27;t compare to the clean, white results that this product provides. I would recommend that anyone that is looking for a whiter smile pick it up at a local retailer or online today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for free for about a month now and I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about it. I REALLY wish I could rinse after Step 1! Otherwise, It&#x27;s an alright product. I&#x27;m not sure if I notice my teeth being any whiter since I&#x27;ve been using this product, but I notice they are a lot smoother throughout the day than they used to be with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using my free Crest 3d white brilliance tooth paste and whitening gel from Buzzagent for just a couple of weeks and it is amazing. The results are great! You can really see the difference and it leaves your mouth feeling so clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some teeth sensitivity the first 2 days of using it that lasted just a few seconds after brushing. I had no other problems with it after that. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a whitening system that only involved toothpaste.  I was offered to try this for free from crest and I am glad I did.  I can see a major difference in the color of my teeth and it is very easy to use.  You don&#x27;t have to wait hours with whitening gel on your teeth like some other brands.  I would highly recommend this product. So glad I got to try it for free</li>
            <li> I am a coffee and tea drinker and have some staining in my teeth because of it. I was given this product by Crest to try for free and I am pretty impressed. Even after a few uses I noticed a whiter smile. The product is incredibly easy to use - just brush your teeth. The instructions are easy to understand to make sure you maximize your results. The only downside is my teeth can sometimes be sensitive, and using it twice a day aggravated my teeth a little. I would switch up with my normal sensitive toothpaste every few uses and they were fine. Overall an incredibly simple and effective way to whiten and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li> I received crest 3d white brilliance as part of a buzzkit to try out. My husband and I have been using it for a few weeks now and we can definitely see a difference in the color of our teeth. We both drink tea coffee and soda, so we are tough in our teeth. The only downfall would be the taste...it is not great. But I can tolerate the taste for the results!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I had high hopes for this product and was really excited to try it but I can only say that it was OK.  I would not spend $20 on it though if I had to purchase it.  I received my kit free through BuzzAgent so luckily I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.  I really loved how clean my teeth felt after using it, but I never saw any whitening after 2 weeks and have since gone back to using dissolving whitening strips once a day; which I feel work a lot better for the money.  So, if you are looking for the cleanest feeling teeth, then this product is for you; but if your looking for whitening I would try something else.</li>
            <li> Love this! I drink coffee daily and so does my husband. We both use this product. It really works!! The only downfall you still need to used toothpaste for a fresh clean feel. Doesnt substitute your toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this product for testing courtesy of Crest and Bzzagent. This is a 2 step system but I did like how you replace your normal teeth brushing routine with this...rather than waiting with a mouthful of whitening strips for an hour or so. Due to this, don&#x27;t expect results overnight....it is a gradual effect.  But it did work effectively for me and I drink coffee and diet cola everyday.  I did not experience any tingling or sensitive teeth which is another benefit of whitening gradually.  Another pro, the price is great!!  I did receive mine free as a sample but I saw the price of this on Amazon and would easily pay this.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t expect it to whiten overnight.  I agree with other reviewers....this would be great as an addition after you have whitened your teeth to use as a maintenance effort.</li>
            <li> I regularly use a whitening toothpaste and felt like my teeth were pretty white. I started using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system and realized how much whiter my teeth could be. It even whitened the edges on the top and bottom which my other toothpaste wasn&#x27;t working on. The two step system only requires 2 minutes of brushing, which you should be doing already anyways, and is not messy like trays and whitening strips that take 30 minutes to work.  The toothpaste flavor is good too and doesn&#x27;t burn or make my teeth sensitive. This is a product I can definitely recommend. The picture on top shows my before and the one on bottom is after using this system. You can see the edges of my teeth are much whiter in the bottom picture and my teeth are just whiter over all. I got to try this product for free as a Bzz agent thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> There is very little foaming that occurs when using it and the flavor isn&#x27;t anything spectacular. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the color of my teeth. This may be due to the fact that I have always used a whitening toothpaste and my teeth aren&#x27;t all that discolored to begin with. It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking to brighten your teeth a bit and don&#x27;t like the strips. This product was received as part of a promotion from the brand and was intended for me to test and review.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this product complementary through BuzzAgent to sample it and share my honest opinion. I have had my fair share of whitening products (especially after having braces back in the day). This product is awesome and only takes 2 minutes to use. I have not experienced any sensitivity in my teeth but have noticed that my teeth are whiter than when I started using this product daily. This is one of the more inexpensive whitening options that I have found, so it really is a great deal! I recommend that you try this product because it won&#x27;t make your teeth any more yellow that they are!</li>
            <li> I received a box of the Credt 3D whitening system and I was already kind of skeptical. I have used whitening products in the past with not much luck. But since Crest sent me it for free I said why not! I had my fianc&amp;eacute; try it out with me. After using it for several weeks, along with my Sonicare toothbrush, I must say I like it. I really noticed a difference in my teeth coloration. But where I really saw it was in my fianc&amp;eacute;!!! He is an occasional smoker so his teeth are more dis colored than mine. But after several weeks using the product his teeth were looking healthy and glowing!!!!! I would recommended this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for roughly four weeks. While I may not be able to definitively say my teeth look whiter, I can say they definitely feel cleaner. This is a 2 step process. You brush for on minute with the purple bottle, followed but brushing for another minute with the whitener. You do not rinse your mouth in between, but you can spit it out. It does not specify to wait any moment of time to eat or drink. I like this tooth paste but at the same time, the two step part isn&#x27;t the most convenient. I was also hoping for a noticeably whiter smile, but I&#x27;m not convinced it showed up yet. I did get this product to test for free.</li>
            <li> I am a huge coffee drinker. I typically drink 2-3 cups a day to survive life with my 3 kids. As a result, my teeth have been tainted. I was given the opportunity to test this product at no cost and thought it was worth a shot. This product actually helped! I wouldn&#x27;t say they are pearly white, but they are much brighter than they were before using this product. I&#x27;m hoping that they will continue to whiten!</li>
            <li> After a few days I tried this product through bzzagent and noticed a slight different. But after a month I noticed and even more significant difference. Definitely need to give it a chance. Won&#x27;t see drastic change overnight but if you use it for a few weeks you will definitely see and even feel a difference. My teeth feel cleaner than using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> L😍OVE THIS STUFF!!! This is the only toothpaste I will use!!! Step 1 REALLY cleans!!! I mean your mouth feels like you just left the dentist type of clean!!! Then after you are done with Step 1, do not rinse off your toothbrush. You don&#x27;t want water on your toothbrush because Step 2 is the whitening &amp; you want it to stick! So don&#x27;t rinse until you are all done brushing. I could tell a difference of whiter teeth the first time I used it! I always get compliments on how white my teeth are &amp; people think I get them professionally whitened!!! So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t worth the effort. Tasted terrible. Requires twice the brushing of similar products and yielded minimal results after weeks of use. Can not recommend.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am a cynic.  I never believed this stuff would work.  I honestly and truly saw a difference in two days.  There are no miracles here so far – I drink tea and cola all day long, both of which stain teeth yellow, but it definitely and noticeably began removing yellow in the first few uses.  I was astonished.  My teeth aren’t sparkling white, but I haven’t finished the total program yet, still have more than half a tube left, so I will update this later when I see the final results, but I just wanted to say it absolutely and quickly makes an obvious difference.  Can it totally remove many, many years of tea and cola stain?  Probably not, but I never expected it to.  I just wanted not to be so sunshine yellow, and it definitely has had an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive teeth, and it has not been painful.  Oddly, it hardly bothers my gums at all.  After a few uses, it did start to make my tongue and lips just a bit numb and tingly, but the sensation does not last long.  All I do then is skip a session or even a day, so it does not become an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not bad.  If you have ever had a sore in your mouth where you had to rinse your mouth with a hydrogen peroxide solution, it is a similar taste.  Not yummy, but easily tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my teeth feel very clean and smooth, almost like I just had a professional cleaning.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were very dark and very yellow because of all the cola and tea I drink all day long.  I had not used any whitening products in many years.  I had my teeth professionally “whitened” years ago, and it was a waste of money as it simply didn’t work.  It also caused extreme sensitivity and outright pain.  It totally turned me off the idea of trying whitening again, but, I started thinking there must have been some advancements in whitening since then, but I didn’t want to pay a lot to try one.  Using this Crest gel system was completely different and so much easier and less painful.  And it cost hundreds of dollars less than for the professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  It was easy, virtually painless, and I got almost immediate results.  Very pleased.  Why waste hundreds of dollars at the dentist?cost hundreds of dollars less than for the professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  It was easy, virtually painless, and I got almost immediate results.  Very pleased.  Why waste hundreds of dollars at the dentist?</li>
            <li> I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System free from the brand for my trial and review. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System does effectively keep my teeth clean throughout the day - and I say this because with brushing twice a day, my teeth feel smooth and free of plaque pretty much all day. I found this product easy to use. Per the instructions, you first brush for 1 minute with the Step 1 toothpaste (which is for deep cleaning). Then without rinsing, brush with the Step 2 whitening paste for 1 minute and rinse. Easy peasy, especially once you get used to the routine. In terms of taste, the cleansing toothpaste has a light mint taste which I am neutral about and the whitening paste tastes a bit like hydrogen peroxide - this didn&#x27;t really bother me too much either as I didn&#x27;t find the hydrogen peroxide taste overwhelming. After brushing with this system my teeth definitely felt smooth and free of plaque, which lasted throughout the day even after eating. I did like this product, but I took 1 star away since after 1 week of use I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in terms of teeth whiteness. I mean, no new stains/discoloration appeared so that&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not fully sold on the whitening function of this product.  So while I do enjoy Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for its ability to keep my teeth squeaky clean and based on this would repurchase this product, I&#x27;m still holding out hope that I will see whiter teeth with longer use of this system...</li>
            <li> This product is great. I got to try it for free thanks to Crest!  I wouldn&#x27;t use it as your main whitening product, however, as someone who has used Crest White Strips in the past, this has proved t be a fantastic way to keep up the effects of the strips. My teeth were fairly white when I began using the two-step system, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s initial whitening powers.  However, it has done a wonderful job of keeping my teeth white as I&#x27;ve yet to need whitening strips again. I&#x27;d recommend this to people that have teeth sensitivity issues as this doesn&#x27;t leave doesn&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive as strips have done to me in the past.  I also recommend this to someone that just needs a maintaining of their teeth shade!</li>
            <li> Simple 2-step process; brush with one, then polish with the other.  The results were nearly as good as whitening strips for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Less mess/time involved/discomfort/inability to speak than whitening strips&lt;br /&gt;Results nearly as good as whitening strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh:&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect to get the same results as you&#x27;d expect at the dentist&#x27;s office for whitening, though this is significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. This product is great! I have tried other whitening toothpaste but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System to test for free through Crest and BzzAgent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to start off by saying that I have tried several at home teeth whitening systems and have never been completely satisfied.  Either they don’t work, they are a huge hassle, or they take too much time and I end up giving up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the idea of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System since I’m already brushing my teeth anyway so there’s hardly any extra work to do at all.  The concept is you first brush your teeth with a deep cleansing toothpaste to clean your teeth and then brush with whitening finisher to polish and whiten.  Pretty simple and it only takes about five minutes.  I admit that the taste is not great but I didn’t really expect it to be and honestly it’s not as bad as some other teeth whitening products I’ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I’m sure you really want to know about is the results.  I’m a mom to young kids and I’ve probably been drinking a little too much coffee lately, so my teeth haven’t been as white as I would have liked before using this system.  I’ve used the product for about three weeks now and I admit I’ve noticed a big difference.  My teeth are definitely several shade whiter and my mom even asked if I’d just been to the dentist.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy, at-home teeth whitening system that really works!</li>
            <li> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Two Steps To A Whiter Smile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this 2 step system.These two products works really well at cleaning and whitening your teeth.It&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth.I followed all the instructions on the package and it works.First you brush with step 1,the toothpaste is minty thats really gets your teeth clean,then you move on to step 2 without rinsing,you apply the second product to your teeth and brush.It&#x27;s incredibly cooling and refreshing.After a week of use my teeth looked so much whiter.This is an amazing product that works with consistent use I love it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty sensitive, so I am always hesitant to try new whitening products, but I got to try this for free from BzzAgent so I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ll say this makes your teeth feel super clean! The step 1 tastes like the stuff they use at the dentist office, which was a little odd at first, but it really does make your teeth feel super clean! Step 2 tastes a little more like normal toothpaste, and both together leave your mouth feeling super super clean and fresh! I am a fan just for that!&lt;br /&gt;As far as whitening, it definitely helps. I am a regular wine drinker (red) so it helps reduce staining from that, as well as staining from my morning tea. Yay for cleaner teeth!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White definitely whitens your smile. I noticed a difference in my smile just after one brushing and my husband even made a comment about my teeth! I love the fact that you break up your time brushing your teeth with two different steps. Sometimes brushing your teeth for 2 minutes straight can become cumbersome and I feel like I often rush and don&#x27;t always last the whole 2 minutes. 1 minute for step 1 and another minute for step 2 makes brushing seem like a breeze. I think that the only downside to this toothpaste is that I didn&#x27;t really feel like my mouth was minty fresh after brushing. The minty fresh mouth is one of the characteristics that I look for in a good toothpaste. Overall though if you are looking for white teeth and don&#x27;t mind not having minty toothpaste this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying the product for free thanks to Crest® and bzzagent!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended not using it because it caused too much sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found it very tedious to have to switch midway from the toothpaste to the whitening gel. I would have prefer for this product to be combined in one, instead of the two different tubes.This toothpaste also gave me a terrible dry mouth after each use, very unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than other whitening products. Results will accumulate over time, and I hope effectiveness will increase. Taste is pretty good, with an aftertaste from #1 that is neutralized by #2. I like the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; of #2.</li>
            <li> I had staining on the bottom teeth, especially, because of a liquid medicine I was taking for a gum problem. The Crest 3D White cleaned and whitened my bottom teeth to a noticeable degree</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The first few days my gums had a stinging feeling.  It is gone now and my teeth are a lot whiter and feel very clean!</li>
            <li> really enjoyed using the new Crest two step system. My teeth feel healthier and a bit more white. I liked the taste and it left my mouth feeling clean all day. the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the cap on the polisher and the paste was a little runny. the mouth wash also worked great too, so fresh!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparking Clean!</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t feel like reading a long review:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really whitens&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing with a great taste&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t affect sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None, it&#x27;s great and does as claimed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Crest products and this is no different. Thanks to Crest and Bzzagent I was able to try the product for free! It&#x27;s really easy to use, you use the toothpaste for one minute, followed by the gel for one minute, then rinse. One thing I dislike about most whitening toothpastes is the nasty taste they have and the nasty aftertaste left in your mouth. This was not an issue with Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel system! This product doesn&#x27;t have that nasty taste when you use it. Not only does it whiten, but leaves you with the best fresh taste and breath! I used this product in conjunction with my Waterpik and I noticed a difference in whiteness after about a week. My teeth look and feel so clean! I would absolutely recommend this product! Also, my teeth can be sensitive at times with certain products and this wasn&#x27;t an issue with this product. My teeth never ached while using it. Overall, I really liked this product and was so glad I got to try it. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> While I was excited to try this product, I was disappointed at my results . I&#x27;m always looking for a way to brighten my smile and this seemed easy ,quick and economical . Will continue to use and finish the toothpaste to see if I have results in a month</li>
            <li> The 2 step system from Crest is convenient to use at home and works wonders for making one&#x27;s mouth feel clean and fresh. The 1-2 punch of the cleanser and polisher assure your teeth are squeaky clean like they feel after the dentist as week as brighter and whiter. There is a noticeable difference in look and feel almost immediately. Even better, the steps come in the same package, so no buying multiple products!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I used it as a part of the Shopper Army for a 2 week period. My teeth are whiter, brighter and have a dentist&#x27;s visit feel.</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my teeth feel. It makes them feel cleaner and whiter but.....my teeth are now very sensitive...I know it is the toothpaste trio doing this. I am very sad that it has to be a bad review. I like the product. But cannot stand how sensitive my teeth are now. I also cannot send a picture....I submerged my phone in water on accident and I am still waiting on a replacement! Thank you for letting me try this product and keep me in mind for future tries!!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. I was very skeptical about how well it would work but after a week I started noticing that my teeth were looking whiter. I was really surprised, but after 3 weeks they are looking even whiter! The system is easy to use, much better than the whitening strips or trays, and as quick as regular tooth brushing. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the taste of the gel (2nd step). If there was some way to improve that my rating would be 10/10.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly how it helped me but knowing that it could help the enamel on my teeth made it sound beneficial.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. The toothpaste has a pleasant peppermint flavor, and the combination of the two products together cleaned my teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  It worked easily and quickly without any irritation.  I recommend this highly.  So easy to use and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste but I did not enjoy it. There was too much of a mint flavor. The Step 2 product is really gooey. It also stings. I was unimpressed, and I don&#x27;t believe it lives up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I drink lots and lots of coffee. My teeth have never been totally white, even as a teenager. I liked the clean, fresh feeling left in my mouth after using the Crest 3D, but I saw only a very slight change in brightness or whiteness. Someone with less yellow or coffee stain could possibly have better results. I have sensitive teeth and use a special toothpaste for that purpose, so I probably will not purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> When I was getting ready for work the morning I used Crest 3D for the first time, I had to ask myself, &amp;#34;Did I brush my teeth this morning?&amp;#34; My teeth felt so clean, and my breath was so fresh after using Crest 3D White that it felt like I had just brushed! What else gives you that kind of clean?! Nothing I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use helped my teeth get whiter too. Not TV announcer white, but pretty good. I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it significantly whitened but I did see a slight difference and it certainly encouraged me to brush longer! It left a weird taste in my mouth I didn&#x27;t like and initially my teeth were sensitive but after a few uses were fine.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new tooth whitening paste. What I found to be the case is while my teeth didn&#x27;t digress from my previous whitening, they are not any whiter either. I also found it cumbersome to use two separate products, especially when running late in the morning.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is ok. I got a free sample of it from BzzAgent and my husband has been using it for about 6 weeks. I have used it off and on. I think my husband&#x27;s teeth look a little whiter, but he says he doesn&#x27;t see any difference. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with me, but I have not used it regularly because I have very sensitive teeth. The toothpaste itself doesn&#x27;t really bother my teeth (other whitening toothpastes do) but I felt like my teeth were more sensitive to eating when not using this toothpaste instead of a sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste and texture of the cleaning paste is fine. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I do not like the taste or texture of the whitening gel. Personally, I think this is just a marketing scheme to get users to use twice as much toothpaste. I most definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth any more money than any other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At first it was a little strange to get used to a 2 part system, but once I got the hang of it I liked it. It left your teeth feeling almost dental visit clean! When you get to stage 2 there is a little tingling feeling, and I thought it would leave my teeth feeling sensitive, but that&#x27;s all it was - a little tingling probably from the interaction of the 2 parts mingling in your mouth. Your mouth feels really clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free and pleased with overall how it worked.  It made a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth as indicated in the product description.  My only complaints are the taste and that it is a two step process.</li>
            <li> This product made my teeth brighter and whiter in the same amount of time as brushing with regular toothpaste. My teeth felt cleaner too.</li>
            <li> Too strong, left temporary white spots on my gums.</li>
            <li> Made  teeth feeling like they were dentist cleaned everyday.</li>
            <li> The steps are easy to follow, just adding one extra minute to the daily process of brushing my teeth. It took a day or two to remember not to rinse between the steps, and there is a definite tingle on the lips and gums from step 2. After several days I did experience whitening of the teeth, so the product has been successful for me. I especially like the way my mouth feels cleaner and fresher for a longer period of time than just brushing with toothpaste did. I do not particularly care for the taste of the step 2 gel, but following up with a mouthwash helps take care of that for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Dentist clean feeling after using!  I prefer to use it once a week to keep that clean feeling going between visits to the dentist but daily use irritated my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I used this product thrice and the second tube caused me to gag each time-cannot use it safely-I really tried...&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> gave me fresh clean breath and suprisingly noticed my teeth looking less dinghy</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this product when I first started using it. I&#x27;m not sure if I was brushing too vigorously or wasn&#x27;t used to brushing for so long, but I had sore gums at first. Small parts of my gums even temporarily turned white (from the bleaching whitener?) I was only using the system once a day since it seemed to irritate my gums, but since I&#x27;ve started brushing more gently I haven&#x27;t noticed a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Now the good news- I&#x27;m still only using this toothpaste/whitening system once a day and have noticed a dramatic difference in my teeth. They look whiter and brighter, and I noticed a difference after only a few uses. The instructions say to use the product twice a day for best results, and I can only imagine the whitening you would see. I&#x27;m happy with the results I am seeing by using at night with my normal Crest toothpaste in the mornings, and I like that this is easier and less time consuming than the whitening strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this whitening system for review from BzzAgent. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I normally use Aquafresh deep cleaning toothpaste but once the Crest toothpaste arrived, I switched. The Crest took a little getting used to because it was rather abrasive on my gums at first. But the more I used it the less it hurt. In fact my teeth actually stayed and felt clean ALL day. With my old toothpaste, my teeth and gums would feel dirty and gross shortly after I ate something. I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old toothpaste again!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> What a find! I am thrilled with this duo, and shocked by just how effective it is. I could see a marked difference in the shade of my teeth, within several days of use. Since we all brush our teeth anyway (I hope), it is not an additional step in your routine, which is a total bonus! As someone who wants to maintain a white smile, but not a huge fan of the cost of strips or professional systems, I am officially planning on using this system regularly, to maintain my pearly whites! I was provided free product to review, by Crest, but all views are my own.</li>
            <li> After using Crest 3D Brilliance toothpaste for 2 weeks, my teeth were whiter and cleaner than ever before. This tooth paste is definitely better than any other that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I tested this product for Shopper Army.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were whiter after just one use. I was so surprised! Strips and trays that I&#x27;ve used in the past also offer quick results, but this product was easier to use AND contributed to my dental health. The first step paste made my teeth and mouth feel squeaky clean (though it did take my gums a couple of days to get used to the formula-I normally use toothpastes for sensitive teeth). The second step paste tasted different than most toothpastes taste but is not unpleasant. I like the idea of polishing my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this product for me are that it is easy to use and yields quick results while not exacerbating my tooth sensitivity. It also makes me more mindful of my dental health: the instructions say to brush with each of the two pastes for one minute and I am now definitely brushing for the amount of time that dentist&#x27;s recommend! Occasionally this process got tedious when I was dying to crawl into bed, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for brighter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t know that I would use this product 365 days a year, but I would definitely use this system at least twice a year to brighten my teeth. I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> No other toothpaste has ever made me feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning. You get to feel this every single day with this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I love this product, I didn&#x27;t get movie star white teeth, but I did improve my smile. My teeth feel fantastic, better than after the dentist cleans them. My smile is brighter and my teeth shine. I definitely will buy this product. I didn&#x27;t mind the brush time or the taste after the first use. Great product! Thanks for letting me try it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my teeth are a little whiter so I rated this product an 8. Given my age times a cup of coffee a day and several glasses of tea equals to 94524257822466 cups of staining liquid that have drenched my teeth in for over five decades and Crest 3D White was able to make them a bit whiter and not so yellow. I had no sensitivity issues and no irritation whatsoever. All in all I had a very pleasant experience with this product.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work too well for me. My teeth do not seem to change color with any whitening products including professional. For me having to basically brush my teeth twice seems to take too much time. Though for someone who using whitening products all the time this would probably be a great product&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I definitely had a reaction, I think to the polishing stuff. Even before that though I didn&#x27;t think this was something I would use...the two part process is more than I would incorporate daily; I didn&#x27;t like the taste of either and then of course I had some kind of reaction-allergic or just irritation, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I do not usually use Crest Products and will not be using this one in the future either. I did not mind the 2 step system but I found it a bit annoying that the tubes were different. I preferred the flip top tube to the capped tube. I did see some whitening. I also felt that my teeth were well polished, clean, and shiny. However, the toothpaste is very abrasive. I found my teeth and gums to be more sensitive with use. I would also question the safety of long term use and the effects on the enamel. I also was not happy with the chemicals and ingredients in these products.</li>
            <li> I was able try this product at no cost thanks to Bzzagent, but this opinion is all my own. I think this is a very good concept, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the past month since using this. It is a lot less harsh on your teeth then other whitening products, and leaves your mouth extremely clean. With just those two point, it makes it totally worth it. I plan on using this for some more time, but as of right now I am not seeing much change in color.</li>
            <li> Not only did I love this product but it made my mouth feel so clean and energized! It&#x27;s wonderful and it&#x27;s smile-verous (my new word for it). I would buy this product above all others and hope my friends will like it too.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any benefits from the short time use from using this product, I used it for the full 4 week period and I found using the product tedious. Other whitening products are a single step easy, simple, and done. I also found the second step to taste horribly and the consistency not so good. However, it did somewhat written my teeth but not significantly enough to where I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product through Amazon, though I shop Amazon all the time and love the site. Amazon does have a fair price on this product as well. I received this free to try in the mail from bzzagent. Overall I am impressed with this product and give it 4 stars. I waited to review it till I could be sure of the results. It is a simple two step process. It does not hurt or cause discomfort really. Once I applied too much product and hurt my gums but that was fully my fault and was fine to continue two days later. It really does help to whiten the teeth, now not everyone has strong white teeth to start with, so not everyone will get movie star WHITE, I was one of those people. However it did improve my teeth and will yours if you keep your expectations realistic.</li>
            <li> I received this for free for review purposes from bzzagent, all options are my own though.What a great product, I am so incredibly lucky to have gotten this to review! I knew that I would love it, because I have used the crest 3D products in the past, and have also used the toothpaste booster as well, so this was perfect as it is very easy, and more convenient because they come as a set. It is priced at around $15 in most stores, and in my opinion I feel that it is worth it. This product has some pretty big claims that definitely set the bar as how to how well it was supposed to perform. It claims that it deep cleans, and keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish. Like I said that’s a big claim, and didn’t know if it would live up to that. There is a 4 step process with this kit, but it’s not difficult to get in the habit of doing it daily, it was easy for me to adapt to, as with anything it works best when you follow the directions, and use the products correctly. The steps will be listed below. I love this kit, and definitely will be purchasing when this one is done, I really do think it works well at whitening, and brightening my smile. I am lucky because I have abnormally white teeth already, due to not drinking coffee, tea, wine, or smoking, yeah right? But this definitely made my pearly whites a few shades brighter, and I am very happy, and loving the results! I definitely think you should give this a try or any of the crest 3D products!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, with that being said, I have really enjoyed using the product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two steps to this system and it recommends brushing for one minute with each tube. Brushing for two minutes isn&#x27;t too hard, but if you are a quick brusher then this might not be the best product for you. Being a teacher and the school year just starting up, I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee than usual. I think this system has really helped maintain the whiteness of my teeth that I have achieved through using whitening strips. Another plus about this system is that my teeth feel really clean...almost as clean as they are after I have just left the dentist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback with this system is that I don&#x27;t always have time to use it. If I am feeling extra rushed in the morning then I skip this system and use my normal toothpaste. If you have a busy schedule and don&#x27;t think you can devote the little bit of extra time to using this system, then you might be better off using another whitening system.</li>
            <li> I was Leary at first because adding an extra step to anything seems just dumb. I did like the kit even though it was an extra step it seemed to clean my teeth better and it wasn&#x27;t as harsh as other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried. With other whiteners my teeth felt extremely sensitive the next few days but not with this kit. I recommend giving it a try. BTW- I got this item for Free from Crest</li>
            <li> I started using mine a week ago. It&#x27;s important to follow instructions: brush with the purple one for a minute, and then spit but don&#x27;t rinse, then brush with the white one for a minute and then rinse. I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are at least one shade whiter, but it&#x27;s only been a week so I&#x27;ll keep at it. I did notice, troublingly, that a tiny portion of my gums (the part right where my front two teeth meet) turned WHITE one day after I brushed. I thought something was stuck there but it was my gums. THe same happened on teh bottom. I panicked and thought I&#x27;d discontinue use for sure, but then later when I was driving to work I noticed that the discoloration was gone. So I bet that was just the hydrogen peroxide in teh formula. Maybe it was too concentrated or just hit that area wrong? I don&#x27;t know; totally not a chemist. But it was a little concerning. It went away, and my teeth are a smidge whiter (not a huge coffee drinker but I will have 2-3 cups of coffee per week), so I think I will keep using it and maybe my teeth will get whiter. Also, I should note that I got this product for free with BzzAgent and am reviewing it as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It started to whiten Great but it hurt my gums really bad I do have sensitive gums and teeth so wan&#x27;t for me but was starting to whiten good</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to test out the Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free. After using the product for several weeks, I can say, without a doubt, this is the best at-home whitening system I have ever tried. Each time I use the system, my teeth feel like they do after a professional cleaning at a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other at-home whitening kits are cumbersome and take a really long time to apply and to see results. This product literally takes 2 minutes and is just as easy as brushing your teeth. I took a before and after photo the very first time I used the 3D White Brilliance Daily cleansing system, and I immediately saw major results! If you don&#x27;t believe me, see the picture I attached! The results are stunning and I can&#x27;t believe that it was just after one use! I&#x27;ve continued using the system and my teeth have never been whiter.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity of testing a full size sample of this product thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent. I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to my teeth &amp; which products I use on them so I was excited to try this out. I&#x27;ve used other whitening products in the past and haven&#x27;t always liked them. It&#x27;s a two step process- first you brush with the deep cleansing toothpaste &amp; then you spit (but do not rinse!) and use the whitening finisher. Now that I have used the product for about a month I can say I throughly love it! At first I was afraid that using a whitening product would make my already sensitive teeth MORE sensitive but I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in sensitivity! I can eat &amp; drink hot &amp; cold things like I normally would. I also worried that using the two products would slow my morning routine down but really it hasn&#x27;t &amp; I now automatically reach for the tube of the whitening finisher. As a person who drinks coffee &amp; tea daily I like the fact that not only am I cleaning my teeth but I&#x27;m also helping to whiten them daily. Two thumbs up for this GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to try the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System compliments of Crest and BzzAgent!  I was a bit skeptical at first, because I have used whitening toothpastes before that were worthless.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  My teeth are noticeably whiter!  The other problem that I had with past products was that I was concerned that my teeth were not being adequately cleaned.  With the 2 step process, I have no doubts that my teeth are being properly cleaned. The step 1 product is similar to other Crest mint toothpastes and the step 2 product is a gel product that tastes like hydrogen peroxide.  Getting used to a 2 step process takes some time, but the system doesn’t really take up much more time than a traditional 2 minute brush.  I have an electronic toothbrush that is on a 2 minute timer and beeps on 30 second intervals.  Therefore, it is easy for me.  On the second beep, I apply the step 2 product.  It takes me mere seconds more to use this system. Overall, I love this product and would definitely purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> I used this product that was given to me as a free trial and liked it. I expected my teeth to be whiter but found that was not really the case. I think it may have whitened them a little and I definitely see the difference with my caps. The taste is a little strong but I think you get use to it after a few days. I will continue to use the product until it is finished because who knows maybe it will still whiten my teeth. I do think the product is a good product&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D Brilliance through BzzAgent and was very eager to try it. As a treat to myself since I stopped smoking 4 years ago, I&#x27;ve gotten my teeth professionally whitened once a year. I usually get the one hour Zoom whitening done at my dentists office, and with regular cleanings, I consider myself  to have an average shade of white teeth. I haven&#x27;t gotten my whitening done in over a year, so I was eager to try this product at home and see if it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I drink A LOT of tea. Herbal tea, iced tea, black tea...you name it, I drink it. I&#x27;m kind of a tea fanatic, which is no Bueno for my chompers. I definitely have a little bit of tea staining on my teeth, but nothing terribly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have extremely sensitive teeth. Anything too cold or too sweet immediately sets my nerves on end (literally). I was apprehensive about using a whitening product without the &amp;#34;sensitivity gel&amp;#34; that my dentist will give me to use afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, my mother and I both tried the regimen, and had slightly different findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the regimen for about 2 weeks, and honestly didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. My teeth might have been one shade whiter, but nothing really noticeable. I felt that the taste of the product was very tolerable, unlike other whitening toothpastes, but it did make my gums very sensitive, and I stopped using it after 2 weeks. I would probably not use this product on a regular basis because of the sensitivity issues, but it might be okay for use along with a sensitivity toothpaste as well. I will say that after using the toothpaste, my teeth were VERY shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother on the other hand had pretty stellar results with the regimen. She is staying the summer with me and has been using the 3D White twice daily for the last 2 weeks. She smokes, drinks coffee, and drinks tea. She has some moderate staining on her teeth. After 2 weeks of consistent use, her teeth are at LEAST 4 shades whiter. She also suffered with a tinge of sensitivity, but after switching to a softer toothbrush than her regular one, said that the sensitivity has lessened significantly. She thinks that at the regular price of around $15, she would continue to use it as a regular toothpaste if her dentist recommended her to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few last thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;We both had some concern about long term use as an everyday toothpaste. Is it safe? Will it do any damage to your teeth long term? We would not use this on a regular basis without a dentist recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;We both had slight sensitivity issues, but for her it was not enough to stop. For me, it was.&lt;br /&gt;We both felt that anyone who brushes their teeth for a minimum of 2 minutes each time they brush will likely see at least some kind of whitening regardless of the brand. I know I&#x27;m not in the minority here when I admit that I don&#x27;t ALWAYS brush for a full 2 minutes 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this whitening toothpaste could really benefit those who have moderate to severe staining on their teeth, but I&#x27;m not sure those who don&#x27;t have significant staining will see much of a result. If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive alternative to whitening and have a few weeks to allow the changes to take place, this is the product for you! If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix, or need a deep whitening, then this is probably not your best bet.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I can whiten my teeth without gel tape that felt weird or trays that felt uncomfortable. I was able to whiten my teeth just by brushing them. Though it may take a little longer than normal brushing, since you are using a two step process, I found that it really helped me to brush while watching tv....I even found I brushed longer, because of the distraction. I really liked that.</li>
            <li> I received this kit free from Bzzagent. I tried it for two weeks and I didn&#x27;t like it at all. My teeth didn&#x27;t look any whiter after two weeks. It was completely cumbersome to use. You had to brush with each gel for 1 minute without rinsing in between. I felt it was messy.  In addition, my normally non-sensitive teeth and gums were suddenly cut up and sensitive after using this product.  Overall, I was very unhappy and will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> In just two weeks time there was a remarkable whitening of my teeth and I enjoyed the refreshing feeling in my mouth following the daily cleansing system. I would highly recommend the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System. Try it..you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for about 10 days and I am very impressed with the results!  I usually use a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste, so I assumed any difference would be minimal.  The instructions also gave me the impressions that it would take about a week to have visible differences.  Well, I noticed after day 1 that my teeth were much shinier - like after a cleaning.  After Day 3, I could tell that my smile was brighter.  The two step process means you are going to spend a couple of minutes brushing.  I thought that would be tedious, but it was actually great.  My teeth, my whole mouth feels very fresh and clean all day - and the brighter smile is great too!  I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort like I&#x27;ve had with strip type whiteners.  My mouth actually feels healthier rather than more sensitive!  I received the whitening system to try for free from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product makes a real difference on your mouth feeling fresh and whiter teeth.  The difference can be seen  after  about two weeks.  I would say the only minor drawbacks for this product is the tube for the whitener is a little harder to squeeze out and the  taste is not the most optimal. The upswing from this product clearly out ways the few minor flaws of this great new product</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White is overall a good product. Although it didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth a great deal, my teeth and mouth almost always felt extra clean. I did have a problem, though, with the second step, the gel, making my gums sensitive after repeated use. After having used the product twice a day for three days, my gums started to bleed a bit when I brushed. I cut back to once a day, which helped. I can&#x27;t see this product being good for extended use, but I might see myself using it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this product, which I received as a trial from Crest.  I have been looking for a brighter smile but didn&#x27;t want to pay for anything too costly.  Have tried the whitening strips in the past but the upkeep and cost was too much.  This product did not disappoint!!  Within a week I could see a difference in my teeth brightness.  Kind of a hassle that its a 2 step system and the taste of the whitening product is not great.  Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:  3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth didn&#x27;t look whiter to me, however I used Crest 3D White once a day not twice as directed. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the 2-step process. My mouth didn&#x27;t feel fresh or minty when I was done brushing. All in all, I&#x27;d say this product is not for me. Target&#x27;s ad in Sunday&#x27;s paper pictured Crest [HD]. I wonder if that&#x27;s a replacement for the product I tried or a totally new product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I liked this concept of a toothpaste and a gel whitener that is not a strip, a gel that I brush on my teeth works so much better for me. Ease of use is paramount, this product surprised me because it did work, and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Although I did see an improvement I the color of my teeth, the surprising part was how clean my teeth actually felt. Not only did I get the initial clean feeling, they stayed clean throughout the day. I had no plaque build-up. What a nice feeling😊 . The only down side is it may be a little strong for some to use twice a day. I personally used it once a day because it felt a little harsh when used twice.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission)</li>

I would not buy this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;nasty taste</li>
            <li> At first I thought the product might be too time consuming with multiple steps, but it ended up working out really well. I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day due to sensitivity in the past, but so far I haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or discomfort. I plan to slowly increase to the recommended twice a day to see if it improves the whitening results. Definitely ended up with a clean pearly whites!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I found this product worked to some extent but not as fully as I had hoped. The taste was a bit strong, but I got accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> During the first few days, I saw no significant changes. However, my mouth felt very clean after each treatment. I was hopeful, but didn&#x27;t expect the results I would eventually receive. The toothpaste has a good taste and is no more abrasive than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried. The polish has no aftertaste and gives my teeth a high-gloss shine. After using the product for two weeks, I can see an incredible difference in the brightness of my smile. I will continue using this every day, as part of my oral hygiene regimen.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>

            <li> My new smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my whitening kit, my first thought was, this must be really expensive. That made me more excited that I received it for free! I have never been a fan of those whitening strips, too much trouble. The first time I used my kit, my initial reaction was &amp;#34;this is like a car wash for my mouth!&amp;#34; I noticed immediate results. After the first week and a half, I did notice a little tenderness in my gums above my top two front teeth. This did subside though. I really don&#x27;t like the flavor of step one but step 2 makes that all better. Also, I love the Crest mouthwash that I received. I have always disliked mouthwashes, (hate that medicine taste) but I must say I actually enjoy using this mouthwash! I have always big a Crest fan, now I like them even more! The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 10 stars is not liking the taste if step one. Thank you Crest and Shoppers Army for improving my smile!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission]</li>
            <li> I really liked the Crest 3D White toothpaste overall - I&#x27;ve tried the Crest Whitestrips in the past, but it was always such a pain to set aside time for the strips in addition to my regular oral care routine. What I like about this product is that it effectively whitens in the time that I would already spend brushing my teeth anyway. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of the product - it felt sort of &#x27;chalky&#x27; and I prefer a more traditional minty toothpaste flavor - but my mouth did feel exceptionally clean after using the product, which I really liked. Overall, definitely a winner!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product. While I did not experience any actual whitening of my teeth, I did like the clean look and feel, and they did seem to be brighter. I cannot say I recommend it for whitening because of my experience, but I will certainly recommend it for clean, fresh teeth. I found the taste to be pleasant in both the toothpaste and the whitener. I would definitely use these products if the cost is not prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Loved this product; simple and efficient way to get my teeth clean and white. Found that the two-step system also encouraged me to brush for 2 minutes like dentists recommend.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This is the first teeth whitening product I have ever used, and I can&#x27;t compare it to any other whitening product out in the market. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and I do see a slight difference. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to happened, but the inside of my mouth felt weird afterwards. Overall, this product is great. Thanks Bzzagent for allowing me to try out this product</li>
            <li> The two part system was easy to use and took no longer than my regular daily dental routine. While I thought I saw a bit of whitening, my dentist (I saw him before and after) didn&#x27;t notice a change. The taste was ok but not bright enough for me. The results were marginal&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Start with the cleaning product: Crisp, clean, pleasant tasting paste with no burning or unpleasant mouth feelings. And running your tongue over your teeth (the acid test for clean) is a pleasure. Now, the whitening product: Easy to apply without an extensive waiting time for the finish + no icky taste that makes one want to spit it all out and quit! After you rinse and see the kind of sparkling teeth shining back at you, a big smile is all you can do. My teeth weren&#x27;t very stained, so I had almost immediate results. Heavy smokers or wine drinkers probably would have to use somewhat longer for the same results. But the product(s) work well. And as my title indicates, beat paying a dentist for whitening by $$$$. I&#x27;ll recommend to anyone I hear talking about tooth strains or whitening anytime.&lt;br /&gt;[You can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found this product to be an easy way to polish my teeth. It didn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing with my normal toothpaste to use, but my teeth felt smooth and clean all day long.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product my first thoughts were &#x27;what a pain this is going to be&#x27;. With two tubes, ugh, who has time? But once you get the system down it goes quickly. The one thing I would change is that Step 2 needs a flip top cap!! it is kind of hard to hold an already used toothbrush in one hand and try to get the cap off with the other. You have to open the tube before starting. Would just be easier to have a flip cap. The system whitened my teeth I guess as much as they are going to whiten. I noticed a good improvement and I am happy with it. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the taste at first but got accustomed to it. Could be a little more minty. The only thing negative I noticed is that after rinsing after step 2 the inside of my lips and mouth felt very very dry. Not enough to make me stop using the product but not a pleasant feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was part of a group that studied this product.  It really whitened my teeth in a few short weeks.  I found I concentrated on really brushing my teeth for the entire length of time.  The only downside I found was it was a little drying to the mouth but otherwise my teeth whitened up and felt clean.</li>
            <li> Too strong. Dried out my mouth and irritated the roof of my mouth.</li>

            <li> This product was okay. I did enjoy the taste and smell of the product and it cleaned really well!</li>
            <li> Pretty great. I didn&#x27;t realize I had any plaque before trying this product. I originally bought it to whiten my teeth as they are a little stained just through all the sodas, coffees and teas that I drink. I find that the ingredients in the gel are very similar if not identical to the ingredients in the white strips.The toothpaste really adheres to your teeth and you can feel it not come off as easy as other toothpastes. I have sensitive teeth and this does not bother my teeth half as much as other whitening products. Easy to use, just brush them on.. I brush twice a day anyways, might as well use this! I prefer this over other whitening treatments. I have been using for a month or so now and my teeth are a shade whiter. It isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it works! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks in another month!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product complimentary of Crest but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> love the ease ans results of this product.</li>
            <li> This product is not for anyone with sensitive teeth.  My second use cause extreme sensitivity for 3 days.  I do have confidence in this product, just use extreme caution if you have sensitive teeth.  My sensitivity is only during cleaning, not to hot or cold.</li>
            <li> I really think that my teeth are getting a lot whiter from this Crest 3D White and I haven&#x27;t had any crazy effects happen to my teeth&#x27;s sensitivity or enamel that I&#x27;ve felt or witnessed! Overall I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it and loved being able to talk about my personal trials!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>

            <li> The 2 steps crest system works very well, however I found that it is very harsh on my teeth and gums. The 1st step tasted like poison even though you have to spit it out and I think that the 2nd step should have been better tasting also, it was bland at best.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The product was really easy to use and didn&#x27;t take much time to use. However, after using it 5 times (not even consecutively) I developed an extreme sensitivity in 2 teeth that is still present 2 week later (but it is getting better). I did not notice any whitening, but I did only use it 5 days. If you don&#x27;t/never had had any problems with tooth sensitivity, this is probably a really good product however.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I loved this product as I saw that my teeth were whiter after using. I loved that I could use it and just leave the house and not have to worry about walking around at home with strips on my teeth. Whitening strips usually irritate my gums and this product did not irritate my teeth or gums at all!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I really liked the clean, polished feeling this left me with; like coming home from a professional cleaning. Whitening though? I&#x27;m not really sure to be honest with you. I posted my before and 1 week photos on Facebook and others said they saw a difference, but I&#x27;m really not sure. I still have product left and will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it every day, regularly. I think this would be great to use in its entirety once every six months, maybe to maintain the results of a professional cleaning. I feel this way because I&#x27;m guessing this system is more costly than regular toothpastes, so it would be more cost effective that way. There is also the lip/cheek tingling that took some getting used to, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want that every day for the rest of my life. Overall, really liked it. One suggestion: add a label warning against consuming yogurt immediately after use. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Lots of effort for an average product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always up for an easy way to whiten teeth so I was eager to try this product. Especially since it&#x27; so Crest product; it&#x27;s already got creds. I wasn&#x27;t that excited to have to time my brushing, but it was manageable, especially with the hope of whiter teeth. Despite my diligence I have noticed no discernible change in the whiteness of my teeth. The taste was okay and I did notice a bit of sensitivity upon continued use. The mouthwash left a horrible taste in my mouth that spoiled the taste of food and beverages for hours after use. I stopped the mouthwash after 3 days. Still using the toothpaste though.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I had a positive experience using this product. My teeth were slightly sensitive at first, but I began to notice a vast improvement in the first 3 days of using this product. I was impressed that I could noticeably see a difference without looking at a before and after photo of myself.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about whitening with this two step system from Crest. I have some stains from coffee and wine that I would love to see whitened. On the first day of use I could tell that my teeth felt ultra-smooth and polished. The taste was fine too. On the second day of use I noticed that my teeth were feeling more sensitive. I was previously using a sensitive toothpaste before switching to the Two Step system. On the third day I knew that due to increasing sensitivity I would not be able to continue with this product. I wish I could have continued on to see the whitening power of Crests Two Step System.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This is a very good product; however, since it is a lengthly multi-step process, it is best to do this right before bed.  They only change I would make to this product is to remove the extreme dry mouth feeling that appears after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free from Crest through the BzzAgent program. The free product did not affect my opinions of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used a different Crest whitening system prior to this one and I think this one is much better. The first thing I noticed was that the step one toothpaste had a pretty good flavor, unlike the other system I had tried. Overall, this has done a pretty job of whitening my teeth. I&#x27;m a regular coffee drinker and have been using this system for about two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth do look whiter. They also feel incredibly clean after brushing with this system. I did have a slight burning sensation on my gums once or twice while using this, but not so much as to dissaude me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great whitening system, especially considering how inexpensive it is!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System complementary from Crest.  I have used the product for several weeks and enjoy it.  It makes my teeth feel super clean and I have noticed a bit of whitening.  I have fairly sensitive teeth and this product has not bothered them.  It&#x27;s a simple two step system that you do twice daily.  Step one you brush with (with out rinsing) and then brush with step two and rinse after.  I would recommend it for someone who is afraid to use the whitening strips due to sensitivity (like me).</li>
            <li> Love love this product, no dentist needed</li>
            <li> Yesterday I had my semi-annual dental appointment. My hygienist&#x27;s first comment was &amp;#34;Wow, your teeth look great; what have you been doing?&amp;#34; I explained I had been using Crest 3D White. My teeth were noticeably whiter and coffee stain non-existent! The cleaning was a snap as plaque was not an issue either. Yea CREST!!!&lt;br /&gt;When you dentist notices a remarkable difference you know it&#x27;s working!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Let me just say AMAZING! The tooth paste leaves your teeth feeling super clean then the second step for whitening just adds to the beautiful smile, it amazes me how much whiter my smile is in just 4 days of twice a day use!&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a trial from bzzkit and love it!!</li>
            <li> I was wanting to get porcelain laminates for my teeth after years of smoking and coffee. (I quit smoking 4 years ago btw) after a week of this product I can&#x27;t even begin to explain the difference. It&#x27;s fantastic if I hadn&#x27;t cracked my front tooth yesterday I would be posting pictures. I absolutely love this and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;(I did also receive it as part of a promotion but love it so much!! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more when it&#x27;s gone!)</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White helped my smile to be brighter.After using crest my teeth look a lot whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for a few weeks now, at first I really didnt care for the taste or smell, they were a tad strong for me. I think its not the best tasting toothpaste, but it gets the job done. Since using it, Ive noticed a significant improvement in the color/shade of my teeth. Particularly after using it for 1 week, I compared side by side photos and my teeth looked brighter, cleaner, and felt smoother. Its very easy to use even though it comes in a set of 2. You simply dont rinse after step 1, but you rinse after using the second toothpaste (step 2). Its much more convenient than using whitestrips or gels to whiten your teeth, and it takes just as long as it takes you to brush your teeth. I will continue using it and purchase it again when I need extra pearly whites. I did receive this product free to test through Crest, but this review is based on my opinion and experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D Brilliance Cleansing system for free thanks to Crest. Having recently got my adult braces off, I have been on a constant search for a quick, inexpensive whitening system. I&#x27;ve used whitening strips in the past but found the price, length of time it takes, and an issue with sensitivity to be against me. I&#x27;ve also tried the Crest HD system. While the HD system is similar, I received amazingly better results with the 3D Brilliance System. The 3D Brilliance kit contains two tubes. First is a Deep Cleansing toothpaste that you use for one minute. Then without rinsing, you follow up with tube 2 which is a whitening finisher. I found the first step to be tolerable. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning or stinging due to sensitivity. It does seem to make my mouth somewhat dry but other than that it was not difficult. The second step is the polisher and this used in conjunction with a power brush is where the magic happens! Be careful around your gum line as white splotches can appear if you hold your brush there too long. (these fade away after a few minutes) I again did not experience any ill affects with step two. After both steps, I found my mouth to feel completely clean and fresh. There was a noticeable difference in the whiteness after the first use that just got better with each additional use. I find that if I use the 3D Brilliance kit at night and my 3D white in the am, it&#x27;s the perfect combination. In conclusion, I believe the 3D Brilliance kit is an excellent kit and has the same if not better results than whitening strips or an office whitening system.</li>
            <li> I love the new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System! I received this system free to try from Crest. In just a few short weeks of using the system twice a day in place of my normal toothpaste, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic improvement in the color of my smile! My results have been the same as the whitening strips, but without the sensitivity or need to leave anything on for long periods of time. This system is as easy as brushing your teeth, and provides even better results than more tedious options. Great product!</li>
            <li> I drink tea and have not been able to use whitening toothpaste in a long time because my teeth are so sensitive so my teeth are definitely not pearly white!  Bzzzagent sent me this duo to try and it has been amazing!  No increased sensitivity and the shade of my teeth after just a couple of weeks is unbelievable!  This works much better than the strips and is comparable to what you would get from your dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing and Whitening System for the past two weeks since I received it from BzzAgent and Crest for free to try and provide feedback. I am reviewing based on my initial reactions and will update my review after continued use. The system is comprised of two products. Step 1 is for for deep cleaning and Step 2 is a polishing/whitening agent. You use each step for one minute; spit after Step 1 but do not rinse. Step 1 seemed like regular toothpaste and had a similar &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; It did not seem to get very bubbly. I prefer a toothpaste with more &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; because I feel like I get a better clean. With that said, however, I do feel like my teeth are cleaner than with my previous toothpaste. I also was not a fan of the &amp;#34;not rinsing&amp;#34; aspect before brushing with step 2. Gross. Step 2 didn&#x27;t taste great but was much better than the traditional strips. You could faintly smell/taste the hydrogen peroxide but it was ok. The second time I used the product I could feel a slight tingling but no sensitivity which was nice. I did &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like it was working. Pros so far: motivates me to brush for a full 2 minutes and twice a day, not bad tasting, gentle whitening, not messy, not an extra product or time spent (just usual teeth brushing which you should be doing anyway. Cons: toothpaste doesn&#x27;t get bubbly, whitening effects are gradual and not immediate, not supposed to rinse in between steps.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think that there would be any difference in using this product compared to regular whitening toothpaste but I was wrong. I received the product from bzz agent.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in my teeth after just a few uses. i have tried white strips in the past but did not like the feeling of tooth sensitivity so I would discontinue after only a few days. However, white this toothpaste I get the same results without the sensitivity. Plus it&#x27;s easy to remember to whiten because you aren&#x27;t going to forget to brush your teeth. I got my first trial for free but I plan on purchasing this as a daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product for free through BzzAgent and loved it! I will definitely buy more of this product. I have very sensitive teeth that can&#x27;t handle much whitening, but this product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least bit! Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent. I have been using it for a few weeks.  It has whitened my teeth slightly.  The first step tastes ok, the 2nd step dries my mouth and makes my skin &amp; gums sensitive to temperatures.  Not sure if I would repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I drink so much coffee that my teeth have been looking less and less white then they used to. Which of course as some one who&#x27;s not even 30 this was not setting ok so when I got a free offer from Crest and bzzagent to try this product for free I was so excited. I feel I should say I&#x27;ve tried I think about every form of whitening in the past and while they do work they all have their pluses and minuses. The strips are hard to stick perfectly on your teeth so you don&#x27;t get your gums causing sores but you need to get all the tooth, not to mention your trying to obtain perfection on a wet surface. Then comes the removal of the strip it leaves this slimy film. Then comes whitening pastes and mouthwashes one they usually taste TERRIBLE and don&#x27;t seem to yield results very fast, until Crest 3D white brilliance. It&#x27;s an easy two step process 1) brush with the provided toothpaste for 1 minute 2) brush with the whitener for a minute, that&#x27;s it. The taste is great meaning I will continue to use it but the results have been wonderful also. The &amp;#34;coffee&amp;#34; feel my teeth had before is gone not to mention the coffee drinker coloring. Great product easy to use tastes great and actually works.</li>
            <li> Been using the Crest 3D white toothpaste for the past couple of weeks and it is really good. It&#x27;s a two step process, first you brush with a paste followed by a whitening gel. I like it a lot better then strips and it helps you brush for a longer time since there are two steps. Not to mention my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter. I would definitely recommend it. Tried it thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to get this product for being a bzzagent, #freestuff, I started using this right away.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised it was a 2 step process but hey you have to work hard to look beautiful all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I feel after you use it leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist.. that clean feeling. I love that feeling so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that you can drink immediately after you use it, whereas I found with some products you can not.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month now and I can see a little difference. To really tell I would suggested taking pics weekly.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free and I have to say that I love it.  I often deal with sensitive teeth and was a little worried about using it twice a day, but I have had no pain with this product.  On top of no pain, my teeth are noticeably whiter as well.  I have been using the product for 4 weeks and could tell a difference after 1 week of using it twice a day.  My teeth feel very clean and fresh as well because it is an actual toothpaste and not just a whitening gel.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to use and was hassle free.  I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> So I want to start by saying yes, I did get this product for free to try from BzzAgent, but I am always honest with my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;This Crest White Kit is the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve come across and I am definitely a whitening toothpaste lover. The first step leaned your mouth feeling beyond clean, it&#x27;s almost am anything feeling lol. The second step polished your teeth with a whitening gel, and if you&#x27;ve ever used another expensive whitening gel, you can tell they didn&#x27;t skimp on this one! It&#x27;s powerful and I swear you see instant results. I have been using this system for a little over a week and it seems I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it so I assume it&#x27;ll last a while. Definitely a worth while purchase and better then the steps on my opiniom because I was going to brush anyway, so why not really whiten while I do!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest I was able to try out this product for free through BzzAgent. I am an avid fan of the Crest 3D White toothpastes and was delighted when I had the chance to try out this 2 step system. However, after using it for about 3 weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any more whitening effect than when I was using the regular toothpaste. My canines are a bit more yellow than the rest of my teeth so I was hoping it would make a difference, but there was no significant change. It also hurt my gums the first week, so I would be careful to avoid brushing your gums as it can irritate them. I will finish using the product, but I do not think I will repurchase it as it is a lot more pricey than buying just the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this product for free through BzzAgent. I have been impressed with the results (although my teeth have never been overly stained) and I have been using it faithfully. The only downside I&#x27;ve encountered is the taste and texture of step one. It&#x27;s gritty and overpowering. If you can get past that, it does what it claims to do! My gums have had a little sensitivity to step two, so I make sure to steer clear of them while brushing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 2 step system!  Initially I was skeptical thinking it would just waste more time and would just be annoying.  To my surprise, this toothpaste is incredible.  First, you brush with step 1.  This is a nice, minty toothpaste that really gets your teeth clean.  Next, you move on to step 2.  Without rinsing, you brush your teeth with the second product.  This product is incredibly cooling and refreshing, it makes your mouth feel amazing.  It almost feels like it&#x27;s polishing your teeth.  After a week of use my teeth look whiter and they just feel cleaner.  I enjoy using this toothpaste.  Crest sent me a sample of this for free to try and review!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste curtosy of BzzAgent and Crest. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I can tell a difference in the color of my teeth. I am a coffee drinker and am always looking for a whitening toothpaste to help with the staining that drinking coffee does to my teeth. The first couple of times I used this toothpaste I found it to be extremely strong and burned my mouth a little bit, but this went away by the third day of using the toothpaste. It&#x27;s a very simple 2 step process, use step 1 for 1 minute do not rise and then use step 2 for 1 minute. This toothpaste gives a very deep clean and foams up great! It has a nice minty taste and I just love how clean it leaves my teeth feeling. I would defiantly recommend this toothpaste to help whiten your teeth of stains.</li>
            <li> This two step daily cleansing and whitening system is a product that does seem to be effective at whitening your teeth. Step one - the daily cleanser has a lovely sparkly pearl white color and the flavor is appealing. Step two - the whitening agent is clear and has a small after taste of peroxide. As a duo they work well together. I think there could be a bit more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; teeth feel after using the product but as a whole if you are looking for a product to clean and whiten your teeth this could be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest for the option to try this product as part of a promotion from the brand! My smile thanks you as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tooth paste for a little over 3 weeks now (I received it for free from BzzAgent to try and honestly review it), and I really like it.  It doe seem very strong, but you want strength in your whitening toothpaste, or it probably isn&#x27;t going to do much.  I have gotten many compliments on my smile, and since using this whitening duo, I&#x27;ve gotten many more.  I used it twice a day for the first week and I realized it might be a little too strong for that, so now I use it once a day and still find that it maintains the white.  I don&#x27;t think the price is too crazy, since whitening strips are far more expensive.  I will consider repurchasing once I use the rest of both of the tubes.  I have yet to find a regular whitening paste that works anywhere near as well as this combo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of whitening products, but they all make my front teeth super sensitive.  I have two boxes of different types of white strips collecting dust in my medicine cabinet because they make my teeth so sensitive they feel &amp;#34;see-through&amp;#34;.  This gives me control over where to aggressively brush and where to leave be (i.e. bottom of front teeth) which white-strips cannot do.  The Step 2 (polish) can irritate the gums at first (I only used it every other day in the beginning until my gums were acclimated to being stimulated more than usual).  My teeth, and my husband&#x27;s teeth have not been whiter since long ago!  Keeps the coffee stains at bay, too.  The only negative is the taste, but if you follow up with a good strengthening mouthwash, it goes away.  Totally worth it.  FYI I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Crest® but my opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> After using this product you can expect to have a DRY mouth. I mean super dry. The toothpaste feels gritty, and the gel tastes bad. I haven&#x27;t seen any whitening effects, But I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue to use it long enough to finish the kit off. The All day dry mouth just isn&#x27;t worth it. I got this product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.  I LOVE this product.  it gives you a nice natural white without giving you that artificial glow.  The taste is a little like the whitening strips, but still leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Having dealt with not so white teeth my entire life I was excited to try out a new product. I received the product for free from Crest through BzzAgent and immediately put it to use. For a solid two weeks I would use the product as directed. I would follow the steps thoroughly but to no avail I never achieved the results I was expecting. After two weeks I did not notice any change in color. Both step 1 and step 2 left a no-so-nice aftertaste after brushing which just made me want to switch back to my original crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this free product from BzzAgent.  I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but have a hard time finding the time to use the strips. I love that I am already brushing my teeth so now I can do both at the same time. I have sensitive teeth and this does not bother my teeth. I have used it for a couple of weeks and can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest® and courtesy of BzzAgent. I am always looking for a good whitening product because I have naturally yellow-ish teeth and drink tea quite often. I have had many great experiences with the Crest brand in the past, and this new product is no different! I like that there are 2 steps- the first is a deep cleansing regular toothpaste that tastes great (nice and minty) and the second is a targeted whitening gel. The instructions on the back of the tube say to use each for one minute, but I probably do a little extra with step one and a little less with step two because my teeth have been pretty sensitive to the peroxide in the whitener. Overall, my teeth do feel nice and clean as a result of using this system, but I think the whitening process has been a bit slow- I see some improvement in areas that were very yellow before but it&#x27;s not getting as white as i hoped. However, I&#x27;m sure this is due to my reduced usage of step 2- I wish I could use more but the sensitivity to cold foods is just not worth it! I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D white brilliance as a part of a bzzagent campaign. I have been using the Crest 3D White Brilliance for a few weeks now and (luckily) haven&#x27;t experienced any of the staining or abrasion mentioned in other reviews. I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are slightly whiter and it&#x27;s a much cheaper alternative than professional teeth whitening which I have had in the past. Prior teeth whiting treatments have led my teeth to become extra sensitive, but I have not noticed an increase in tooth sensitivity with use of this product. The taste is pretty gross, and my mouth feels a little dry after I brush with both tubes, but I think this toothpaste has more benefits to offer then drawbacks. My teeth could be whiter, but I drink coffee and tea everyday.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed this product and more than likely will be buying it again. I have to honestly say that this is the best tasting toothpaste (the step 1) that I have ever had. I read other reviews that said the taste was disagreeable because of the sweetener, however I LOVED it. The step 2 tastes just like other whitening products, not good, but tolerable (and it isn&#x27;t like you are swallowing it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews state you use step 1 for one minute, then without rinsing use step 2 for one minute. I found this routine easy to add to my brushing regimen. I love the idea of whitening ALL your teeth and not just the front ones like some whitening kits provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t see any HUGE improvements in the whiteness of my teeth but I DID see improvement. I will also be buying this when I run out - I got to try it free from Crest® offered thru BzzAgent and I am glad I did because otherwise I don&#x27;t think I would have given it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying it and giving it a try for yourself!</li>
            <li> Just received a Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free from BzzAgent. I&#x27;m a couple of days in, but wanted to write an initial review. So far, I can say how simple this system is to use. It&#x27;s as easy as brushing your teeth. I will update with a before and after picture when I&#x27;m further into the process, but so far, pending results, I would recommend this system to anyone trying to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3d white kit to try as a buzz agent.  I drink both coffee and soda both caused my teeth to stain.  After a few applications I noticed a huge difference.  Within a week my mom noticed and asked if I had to teeth professionally whitened.  I am extremely pleased with my white smile thanks to Crest 3d white.</li>
            <li> I used this for weeks with no particular improvement. I drink a few glasses of tea each day, and was hoping to brighten up my teeth from that habit. It didn&#x27;t really happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your results may vary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for about two weeks and I have seen some results. With this two step whitening process I have seen my teeth change about one shade whiter, which for me is great since other products have never seemed to really work with all of the hassle that you go through. This product is simple and easy, it&#x27;s just brushing your teeth. I will say that after using the deep cleaning toothpaste your teeth will feel rough but when you continue and use the second tube of whitener your teeth will feel great. I have received a sample of this product to try for free to write this review from Smiley360, but the opinions are mine.</li>
            <li> Tried this cleansing kit free as a Bzz agent thanks to Crest and it does a good job of removing surface stains on teeth. I love my daily coffee and noticed this cleansing kit working right away thanks to the dual step system. I tried other whitening systems like strips but they usually leave my gums and teeth extremely sensitive. However, this one does not. Since this is in toothpaste form, it saves me the extra step of whitening and cleansing my teeth. Definitely recommended for those with more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I received the crest 3d white brilliance to try for free, the product isn&#x27;t to bad. I at first didn&#x27;t think it would do much to my teeth but after a week i definitely noticed a difference.  The only thing is it didn&#x27;t last long. It also made my teeth alittle sensitive after using it a few times a week. But other than that it was a decent product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for FREE  thanks to Crest. I have only used this for two weeks and I can tell a difference already. I drink a lot of coffee and smoke but you would never know it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Crest of their 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System and here&#x27;s what I think:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 2 step process- The deep cleaning toothpaste and the finishing whitener. I think a 2 step process has its pros an cons. Pro: It may get me to brush for longer (certainly closer to the 2 minutes you are supposed to) and it gets my teeth REALLY smooth and clean. Con: It&#x27;s super annoying, 2 tubes, 2 caps, stop in the middle, etc...&lt;br /&gt;Taste: Not great... Its the same as many other similar Crest Pro-health or 3D series, it&#x27;s probably the taste of the specific ingredient but it&#x27;s not as fresh or minty as the Scope flavor which is my favorite toothpaste. Also the finisher is loose, goopy and runny and feels weird. If you don&#x27;t use it though your mouth gets really dry from the toothpaste alone.&lt;br /&gt;Clean: EXCELLENT! My teeth are so freaking clean feeling and smooth- I feel zero tartar&lt;br /&gt;Price: Maybe worth it for excellent clean feeling, much more than other toothpastes. Will last ~ 1 month I think.&lt;br /&gt;Whitening: I have not noticed a significant difference- but my teeth are pretty white anyways and I constantly use a whitening toothpaste.  So if you were not using a whitening toothpaste and you went to this toothpaste maybe the results would be more dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity: No issues, and I generally have these with whitening products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: A good toothpaste for whitening with EXCELLENT cleaning capability, mediocre taste and value for money.</li>
            <li> I was blessed to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was super excited to test this one out.  A few years ago I had done professional whitening and had a good experience however it took so long to do, I mean who has 30 minuets to just wait around with trays in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the product and while it felt a bit odd brushing my teeth with 2 products I noticed an immediate difference.  The first tube you use has a gritty feel to it and does a great job at cleaning your teeth, the second tube is like a silky gel that glides over your teeth.  Afterwards my mouth felt clean and super bright.  I continued to use it for about 4 days that&#x27;s when I had to stop using it because I noticed a sensitivity to cold that I did not have prior to using the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product to everyone and even though I had a sensitivity to this I still continue to use it periodically.  If I have a wedding or a party to go to the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System helps to give my teeth a pop of white and I don&#x27;t have any long term sensitivity doing it this way.  Thank you again to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me to try it for Free!</li>
            <li> Where to start with the things I love about this product?!  I love how clean my mouth feels after using step one (The deep cleansing paste) and I love how white my teeth are just because I am doing my normal daily routine with brushing.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to sit around with anything on my teeth and that this product is easy to use!  I also think it has helped improve my tooth brushing regimen because I count while brushing to make sure I&#x27;m using each step for the correct amount of time.  I recommend this product and am a big fan!  I was given this product in an exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion by Crest.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and have noticed some great results.  My teeth seem whiter, and clear and am very impressed that my teeth do not feel more sensitive, or painful due to using this product.  I used a previous whitening system by crest, and experienced some pain while using the whitening gel.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my teeth look after using the enter kit and am hoping for great results.  I highly recommend anyone looking to whiten your teeth, while getting a deep clean to give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is my second whitening system that I&#x27;ve been asked to try this year by Crest. When the Crest Pro Health HD system didn&#x27;t produce sparkling white results, I was really hoping that the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System would step it up. The system runs just under $15 and seems like it will last at least 2 months, if not more. While the 2 step system takes longer, I definitely notice a much cleaner feeling than the regular one tube route, so that&#x27;s a positive. However, the picture I posted is after daily use for over 4 weeks. It is really difficult to tell the difference between my before and after, so ultimately, I can&#x27;t rate the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System higher than 2 stars. I&#x27;m now really willing to shell out the $40+ to get quality results with Crest&#x27;s white strips system instead.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest I was able to try this product for free! Which is really nice considering I would not have purchased otherwise. I have very sensitive teeth so I was a bit leery trying this. At first I used daily and after 3 days my teeth bothered me. So, then I skipped to every other day, and they still bothered me, but not as much. So, now I use it every 3 days and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. The two days I&#x27;m not using it, I use a sensitivity toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this product nice is the fact I don&#x27;t have to use it daily for it to work. I can use it every 3 days and still get amazing results. With strips I cannot do that. They will not do anything if I used them like that. I hope for future maybe they can make it in a sensitive version but even if they don&#x27;t I will still continue to use this product. It does not leave any white dots on the teeth or burn your mouth. It truly made me feel better about my teeth!</li>
            <li> I tell everyone I know about the products I get to test, this by far has been one of my favorites. I have very sensitive teeth so usually when using a product like this I have to discontinue, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with Crest 3D White :) It really truly does work for whitening and my breath is super fresh! I will absolutely buy this again in the future!</li>
            <li> Four stars for MAINTENANCE whitening of your pearly whites... &amp;#34;Maintenance&amp;#34; being the operative word with this two step Crest 3D White Brilliance daily toothpaste and whitening gel because I have been using this product twice day day for 2 minutes EACH application and have really only noticed that it has kept my teeth as white as when I applied it for the first time almost 20 days ago. I like to use whiting gel with my retainers or Crest whitestrips to get my teeth their whitest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this product is brushing with the whitening gel for 2 minutes.  You are bound to get some on your lips and it REALLY DRIES your lips out!  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with taste, sensitivity or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can still only recommend this as a maintenance product only. Try Crest Whitestrips or a similar product for TRUE whitening...</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White did not work as well as I had prayed it would. Maybe I was looking for a miracle working - magic toothpaste sent down from God above and expected way too much from two tubes... However, I DID see whitening in just one use and my teeth did continue to get whiter over time! Please know that I did not start out with stained teeth. I get complemented on how white my teeth are all the time but to me they are not white enough. I want them whiter. So , with this being said, I could possibly be expecting way too much. I would recommend giving Crest 3D White a try. It will be well worth your time and effort and I feel it is the best home product on the market at this time.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Crest and Thought this was an amazing over the counter product! I noticed a considerable difference after just a week. My favorite part was that this didn&#x27;t hurt my gums like other whiteners have in the past. This toothpaste also leaves your mouth feeling super clean!</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;It is from the most reputable manufacturer of oral hygiene products in the world and may be used with complete confidence. Easy to use. And, I think not only does it whiten, it cleans my teeth more thoroughly than any other toothpaste product I have ever used. The flavor is good, not too minty. I would absolutely purchase this product, unless the cost was too much for me to afford, like $25.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was able to try the new crest 3d white brilliance daily cleansing toothpaste via BZZ agent and Crest for free. So after using it for a month my opinions are:&lt;br /&gt;1. My teeth feel and are noticeably cleaner, the two step process definitely makes my teeth cleaner and more polished.&lt;br /&gt;2. My teeth are whiter, but not as white as I hoped they would be.&lt;br /&gt;3. While I like the results, I am a busy mom and the two step process is a little added time. One would definitely have to weigh the added steps with the benefits :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would probably buy this product again</li>
            <li> This toothpaste made my teeth feel very smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> 3D CREST WHITENING PRODUCT IS WORKING GREAT FOR ME. MY TEETH HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED YELLOW (QUITE EMBARRASSING). AFTER JUST A FEW USES, I COULD SEE A GOOD IMPROVEMENT. I&#x27;LL BE PUTTING THIS PRODUCT IN MY ROUTINE.</li>
            <li> Having used Crest whitestrips to achieve a set of white teeth, I find this system maintains the whiteness through everyday use of tea and red wine. I use the system once a day to minimize sensitivity. The paste does an excellent job of cleaning and the gel step maintains the whiteness. The flavors of both products could do with being a little mintier in my view. I also worry a little about the abrasiveness of the paste and long term wear on my enamel so I&#x27;m going to check with my dentist next visit for his opinion.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TEST TEST TEST TEST test test test test it&#x27;s a test&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The Crest two part whitening system helped me get my teeth looking brighter as well as giving them a good clean and almost polished feeling. I felt confident in my smile.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> When I first received Crest 3D White, I wanted to see if it would REALLY whiten my teeth. I tried it for a few days and can&#x27;t really tell the difference but after a week, I looked at the before picture of my teeth and the after using Crest 3D White for one week and really see a difference. I&#x27;m not saying good things about this product because I got it for free but it really worked and made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> This product is really interesting despite the fact that Crest is my go to brand. Typically, I use Crest 3D White Luxe (Diamond Strong) to not only keep my teeth white but to strengthen my enamel. I was psyched when I was given the chance to test this product from the company before it even hit the market. Naturally I said yes since I&#x27;m very comfortable with the brand. After 3 and a half weeks of use, I will say that my teeth are about 1 1/2/ shades whiter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is a whitish, semi translucent paste that deep cleans.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is a clear gel like finisher that actually makes mouth wash unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Brush with Step 1, Do not rinse Step 1 (only spit out excess), Add Step 2 to brush, Brush for a 1-2 minutes, Rinse Mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The size of the tubes are large enough to last an individual user for about 2-3 months (twice a day use)&lt;br /&gt;-Step 1 is pretty thorough in it&#x27;s cleansing power (makes teeth literally squeaky clean)&lt;br /&gt;-Step 2 seems to come into play to neutralize step 1 and freshen breath&lt;br /&gt;-Breath and mouth stay pretty fresh for hours&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely effective in not only whitening but the protection of tooth enamel and gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars despite loving my results is the way my mouth feels during Step 1. I&#x27;m not sure what it is but I&#x27;m certain that Step 1 changes the pH balance in the mouth. It&#x27;s hard to describe but makes my entire mouth feel sort of dry or evaporated. It feels weird until I finally get to Step 2 which seems to stabilize everything and brings back the moisture. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker at all however, it&#x27;s just an odd feeling. Despite this, I definitely will use this product till it&#x27;s finished and purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Thanks to Crest® for providing this product for me to review*</li>
            <li> The product provided me with a really deep down clean feeling that lasted for a long time. I did not experience any sensitivity issues which I have with other whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> After two weeks it appears to be working. However, it was difficult for me to use at first due to the product reaction to my tongue. After the 2nd step the bottom front of my tongue was really stinging. Especially with a cool water rinse. I have gotten somewhat conditioned to it, but am not sure if this is due to how I use it or numbing of the senses.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out how well this system works and that it was safe for my very sensitive teeth. I was wary of Step 2 when it smelled like bleach. However I never had any ill effects from it&#x27;s use. I found my teeth to be cleaner and whiter much quicker than I had expected. I loved the feeling of my teeth having that just from the dentist feel and it lasted all day long. I did not have that middle of the day film on my teeth after meals. So you know that the protection is working as well. The final test .. will be to see what my dentist will say upon my next visit. This is one time that I cannot wait to go to the dentist and show off my new pearly whites!!  I tested this product for free from Shoppers Army.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference after one use, but I have sensitive teeth. This did not end well for me. My gums and teeth became super sensitive while using.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try Crest 3D White, but apprehensive as in the past whitening products didn&#x27;t really seem to work. Packaging was super easy to open and didn&#x27;t give me a workout. The first step left my mouth feeling dry, a bit dull, and like I really needed to brush my teeth with something that would clean them. It felt like I had a film over them. Second step surprised me with the cool minty flavor. I would have preferred a flip top tube. I have a tendency to brush hard, and learned within the first couple days of using the product that I definitely couldn&#x27;t continue to do that. My gums were sore like I just poured bleach on them. When I tried to use a mouth guard, it was super uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve since eased up on the brushing and haven&#x27;t noticed the same sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> My experience was fine. I hoped for a whiter smile, but my teeth may just need stronger whitening ingredients&lt;br /&gt;In twelve days of use, at least twice a day, I feel my teeth got one shade whiter. I will keep using 3D white until gone, maybe my teeth take longer to whiten. After all my teeth are 65 years old! I was pleased that 3D did not increase my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I found that Crest 3D White made my teeth look brighter and a little whiter. The experience was pleasant because it was not bad tasting nor did it leave a bad after taste. I think if I use it longer I may see even more improvement in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Lets be honest here. I don&#x27;t like my teeth. If I were younger, I&#x27;d have them straightened but that ship has sailed! That said, my dentist suggested whitening would help so I bought a kit from him. I don&#x27;t like the kit, it makes my teeth sensitive and I have to leave the trays on for minimum an hour. Who has that kind of time? Crest 3D is easy, fast and I can use it every day instead of carving out time from my schedule once a month. I didn&#x27;t notice any increased sensitivity using Crest 3D and I definitely saw a difference, within 3 or 4 days!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see such whitening results. It was easy to use. the first step, the cleaning, was a great cleaning paste, not too minty, just right. Some toothpaste are too minty and foamy, this was neither, so made brushing for 60 seconds easy and comfortable. The whitening gel was non abrasive. I have receding gums and was concerned about tooth sensitivity, but experienced none. Did the job without harshness. What I liked most was that all my teeth and to the gum-line was whitened, whereas with the trays I was usually using, I was only whitening the bottom parts of my front teeth. I would definitely recommend the Crest 3D White.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest toothpaste for years and was looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately, the unpleasant sensations made it a negative experience. My mouth felt like all of the moisture had been drawn out after using the toothpaste in step 1. Following with step 2 just burned.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I thought this was a really great whitening product. I like that it is a toothpaste system, not strips. It really did whiten and remove some surface stains.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I liked the product, although the polishing gel did have a bit of an off taste to it. I did notice my teeth were whiter, which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue though with my gums. Under two of my teeth, the gum became irritated.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Not really satisfied with the performance!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D Cleaning/Whitening/Works&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various whitening products and this one is the easiest one to use! Two simple steps twice a day and you are done. The taste is so much better than other whitening products I have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would show some improvement from the first time I used it but was very disappointed, did not see any. Also, did not like the after taste, had to rinse several times to get rid of the strong taste.</li>
            <li> This product really helped to make my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I liked the way it makes my teeth look whiter, and enjoy the tingle after brushing! It is very easy to use; and did make a big difference in brightening my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I do notice that my teeth are a bit whiter. I am surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference, and that motivated me to use it twice a day, which improved my previous tooth brushing routine. The step one is a great minty flavor, and the step 2 is a milder flavor, yet still pleasant. Every time I use the step 2, I think it tastes like a &#x27;vanilla mint&#x27; flavor.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I am very sorry to say that this product did not whiten my teeth and my mouth burned when I rinsed with the mouthwash I use.</li>
            <li> I thought this two step system had potential and was excited to give it a try. Step 1, the deep cleaning paste, made my teeth feel polished, however, it left my mouth dry and it had no flavor. Step 2, the whitener, irritated my gums after about a week of use. I know they say if this happens, stop using it for a few days, but I have to wonder about the safety of the product itself when I have this kind of reaction to it. Overall, I liked the polishing effect of step 1, but wished it made my mouth feel cleaner and refreshed and I would not recommend or use step 2 again.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Good product for a decent price!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this product through Crest and BzzAgent. I do like how clean my teeth feel after I use step 1 and honestly I do think that my teeth look whiter even after 1 use! I however do find it sort of time consuming in the morning and haven&#x27;t been able to consistently use this product twice a day. I think if I did it would absolutely make a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s 2 step because you feel like your really cleaning your teeth. The color and look of the paste is pretty and I felt like I had cleaner teeth when I finished the product. There was a slight sensitivity that occur when I first starting using product, but it was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this Crest 3D White two step system. The system is easy to use and gives quick results. After the 1st use my teeth felt smoother, cleaner and looked brighter. After a few days of use I could its whitening effects. The toothpaste has a nice mint flavor and the whitening gel did not cause any teeth or gum sensitivity. I like that this system both polishes and whitens, while improving the overall health of your teeth &amp; gums. I would definitely recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was really excited about receiving this product- I&#x27;d been contemplating doing something to help whiten or maintain my color since I admittedly drink a lot of tea and diet sodas.&lt;br /&gt;Many moons ago (try college) I&#x27;d gone to a dentist and had my teeth whitened to the tune of $300 (and as many years ago think inflation!) This Crest product helped whiten my teeth but not only that made my teeth feel polished too! My teeth weren&#x27;t horribly stained, but they certainly did brighten using this system. It also made me take better care of my teeth by brushing longer, and I even started to floss more! Win win!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Due to genetics, I have yellow teeth...not too bad...but enough that it bothers me. The box was a bit difficult to get open but once I did I was ready to get started! The directions are easy to follow. My teeth are somewhat whiter...and I don&#x27;t want them pearly white as that looks so fake. I hope they will &amp;#34;deyellow&amp;#34; a little bit more, though. My only complaint is that my teeth are a bit more sensitive than before using this product. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to improve the color of their teeth!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> :&lt;br /&gt;I used the product two times a day for two weeks and I really did not notice a difference in my smile. The process itself was tedious and my teeth never really felt clean the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I liked the &amp;#34;process&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s easy to brush with the first paste (spit but don&#x27;t rinse) and then brush with the whitener. It makes my teeth feel clean and polished. My teeth are naturally quite white, there are only minimal yellowish stains between the bottom teeth at the gum line. Crest 3D White helped, but didn&#x27;t completely whiten the stains. Since this part of my teeth isn&#x27;t visible, my teeth look really white.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use this product for any length of time. I was excited about the concept of being able to just brush my teeth to whiten them without using any messy trays, etc. However, the first time I used the product, it burnt the gums above my two front teeth. Prior to that, I did not have any sensitivity problems in my mouth. I waited a few days and tried again, with the same results. It just felt raw and sore after brushing--so painful that I could not continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for the average customer. Dont get me wrong, this isn&#x27;t a review to bash crest or say I hate the product. I was super excited to get it and think it might make a difference. I am only giving it two stars because people with sensitive teeth do need to be aware that this toothpaste alone will make hell in your mouth. I used it every day for about a month before stopping since the warning said that the sensitivity would subside. However, it made it so bad that I couldnt brush my teeth without feeling like I was taking a knife to the most sensitive parts of my mouth. So I support this product, but people with naturally sensitive teeth need to find a different way to whiten. Unless you are willing to be in pain.</li>
            <li> I am not really impressed by this product. 2 steps in my opinion are not necessary when their clinical toothpaste does whitening too plus much much more! I&#x27;ve used a whitening gel on its own and that&#x27;s all they need to sell. The taste of the polish is not that great either. I received this free as a promotional product. I would not purchase.</li>
            <li> I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening system to try from Crest and BzzAgent. Having white teeth is extremely important to me and after I tried the system I can tell it do it it&#x27;s work. I have had excellent results so far and have only been using the product for few weeks. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Crest 3D White Brilliance.  I have had excellent results so far and have only been using the product for 2 weeks.  Using this is fairly simple - you brush your teeth for one minute with the step-one paste, then finish up with a final minute of the step-two finisher.  I am not a smoker but I do drink coffee, soda, and red wine... all things notorious for staining teeth.  I have had no issues with staining from drinking anything while using this product and the discoloration I did have has all but diminished.  My teeth are whiter and brighter and the process is so much easier than using whitening strips.  Also, brushing with Crest 3D White Brilliance has not causes any sensitivity.  Thank you Crest and BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test and review the product for free through by Bzzagent and thanks to Crest.  My honest opinion about the product is it is great. Cu toothpaste and whitening agents are both light in flavor in Middle earth and foam very much especially compared to a normal toothpaste.  I will take that left my mouth feeling cleaner but he&#x27;s feeling smoother longer throughout the day and my breath as well. The thing that annoys me about the product with the packaging you are easily able to distinguish between step 1 and step 2 easily due to the labeling and color.  I was annoyed by how one is a  flip cap and thebanother one is a twist cap, plus the lables are in the opposite position as the other.  I suppose it was to ad ,ore distinction but they are different enough as is.  I have noticed my teeth are brighter and whiter so it does work well and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it one time and noticed results! My teeth were brighter and more vibrant! Don&#x27;t expect it to foam because it won&#x27;t It&#x27;s more the consistency of a gel. It was really simple to use. I have a time toothbrush so I just used it to keep it at 1 minute each. I didn&#x27;t have any oral discomfort or staining from the product, though I will be keeping an eye out for it. The taste was so so. I prefer a more minty toothpaste and this one was pretty  bland.  I tried this product free thanks to bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. It is super easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> Crest products are my favorite for tooth brushing, and mouth washing. That being said, I was disappointed with the claims of this product. I expected at least a minimal change in the color of my teeth, alas, there was no visible change.&lt;br /&gt;This product has 2 steps, the first is for prepping your teeth by cleaning them, like a regular toothpaste. The second step is for polishing and whitening. While the first step does its job and I feel my mouth is very fresh and clean, the second step has been a waste is my time over the last 4 weeks that I&#x27;ve used the product.&lt;br /&gt;I did not change my daily habits such as drink or food intake as I feel that would falsify any claims for whitening if I suddenly stopped drinking coffee, tea, soda, juice. I wanted an unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am grateful for BuzzAgent and Crest for providing this product free of charge as I would be extremely disappointed to pay $24.95 for basic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So crest has come out with another 2 step whitening toothpaste system. I love the first one I tried, the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System, but this one falls short. So I will stick with my loved Crest brand, just not this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is simple, brush for one minute with step one. Spit, but don&#x27;t rinse, and brush for one minute with step 2. Rinse and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this system is in the paste itself. It is gritty and pastey with a fake sugar taste. I understand the theory of the gritty paste is &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; off stains but I have not noticed any difference in the color of my teeth. Now perhaps that&#x27;s a good thing, as Crest mentions in their Crest 3D commercials, &amp;#34;If you&#x27;re not whitening, you&#x27;re yellowing.&amp;#34; but when a product claims to be &amp;#34;99% as white as a professional polish&amp;#34; then I expect better results. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular toothpaste again, but I do like the 2 step process, if for nothing else, it keeps me honest and I brush for the full 2 minutes. So I will be buying the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System again, which I recommend you try for yourself. Happy brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free thanks to Crest® and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System(Free courtesy of bzzagent and crest) for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m really impressed with the results. I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whiten but have used the crest whitening strips. Using this 2-step system is so much easier since all I have to do is just add a second tube to my daily brushing routine. I normally get teeth sensitivity from whitening toothpastes but ever since using this system, I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity. My smile is noticeably brighter ever since I&#x27;ve been using the system even when I drink coffee. I like this system in all aspect of it but I wish the taste was a bit more fresh feeling. Overall, This system is great and I look forward to keeping it in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System through BzzAgent, and I am so glad I got to. I often buy toothpaste that says whitening, but it doesn&#x27;t result in whiter teeth plus I get tooth sensitivity problems. This is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried that says visibly whitens and ACTUALLY shows a significant difference! I started using this toothpaste about a month ago, and I saw a difference within two weeks. People commented that they looked whiter within three weeks, something that has never happened to me (especially since I&#x27;m a coffee and tea drinker). I don&#x27;t mind using two steps, and Step 2 results in a nice, smooth finish. Although there are lots of pros, there are a few cons. It&#x27;s a bit disconcerting that Step 1 can cause staining. Plus, I don&#x27;t particularly like the sucralose taste in Step 2, and it makes me very thirsty.</li>
            <li> I received this free from buzzagent to try and review. This is the first whiting product that I actually see results, but the it does turn my gums white and does hurt after brushing.The white on my gums goes away after a couple of mins but still uncomfortable. Its a two step processes that you brush then do not rinse til you complete the second step. My teeth are whiter after a couple of uses, will buy again</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product for free as a BzzAgent. I have previously tried a similar product from Crest, called HD White, that worked in a similar way - two tubes for two different steps. Overall, I am relatively neutral on this 3D White product. It does leave my mouth feeling fresh, and I like that it encourages me to brush for the dentist-recommended amount of time (2 minutes). The first time I tried it, I did feel a bit of tooth/gum sensitivity, which made me think that the whitening product might really be working. (I always get sensitivity with whitening products.) But, I only felt that sensitivity the very first use, and even with consistent use for several weeks, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I do drink quite a bit of coffee, so it&#x27;s possible that this toothpaste is preventing additional staining. I will continue using the product, but at this price point, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I tried this for free courtesy of Crest. I would not believe the difference it made after just the first time of using it! I didnt take a picture because honestly, I didnt think it would work because my dad didnt notice a difference. At the same time, he is very diligent with his teeth and getting dental  cleanings, etc...so i think he cant get any lighter in tone. I however, do my dental cleanings, but i&#x27;m also rough on my teeth, I smoke, drink beer and wine, so this had something to work against. My first time using it, I was a couple shades lighter and my teeth were SO SMOOTH!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would recommend this for a low cost whitening option to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent! It is an easy 2 step system that takes no longer than your usual brushing time. My teeth felt super clean all day after using this system, and I could see a bit of a change from the very start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses, the whitening system did begin to hurt my gums when brushing. I cut down from using the toothpastes from 2 times a day to only one, but it was still causing irritation. I now only use it about 2-3 times a week and am not seeing the results I would like. Overall, I think it is a good whitening system but probably not meant for me!</li>
            <li> im reviewing this product that I received for free. its okay. It did make my gums sensitive and it&#x27;s kinda annoying when you have to use two different products to brush your teeth. I didn&#x27;t see that big of a difference is my teeth, I&#x27;d rather use crest white strips while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> Thank to Crest I&#x27;m trying Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System for free and I&#x27;m in love with the results. This product is super affordable and I got fast results. Will be buying this myself once my free sample is gone. Also, this 2 step system is easy to do, each paste for one minute and your done. I was afraid that step 2 or the whitening gel was going to cause sensitivity in my teeth and I&#x27;m glad to say after about 4 weeks of using these I just have whiter teeth. Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. :)</li>
            <li> I received this free from crest as a bzzagent to try and review.  It&#x27;s great!  My teeth are DEFINITELY whiter now!  It&#x27;s been about two weeks, and though I have forgotten to brush with it a second time a few days, it&#x27;s still working!  It may not be as quick or quite as perfectly white as a professional job, but it&#x27;s HUGE and still working!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the idea of this product. I was excited to try it because I have coffee stains and other staining on my teeth. I did notice a difference in the color and could see that it was working, but my teeth got very sensitive and I ended up switching back to my old toothpaste. I gave it to my sister and she seemed to love it. I did received this product as part of a sample program so I did not pay for it. I would recommend to someone that does not have dental issues or tooth/gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This was a good product. I think it compares to other whitening products you can buy at the drugstores. The taste was good for me. I will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> just used the kit for about 2 weeks, im a big coffee and tea drinker, i will say this product is not really whiten my teeth as it said but it definitely brighten up a lot, i can see some of the result just within these couple of weeks, i will continue using them for the whole month and come back for a follow up result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now. It leaves my mouth feeling very fresh. However I follow the directions exactly, step 1 brush for 1 minute spit but don&#x27;t rinse then do step 2, and my teeth are not any whiter. I have been doing it twice a day too. I will continue to use it anyways, because I like how fresh my mouth feels.&lt;br /&gt;**i received this product as a promotion from the brand but this is my Own, honest opinion**</li>
            <li> I was provided a box of the New Crest 3D White Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from BzzAgent. I have done multiple different kinds of whitening systems in the past, including one that is prescribed by my dentist and is extremely expensive. I was hesitant to try this at first, because with lots of whitening systems, they can be harsh and abrasive to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have lost some enamel on my teeth and due to flouride in the water I drank as a child, there are marks on my teeth that always seem to brighten when I use whitening products and then my teeth look weird.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to see if the Crest product worked differently and much to my surprise, it did! I absolutely love this system. It was easy to use and while I did have some burning and irritation to my gums, that was normal. Within 2 weeks, my teeth were so much whiter AND they felt great. The pastes leave this super fresh, super smooth clean feeling like none I&#x27;ve every experienced. My husband noticed the difference and we got him some too. We have a wedding coming up that we are both in and so we were thrilled to find something that worked and that didn&#x27;t have the side effects that we&#x27;ve experienced in the past. Other brands have caused lots of pain and headaches even. So this..this was a home-run and definitely part of our new routine :)</li>
            <li> I received Crest 3D White free from Crest and BzzAgent and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working!!  I&#x27;ve noticed the my teeth are looking brighter and I drink a lot of coffee so it&#x27;s got its work cut out for it!  I love the step 1. It makes my mouth feel super clean in a way you can&#x27;t get from other toothpastes. I don&#x27;t love the taste of step 2 but that&#x27;s where the magic happens so I live with it. It just tastes a little too tangy for me.  I&#x27;m not adventurous when it comes to toothpaste. My only complaint is, some nights when I&#x27;m tired, I&#x27;d rather just slap the old Crest on my toothbrush and get myself to bed so I don&#x27;t use it as dilligently as I should. Otherwise-love it!</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  When I wore braces they made marks on my front two teeth. I used many products through out the years. The first 3 days I noticed a difference on how light the marks were after using the Crest 3D.  So simply and didn&#x27;t take long to use daily. I would definitely recommend to friends and family. As did not have any problems with my teeth becoming sensitive after using.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  This is my unbiased opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First here&#x27;s a brief overview of my history of whitening products.  I have never had professional whitening done in the dentists office.  I have used Crest white strips as well as generic branded gel trays that I bought at the grocery store.  I have also used Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste.  The trays and white strips worked well for me, but depending on what product you get you have to leave them on your teeth for up to an hour or two, and it&#x27;s hard to talk with them in.  They really require a time commitment and I definitely noticed some tooth sensitivity after using them that would last a day or so.  I recently started using Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste as my normal every day toothpaste and used it morning and night.  I have always preferred Colgate toothpaste over Crest because I feel that overall Colgate has a more minty flavor which I like.  I did notice some whitening with that Colgate toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said I received the Crest 3D Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent for review.  I was very excited to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-quick and simple to use two step process that replaces your normal toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;-teeth feel really smooth and clean after using&lt;br /&gt;-tooth sensitivity is minor and not very noticeable&lt;br /&gt;-I have noticed my teeth seem whiter (more than I saw with the Colgate Optic White)&lt;br /&gt;-more affordable than white strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-seems to irritate my gums (only while I&#x27;m brushing) to the point of me not wanting to use twice a day&lt;br /&gt;-does not provide the strong minty flavor that I prefer in a toothpaste</li>
            <li> The amazing Crest 3d whiting system has been working amazing. I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker with 4 young kids and the whiting system has drastically changed the stains on my teeth. It is very quick and easy to use which is a plus with me. My teeth feel so clean after I use it, and the clean feeling lasts all day. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the taste, it was bitter. Thank you for bzzagent.com for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I was recently chosen to try this product for free through Bzz agents. I would have to give this product a 4 start rating. It only slightly made my teeth whiter but I couldn&#x27;t use it like I was suppose to(twice a day) . I did have a lot of sensitivity issues that I had to see my dentist about. I was told to only use the product once a day and use a fluoride treatment once a day to make sure my sensitivity went down.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started to use it the first step toothpaste left a weird taste in my mouth but I got used to it through the 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product. You can&#x27;t beat the cost! It&#x27;s a very easy and effective way to get your teeth a bit whiter!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from using this product because I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips before and they are clumsy and inconvenient to use and not all that effective. The two-step process of the  Crest 3D Brilliance Cleansing and Whitening System turned out to be easier than I expected and was easy to work in to my normal tooth brushing routine. The first step (the deep cleansing toothpaste) you leave on without rinsing for just a minute, then you proceed to step two (the whitening finisher), brush for a minute more then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised at how well it whitens and how soon I started getting results - after using Crest 3D Brilliance for just a couple of days I noticed a big improvement and with steady use for about three weeks now, my teeth are continuing to whiten and brighten - I&#x27;m very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite parts was the foaming action because that gets deep down into the crevices that whitening strips could never reach and the micro cleansers polish away stains and leave my mouth feeling very fresh and clean, with clean fresh breath. I can see why they call it 3D Brilliance because my teeth not only look whiter but the illuminating complex makes them very bright and lustrous like no other toothpaste or whitening system has done for me before. I think the two-step system is key - they work together as a team to make my teeth the cleanest and brightest they&#x27;ve ever been. I&#x27;m very excited about the product and am so happy that i discovered it through BzzAgent, and was able to try this wonderful product free by participating in one of their campaigns.</li>
            <li> Easy and really works! Just a few minutes in the morning! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Crest I was able to try this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Crest whitening products in the past and my teeth always became so sensitive (bleeding, painful gums) that I normally didn&#x27;t finish using it.&lt;br /&gt;With this product I did not experience much sensitivity and my teeth after about 17 days were about 3 shades whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I really love how the Step 2 polish makes my teeth feel &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean. Its like I just came from the Dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anybody who drinks tea or coffee heavily as that is the case with me and it worked really well on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a trial for my buzz campain , I was a little doubtful  at 1st but this product works great!  I&#x27;m not a fan of the taste but it&#x27;s worth the results.  I used to be a smoker and coffee drinker and it got a lot of the discoloration to go away! Best part was I got to try it for FREE Thanks to crest.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for free! It&#x27;s a 2-step process, but does a pretty good job! I wouldn&#x27;t call myself the pickiest person when it comes to toothpaste, but I do want it to keep my teeth white and do a good job, of course. I&#x27;m a 34 year member of the &amp;#34;No Cavity Club&amp;#34; and I think this will help me stay there. It&#x27;s a great alternative to the strips as I don&#x27;t usually have time to do those during the day, and since I&#x27;m already there brushing, might as well make it just a few seconds longer for the good outcome. The first step DOES make my mouth a little dry, but  come step 2, it&#x27;s much better. I&#x27;ve noticed a good difference when I switched to using this over Crest&#x27;s regular extra whitening paste, and think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while.</li>
            <li> I received Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System free from BzzAgent for review.  I had recently tried the Crest ProHealth HD whitening system and was disappointed and I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product. I quickly changed my mind!  After a few days of use, I could already tell a difference in my teeth. While this is a 2 step system, it only takes 2 mintues. Hard to complain about that. It left my teeth whiter and the taste was fresh and minty. My gums did not experience any sensitivity. This is a purchase I will make in the future.</li>
            <li> This product works, but is not great. Does not super brighten fast. And i do not like that it is a two step process either. I feel if you are really into your teeth and feel extra steps are worth the benefit, then this product for you. I still feel like my old whitening toothpaste is easier with the same results, but they are the same brand so they both do work.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product for those days in between your regular visits to the hygienist. Left my teeth feeling very clean, with a little tingle of freshness.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate white teeth beauty duo. I was a little skeptical, but was very pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s easy to use and I started to see results after just a few uses. After 2 weeks, I started to get compliments on my teeth/smile. Not just from family, but strangers, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes fine and wasn&#x27;t bad on my sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with gels and such in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! Thanks Crest for allowing me to sample this product for free!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the two-step process a little cumbersome. To time one minute doing the first step and then not rinsing (ICK!) and then proceeding to the next step for another minute was a little much for everyday use. I think I can handle this maybe at bed time, but not morning, noon and night. Plus to keep track of two separate containers-just two-much all around. Although my mouth felt &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; (almost fresh from the dentist clean), there really wasn&#x27;t a refreshing minty feeling one usually gets from regular toothpaste. My mouth felt a little dry and pucker. Otherwise, a decent product that does give results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t like the taste of either product. I also found it to be &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; in the sense that it kinda stung my tongue. But to put that into perspective, I have what I would describe as a sensitive tongue; I don&#x27;t like hot sauce or red wines, etc., because of the taste they leave on my tongue or in my mouth. With that said, I do feel Crest 3D White left my teeth feeling smooth and clean and it may have lightened the color of my teeth a bit after two weeks of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. I noticed my teeth whiting on the very 1st week. I would recommend this product. This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I loved that it cleaned my teeth and the first few days were ok and then my teeth started to get real sensitive to cold items, my tea, my pops and so on. Then I used the Crest 3D White once a day and then brushed my teeth with my original toothpaste Crest Whitening. But it still did not stop my sensitivity to cold. Maybe I need to go see my Dentist to see if all is good with my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received a sample through a promotion campaign. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using my toothpaste system. I can notice a difference between the system and regular whitening toothpaste, but don&#x27;t expect the same results as the Crest whitening stripes. But overall great with no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Although I prefer a mintier taste for step 1, my mouth feels fresh after I use this product. Step 2 burns a bit at first, but I got used to it after a couple of days use. I use an electric toothbrush, so I use Step 1 for a 2 minute cycle (30 seconds per quadrant) and then use Step 2 for 30 seconds on my upper front teeth and 30 seconds on my lower front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this product. It makes my teeth feel so clean. It is just like coming having them cleaned at the dentist. But not as expensive. Using the product as 2 parts actually makes you brush longer and it makes them feel so good. I think the product whitened them some, but it&#x27;s hard for me to tell these days. I had no problems with sensitivity from this product. I truly liked using it 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Product</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product. I&#x27;ve seen it advertised in print and in stores. The instructions were ok. It didn&#x27;t say on the package exactly how much of each tube to use on the toothbrush. The tubes, themselves, were a good shape but I think the cap for the second tube needs to be changed. It should be a flip top like the toothpaste. I kept thinking that I was going to lose the cap every time I went to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Using this product seemed simple enough. I did try it for several days but I started to discover that my gums were feeling sore. I hadn&#x27;t changed my toothbrush, so that could not have been the problem. Then I noticed blood. For some reason my gums became so irritated that they started to bleed. This has never happened before. It had to be one of the ingredients in the toothpaste or the whitener. I did give myself a break from using it and then went back to trying it again. The same thing happened after a few days of usage, irritation and a little bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product doing its job, it did make my teeth a little bit whiter, though not much. As strange as it sounds, I would recommend this to people, as long as they could return it to wherever they purchased it if a problem such as mine would arise.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn great!!  What I love about this product is that it enables me to whiten all of my teeth and just not a few that strips cover.</li>
            <li> Love it! Recommend it to everyone!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am proud to say I am a bzzagent. That means I review products for free and give back my opinion and review. One of my recent products I was able to review is the crest 3d brilliance daily cleaning for free. I was skeptical because all of the other whiting treatments I have used are either nasty tasting, very time consuming or messy. With the crest 3d whiting two step daily cleansing treatment I was shocked to read that it only takes one minute for each step. Ya right I thought two min for whiter teeth right. But I tried it anyway and what do you know IT WORKED. The first step is the cleaning process you brush like any other toothpaste, brush for at least one minute. Then spit don&#x27;t rinse, put step two on your tooth brush and brush for at least one more minute. This process whitens your teeth. Then spit rinse as you regularly do. Take a minute to look at those bright shinny teeth. Yes after just one use you will see a difference. I am a coffee drinker and I tried everything to keep my teeth white all failing. Until I was able to try the crest 3d two step teeth whitening tooth paste. I could not believe it that I really saw results after one use. I was always unsure about smiling and showing my teeth but with the crest 3d whitening toothpaste I am not afraid to show off my smile. #gotitfree #crest3dwhitebrilliancecleasing #procter&amp;gamble</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste for free through BZZAGENT to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of weeks now I have really grown to like it and love the lasting effects it has made. My teeth are whiter without any sensitivity issues, and the flavor of STEP 1 was quite refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it I did have some moderate whitening of my gums that really freaked me out. It lasted for quite a few hours and did not go away no matter what I did, but after my gums got used to the toothpaste it stopped happening.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this toothpaste nightly.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is very minty and makes my teeth feel very clean, but made my mouth very dry. The whitening step seemed very thin and runny and it didn&#x27;t feel like I was accomplishing anything. I also did not notice my teeth were any whiter than when I started the system. Two steps is also kind of time consuming and somewhat of a hassle so I could not see myself using this again. Overall, the best part was my mouth and teeth felt really clean with the first step.  Also, the price is so much higher than regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Cleans and polishes really well!</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White left me with a clean feeling mouth &amp; teeth. It was very easy to use. Some complained about the taste, burning, and dry mouth but I have no complaints about the taste, had no burning or irritation and no dry mouth. I did use warm to hot water to rinse and maybe that helped. I only noticed a slight whitening of the teeth but that is better than none! I did use the product only once a day in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of Crest 3D White was attractive packaging. I did use it for two weeks to get the full effects. The taste was too hot for my liking. Also, my mouth felt very dry for about ten minutes after using the toothpaste. However, after each brushing my teeth did feel very clean and smooth, almost like having had a professional cleaning at the dentist. Having two steps is a little bit of a hassle, but hopefully this 2-step process was tested. It is suggested to use first step for 1 minute then 2nd step for 1 minute. I extended both times because I think my teeth are cleaner when I brush for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful to Crest and Shopper&#x27;s Army for letting me test this amazing product for free. I&#x27;d wanted to try it for sometime but I just wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work well enough to be worth the cost. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! My teeth weren&#x27;t horribly dingy but because I am a heavy tea drinker they do get noticeably stained! This Crest 3D White gave me a noticeable difference from the very first use! After using it for over a week my teeth are pearly white and I love it! Not only that but the paste left my mouth feeling minty fresh, crisp and very clean! This is a product I will definitely continue to use and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for fast and satisfying results!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This product is like other teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve tried. I followed the usage instructions, but didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the color of my teeth after using several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I received the Crest 3D Brilliance Cleansing system for free thanks to  Crest. I have been on a constant search for a quick, inexpensive whitening system for a while now. I&#x27;ve used whitening strips in the past but found the price, length of time it takes, and an issue with sensitivity to be against me. I&#x27;ve also tried the Crest HD system. While the HD system is similar, I received amazingly better results with the 3D Brilliance System. The 3D Brilliance kit contains two tubes. First is a Deep Cleansing toothpaste that you use for one minute. Then without rinsing, you follow up with tube 2 which is a whitening finisher. I found the first step to be tolerable. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning or stinging due to sensitivity. It does seem to make my mouth somewhat dry but other than that it was not difficult. The second step is the polisher and this used in conjunction with a power brush is where the magic happens! Be careful around your gum line as white splotches can appear if you hold your brush there too long. (these fade away after a few minutes) I again did not experience any ill affects with step two. After both steps, I found my mouth to feel completely clean and fresh. There was a noticeable difference in the whiteness after the first use that just got better with each additional use. I find that if I use the 3D Brilliance kit at night and my 3D white in the am, it&#x27;s the perfect combination. In conclusion, I believe the 3D Brilliance kit is an excellent kit and has the same if not better results than whitening strips or an office whitening system.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It delivers what is promised - which is bright shiny teeth, that look and feel like you just had a professional cleaning. My teeth are relatively white with few stains anyway, so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change with this product, but they did appear shiny and felt nice and clean - like I had just been to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> The cleaning aspect of the product was much better than normal toothpaste. My teeth felt slippery clean. The teeth lightened slightly, but due to my age and the amount of coffee and tea I drink there wasn&#x27;t a lot of whitening. I am going to continue to use the product for several weeks to see if further whitening occurs.</li>
            <li> At first I was not to sure it was doing a good job getting my teeth white, but then I happened to read the instructions and it said to use it twice a day. I was doing it once a day. Not sure I needed to read instructions on a tooth paste tube, but apparently I do. So, after using it more than a week I do see a difference. Not all &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; white better, but definitely a few shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I love the ease of whitening with this product. In just the time it takes to brush my teeth, I&#x27;ve been not only deep cleaning my teeth, I&#x27;ve also been gradually whitening my smile. I like the taste, the snap-top tubes and the way my mouth feels after using. I like this so much more than messy, awkward strips or trays.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; using Tube #1 and then Tube #2. I found that my teeth felt extremely clean, more so than any other toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used. I liked the clean feel I got when I ran my tongue over my teeth both the front and back. However, I had to use warm water when rinsing my mouth at the end of brushing because cold water hurt my teeth and mouth and my mouth had a slight burning sensation. Although my mouth felt clean it did not have a good taste. I was disappointed in the way my mouth tasted. Perhaps some mint flavoring would have helped.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> When using this product my teeth feel exceptionally clean. The flavor is just right - not too minty and not to mild.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Love how white my teeth are now. the crest 3d white really works and is easier to use than I previously thought it would be. every one has noticed the new whiter teeth and have asked if I spent a fortune at the dentist office. I&#x27;m happy to tell them that it was less expensive than that and painless too!</li>
            <li> Achieving a whiter smile in two easy, refreshing and love that smile steps is possible, with the addition of Crest 3D White to your oral hygiene routine. After following this easy 2 step and wow, I love the results routine for two weeks I find I am flashing the pearly whites with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;A little lack luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I found the Crest 3 D White a little lack luster. I had reviewed one in January that I thought was much better! I don&#x27;t love the taste of this one. My teeth don&#x27;t feel especially clean and I don&#x27;t think they got whiter. I was expecting more out of it!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Your mouth will feel fresher and your teeth will sparkle.  Much easier to use then the white strips and easier too.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent, but when I received it, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the similarities in packaging to Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health HD two-step system, which I&#x27;ve been using thanks to a previous BzzCampaign.  I happened to have the package laying around.  The difference?  Absolutely none, unless you count the &amp;#34;blue 1&amp;#34; coloring in the HD cleanser.  Huh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is of selling a product under two different names, and that bothers me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the positives and negatives.  I love how well the deep cleansing toothpaste cleans.  My mouth has never felt cleaner than when I&#x27;m using this product (or the HD stuff, which is the same).  And while I personally wasn&#x27;t noticing significant whitening, I didn&#x27;t exactly have the most yellow teeth to begin with -- and my dental hygienist went out of her way to ask me if I&#x27;d ever whitened my teeth before, because they looked so great.  So I guess it must be working after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really struggle with, though, are the two steps.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of doing each step for a minute, because I feel like I&#x27;m rushing through on both minutes and missing spots.  As a result, I brush with the deep-cleansing toothpaste for two minutes, then follow up with the finisher for one minute.  But this makes my overall brushing regimen take longer, which is frustrating.  Also, when I&#x27;m half-asleep before bed, I commonly forget the second step altogether.  I&#x27;m nervous about doing this too frequently because the active ingredient in the deep-cleansing toothpaste is known to stain teeth.  I feel like the second step is there to help counteract that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also pretty put off by the cost.  While it works great, I just can&#x27;t justify spending this much on toothpaste on a regular basis.  But if you&#x27;re really looking for a good clean, some pearly whites, and don&#x27;t mind paying extra for that, the product definitely does work.</li>
            <li> I was part of the Army Shopper mission and tested this product. My teeth are very yellow due to being given high doses of antibiotics when I was young. They will never become white again but this product definitely make them less yellow and shinier.</li>
            <li> The two step system did the job of whitening and cleaning my teeth. I took time to watch the clock and brushed longer than I usually do. When I rinse my gums hurt so I have not been able to use the product twice a day. They may have hurt from cleaning better.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This did a better job than I was expecting it to. To start let me say that our family usually buys Colgate toothpaste products but once in a while we get Crest so this was a new experience for me. First off the taste-was good and did not have a chalky aftertaste. Fairly simple instructions-you only have to add one step when you are brushing your teeth. Noticed a change- not completely white but a definite brighter smile. My wife mentioned it to me a few days ago so that is a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable-would try if you are thinking of trying it!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free as a member of Shopper Army. I found that the toothpaste noticeably whitened my teeth in about a week. It did cause sensitivity after about 5 days. At that time, I began using the toothpaste only once a day until the sensitivity passed (after 2 days). Then I began using the toothpaste daily again. After a week, I began not following the directions. I used step 1 for 2 minutes on all my teeth. And I used step 2 (the whitening paste) only on my teeth visible when I smile (those usually covered by whitening strips). I didn&#x27;t see any point in whitening teeth not visible especially since they became sensitive. Great toothpaste overall!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White After using it I noticed a huge difference.Nothing like before.My teeth are super clean and whiter than ever before. I love how it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed. I drink tea everyday this Crest product will help prevent from stain The toothpaste combination is great for fresh breath .</li>
            <li> I am a big coffee and iced tea drinker, and although I know it stains my teeth, I can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t?) give it up. I have tried teeth whitening strips in the past, and found them not only to be time consuming, but somewhat damaging to my sensitive gums. Crest 3D White seems to be the answer, by adding a simple little step to my normal brushing routine, and with no harsh side effects.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> When I first received the product I was a little worried that it would make my teeth sensitive. On the first day, I did have a little sensitivity but have not had any since then. I used the product as recommended each day with a little skepticism. Took a picture the first day and have compared it to now. I am a little surprised that I have seen some whitening! After so many years of drinking coffee, tea and soda, I thought it would be a waste of time but I am seeing some results that I did not expect. I still have a long way to go but I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that the product left my teeth feeling clean and polished&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and let me tell you, I am obsessed!!! The system is super easy to use and the results are almost immediate. I have been getting lots of compliments only after three weeks of use. One minute for the cleansing toothpaste and another minute for the whitening finisher; that&#x27;s all it really takes to achieve professional looking result from this system. Thank you BzzAgent and Crest for the wonderful opportunity.</li>
            <li> I thought it would whiten my teeth more than it did. My teeth do look a little whiter though. I got better results than I have with any other toothpaste. I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Thank to Crest, I was able to try this product for free ! And am I glad I got the chance to! This product is AMAZING. Within a week of using it I started to notice that my teeth were shinier and whiter. By the three week mark, others had begun to notice that my teeth were whiter as well. My only complain is that the toothpaste is incredibly minty, like so minty it burns a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love how my teeth feel after using the product. I&#x27;m not sure that they were whitened but the definitely had that polished feel you get after a professional teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped keep my teeth whiter than before, even when I would eat stuff that usually stained. would help keep it looking great.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free as a promotional product from Crest and BzzAgent. I would have to say I am not a fan of how sensitive it made my teeth feel. Even breathing in caused my teeth to hurt.  I had to stop using after about 2 weeks of use. I would say that it did seem to start whitening, but I just couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore.</li>

Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I found it was pleasant to use, but didn&#x27;t really whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> At first glance I was skeptical. I have tried whitening products in the past with no success. I did not have high hopes for this one either. The packaging was fine. The cardboard bottom could have gotten wet and possibly torn, but that is a little thing. A two part system, hmmmm....not so sure about this. Time to test. Upon testing I first notice the taste and texture of part 1, it was gritty and had a mild minty type taste. Not bad. I figured the grittiness served to scrub the teeth. Now for part 2. This seems to be a gel form of peroxide. It did not have the best taste to it, but it was bearable. I noticed a burn with part 2. The bubbles filled my mouth as my gums burned. It was not the most enjoyable experience, but I knew that it was like putting peroxide on a dirty wound. My gums were sensitive throughout the day. I continued this process for two weeks. Around day 4 the burning stopped. I noticed around week 2 a slight whitening, not a major difference. Over the 2 weeks of trials, I no longer had an issue with the taste or burning. Overall I like the product. It is a little burdensome to have it in 2 different tube, especially if you have to travel.</li>
            <li> I got to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent. I love how well the deep cleansing toothpaste cleans. My mouth feels great after using the product and there isn&#x27;t sensitivity like I have experienced with other whitening products. However, I did not notice any  significant whitening. My teeth are generally pretty white, but they could always be whiter, and that just didn&#x27;t happen with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like the two steps. I spend two minutes with each because I want to make sure all my teeth are cleaned properly but that then doubles my brushing time. Some days, I just don&#x27;t have that extra time. Also, I don&#x27;t like the fact that it tells you not to rinse between the two. That just doesn&#x27;t feel right to me. When I received my package, one of the tubes was opened and had leaked out slightly. I&#x27;m not sure whose to blame for that, but it is a turn off right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the deep cleaning really works and I love that. But it doesn&#x27;t whiten much and it&#x27;s just too expensive for toothpaste. I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay, just for the deep cleaning aspect.</li>

Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;This product has a nice taste. It is easy to use and although it does take more work than a regular toothpaste, it is diffenantly worth the try, as this is not expensive as in a dental office for whitening. Probably use it for longer than this trial period for best results. I have seen a difference in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Put Your Smile Forward !!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a buzz agent  promotion from crest to try for free and love it! It&#x27;s much faster than whitening strips taking only 2 minutes to get awesome white teeth. The only downside would be that this toothpaste causes minor gum irritation which can be painful so I would not recommend using it for daily use but definitely an everyother day must have! Since using Crest 3d white brilliance toothpaste I have gotten many complements on my pearly white smile (:</li>
            <li> Yikes. So, three stars because there was noticeable whitening. But minus-two stars because the second step turned my gums white almost instantly! The white-gums go away within an hour or so, but it was a bit concerning that it would even happen. I am not finishing the tubes since I am concerned what they are doing to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review.</li>
            <li> I received this kit through a bzz campaign.  I was extremely excited as I have wanted to try a new whitening product. The instructions are very simple,  brush for 1 minute with the cleaner,  spit, the brush for 1 minute with the whitener.  Unlike other reviews that I have read,  I don&#x27;t mind the taste at all. My mouth feels very refreshed and clean after every use. I have definitely noticed that my teeth are whiter. The only complaint that I have is that you need to be careful when using the whitening product,  try to avoid it touching your gums,  it will burn slightly and temporarily turn them white. I also was expecting a more dramatic difference in my teeth,  but I did see an improvement. I will continue to use this product for sure!</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening system is quite strong and abrasive. I would probably suggest you read through the ingredients and make sure that you are fine with all the active ingredients which may be a little harsh for sensitive teeth and gum. The result is not quite visible, but I would still like to give a try for longer since I have only used it for 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> After using the product for some time, it exceeded my expectations. I won&#x27;t say my teeth are blindingly white now, but they do look better. I also feel like the product helped prevent more stains from my constant coffee drinking. It feels weird on your teeth if you use one product and not the other so it&#x27;s important to do both steps. But the product did not cause increased oral sensitivity or weaker teeth unlike a lot of other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Crest 3D White Brilliance System through BzzAgent for free. I really like how it has whiten my teeth with non of the harsh effects and sensitivity that some whitening systems do. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Crest products so I uphold them to a high level, and they succeeded. I will purchase again in the future for my whitening needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this toothpaste! I received this set in my Bzzz kit, and couldn&#x27;t be happier! It not only tastes good, but it actually whitens! I seen results in a week. Visibly whiter!</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and tea. Needless to say, my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they could be, so in addition to my regular whitening toothpaste I resort to OTC whitening treatments from time to time. I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, to try and review. Claiming to keep your teeth up to 99% as white as a professional polish/teeth whitening treatment, this product makes some tall claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step system is simple - brush with the blue tube for one minute, spit, then brush with the white tube for one minute. Implementing this regimen in place of your normal toothpaste is supposed to give you a dazzling, professional-grade smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, if you can get past the taste. This toothpaste is sweetened with sucralose, which I find intolerable (as do many people). On top of the taste, it has an extra-gritty texture for increased abrasion. This is an old-school method of whitening because it essentially buffs away the stains...taking precious enamel with it. You can decide if the cosmetic results are worth the damage; for me, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fluoride this product contains for anti-cavity purposes is not the usual one we see, sodium fluoride. This instead contains stannous fluoride which, surprisingly, can cause staining - and it is even disclaimed on the packaging! Makes a lot of sense in a whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel in step two is nothing more than a peroxide-based gel on steroids; you should probably not actually brush with this. Following the instructions turned my upper gums white in the single minute I used to brush; this is indicative of tissue damage. A product like this should ONLY be used with a tray that can isolate the gel to the tooth&#x27;s surface, protecting the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using it again, and I definitely would not buy it. If you don&#x27;t hate sucralose, have flawless, strong teeth, and only wish to lift everyday stains (like coffee), this may work for you. It is a pretty big fail for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details/review in greater depth at http://www.beautyskeptic.com/?p&#x3D;3276</li>
            <li> I got to try this product out free thanks to BzzAgent and Crest. I am a big coffee and soda drinker and was pleased that I was able to try this out and see what it could do for my darker stained teeth. I could notice a difference within a weeks time that I had a brighter, lighter smile. This product system only takes an extra minute of your time and it is well worth it for what it can do for your smile and your pocket book compared to dentist office whitening treatments!! Go for it, its definitely worth the time, money and your new smile.</li>
            <li> I received the brand new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for testing purposes thanks for Crest. I have tried the Crest whitening product in the past but could not use it because of the taste. This new product is completely different and has a great minty taste. I highly recommend this product. I noticed a difference in my teeth with only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a trial as part of BzzAgent. I havent tried a product like this before because I have very sensitive and crooked teeth so I cant use things like the strips or anything that has a mouth plate. The first step tastes a lot like the blue sparkle tooth paste that I used as a kid. You brush for 1 minute with it and spit but do not rinse. This part leaves my mouth feeling rather gross.... Then you apply step 2 for a minute and it tastes like hydrogen peroxide gel. After this step is completed rinse. It&#x27;s really simple, works really well and it doesnt seem to add any extra time to my morning or nightly routine. The one problem I do have with it is my teeth seem overly sensitive now. I expected that because I have problems with it anyway. Over all the product is worth it. It does a great job and is quick and simple. It&#x27;s great for people with very crooked teeth like me because it works better than a whitening toothpaste and doesnt need to conform to fit your teeth like strips or mouth plates.</li>
            <li> I received my Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System from Crest to use and review. This system works wonderfully. It actually whitens my teeth and I don&#x27;t have to sit around with a tray or strips on my teeth. All it takes it 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes in the evening. If you use it as directed I am positive that you will also see results. I am very happy with the way this product whitens. I&#x27;ve had to tell my husband and children to not touch it because they&#x27;ve all seen how white and bright my teeth are. The best thing about this system is that there is no nasty tasting gel. Anyone can whiten their teeth with this product as long as you have 4 minutes a day and a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent. My husband and I both used this to try it out, and neither of us will be repurchasing. The toothpaste (first bottle) wasn&#x27;t all that bad, but the second finishing treatment made my mouth burn and left my cheeks with irritated patches inside. While I did have slight whitening thanks to the product, it wasn&#x27;t enough to warrant the bad taste or side effects. I will stick to one time treatment options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I can tell it has got my teeth whiter.  And its so easy and fast to use!  Not time consuming at all! I&#x27;ve been trying the product for free thanks to Crest®.</li>
            <li> The product promises that it keeps your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish with daily use 4 weeks after a dental cleaning. I swapped out my Optic White toothpaste for this two step system and so far love the results. They are whiter to me and i&#x27;m noticing less build up when I go to floss.  Yes, the main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide but oh well, you know that already.  I have a noticeably whiter smile after just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently quit smoking and wanted to step up my teeth&#x27;s whitness. I have tried almost all whitening toothpastes with very lackluster results. I got a BzzAgent kit and got to try the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System FREE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before and I&#x27;ve definitely used my fair share of whitening products. I received this for free thanks to Crest and I think this works great as a quick whitening system since you&#x27;re already brushing your teeth every day anyway! It does leave my mouth/lips feeling dry for a little while after brushing but it&#x27;s not horrible. That would be my only complaint about it. I did notice my teeth getting whiter after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have received this product free as a promotion from Crest and through the site of BzzAgent. I am definitely surprised that this product has worked so well for me. At first, when I started using this 2 step system I didn&#x27;t really think I would like it. While trying the 1st step, I noticed that my teeth felt a little gritty and they burned. Then I tried the 2nd step that taster a little funky but I knew it was a whitener so I expected that. Although, I was very happy about these things.. I realized that they were helping whiten my teeth and keep them fresh. I even noticed throughout the day that my teeth stayed cleaner and felt fresher. After that day, I have nothing bad to say about this product. I highly recommend this product to everyone. I don&#x27;t think I would use it on children, because it is a whitening product and could potentially be dangerous. Other than that, I will continue to purchase this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent, When I received the package I was super excited because I had been looking for something that would actually work on my teeth. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with this. The first step makes my teeth feel SUPER clean, and it lasts! The second step is especially great because my teeth are not perfectly straight, so by brushing in the paste, I&#x27;m able to get every spot!</li>
            <li> I have hidden my teeth when I smile. I have dark spots where my they are stained. I was sent this to review from bzzagent. I&#x27;ve heard awful things about self whitening kits. They that they streak your teeth, strip your teeth, and they don&#x27;t look naturally white. The people that say these things have never tried this. I&#x27;m really in awe. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. My teeth really look different!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a two step system. You clean, then you whiten.I have only one small complaint. It really dries out my mouth after use. It goes back to normal. It only last a few minutes, but it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;I have no streaks, no discoloration and it looks so natural. Someone I work with even noticed. I&#x27;m so excited about this product and I&#x27;ll be purchasing when I need it! I love that there isn&#x27;t any strips to mess with or leave on paste. It&#x27;s just brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I drink a lot of coffee. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my teeth actually were. The first time I used this I saw results!!! My teeth looked brighter and felt cleaner. The clean feeling stayed all day. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and the results have been great. It&#x27;s so easy to use compared with other teeth whitening kits. My teeth are at least a few shades whiter and feel so clean. I am trying this product free thanks to crest but this in no way swayed how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample from BzzAgent of this Excellent toothpaste. After just a few uses I feel there&#x27;s definitely an improvement over my prior all-in-one (including whitening) toothpaste. (Not to mention it is better tasting)  I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing. My husband even noticed his teeth were whiter, after one use! (and he doesn&#x27;t notice much, lol!)This is a great product and one I&#x27;m definitely keeping in my cabinet. Super affordable, WORKS, tastes wonderful and does not bother my gums or teeth. Highly Recommended!!</li>
            <li> Omg i love crest 3D daily it leaves my mouth feeling so minty clean. I am 2 weeks in and I can see my teeth are getting brighter and I love it. #gotitfree #Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> OK, as many people are like me and the thought of yet another whitening product and the taste..YUCK....Well I got it free to try and do as BzzAgent. I was so shocked that I did not mind the taste! The 2 steps are nothing more than what you do every morning to clean your teeth anyway! Step 2 is a a little weird after taste BUT nothing like all ones I have tried before. You can actually tolerate this one and not gag!&lt;br /&gt;Not only the taste but I compared via photos after 7 days and WOW...I am highly impressed with Crest. Not only I can tolerate taste but the actual product works. Thank You Crest for finally a product I can like the taste and works!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product and it is by far the best whitening treatment they have! I drink coffee 5 days a week at work and that cannot be good for your teeth. My teeth are not as white as I would like, but I don&#x27;t care too much about whitening strips and I don&#x27;t want to pay all the money to go get them whitened. I received the opportunity to try Crest 3D White Brilliance 2-Step System for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step system is simple and very comparable to just brushing your teeth. The time recommended by the dentist is to brush for 2 minutes, so brushing with the blue tube for one minute and then the white tube is simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only downfall is the taste. If you have used the strips before, it is the same taste. I think the texture is very similar to regular toothpaste, but if you are sensitive to texture it might not be recommended due to the mixture of the taste and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this once a week, but I can tell a difference and would by this again. I am very happy with the crest brad.</li>
            <li> I received these to test from BzzAgent and they are amazing. I can tell such a difference in my teeth already. I normally have problems with whitening toothpaste causing my teeth to hurt but I have not had any problems with this.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and wine. So my teeth aren&#x27;t exactly pure white. I received this crest 3D white brilliance set from bzzagent to try and review. It has worked wonders! My teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter! This is a pretty amazing product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Bzzagent. I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this whitening system, but felt that the actual results fell a little flat. The two step system made me feel like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting really clean. You are supposed to use the Step 1 product for one minute and then spit (do not rinse) and &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; with the Step 2 product. Both tasted terrible and I just never felt like I ended up with really a really clean mouth. That being said, maybe that is not what this product is designed to do, but it is part of what I expected from a toothpaste. RESULTS.  I have used this product consistently for about three weeks now, and continue to use it in hopes that I see some good results, but so far the lesson that I have learned is that good result pictures are all about the lighting! I took my before photo the day the product arrived and my teeth looked surprisingly white in natural light. two weeks later after consistently using the product I photographed my smile in my bathroom and found that my teeth looked more stained that at the start. If I flipped the photos I&#x27;m sure I could convince people that I got a great result from this product, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m here for. Best of luck and I hope you end up with better results than I did.</li>
            <li> It requires two steps which takes a bit of extra time, but not much. I felt it did make my teeth noticeably whiter. I felt like it made my teeth and mouth very clean. It does have a different taste compared to normal toothpaste, but I am willing to have a different taste for sparkly white teeth! I prefer this method to the whitening trays or strips.</li>
            <li> After using this the first time, I immediately noticed my teeth were squeaky clean and smooth just like a fresh polish from the dentist. This has not caused any sensitivity and I have been using for 3 weeks now. The strips normally do so I was excited that this didn&#x27;t. I received this as a promotion from crest for free and appreciate the opportunity to try such a great product!!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical that the 3D Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening system was a ploy by P&amp;G to make twice the profit off of the same product they already sell in a smaller tube. Thanks to BzzAgent, an awesome site that allows consumers to try and review products so that you don&#x27;t have to waste money on the &amp;#34;highly marketed-brain-washed-advertising-to-buy-it&amp;#34; items; I can share with you the truth of the new 3D white Crest toothpaste (Thank you Crest!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you do have to get used to the taste but that&#x27;s what I like! After finishing both steps, I have the tingling sensation of feeling like I just left the dentist office. There are two steps involved in this process but that is the beauty, you will spend more time concentrating on brushing your teeth thoroughly rather than up down, back forward, spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with my teeth, they have calcium build up that was an inherited trait, so they look like they have spots. This has been hard for me to whiten because the whitening solutions have always made the spots brilliant white and the rest of the enamel did not match. This Crest product has been consistent, not over whitening, which has made for a more even smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am proud to say I fully support this product, maybe it won&#x27;t work as well for you, but it sure has for my teeth!! Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent. I think this is a great concept but I had to discontinue use of the product because my gums became inflamed and my teeth were so sensitive it hurt to even breathe with my mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any significant staining or have not had your teeth professionally cleaned recently you will not see dramatic results. This is more of a maintenance product than a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of just two minutes to help whiten my teeth due too drinking coffee and tea daily, however Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily &amp; Cleansing Whitening System is making my teeth sensitive. The whole concept is great though - brush teeth for one minute with the cleansing toothpaste then brush another minute with the finisher toothpaste. So simple, easy to use, and time saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did gave the toothpaste a second try however it made my teeth sensitive again and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> After receiving this whitening kit from BzzAgent I was pretty excited to try it out! Whitening your teeth within your daily routine sounded perfect. It actually is pretty easy but the results aren&#x27;t amazing. The step #1 toothpaste doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans your teeth as well as regular toothpaste. It leaves your teeth feeling a little grimy after so I ended up brushing with my own toothpaste first (adding an additional step). Step #2, the gel, is what seems to work but the results do not compare to strips or trays. If you really want to see results I wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit. Results are moderate.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product. I was given a free sample from BzzAgent courtesy of Crest and was hesitant. I didn&#x27;t want that fake white look, or uneven whitening because my teeth are crooked, and I really didn&#x27;t want the baking soda taste.  So far none of that. It very evenly whites my teeth and they look naturally white and not stripped. I might be most pleased white the fresh taste it leaves in my mouth. It just leaves my mouth feeling clean. Plan to continue to use and buy.</li>
            <li> I received this project for free from BzzAgent.  This is great system.  The results seem to appear almost immediately!  Step 2 gives your teeth a super clean, polished look right away, making you feel and look awesome!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good stuff; I got it as a sample from the brand through BzzAgent.  It doesn&#x27;t taste awful, and you&#x27;re gonna brush your teeth anyway.  I&#x27;ve seen some pretty remarkable results in 2 weeks.  I would suggest this for anyone who is too lazy to sit with those strips on your teeth all day.  WAY easier, same results.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I have used the whitening strips in the past and always use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash. I was pleasantly surprised to find that when I first began using Crest 3D Whitening System, my teeth did not become overly sensitive, as was my experience in the past using whitening strips. My teeth feel cleaner after I get done brushing then with any other kind of toothpaste and they look a lot whiter, too! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to put in words just how THRILLED I am with the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System! I have tried many, many different whitening toothpastes, gels, strips, lights to get rid of stubborn coffee stains. Each product has left me unsatisfied-whether it was from the shade of my teeth or to how much my teeth hurt afterwards. Rest assured, I have found my go to whitening product that I am absolutely in love with. Crest hit it out of the ballpark with this whitening system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one is a cleansing system. I squeeze a pea size amount onto my toothbrush which is plenty. This step honestly makes me feel like I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office. The paste has a tiny amount of grit in it to make your teeth feel super clean. I love how my mouth feels after using this step. In just one minute, I feel like my mouth has never been cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two is the whitening gel. Again, in just one minute, your teeth are brighter, whiter, and all around more sparkly than before. I was worried I would feel sensitivity at step two. However, I never once felt any sensitivity or pain after! This is a huge deal to me. I usually feel like someone is stabbing me with pins and needles after whitening my teeth. I wish I was kidding with that, but that&#x27;s how sensitive my teeth are. Again, not one side effect almost a month later. Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Whole process only takes two minutes&lt;br /&gt;-BRILLIANT white teeth with results within a week&lt;br /&gt;-Banished my stubborn coffee stains&lt;br /&gt;-Whitened my canines which no product has ever done successfully&lt;br /&gt;-Teeth feel super clean&lt;br /&gt;-Absolutely zero sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;NONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do yourself a favor. Go grab this Cleansing and Whitening system immediately. Your whole mouth will thank you. Your teeth will never have looked better! Thanks Crest and BzzAgent for letting me try this amazing product. I have a new staple in my daily routine and am beyond thrilledwith my results. Never again will I need another whitening product!</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s cleaning as I&#x27;m brushing and making my teeth whiter. Still need to wait long enough to see a result, but my teeth feel super clean and fresh after brushing! I also don&#x27;t mind the taste and it helps me brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes. Thanks to Crest, I did get to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Brillance is awesome!  I have uber sensitive teeth, but want a nice white smile like everyone else....this gives it to you.  Just by using two simple steps.  It&#x27;s so simple, all you do is brush!  Thanks Bzz for sending me this great product to try.  I&#x27;m sold;). #agentjono #smilyJen</li>
            <li> #GotItFree&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest I was able to try out the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleaning % Whitening system. It&#x27;s a two step process which includes a cleaning paste followed up by a whitening polish. One minute of each. It&#x27;s supposed to brighten your smile. I&#x27;m still waiting for visible results, but overall I think that it would work if given enough time. This system is very much like the Crest HD system I had tried in the past. I would recommend it, however you cannot expect immediate results.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent! I have been using this for two weeks and I already see a pretty dramatic difference. I also use the whitestrips, but I&#x27;m loving the toothpaste, because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t taste quite as bad as the gel on the strips! I can&#x27;t wait to see the final outcome. I&#x27;ve never had a professional whitening done before, but I can almost bet by the time I&#x27;m done, it would be close. I just hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and have found that my teeth are much whiter than before. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the dry mouth you get after brushing. I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s better to put the #2 step gel on with a Q-tip as opposed to a toothbrush. I have not noticed any sensitivity issues like I&#x27;ve had with previous whitening products and that&#x27;s a big plus for me. I will probably continue using.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste made my mouth feel like I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trialing this product for about two weeks now thanks to BzzAgent. At first I was hesitant because I was adding a second tube of toothpaste to my brushing routine. Surprisingly, this couldn&#x27;t be any easier! It only recommends brushing for one minute per tube...I try to brush my teeth for two minutes with my regular toothpaste anyway. No extra time needed out of my day! I feel my teeth are fairly white on their own; I try to stay away from drinks that will stain my teeth. I&#x27;ve been amazed at the transformation of my self proclaimed &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth. I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this. Aside from the whitening power, it leaves my teeth feeling extra clean, more so than with any other toothpaste I have EVER used. As I&#x27;m writing this, it has been about seven hours since I last brushed. They feel as smooth and clean as they did this morning! When paired with my electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m getting amazing results! It is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I love Crest 3D White Brilliance!  It makes my teeth feel amazing and clean.. Like I just left the dentist&#x27;s chair!  My teeth seem a little whiter after 3 weeks, but they were pretty white to begin with so I was not expecting a dramatic change for myself.  The two tubes are easy to use and also easy to tell apart, even on a sleepy morning.  This is such an easy process.... It takes maybe 15 seconds longer than using regular toothpaste and its so much easier than the strips or gel to leave on your teeth.  I love it, and I will keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree.  #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I recieved this kit to try for free from Crest via  Bzzagent, and I was really excited to try it. I wanted to wait a while before I wrote my review to see if I noticed any whitening, and not only did I notice my teeth were whiter but other people did too! I did feel a little burning or tingling while using the second paste but nothing so intense that I&#x27;d stop using it. I really like how smooth my teeth feel, my husband said my teeth look like I just left the dentist, all clean, white &amp; polished! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from whitening products because they seem to really bother my sensitive teeth, so I was very surprised that this did not! I got this product as a promotion through BzzAgent (great website) and as an avid coffee drinker and, now, ex-smoker I have always wanted whiter teeth and this helped a little. It was not a cure all extreme teeth whitening product but I can say it did help. I would recommend this product to people who have sensitive teeth and want a little extra whitening boost. I will buy this product after I am done.</li>
            <li> I use the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System every night and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth. In the past, I&#x27;ve used Crest 3D Whitestrips and those worked great, but they were so unnatural for me. With the Cleansing &amp; Whitening System, I don&#x27;t have to do anything out of my normal bedtime schedule. I just used the two-step system to brush my teeth and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything out of the ordinary, like wait 30 minutes, then peel the whitestrips off. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural, quick, and easy way to get whiter teeth, I would recommend Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System!&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me for review purposes by BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have been eligible for this through BzzAgent. I LOVE a white smile and have been a loyal customer to the Crest 3D White brand. I am pleased to say that this really does brighten your smile! it&#x27;s a 2 step process so it was fun at first and then became a slight chore. Still worth it, though! It&#x27;s an easy (and inexpensive) way to get that bright, white smile!</li>
            <li> I received a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through BzzAgent and Crest. I was very excited about this as I had been wanting to get my teeth whitened professionally for a while now but hadn&#x27;t had the time to do so.  I am an avid diet soda drinker and know that it is not good for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is very simple!  It will add no time to your current teeth brushing.  You just use tube 1 to clean your teeth.  It is a lightly gritty feeling paste. You brush and spit. Then you put tube 2 on your brush. You brush, spit, and rinse.  Done and done!  It is amazingly easy and after you&#x27;re done your teeth feel soo smooth and are whiter right off the bat! I love running my tongue across my teeth as soon as I am done brushing them.  It feels like you just got out of the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviews had concerns about possible staining when using this product but I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all. I have sensitive teeth usually and had no issues with this system making my teeth any more sensitive which was one of my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was so impressed with the whitening that he has started using it as well! I will definitely be purchasing more when this runs out!  I have recommended it to many people already and definitely think you should give it a try!</li>
            <li> I started using the crest brilliance system about a month ago.  I was able to notice a difference in about 3 days.  I like this much better than the white strips.  I used them a few years ago and they made my teeth very sensitive.  I didn&#x27;t have that issue with this initially, however after a couple weeks I could tell my teeth were becoming a little more sensitive so I started using it only once a day.  Even with once a day, my teeth are very noticeably whiter.  People I don&#x27;t know well comment on how white my teeth are.  While I did receive this product free to try out, I can honestly say this is the easiest way to get whiter teeth quickly.  The gel in the second step seems to be similar to the gel in the white strips but isn&#x27;t as gross since you&#x27;re just brushing with it then rince it off.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations that this product was going to remove or at least lighten a stain on one of my teeth. I used the product faithfully for 5 weeks prior to my regular 6 month dental exam checkup. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes whatsoever. The dental hygienist was able to remove the stain from my tooth in under a minute. The tube labeled #1 was very abrasive to my gums and was not a smooth clean like my normal paste. It was a little painful even. I suppose that&#x27;s how it is supposed to work to give you that deep down clean?! The tube labeled #2 did give me some white spots on my gums and made them tingle, but this did not last long. It was in the list of side effects. Overall, I didn&#x27;t mind using the product but like my normal routine better. I will stick with that and see my dentist every six months! (I tried this product for free thanks to Crest!)</li>
            <li> So I was able to try crest 3D white brilliance daily cleansing and whiting system for free. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now  and the toothpaste did make my teeth feel clean the whiting part didn&#x27;t really seem to whiten my teeth much and I didn&#x27;t really like the taste of it</li>
            <li> I recently received this product to review from BzzAgent. I&#x27;m always looking for new products to whiten my teeth, and I drink a lot of tea and soda so it&#x27;s an ongoing struggle. I had high hopes for this product based on many positive reviews that I had read. However, after 2 days it caused me a lot of sensitivity.  I can&#x27;t really give this a review of the whitening, but if your sensitive to a lot of whitening products this may not be the item to buy.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of receiving Crest 3D White Brilliance System as part of my honest feedback from bzzagent. I was in the market for a new teeth whitening product and was excited to try this. Instructions are very clear and easy. Its only 2 steps so its not a very long time consuming routine. After using it 2 weeks, I saw a difference in the brightness of my teeth. The stains I had due to my daily coffee intake was starting to fade. After 4 weeks, I have a smile that I am very proud of showing off. This product truly works! My only complaint is the taste of the toothpastes. I am used to the fresh tasting mint flavors of crest and you do not get that from this whitening system. Is it a reason to not buy again? Probably not, but it would be nice to have and would improve the product. Either way, great results and easy to use, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try Crest 3D daily cleansing &amp; whitening system in return for my feedback. Initially I thought the product could not be used in place of my everyday toothpaste for fear that it would cause my gums/teeth to become too sensitive, as they already are sensitive. However, after a few uses I discovered I was wrong and began using the 2 step system every time I brushed. The system also brightened and whitened my smile after just a few uses. I have used Crest 3D white strips and this beats them by far, and at a much cheaper price. Step one gives your mouth that just left the dentist clean feeling, while step two polishes them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be it takes a few uses to get used to leaving step one on without rinsing before step two. Out of habit I would start to rinse after step one and would have to stop myself.</li>
            <li> My review was participation with Shoppers Army.Awesome whitening, mild taste.  Teeth feel very clean after use. Easy to use.  Only downside was an annoying aftertaste.</li>
            <li> This is very much like the HD white although they added a flavoring to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth so I can&#x27;t use these everyday but they do remove coffee and tea staining. My teeth feel squeaky clean after use and fresh mouth feeling lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used before, this is a two part system. You just squeeze a small amount from number one bottle and brush for a minute. Then you do not rinse, and add a small amount from number two bottle and brush for another minute. No trays or strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this whitening system for the past several weeks. I love it! My teeth feel fresh from the dentist. In between the toothpaste and whitening gel, my teeth felt pretty gritty. But after using the gel, they felt so smooth! At first I thought I saw a difference in my teeth shade, but now they seem the same as usual. It makes your teeth feel good, but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job of whitening.  And I did receive this free from Crest.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Crest 3D White system. The toothpaste worked wonderfully at giving my teeth a good, thorough cleaning. I also loved the minty flavor. In addition, the whitening paste was pleasant enough to use. I did notice a slight whitening after a couple of weeks of usage. I would recommend this system because it is an effective product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that after a few days of using the product, my gums became very sore, like a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> It works, by what i mean it cleans your teeth. Easy to use, just too strong for me. As it caused me pain while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this set. I have always wanted whiter teeth but I have pretty sensitive teeth and usually have to use a sensitive toothpaste. With that being said, I was a little skeptical to try this out. I was pleasantly surprised though! This was really gentle on my teeth and since I only used it at night, I was still able to use my sensitive toothpaste in the morning. I might have gotten results sooner if I used it twice a day, but I wanted some of the safety of what I usually use to keep my teeth used to the normal. I did notice a difference in the shade of my teeth! It might not have been as drastic as I had hoped but that came with the territory. This is something that I could definitely see myself buying in the future to keep the whitening going strong.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>

Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I found the product very easy to use. The Step 1 was a very good cleaning toothpaste with some abrasive in it so I felt it did a great job of cleaning my teeth. It had a very pleasant and refreshing flavor. The Step 2 was also very easy to use and had a pleasant flavor very similar to Step 1. Using both products gave me a very clean feeling for my teeth. After using the product for a few days I felt as if my teeth looked whiter but that could have been my imagination. I am a big coffee and tea drinker so I do suffer from stains, my teeth looked good!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Clean and Brite</li>
            <li> I found the product to be easy to use, not bad tasting, and what I can to expect from Crest brand. Overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!</li>
            <li> This product was overall wonderful. The taste was great. I really felt the difference in the two products and felt like my teeth were so clean when I was done using it. I do think it took some stains from coffee off of my teeth. I found it very easy to use and can see my self using this product from this point on.</li>
            <li> I received the crest 3d whitening through bzzagent. I have been looking for a whitening product that works. This product not only works but it makes my mouth feel so clean. It is like just after a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product that left my teeth whiter and smoother. I noticed a dramatic difference after two to three days and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> When I use the Crest 3D White, my mouth feels like I just had a professional cleaning. My teeth are a little whiter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found that telling me all the steps to use it turned me off immediately and to tell you the truth I never started the regiment. I brush my teeth when I am sleepy going to bed or sleepy just getting up and I never remembered to do the program. I just could not spend time reading directions for a process I have been doing for most of my life. Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I first used this product last Sunday, Aug. 31, 2015. My first impression of the toothpaste was that I tasted a hint of baking soda and the polish was very tingly in my mouth. My teeth did feel clean. On Monday after using the product my mouth and teeth felt very clean even after I had my coffee. I had the same feeling on Tues. Today I seem to see a bit of a shime to my teeth that I don&#x27;t think was there before. I also felt that my mouth and teeth were clean all day. I really like this product and intend to continue using.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the product at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would cause too much extra work in my normal routine. Once I tried it, I realized that it didn&#x27;t really change my routine at all, which made me much more open to using it. I wasn&#x27;t really sure about the taste at first, but it grew on me after a few days. I still don&#x27;t feel like it makes my mouth feel as minty fresh as normal toothpaste, but I do like how completely clean my teeth feel after I use it. My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t really see a noticeable change in whiteness. It might be better if it came with one of those color charts so people can have something to compare to. That would make it easier to see if your teeth were actually getting whiter.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the product did whiten my teeth, although not spectacularly so. My biggest complaint is the flavor of the second component. I don&#x27;t mind it while I am brushing my teeth but despite rinsing and rinsing I can&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth. Nor does it have the nice fresh taste I appreciate in Crest toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Good product, bad flavor&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> I did not notice much, if any, improvement in the whiteness of my teeth while using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  I loved that is was so easy to use.  It made me want to brush my teeth!  My smile is much whiter and I could feel the cleansing action in my mouth!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White definitely held up to it&#x27;s claim; there was a noticeable difference within the first use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> his product comes in a very professional looking package. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work or it if would cause my teeth to be sensitive. I found this to be easy to use, and the two step process easy to follow. The toothpaste is a little gritty- similar to what the dentist uses and the whitener is applied over the paste after brushing and spitting out the excess, but not rinsing. I like that the whole process takes two minutes- certainly not too much time to ask. I enjoyed using this product and will continue to use it/&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Because of the harshness of the product, I only used it one time. It burned and irritated! But I loved the clean feeling of my teeth that lasted the whole day. I&#x27;d love having that every day!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;The Crest 3D White kit consists of a two step process with two separate tubes of paste. Step one deep cleans your teeth and step two polishes them up. When you are finished your teeth are literally squeaky clean. I felt like I had just come from the dentist office. The process is easy to do. You brush with step one paste for one minute, spit but do not rinse and then brush with step two paste for one minute then spit, rinse and you are ready to go. There is not a true minty flavor that you are used to with regular toothpaste and step one is more gritty and step two is more like a thin gel. Your mouth will fill a little strange and dry like you need a drink of water for a bit after you use the kit. I have found that using it twice a day as direction keeps my teeth squeaky clean all day. After using two weeks I did notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission]</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed trying Crest 3D white. Mostly because it worked! It whitened my teeth and I saw a difference in the third day. Teeth looked as white as when I go for my 6 month cleaning, or even whiter. Instructions are clearly labeled, I like the fact that each bottle has a big 1 and a 2, so you get the steps right, even if you are not wearing your glasses. This system works so well because you have to brush it on with your toothbrush, so you are able to do the front and back of teeth, unlike with strips where only the surfaces with the strip will be whitened. I also noticed that it removes tartar that usually builds up in back of the bottom front teeth. I strongly recommend you give Crest 3D white a try. You will smile with so much more confidence!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Gives you whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight improvement in the whitening of my teeth but really didn&#x27;t care for the taste or side effects of the gel.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of any difference in the whiteness of my teeth using this product. The Step 1 part left an odd feeling my mouth as I was using it. Maybe a dryness? The taste was also not that pleasant. The Step 2&#x27;s taste was also not all that palatable. I found the 2 stages to be a little awkward to do. I used my cellphone timer to help, but it seemed a lot of work for next to no gain for me. It would not be a product that I would continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a unique and easy way to whiten. The brushing easily fits into a normal routine. Step 1 really left my teeth feeling clean and smooth. I did not see significant whitening from using Step 2, though I only used it once a day and didn&#x27;t have very stained teeth to begin with. I had very little problems with sensitivity using Step 2. However, since the packaging does not list the percentage of active ingredients in this step, I have some concerns over the amount of chemicals that are being used. Overall, I would recommend this who people who wish to use a tooth whitener without having to go through a lot of fuss.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use, and tasted great!! I have tried other whitening products and was very pleased with the refreshing taste of this one!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try free of charge. Didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it because I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results after using whitening toothpastes. However, I can confidently say that I have definitely seen whiter teeth after using this for a month. Others have mentioned the less-than-stellar taste of the &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34; (kind of tastes like fennel), but it&#x27;s not that bad and my teeth feel VERY clean after brushing with both products. But most importantly, my teeth are noticeably whiter (maybe a few shades?). Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I think this 2-step whitening product is the best way to clean teeth. My teeth have not felt cleaner or looked brighter. I only used it once a day because many people said they experienced sensitivity when using twice a day. I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy way to get whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth were very yellowed before I used the product. I drink coffee and tea and they were stained from it. Regular whitening toothpaste did not help. They have never been this white before.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Good product - teeth felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell a big difference in the whitening aspect but my teeth&lt;br /&gt;were never super white anyway. May work better for some.</li>
            <li> I have been using crest 3d white brilliance as a frees sample I received from bzzagent.com. The first step is the deep cleansing paste. Brushing with the deep cleansing paste leaves my teeth very clean and fresh. It truly is a deep clean feeling. The second step is brushing with tube two without rinsing in between. This is the part I disliked. I do not like putting the toothbrush back in my mouth without rinsing it. Step two leaves my teeth shiny. The two step process leaves my mouth clean and shiny with a bright smile.</li>
            <li> I thought the Crest 3D white did a really great job of getting my mouth, teeth, and gums very clean looking and feeling. However, I did not find that it whitened my teeth at all. I took before and after pictures and I cannot tell a difference. I can&#x27;t tell a difference looking in the mirror and my husband did not notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing System for the past 2 weeks, and have been very happy with it.  It is a two part system that one uses twice a day to clean and remove stains.  It claims it can keep your smile up to 99% as white as a professional polish! I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whitened but I definitely noticed a change in my pearly whites for the better after using the product ffor a week or so - even my kids noticed!  It might sound silly but it definitely was a confidence boost, especially since I work with people all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself is really great, It takes about two minutes, the first tube is kind of gritty and the second tube that you use immediately after has a peroxide compound in it to really penetrate any stains.  I&#x27;m a moderate to heavy coffee drinker and definitely noticed results.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a complimentary sample of this, by Crest and Bzzagent but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> For the 2 weeks I have been using the product I can truly see a difference. Given more time I believe there would been even more lightening of the stains. I can see stains that were in the cracks between my front teeth getting lighter. I do realize I will never have a true white movie star smile but just less stains will be nice.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that really works!!! In just after a few days my teeth were a few shades whiter. I loved the squeaky clean feeling of my teeth after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> It whitens my teeth, however, with the next cup of coffee my teeth are yellow again.  The two-part process is a bit awkward.  My electric toothbrush is in 2 minute cycles.  I had to stop it and then start it again.  I would like to have the toothpaste in 1 tube.</li>
            <li> I had no problem using the product as instructed. The 2 step process was easy. Also I saw comments about gums burning or hurting, I did not experience any discomfort at all. I think it is a novel approach to whitening, but I would like to have seen better results.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I had the brightest, shiniest teeth while on vacation.  I found that it helped me to brush longer and more thoroughly. I love the way my teeth look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth were whiter after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> As part of the Shopper&#x27;s Army, I was invited to try this product. I really liked how clean the product got my teeth. I do believe I noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that is so easy to use and get results right away.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product was a great alternative to professional whitening systems and white strips or trays, all of which I have tried in the past. It&#x27;s great that you can get your teeth clean and whiten them at the same time in such a short amount of time. I noticed a difference within the first five days. The toothpaste had a good flavor and the only slightly negative thing would be it sometimes seemed a bit harsh in my gums. Probably user error or the fact I use a pretty powerful electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Please know I received this system for free courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent, however the opinions are my own and I have purchased a system since then. I have been a user of Crest WhiteStrips from the very beginning. I have always liked the value but it has gotten a little too expensive for regular use when one use doesn&#x27;t show much of a result. Thus I am blown away by the new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used WhiteStrips, I specifically had to wear them only at night as I knew they would cause pain and sensitivity for hours which could come and go while I slept. As you are only brushing with this new system, I did not think it could possibly be as effective as WhiteStrips, but I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Deep Cleansing toothpaste was a nice refreshing mint and seemed like the Crest toothpaste I usually use. After brushing for one minute with this, you spit and move on to the Whitining Finisher. Alright, by move on I mean put down toothbrush and unscrew the top to the finisher and carefully (it&#x27;s a little liquidy) put it on toothbrush, screw top back on (or have finisher drip onto vanity), then brush! Would really like to see the finisher have a little more substance and be in a flip top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You then brush with the finisher for one minute, which is when the magic happens! I normally use an electric toothbrush, but recommend not turning it on for Step 2, as for me it spread the paste around too much, when I mainly want to whiten the teeth that show in a smile. Step 2 also gives a bit of a burn, but it&#x27;s not necessarily bad, just seems refreshingly intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nitpicking at the tube and the consistency but the end result is AMAZING. Two minutes and my teeth are glowing!! The best part is that I have absolutely no pain or sensitivity. How is this even possible?! Crest, you have won me over with the amazing new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System!!!</li>
            <li> Overall Star Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of different products to help whiten my teeth without much success. The strips are very awkward and don&#x27;t cover all the teeth and toothpastes don&#x27;t really work allthat well. So when I was offered the opportunity to try the new Crest 3D white toothpaste I was very excited. A product from Crest has to be great!&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e been using Crest 3D for a few weeks now and I think it is a good product. No.1 really deep cleans my teeth and freshens breath-it&#x27;s a clean and a freshness you can feel. I have noticed a bit of whitening,not as much as I would like,but I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;I thought using two toothpastes would be too much,but you only use them for 1 min. each,so it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this new product to anyone,if only for the deep clean andfresh breath</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product free, courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent, and have been using it for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt healthier.  I am currently 3 months pregnant, and suffered through some bad pregnancy gingivitis during my last pregnancy.  I feel like this product has staved this off for me this time around.&lt;br /&gt;Though I initially balked at the 2-step system (why do I need to put them on separately?). My teeth FEEL clean when finished and are much whiter than with my previous routine, and that&#x27;s a good enough answer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this toothpaste going forward, well after my free sample is all used up!</li>
            <li> My first impression of the product was that I really liked the packaging (packaging is a big factor in my purchase). I loved that the two tubes came in one package.&lt;br /&gt;I love the taste - not too &amp;#34;stingy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like after using the product for a while now - is the time it takes you to brush. If you follow the directions properly and are really motivated to get a whiter smile - you have to commit 2 minutes to the brush. Doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot but truthfully when I&#x27;m tired and want to go to bed, I just want to brush. I found myself using my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste at night and the whitening toothpast (the two tubes) in the morning when I felt refreshed and more willing to commit the full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t like the way my gums would feel after using it twice a day every day. Too much on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee drinker with sensitive teeth so I gave up on whitening. As you can see in the picture crest 3D whitening paste works great</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  I have always used crest so I was thrilled to try this out. It comes with two different toothpaste you use them in the order they are marked. I have been using daily, but just one time a day. I love how white you can automatically see my teeth are after the usage.&lt;br /&gt;I love how clean my teeth feel afterwards! Like they literally sparkle! There are no beads in it to get stuck under the gums; the smell is amazing and little burn. The process was easy to do i love the way it is numbered so no trying to remember which is first.&lt;br /&gt;I love no strips to stick on the teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add I do not smoke or drink excessive amounts of soda. So my teeth are not horrifically stained, so I am unsure how this will do for a person who has been smoking for many years or who drinks lots of soda, teas, or coffee. But I did see a very noticeable difference in my teeth in 4weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used so many types of whitening products and I was skeptical of this one. I was given this product free of charge by Crest to try and give honest feedback.  I was absolutely blown away by the results. Whitening products I&#x27;ve used in the past have worked well enough but they always took the shine away from my enamel- making my teeth look chalky. This product whitens as well as anything I&#x27;ve ever used and made my teeth shiny as if they&#x27;d just been polished at the dentist. I was excited when I saw the price of it in stores. I will not be without this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the product, plus it didn&#x27;t bother my teeth like similar products have in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this product would deliver its promised results. But after using I truly did notice an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product when I began using it as I am prone to sensitive teeth. I really like this toothpaste! I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and have noticed some whitening but the best part is how clean my teeth feel all day long. It feels like I have been at the dentist for a cleaning. I only use the toothpaste once a day and take a day off every few days to use my sensitive teeth formula toothpaste so I am not sure how my teeth would react if I was using it 2 times a day as recommended. I have not had any sensitivity issues with this product though so I am going to continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
            <li> Received product for free to try and review. Saw results in about a week and now my teeth are the whitest it&#x27;s probably ever been! Not bad tasting, easy to use, and for the price why not try it! Def recommend.</li>
            <li> After the first use, began to see an improvement. Teeth appeared whiter and stains began to diminish. After a week, smile was very bright. Was unsure of a 2 step process to brush my teeth, but was very satisfied. Mouth felt like a &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27;s office&#x27; clean feeling after each use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]</li>
