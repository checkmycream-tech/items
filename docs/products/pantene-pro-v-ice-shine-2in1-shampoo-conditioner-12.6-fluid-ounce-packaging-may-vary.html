            <li>washes well and smells good.</li>
            <li>product is good as it is...and price was amazing as well...</li>
            <li>but after a week it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s good price,i love it.</li>
            <li>Does not leave any kind of oily residue and does not have an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; quick shipping</li>
            <li>I need a good 2in1 when trying to get out the door quickly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product works well, smells good, and is a light scent not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most conditioning product but most 2in1s aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is better than most.</li>
            <li>I am glad I started using it.  </li>
            <li>or when you have more time to shampoo and condition well separately</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love all Pantene products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>Light scent</li>
            <li>(The 2-1 makes it *slightly* more workable than regular shampoo, so it might be more effective on shorter/straighter</li>
            <li>My husband uses this product on his snowy white hair and it does a great job of keeping the &amp;#34;yellows&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li>Wife uses this particular shampoo and conditioner separate and I liked it</li>
            <li>I have recently begun using the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioners, and Pantene is the best as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and makes my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>It works fine, the decent smell is too strong...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine shampoo but a less successful conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and have read that the 2-in-1 shampoos work best with short hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of 2-n-1 products,  They clean hair fine but the conditioner part is lacking.  </li>
            <li>Though I have tried many others, I always come back to Pantene.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I like the Ice Shine 2 in 1, my first time buying it.</li>
            <li>Think about it, If the conditioner molecules hit the hair before the shampoo the whole purpose is lost.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair gets super greasy the next morning if I don&#x27;t wash it first thing when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>nothing special, for my hair I still need an instant conditioner</li>
            <li>:) But of course like any man the idea of getting it done quickly with least amount of cycles overpowered normal sense to separate shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li>I hope that in the future we can have more such opotunities.</li>
            <li>packing could have been little better...</li>
            <li>and it was a bit of a mess to clean it up...</li>
            <li>the conditioning action actually lets me comb it with ease.</li>
            <li>I apply just a little bit, since I have medium hair and it lathers very well.</li>

            <li> a shampoo, it gets the job done, but I&#x27;ve found that my hair is less shiny than when I used the regular Ice Shine shampoo, and, as another reviewer put it, it leaves my hair feeling like straw.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and it does what is suppose to do.  I waited until there was an coupon to clip and ordered a pair.  They are doing a good job and my hair looks great.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo. Just what I expected. It has a nice scent. I apply just a little bit, since I have medium hair and it lathers very well. It&#x27;s easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> I need a good 2in1 when trying to get out the door quickly. It&#x27;s not the most conditioning product but most 2in1s aren&#x27;t. It is better than most. I also got this with an amazon coupon and on sale so it was a great deal!</li>
            <li> A person at a drug store told me she used this shampoo.  I am glad I started using it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> wanted something for everyday that won&#x27;t dry my hair or leave it too heavy. this 2-in-1 isn&#x27;t either one. would recommend for every day use but use something nicer on the w/e or when you have more time to shampoo and condition well separately</li>
            <li> nothing special, for my hair I still need an instant conditioner&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a conditioner in it at all</li>
            <li> The bottle came to me in a plastic bag, but the bottle had opened up and spilled all over the bag.  It&#x27;s a mess!  I filed a complaint but never heard back.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo. I dont even need conditioner when using. Smells divine! and the smell lasts. Love all Pantene products. Arrived quickly and packaged well. Great price!!</li>
            <li> Wife uses this particular shampoo and conditioner separate and I liked it so bought the combo.&lt;br /&gt;The two in one products have never made sense to me. Think about it, If the conditioner molecules hit the hair before the shampoo the whole purpose is lost. :) But of course like any man the idea of getting it done quickly with least amount of cycles overpowered normal sense to separate shampoo and conditioning. It works well though.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair too dry and flyaway-ish. Bummer.</li>
            <li> product is good as it is...and price was amazing as well...packing could have been little better...mine came with a leak started in the wrapped plastic...and it was a bit of a mess to clean it up...</li>
            <li> My hair gets super greasy the next morning if I don&#x27;t wash it first thing when using this shampoo. Light scent</li>
            <li> The packaging is really awful. The lid of one of the bottles was open and the plastic wrapper was broken and the shampoo spilled all over inside of the box. The bottle is almost empty. The worst thing is there is a book shipped with it. The book had to be wiped and be wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use nothing but this shampoo since I started using it 2 years ago. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of 2-n-1 products,  They clean hair fine but the conditioner part is lacking.  I like a separate conditioner I can leave in a minute.  It&#x27;s a fine shampoo but a less successful conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with just a bit of waviness, and there is no way I could use this product without a separate conditioner, even after leaving it in for a few minutes. (The 2-1 makes it *slightly* more workable than regular shampoo, so it might be more effective on shorter/straighter hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, it gets the job done, but I&#x27;ve found that my hair is less shiny than when I used the regular Ice Shine shampoo, and, as another reviewer put it, it leaves my hair feeling like straw. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I think 2-in-1 design is for someone who is really lazy, like me. It works fine, the decent smell is too strong...</li>
            <li> The bottle was open and leaked inside the box.  Lost half of the bottle. It was a messed inside the box.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product on his snowy white hair and it does a great job of keeping the &amp;#34;yellows&amp;#34; away. The combo of shampoo and conditioner is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene shampoo for years. Though I have tried many others, I always come back to Pantene. I have short hair and have read that the 2-in-1 shampoos work best with short hair. My hair does shine when I use it.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s good price,i love it. I hope that in the future we can have more such opotunities.It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have recently begun using the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioners, and Pantene is the best as far as I can tell. It really works! I have very long hair, and the conditioning action actually lets me comb it with ease. Plus this product allows your hair to shine like nothing else! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; quick shipping</li>
            <li> I like the Ice Shine 2 in 1, my first time buying it. It smells lovely and makes my hair very shiny. I had to adjust to using it but after a week it was amazing. I recommend this product works well, smells good, and is a light scent not too strong. Another plus guys or gals can use it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at a great price.  Does not leave any kind of oily residue and does not have an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> it makes my head itch, so I threw the pack into the trash after 2 weeks, I don&#x27;t have this problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> no surprise with this one. washes well and smells good. came in pack of two for the price of one.</li>
