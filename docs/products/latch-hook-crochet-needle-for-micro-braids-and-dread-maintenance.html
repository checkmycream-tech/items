    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great tool to crochet my hair. I have use this tool from the beginning to keep and start a crochet lock of my hair</li>
            <li> This is way too large to use for extensions.  Should not be listed as such an item.  Should only be for latch hook crafts.  You cannot pull it thru any of the beads.</li>
            <li> What is pictured is what I needed. What was sent was something I could have gone to the corner and bought for less than a dollar.  I ended up spending over $5.00 with the shipping.  Bogus. If I can upload a real picture I will.</li>
            <li> Smooth delivery.  I know some people say what they received didn&#x27;t look like the picture, but mine did. Looks just like the photo advertised.  What else can I say? Just a regular crotchet needle, works how it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I noted the negative reviews prior to ordering. I chose to order this product because the seller responded to the previous customers instead of ignoring them. I received my latch hook well before the delivery date and it was exactly as pictured and described. Just for reference the opening on the hook is about 1/8 th of an inch across. Works perfect for me. Thank you</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and product was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Did my hair work great</li>
            <li> I got this to help my husband maintain his dread but I guess this is best for dreads that started off as braids and not rasta style dreads because it is so small and my husbands dreads are too big to fit throught the loop.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this style threader at all. I rather a different style. This one pulls the hair and takes a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> As the other customers stated, the item in the picture and the description postedis misleading. My order was for the needles and in turn I received a cheap latch hook that could havebeen bought at a $.99 store. I wish they were more honest about what they are selling!!!! BAD BUSINESS.</li>
            <li> The photo that is being shown  is not the product being sent to me. I  see 3  interlock tools in 3 different sizes.  The tool your sending me  is not the same as this picture here.</li>
            <li> not for me. feel like it pulls at my hair.</li>
            <li> Too big. I thought it was smaller than what I received</li>
            <li> was a little scared when i read the reviews wasn&#x27;t sure what i ordered would be delivered. it was exactly what i ordered and needed.</li>
            <li> The crochet needle is just as pictured. I used it to do Crochet braids for my sister hair and it worked well once I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t receive what is in picture. They need to change the pic to what they are actually selling. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Not the same product as shown. Picture shows small hook, it was actually pretty big. They did refund my money though.</li>
            <li> Great for tightening dreds. It&#x27;s hard to use on your own, but makes maintaining someone else&#x27;s extraordinarily easy.</li>
            <li> This hook is very lightweight and simply made. It works just fine and I&#x27;ve used it twice without any issues.</li>
            <li> Amazon should do something about a this. I have purchase this item twice, and twice have been deceived, the picture is deceptive...how long will this be allow to be on Amazon....I order the 3 small items pictured and th websites sent me a rug hook tool that looks nothing like the picture. ..</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for crochet braids.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and on different peoples head and it all ways works with no difficulties for me.</li>
            <li> Experimental purchase, along with a range of other latch hook types.  I intended to use them to hook wool curly locks to a wig cap. I have not yet used them for that, so do not have usage experience to discuss.</li>
            <li> Great and cheap but it doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered by the next day, which both surprised and pleased me. The product helps to increase my clientele.</li>
            <li> If you want to buy what you see in the picture...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;It is a total misrepresentation of what you actually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I noticed the name of the item (micro braid and dredlock maintenance latch), yet I ordered because I was going by the picture and the description...so I thought I was getting the dred lock tool featured. Instead I received a long necked hair weaving crochet latch hook with a pink and green handle.!!??..in which that I could&#x27;ve bought locally at the beauty supply for $1 if that&#x27;s what I wanted. Instead I paid 14cents times two plus $5 S&amp;H each ($10.28) They should be ashamed tricking consumers like that. If they were going to send me whatever they wanted, they could&#x27;ve at least sent me something worth the money I spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally...there is no customer service. Once the package arrived, I went to their website and called the contact numbers provided. It went straight to voicemail, no greeting. I left a message, still no response. But best believe somebody will do something because I don&#x27;t believe in giving away any amount of money for what I don&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you have been forewarned...Unless you don&#x27;t care if you don&#x27;t get what you think you&#x27;re buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;December 12, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;UPDATE-UPDATE-UPDATE-UPDATE-UPDATE&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very humorous that as soon as I wrote the above review(the same day to be exact), the seller changed the picture to the correct one and even raised the price....and still I have not received a response about my messed up order. This goes to show that they did get my correspondence and chose to ignore it because they did not want to return my money that was justly due to me. Once again, do not sacrifice your hard earned money with this seller. Completely unprofessional and untrustworthy. If they wanted to honor their business practices, they would contact me and rectify my order. I&#x27;m definitely not hard to find, especially since I have contacted them several times with my contact information(email, telephone#, etc.)show that they did get my correspondence and chose to ignore it because they did not want to return my money that was justly due to me.

            <li> works great , easy to use</li>
            <li> Well well first let me start by saying I was very excited that I have found this latch hook ,so I order it and to my surprises get the product it broke who in the world think that you going to sale a product to someone and think you don&#x27;t know it broke,is they crazy I&#x27;m very very disappionted with this it really made me hot to know that they thought they was selling to a fool they didn&#x27;t see fool in my order but what I&#x27;m  to do is to tell this company that you need to do better because you and amazon did some sorry no good mess, yaw just don&#x27;t know how piss I am with this even though it was only 1.99 like Big Worm would say it the princpal of it don&#x27;t play with my money sending me no broke product . I not about any mess so if you read this I want you all to call me back and I want free shipping for this sorry product and I will send you your when you send me mind first after I done pay you all double for nothing.</li>
            <li> from reading all the reviews before i purchased this item i was hesistant in purchaing this item. owing to the fact that some reviews stated that the display pic was misleading and it wasnt the item that was being displayed. however, i went along and bout this item, while checking out the display picture changed and i became very worried if i should continue the process i did however. when the item came and i opened the package i was quite relieved to see it was exactly what i wanted. i have since interlock some dreads and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> This item is sturdy. I have had it for a little while now and I am still using it. I use this to do crochet braids in my hair.</li>
            <li> Was not what thought it would be. Oh well I can use it anyway eventhough I already have this one.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time but is of poor quality. The hook came out of the base while trying to lock the hair. Poor manufacturing of item though it would do the job if made better.</li>
            <li> this is NOT what showed up, seriously, the HUGE handle that was sent is easily bought in any corner hair store. the small needles you advertise were what I wanted for the inflated price you charged. waste of my time waiting for this.</li>
            <li> the needle I received was nothing like the one&#x27;s being advertised also I had trouble utilizing this product</li>
            <li> Work great for what I needed it or but I should have just gotten it out of a beauty supply store for 99 cents. very over priced.</li>
            <li> Product came pretty fast, its great for what its for. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> way too big and it sucksss. don&#x27;t waste your money. i&#x27;m just saying. the hook is too big and the little latch thing is annoying and does nothing. .and it&#x27;s just cheap.</li>
            <li> affordable&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;i used this to crochet weave into my hair&lt;br /&gt;simple and easy application&lt;br /&gt;lasts for good&lt;br /&gt;durable</li>
            <li> Rips your hair out really cheap don&#x27;t buy it really suck its paying money for crap I understand the price is cheap but... Really</li>
            <li> This hook is WAY TO BIG for dreadlocks. I was expecting it to be MUCH smaller, it is way too big. Waste of money.</li>
