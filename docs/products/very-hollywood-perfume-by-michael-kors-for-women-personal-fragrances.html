            <li>Got it quick!</li>
            <li>What a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Hope this seller keeps having them available bc</li>
            <li>so I was really pleased to find it on here and for such a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flowery and sweet, and thought it&#x27;s not overly strong, it does bring compliments throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy</li>
            <li>something a rich person would wear.</li>
            <li>so excited when I found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>They were a gift, I can not rate anything really except the bottles were not broken and received in good order</li>
            <li>Love the smell, very flowery,  took a bit longer to get as not a Prime item but free shipping.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is light and fresh ....</li>
            <li>I have LOVED this perfume for a really long time...</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute - simple glass with a bubbled look and gold top, very classic Hollywood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and lovely, and I wish it could be back in production.  </li>
            <li>Priced right as well .</li>

            <li>My BF absolutely looooves it!</li>
            <li>wonderful scent, a little heavy bodied if you like that.</li>
            <li>It smells very fancy.....</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell you much about the scent for when I asked her how it smelled she said, &amp;#34;Amazing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s all the info I have, haha.</li>
            <li>It is just an drop of perfume and rest is probably water and may need to use whole bottle to get the smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It came relatively fast, and was correctly packaged etc.  </li>
            <li>Chanel #5, White Diamonds &amp; L&#x27;air Du Temps devotees should enjoy this fragrance for variety.</li>

            <li>Trying hard to use this more and not save it for special occassions, ha ha-</li>

            <li>Clean, divine, lasting.</li>
            <li>This is a soft, pretty scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume is unfortunately discontinued so I was happy to find it on here and received it unopened and brand new.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorites</li>
            <li>Got this for my roommate who is obsessed with Michael Kors and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery with samples and other goodies was a bonus!</li>
