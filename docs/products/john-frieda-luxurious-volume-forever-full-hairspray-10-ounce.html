            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>gives my hair just a nice bit of volume</li>
            <li>Not this one, unless you need that kind of hold.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking for a nice volume hairspary.</li>
            <li>Holds volume nicely.  </li>
            <li>THANKS for being HONEST!!</li>
            <li>It helps maintain my hair style during the day and brushes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for very strong hold, this might be for you.</li>
            <li>I love most John Frieda products that I have used over the years!  </li>
            <li>By far the best &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; hairspray I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair, I spray this very lightly in the layers of my hair and then use a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>It is light but effective.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase of this hair spray.</li>
            <li>Love it, better than all the rest.</li>
            <li>LOve it, won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase although I wish it was fruity scented, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>Excellent hairspray- needed to keep my short hair in place.</li>
            <li>My husband hates the smell of most hairspray sand he can tolerate this one.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I  would order it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&lt;br /&gt;t come up with 6 more words</li>
            <li>I have already ordered two more cans to have in stock.</li>
            <li>Will definately my more.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find I could order since I cannot always find at walmart</li>
            <li>and I love this hairspray for the price.</li>
            <li>This is an OK hairspray, but it did not help with volume at all.</li>
            <li>love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Sure, it held my hair, but it was anything but touchable.</li>
            <li>However, for my super fine hair, this stuff is like glue, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>John Freida spray holds pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and lived in southwest Louisiana most of my life.  </li>
            <li>hairspray has plenty of holding power, and I suppose it might be good for someone who wants gravity defying, vertically spiked hair.</li>
            <li>has a nice light mist that dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>strong, non-sticky looking hairspray</li>
            <li>This is a good hairspray just e aware that is very strong hold , so is very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep a coiffure in place.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, shoulder-length, highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>Held my fine hair volume well.</li>
            <li>This works to build some body and hold into my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It works wonders on my fine thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Have baby fine hair?</li>
            <li>like this product for fine hair .</li>
            <li>This hairspray works fine as in it holds hair in place as for the promise of adding volume, I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>This aerosol hair spray has a fine spray when you want just a light touch.</li>
            <li>and it certainly did seem to make my hair hair lovely and with more volume, so</li>
            <li>I finish with a light spray all over.</li>
            <li>Just remember to brush or smooth out the hair</li>
            <li>I have been using this hairspray almost daily since I received it with great pleasure.  </li>
            <li>Well simply put, it&#x27;s great for about an hour</li>
            <li>It works better than most products that I&#x27;ve tried to use to keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hairspray!  </li>
            <li>First time to try this product, and mostly pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is better than Big Sexy Hair which used to be my favorite volumizer.  </li>
            <li>OMG amazing my favorite hair spray or only 13 dollars</li>
            <li>Great for volume and lift with my fine hair and the results last all day - I don&#x27;t like the way it smells and the smell does tend to linger for a few hours, but if you&#x27;re looking for hold and volume, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Better than most that I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair all day long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>It also sprays in a very large arc -</li>
            <li>works great for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this product for the price and just may have to repurchase when I get low.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is good, but I prefer the Fudge volume hairspray I was using previously.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, and manages to go flat, or just droop, or blows all over in a gentle breeze.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell this hairspray does hold more of my curls in longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different sprays, concoctions, magic, and fairy dust to try and add volume...</li>
            <li>I held pretty well--</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I really love this hairspray and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and love a little volume at the crown.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>thank you to previous reviewer statement regarding very good quality for the money as I whole heartedly agree and not too large for travel in suitcase to be checked through.  will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product.</li>
            <li>Hot and humid much of the time, but always humid.  </li>
            <li>but if you spray to much in one area it can get pretty crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I have used this hairspray for a long time and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveda Firmata ( the original non-sticky formula), my long time favorite, and love Kenra firm hold, but the cost is just too much.  </li>
            <li>If only the smell wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Arrived as advertised; first time trying, although I have used many other Frieda products.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny spritz does the trick on fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Product is a sticky firm hold and would probably work great on thicker hair or slicked back hair.</li>
            <li>This spray is light and actually gives my hair volume and hold.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t over whelming and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Very sticky and don&#x27;t need much to get the job done</li>
            <li>so much so that I now use the John Frieda Mousse and Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it will, and I received it promptly and packaged very protectively as it should be for an aerosol spray by the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;packers.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again since I really like it.</li>
            <li>When I take the time to curl my hair, no matter how much hairspray I put in it, it always returns to its borderline wavy/flat state within the hour.  </li>
            <li>It did not give me as much volume as my cheaper tressame spray...</li>
            <li>I have long, layered fine hair and this hairspray holds my style and at the same time combs out easily for re-styling.</li>
            <li>love that you can the entire line for complete hair care</li>
            <li>This is the only spray that actually gives it some structure and holds it in some kind of shape.</li>
            <li>My hair is so fine and flat, but when I spray this stuff on the roots of my hair it really gives body.</li>
            <li>Just OK...I have had other brands that&#x27;s better</li>
            <li>lot better than other products</li>
            <li>I have pretty heavy hair because of the length, but I&#x27;ve had much better products before.</li>
            <li>Amps up the volume, love the way my soft grey hair looks.  </li>
            <li>not heavy, not greasy looking, no weird smell.</li>
            <li>This is a great dry hair spray that isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li>It holds well, is a little sticky but overall good.  </li>
            <li>Decent, but i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Nice... but the only problem is doesn&#x27;t stay all day as expected</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone who likes a &#x27;high volume&#x27; spray.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more out of it.</li>
            <li>if even for 15 minutes (it falls that flat that quickly).</li>
            <li>Most styling products are just too heavy.</li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling very sticky and easily tangled once it was dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair thats short, had to find a hairspray that holds.</li>
            <li>My new hair spray of choice.</li>
            <li>Holds but is not stiff or sticky!</li>
            <li>i use this pretty regularly and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>The other bonus is that the spray nozzle rarely gets clogged!</li>
            <li>After one use this spray levels white flakes in my hair, I don&#x27;t even use that much!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This hairspray is the first one I have found that actually does its job!  </li>
            <li>A little bit of spray goes a long way with this product and you can work your fingers through your hair but still have nice volume.</li>
            <li>Never sticky or stiff  and easy to brush or comb through.</li>
            <li>Its not stiff or stinky.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and fine and heavy sprays crush the style and leave helmet head.</li>
            <li>Works well on my fine hair without feeling stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>use the smallest amount and you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>Tried this on my colored long hair, after using hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>It holds and still feels like your natural hair with no sticky feeling..</li>
            <li>Not too heavy or light.</li>
            <li>I have to get a wet paper towel every few days and clean off the spray nozzle since it clogs non stop and a quick mist over my head</li>
            <li>Who knew that it was possible to find a spray that holds the hair, but doesn&#x27;t turn it into a lump of concrete?!</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look dull like so many other hair sprays.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the price is right for the size</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very thin, very silky hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have very fine thin stuff that nothing works on.</li>
            <li>Fast dry and will hold the craziest of hair in place, found it over a year ago and will never switch!</li>
            <li>turns into a direct shot of hair spray in my eye and ear at the same time</li>
            <li>I just started using this products the past few days, I do really like the fine mist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to John Frieda&#x27;s Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear hairspray.</li>

            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It is light but effective.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase of this hair spray.</li>
            <li> Love it, better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> LOve it, won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase although I wish it was fruity scented, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairspray- needed to keep my short hair in place.</li>
            <li> My husband hates the smell of most hairspray sand he can tolerate this one.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I  would order it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&lt;br /&gt;t come up with 6 more words</li>
            <li> I have already ordered two more cans to have in stock.</li>
            <li> Will definately my more.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find I could order since I cannot always find at walmart</li>
            <li> and I love this hairspray for the price.</li>
            <li> This is an OK hairspray, but it did not help with volume at all.</li>
            <li> love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Sure, it held my hair, but it was anything but touchable.</li>
            <li> However, for my super fine hair, this stuff is like glue, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> John Freida spray holds pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, and lived in southwest Louisiana most of my life.  </li>
            <li> hairspray has plenty of holding power, and I suppose it might be good for someone who wants gravity defying, vertically spiked hair.</li>
            <li> has a nice light mist that dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> strong, non-sticky looking hairspray</li>
            <li> This is a good hairspray just e aware that is very strong hold , so is very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep a coiffure in place.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, shoulder-length, highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> Held my fine hair volume well.</li>
            <li> This works to build some body and hold into my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my fine thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Have baby fine hair?</li>
            <li> like this product for fine hair .</li>
            <li> This hairspray works fine as in it holds hair in place as for the promise of adding volume, I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> This aerosol hair spray has a fine spray when you want just a light touch.</li>
            <li> and it certainly did seem to make my hair hair lovely and with more volume, so</li>
            <li> I finish with a light spray all over.</li>
            <li> Just remember to brush or smooth out the hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray almost daily since I received it with great pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Well simply put, it&#x27;s great for about an hour</li>
            <li> It works better than most products that I&#x27;ve tried to use to keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hairspray!  </li>
            <li> First time to try this product, and mostly pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is better than Big Sexy Hair which used to be my favorite volumizer.  </li>
            <li> OMG amazing my favorite hair spray or only 13 dollars</li>
            <li> Great for volume and lift with my fine hair and the results last all day - I don&#x27;t like the way it smells and the smell does tend to linger for a few hours, but if you&#x27;re looking for hold and volume, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Better than most that I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair all day long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> It also sprays in a very large arc -</li>
            <li> works great for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this product for the price and just may have to repurchase when I get low.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is good, but I prefer the Fudge volume hairspray I was using previously.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, and manages to go flat, or just droop, or blows all over in a gentle breeze.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell this hairspray does hold more of my curls in longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different sprays, concoctions, magic, and fairy dust to try and add volume...</li>
            <li> I held pretty well--</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really love this hairspray and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and love a little volume at the crown.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> thank you to previous reviewer statement regarding very good quality for the money as I whole heartedly agree and not too large for travel in suitcase to be checked through.  will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product.</li>
            <li> Hot and humid much of the time, but always humid.  </li>
            <li> but if you spray to much in one area it can get pretty crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for a long time and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveda Firmata ( the original non-sticky formula), my long time favorite, and love Kenra firm hold, but the cost is just too much.  </li>
            <li> If only the smell wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised; first time trying, although I have used many other Frieda products.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny spritz does the trick on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Product is a sticky firm hold and would probably work great on thicker hair or slicked back hair.</li>
            <li> This spray is light and actually gives my hair volume and hold.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t over whelming and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and don&#x27;t need much to get the job done</li>
            <li> so much so that I now use the John Frieda Mousse and Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it will, and I received it promptly and packaged very protectively as it should be for an aerosol spray by the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;packers.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again since I really like it.</li>
            <li> When I take the time to curl my hair, no matter how much hairspray I put in it, it always returns to its borderline wavy/flat state within the hour.  </li>
            <li> It did not give me as much volume as my cheaper tressame spray...</li>
            <li> I have long, layered fine hair and this hairspray holds my style and at the same time combs out easily for re-styling.</li>
            <li> love that you can the entire line for complete hair care</li>
            <li> This is the only spray that actually gives it some structure and holds it in some kind of shape.</li>
            <li> My hair is so fine and flat, but when I spray this stuff on the roots of my hair it really gives body.</li>
            <li> Just OK...I have had other brands that&#x27;s better</li>
            <li> lot better than other products</li>
            <li> I have pretty heavy hair because of the length, but I&#x27;ve had much better products before.</li>
            <li> Amps up the volume, love the way my soft grey hair looks.  </li>
            <li> not heavy, not greasy looking, no weird smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry hair spray that isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds well, is a little sticky but overall good.  </li>
            <li> Decent, but i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice... but the only problem is doesn&#x27;t stay all day as expected</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone who likes a &#x27;high volume&#x27; spray.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more out of it.</li>
            <li> if even for 15 minutes (it falls that flat that quickly).</li>
            <li> Most styling products are just too heavy.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling very sticky and easily tangled once it was dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair thats short, had to find a hairspray that holds.</li>
            <li> My new hair spray of choice.</li>
            <li> Holds but is not stiff or sticky!</li>
            <li> i use this pretty regularly and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The other bonus is that the spray nozzle rarely gets clogged!</li>
            <li> After one use this spray levels white flakes in my hair, I don&#x27;t even use that much!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the first one I have found that actually does its job!  </li>
            <li> A little bit of spray goes a long way with this product and you can work your fingers through your hair but still have nice volume.</li>
            <li> Never sticky or stiff  and easy to brush or comb through.</li>
            <li> Its not stiff or stinky.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and fine and heavy sprays crush the style and leave helmet head.</li>
            <li> Works well on my fine hair without feeling stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> use the smallest amount and you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my colored long hair, after using hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> It holds and still feels like your natural hair with no sticky feeling..</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or light.</li>
            <li> I have to get a wet paper towel every few days and clean off the spray nozzle since it clogs non stop and a quick mist over my head</li>
            <li> Who knew that it was possible to find a spray that holds the hair, but doesn&#x27;t turn it into a lump of concrete?!</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look dull like so many other hair sprays.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the price is right for the size</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very thin, very silky hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have very fine thin stuff that nothing works on.</li>
            <li> Fast dry and will hold the craziest of hair in place, found it over a year ago and will never switch!</li>
            <li> turns into a direct shot of hair spray in my eye and ear at the same time</li>
            <li> I just started using this products the past few days, I do really like the fine mist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to John Frieda&#x27;s Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear hairspray.</li>
            <li> It will last so long, I had to remove it from the auto-ship.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times and even recommended the same product to two of my friends that use other John Frieda products</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Paul Mitchell hairsprays.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my roots before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake nor does it seem to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it now on my little girls when their hair is smoothed back</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s straightest hair, which consequently hangs like a wet noodle if I just let it be.</li>
            <li> then your hair is flat and stiff.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly the hold I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I rated a 2 because the packaging was damaged so that the plastic cap caused it to spray during delivery - wasted product and a mess to open.</li>
            <li> My hair remains curly all day, and the serum leaves behind minimal crunchiness so that my hair looks natural.</li>
            <li> Holds it in place without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> So I will only use this if I have to go out in a storm--and then plan to wash it out when I get home-- seriously.  </li>
            <li> so it seems the hold breaks down in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave your hair rock hard, come out as a a powerful &amp; even mist, doesn&#x27;t shine like crazy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> For everyday, no way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> It seems it dried my hair</li>
            <li> and I just want a firm hold.</li>
            <li> so it was too heavy for it-</li>
            <li> once I was out for a few hours.</li>
            <li> A little stiff for my needs.</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair in place without making it stiff.  </li>
            <li> Never could find a spray to tame it, or, if I did, it felt like cement on my head.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so this is no easy task.</li>
            <li> BUT I do have a ton of hair which is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very stiff</li>
            <li> I found it to be very stiff, sticky and created buildup on my hair.</li>
            <li> The product casts a film over my hair making it look dull.  </li>
            <li> Did not become sticky, and did not leave hair hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Feels like it would my hair in gale force 4 winds, which is saying something since my hair is ridiculously thick and unruly.</li>
            <li> I ride in my car with the windows down in the summer, it still holds my style-its not perfect but it will hold.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in a Frieda product for the first time.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the chemical like smell.</li>
            <li> Disappointing Freida product.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you buy it, too.</li>
            <li> Smells awful!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as awful as the tressame though, which is a plus.</li>

            <li> Just OK...I have had other brands that&#x27;s better&lt;br /&gt;..Kenvo...best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not try this again.</li>
            <li> OMG amazing my favorite hair spray or only 13 dollars it&#x27;s amazing I WOULD RATE THIS 100 but you know.. I recommend that</li>
            <li> My new hair spray of choice. I have baby fine, shoulder-length, highlighted hair. Most styling products are just too heavy. This spray is light and actually gives my hair volume and hold. The smell isn&#x27;t over whelming and the cost is reasonable. I am so happy to have found this spray. I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> i use this pretty regularly and it works as advertised. gives my hair just a nice bit of volume so I can style it.</li>
            <li> This holds great without a too sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Held my fine hair volume well.</li>
            <li> best spray i ever used!!!! great for fine hair! not heavy, not greasy looking, no weird smell. use the smallest amount and you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  Works well on my fine hair without feeling stiff or sticky.  I like that I can get it with Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in a Frieda product for the first time.The product casts a film over my hair making it look dull.  I am going to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray.  It is light but effective.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is really good hairspray.  I have baby fine hair, and lived in southwest Louisiana most of my life.  Hot and humid much of the time, but always humid.  Coastal south Louisiana in August is where and when hairspray should be tested!  I&#x27;ve used Aveda Firmata ( the original non-sticky formula), my long time favorite, and love Kenra firm hold, but the cost is just too much.  For a fraction of the price, this John Frieda hairspray is almost as good, probably 95% as good as the pricey salon options. By far the best &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; hairspray I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry hair spray that isn&#x27;t stiff. After blow drying my hair, I spray this very lightly in the layers of my hair and then use a curling iron. I finish with a light spray all over. This works to build some body and hold into my fine hair. I love that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look dull like so many other hair sprays.

Just remember to brush or smooth out the hair then you won&#x27;t have any problems.  Overall, I am happy with this product for the price and just may have to repurchase when I get low.</li>
            <li> After one use this spray levels white flakes in my hair, I don&#x27;t even use that much!</li>
            <li> The John Frieda band of Hairspray, is the only hairspray that actually does what it says it will do!!! It actually does hold and holds ALL DAY!!!! THANKS for being HONEST!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase of this hair spray. It holds my style all day, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very stiff</li>
            <li> This is a good hairspray just e aware that is very strong hold , so is very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep a coiffure in place. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it, better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> LOve it, won&#x27;t go without it. Try it. It works wonders on my fine thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own, and manages to go flat, or just droop, or blows all over in a gentle breeze. Never could find a spray to tame it, or, if I did, it felt like cement on my head. Then, I decided to try this.  WOW! Who knew that it was possible to find a spray that holds the hair, but doesn&#x27;t turn it into a lump of concrete?! Gotta recommend this as a product that does what it claims it will do. A winner!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do - give you the appearance of fuller hair!</li>
            <li> Not exactly the hold I was hoping for. I have pretty heavy hair because of the length, but I&#x27;ve had much better products before. Decent, but i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hole was clogged and cracked</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell this hairspray does hold more of my curls in longer. I am satisfied with my purchase although I wish it was fruity scented, but that&#x27;s just me. Other than that, the price is right for the size and I had a good experience with the delivery as well.</li>
            <li> thank you to previous reviewer statement regarding very good quality for the money as I whole heartedly agree and not too large for travel in suitcase to be checked through.  will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairspray- needed to keep my short hair in place. I must use Fibers as a hair filler.</li>
            <li> I like the way it sprays out.  I use it on my roots before I blow dry.  Then I get extra volume.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling very sticky and easily tangled once it was dry. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray. My husband hates the smell of most hairspray sand he can tolerate this one. It holds very well without felling heavy.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised; first time trying, although I have used many other Frieda products. Just a tiny spritz does the trick on fine hair. It will last so long, I had to remove it from the auto-ship.</li>
            <li> Feels like it would my hair in gale force 4 winds, which is saying something since my hair is ridiculously thick and unruly. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is really good hairspray.  Holds but is not stiff or sticky!</li>
            <li> Want hair glue? Buy this. Have baby fine hair? Do not buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairspray has plenty of holding power, and I suppose it might be good for someone who wants gravity defying, vertically spiked hair. However, for my super fine hair, this stuff is like glue, and not in a good way. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and don&#x27;t need much to get the job done</li>
            <li> I have literally tried multiple hairsprays and always return them. I am very pleased with this productâ€¦so much so that I now use the John Frieda Mousse and Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my hair well and I have very fine thin stuff that nothing works on.</li>
            <li> First time to try this product, and mostly pleased with its performance.  Did not become sticky, and did not leave hair hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Just a light spray keeps my hair in place all day !!!  Never sticky or stiff  and easy to brush or comb through.</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s straightest hair, which consequently hangs like a wet noodle if I just let it be. While the straightness is awesome, sometimes I want to change it up a bit...if even for 15 minutes (it falls that flat that quickly). If I curl my hair and douse it in this hairspray, I am left with voluminous hair. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different sprays, concoctions, magic, and fairy dust to try and add volume...and I have to say that this spray is about the best.</li>
            <li> like this product for fine hair .</li>
            <li> Great for thin fine hair. Holds it in place without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the money .Like the scent , good level of hold and good value for the price . Would order again . Thanks</li>
            <li> Tried this on my colored long hair, after using hot rollers.  I held pretty well--BUT--I couldn&#x27;t even get my fingers through it without ripping out hair.  So I will only use this if I have to go out in a storm--and then plan to wash it out when I get home-- seriously.  For everyday, no way.</li>
            <li> works great for fine, thin hair.  has a nice light mist that dries quickly.  smells pleasant.  will buy again.  you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you buy it, too.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is light-weight, pleasantly scented, and leaves my hair with nice volume. I love most John Frieda products that I have used over the years!  This hairspray works just as well as a similar $20 product that I was using before. Love it!</li>
            <li> This aerosol hair spray has a fine spray when you want just a light touch. My hair is soft and fine and heavy sprays crush the style and leave helmet head. Not this one, unless you need that kind of hold. Then just re-spray until desired effect is achieved.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray almost daily since I received it with great pleasure.  It does exactly what it says&lt;br /&gt;it will, and I received it promptly and packaged very protectively as it should be for an aerosol spray by the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;packers.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone who likes a &#x27;high volume&#x27; spray.  It is just that!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I really loved the hairpsray. I  would order it again for sure. It was here on time.</li>
            <li> Smells awful!! I tossed it after one use and then washed my hair!</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair thats short, had to find a hairspray that holds. John Freida spray holds pretty good. Its not stiff or stinky. I ride in my car with the windows down in the summer, it still holds my style-its not perfect but it will hold.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good volume product for a while now. This one didn&#x27;t make a big difference as well. But it is a good hairspray I believe. If only the smell wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> awesome product. doesn&#x27;t leave your hair rock hard, come out as a a powerful &amp; even mist, doesn&#x27;t shine like crazy. great value for the price</li>
            <li> This hairspray is good, but I prefer the Fudge volume hairspray I was using previously.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again since I really like it. Great for the summer but I will use all year.</li>
            <li> Product rating would be a 3, as the hairspray is stickier than a Super-fine hairspray should be.  I rated a 2 because the packaging was damaged so that the plastic cap caused it to spray during delivery - wasted product and a mess to open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pleasant and effective hairspray but I wish it was not an aerosol can.  It also sprays in a very large arc - I need longer arms, LOL!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray for my baby fine hair, used with the Klorane products.</li>
            <li> A little stiff for my needs.</li>
            <li> Nice... but the only problem is doesn&#x27;t stay all day as expected</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works better than most products that I&#x27;ve tried to use to keep my hair straight. It also came two days earlier.</li>
            <li> Provides the volume advertised. Amps up the volume, love the way my soft grey hair looks.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Paul Mitchell hairsprays.  I have fine hair and love a little volume at the crown.  I have FINALLY found the hairspray I have been looking for that does just this and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily.  Thank you John Frieda - I am a faithful fan.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray there is! Fast dry and will hold the craziest of hair in place, found it over a year ago and will never switch!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever!! It holds and still feels like your natural hair with no sticky feeling..</li>
            <li> Great product ..holds better than store brands and is priced great....lot better than other products&lt;br /&gt;I tried off the counter....love that you can the entire line for complete hair care</li>
            <li> Great hairspray holds well the scent is nice. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> This Volume Extra Hold Hairspray didn&#x27;t impress me at all.  It seems it dried my hair and it certainly did seem to make my hair hair lovely and with more volume, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking for a nice volume hairspary.</li>
            <li> Love!  My hair goes nowhere....just how I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times and even recommended the same product to two of my friends that use other John Frieda products</li>
            <li> It is hair spray. I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with it. it does it job. I can&lt;br /&gt;t come up with 6 more words</li>
            <li> best hairspray ever!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT for fine hair, The best hairspray I have ever used. Makes my hair thicker and doesn&#x27;t cause tangles. I hope this product will be on the market forever!</li>
            <li> When I take the time to curl my hair, no matter how much hairspray I put in it, it always returns to its borderline wavy/flat state within the hour.  This hairspray is the first one I have found that actually does its job!  My hair remains curly all day, and the serum leaves behind minimal crunchiness so that my hair looks natural. I love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product. I found it to be very stiff, sticky and created buildup on my hair. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I have ever used. I have already ordered two more cans to have in stock. It is especially good for people with fine/thin hair like me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very thin, very silky hair.  This gives it body.  Nuf said.</li>
            <li> Just a great hairspray. No noticeable scent. Doesn&#x27;t make hair look sticky or plastered. Holds volume nicely.  Watch for coupons!</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than Big Sexy Hair which used to be my favorite volumizer.  A friend suggested it and I&#x27;ve been converted.</li>
            <li> It helps maintain my hair style during the day and brushes out very easily.  Will definately my more. Not tacky..</li>
            <li> This hairspray works fine as in it holds hair in place as for the promise of adding volume, I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is alright. I was expecting a little more out of it. It did not give me as much volume as my cheaper tressame spray...but it was worth the try. It doesn&#x27;t smell as awful as the tressame though, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for a long time and it is still my favorite. Please try it if you have not used it before.</li>
            <li> Great for volume and lift with my fine hair and the results last all day - I don&#x27;t like the way it smells and the smell does tend to linger for a few hours, but if you&#x27;re looking for hold and volume, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find I could order since I cannot always find at walmart and I love this hairspray for the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; great spray for styling. Holds well &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky. Recommend to users looking for volume in their hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointing Freida product.  This is an OK hairspray, but it did not help with volume at all.</li>
            <li> Great hold without stiffness.</li>
            <li> It holds well, is a little sticky but overall good.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> great for fine and thinning hair</li>
            <li> Product is a sticky firm hold and would probably work great on thicker hair or slicked back hair. I use it now on my little girls when their hair is smoothed back and I just want a firm hold. My hair is thin though so it was too heavy for it- I went back to aquage finishing spray.</li>
            <li> love this hairspray. it keeps my hair in place without making it stiff.  i recommend it to my friends and family</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of product to achieve the look I wanted. It also didn&#x27;t stay that way once I was out for a few hours. BUT I do have a ton of hair which is thick and heavy. It will probably be perfect for thinner, lighter hair. TRESemme&#x27;s Thermal Creations Volumizing Mousse is the best trick for oomphing up my hair which I will be sticking to.</li>
            <li> Just as good as more expensive brands.  Not too heavy or light.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hairsprays I have ever used.  It holds your hairstyle without that sticky feeling.  I would recommend this to anyone with any harstyle.</li>
            <li> strong, non-sticky looking hairspray</li>
            <li> keeps my hair in control</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the chemical like smell. Hold??? Well simply put, it&#x27;s great for about an hour then your hair is flat and stiff.  I have to get a wet paper towel every few days and clean off the spray nozzle since it clogs non stop and a quick mist over my head turns into a direct shot of hair spray in my eye and ear at the same time</li>
            <li> Best volume hair spray I have ever purchased. My hair is so fine and flat, but when I spray this stuff on the roots of my hair it really gives body. I&#x27;m planning on buying another can. This stuff really is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this hairspray and use it daily. A little bit of spray goes a long way with this product and you can work your fingers through your hair but still have nice volume. I hope John Frieda doesn&#x27;t change the formula or stop making this!</li>
            <li> I have short, fine and straight hair.  This is the only spray that actually gives it some structure and holds it in some kind of shape.</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair spray. It keeps my hair frizz-free and shiny, even in the summer humidity. I have curly hair so this is no easy task.</li>
            <li> Better than most that I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair all day long.  My hair is fine so it seems the hold breaks down in a few hours.  It doesn&#x27;t flake nor does it seem to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hairspray!  I have long, layered fine hair and this hairspray holds my style and at the same time combs out easily for re-styling.</li>
            <li> Yuck! This reminds me of Aqua Net from decades ago. Sure, it held my hair, but it was anything but touchable. It basically froze my hair into place. If you&#x27;re looking for very strong hold, this might be for you. Me? I&#x27;m going back to John Frieda&#x27;s Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear hairspray.</li>
