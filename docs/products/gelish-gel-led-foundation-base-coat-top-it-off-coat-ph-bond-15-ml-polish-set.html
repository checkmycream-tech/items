            <li>You will need all three of these (in addition to color, cleanser, and a UV lamp) if you use the Gelish nail system, so it&#x27;s a great idea to bundle them together.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for DIY gel manicures.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>

            <li>Great product and value.  </li>
            <li>Great product and saved me tons of $$ to buy each piece rather than the Gelish starter kit with lamp.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great quality and it looks like I might know what I&#x27;m doing when I use these :)</li>
            <li>if you follow the directions you can find on utube on how to apply gelish Polish , I think you will be very satisfied with your home manicure.</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails myself and this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it makes your nails look great for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Gelish is a great product and this is the best way to get the 3 main items you need to get started doing your own nails.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am pleased!</li>
            <li>Sure beats a day with chips by the days end!</li>
            <li>I love the gelish system!</li>
            <li>Great full size bottles!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works great lasts weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>I put them on with a UV light and it works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just amazing, period.  </li>
            <li>and the product is absolutly amazing</li>
            <li>but i decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li>This is a nice starter kit for home use.</li>
            <li>After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n</li>
            <li>Just what you need to get started on your own gel nail manicure at home.  </li>
            <li>My wife convinced my daughter in law to do her own fingernails and we recommended that she purchase this kit.</li>
            <li>The thickness is nice because it won&#x27;t run onto your cuticles.</li>
            <li>I bought three packages for myself and my friends that do their own gel nails.</li>
            <li>The ph bond is a must when doing your own gel nails at home.  </li>
            <li>These are essentials for my gel nails, and I was able to purchase them for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the absolute best price.</li>
            <li>So, I thought I would invest in some gel polish, a UV lamp, and start doing my own nails at home</li>
            <li>Did my own gel manicure in 30 min.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deal for the full sized version of these products.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price for three full size bottles.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my wife, she says this product works great, very good quality will purchase from this vendor again in the future.</li>
            <li>They have worked great so far and is a great value for all three items.</li>
            <li>LOVE this top coat!</li>
            <li>Love love this product!</li>
            <li>Very pleased to have found FULL SIZE BOTTLES and a 3 pack at that!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and work well!</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and love, love, love this system.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Large sized bottles creates great value.</li>
            <li>Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li>sure if I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li>USE A LINT FREE CLOTH!</li>
            <li>It helps the builder gels or top coat...</li>
            <li>It will remove the top layer of your nail.</li>
            <li>I just love this nail system.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
            <li>Gelish is one of the top brands out there</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The Top</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>Also top coat is runny.</li>
            <li>but I think top coat should do the job with one coat.</li>
            <li>Love it would recommend to any do it your sellers:)</li>
            <li>I was on Amazon looking to buy Shellac and decided to give Gelish a try because the price was so much better.</li>
            <li>I think BondAide works better than pH bond however.</li>
            <li>I have done my nails with our a bonder many times though.</li>
            <li>I love that it manages to make my nails completely smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to not do by sunlight or your top it off will stiffen up.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love all Gelish products and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>It really gives my nails a great primer for the polish.</li>
            <li>The polish will lift for sure.</li>
            <li>They seem to give better coverage and are easier to control than the longer ones.</li>
            <li>they work better then the ones that I got in the kit.</li>
            <li>I needed to replenish my gelish supplies, and I am so glad I came to Amazon to do so.</li>
            <li>Love the Gelish brand.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Gelish brand and will not use another gel nail product.</li>
            <li>The french tip gelish product always looks very elegant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have been using Gelish for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;For about a year I was sure the Gelish line was the best, but I am convinced Shellac is the longest lasting brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gelish does take a lot more work to remove than Shellac, that is why I thought it was stronger.</li>
            <li>These work fantastic!</li>
            <li>This has solved the issue that arose after I had done so many manicures that I was running out of the basics.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Gelish since they are a more well-known brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these four times now and love the Gelish products.</li>
            <li>but I love Gelish.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish products.  </li>
            <li>So glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>better than Calgel, I love them</li>
            <li>Top It Off.</li>
            <li>Great products and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>the top coat is shiny.  </li>
            <li>I also have the CND top coat/base and find that I reach for Gelish more often.</li>
            <li>Top</li>
            <li>No matter how many coats of polish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to use the Gelish products with IBD and Fingerpaints gel polish with no problem.</li>
            <li>see too many overweight ladies with dyed and permed hair and overdesigned nails.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t possibly be more pleased with my transaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I apply the bonding product which I think is just acetone kind of to clean the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>I did my very first gel nails on my own last night and they came out perfectly!!  </li>
            <li>Many dry perfectly opaque, which is  boon if you&#x27;re like me and work with paints and stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>three pack is great for those new to DIY gel nails.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>My technique isn&#x27;t as good as the nail technician&#x27;s but its good enough to save me money in between time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gel polish can shrink, some more than others, so it&#x27;s important to make sure to cap the tip of your nail with each coat so it&#x27;ll fully shrink onto your nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gel polish can shrink, some more than others, so it&#x27;s important to make sure to cap the tip of your nail with each coat so it&#x27;ll fully shrink onto your nail.</li>
            <li>Also, the products work great and are superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>The top off is SUPER SHINY!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Likewise, the topcoat dries very quickly and is quite glossy, not to mention the gelish colors are generally very awesome, with a very wide range of colors and shines.  </li>
            <li>The polish easily lasts 2 weeks when I want to replace it anyway because of nail growth.</li>
            <li>My nails will look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>The Harmony - 3 pack soaks off easily.</li>
            <li>I make sure to clean my nails before I start and file and buff everything as needed.  </li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to do gel nails at home.  </li>
            <li>So I gave it a try myself and didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to do.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a starter item when I first started doing my own gel nails.</li>
            <li>Was pleased to find a full bottle of the phbond.</li>
            <li>Helps create the perfect gel manicure with a price less than one visit to the salon.</li>
            <li>and they are still fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine but have never used anything else.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and you will get perfect looking nails for much less than going to a salon.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was safely packaged.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and she is satisfied with the product and the fact that it came to her door.</li>
            <li>I have used them once and my nails are strong, shiny, and chip free after 8 days.</li>
            <li>This set is amazing and if you are just using it to do your own nails and toes, it will last you forever.</li>
            <li>Huge difference between store product and this product.</li>
            <li>DID I MENTION TO USE A LINT FREE CLOTH?  </li>
            <li>but it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...</li>
            <li>I bought a light</li>
            <li>The pH Bond prepares your nail surface and makes it suitable for the first coat of the Foundation Base.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I got the 12 watt LED light from U Spicy</li>
            <li>Quality product, bottle, and brush for smooth application.</li>
            <li>This is a great combo for someone starting out or someone who needs a refill - like I did.  </li>
            <li>It arrived within the ship/delivery window, and package securely.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>so I can smooth out the edge after.</li>
            <li>so I can smooth out the edge after.</li>
            <li>a UV light to cure (AKA harden and set)</li>
            <li>a must have if you are going to do the home UV light.</li>
            <li>Has anyone tried an additional coat of Top-It-Off after a week or so to re-seal free edges, prolong manicure and help protect nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>n free edges</li>
            <li>I do 2 minutes for the clear coats and 1 for each color coat with great success.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is short and I LOVE THIS!!</li>
            <li>Also, because your nails are supposed to be a clean, oil free zone, eat before you start.</li>
            <li>And super easy</li>
            <li>My nails are growing fast and are very strong.  </li>
            <li>Excited to continue practicing and improve my execution.</li>
            <li>and I can see where my nail has grown out significantly since the gelish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to use the Gelish products with IBD and Fingerpaints gel polish with no problem.d first</li>
            <li>off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...</li>
            <li>still clean my nails with rubbing alcohol before I use the pH bonder.</li>
            <li>You just lightly clean off your nails then wash your hands</li>
            <li>I use a LED light and the cure time was quick.</li>
            <li>It helps hydrate and clean the nail for the gel base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a wood stick to clean up the nail edges.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it goes on good and stays on, I do use the Gelish polish with these but have used other brands and it works well.</li>
            <li>now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li>Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it</li>
            <li>Love this kit it has save me so much time and money.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon.</li>
            <li>love the new polish and light</li>
            <li>There are other kits available but to be honest this kit is a much better buy.</li>
            <li>i love french manicures and i love the gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li>If there is a sticky layer after curing the top coat layer, just wipe it off with alcohol and it will shine like the high heaven</li>
            <li>The company fixed the issue right away!!!</li>
            <li>I have used Gelish since it very first came on the market.</li>
            <li>Unlike my local beauty supply store, these are full size bottles, and the Harmony Gelish brand is of pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li>work great with the Harmony Gelish polishes and other products!</li>
            <li>I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it</li>
            <li>It is strong and very chip</li>
            <li>remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li>It is HOT and it BURNS!</li>
            <li>Still learning the technique but satisfied so far!</li>
            <li>so I may try that next time around and purchase the 2 pack instead with just the foundation and top coat!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>They cured very well under my LED light, and of course the Top it Off left a sticky residue that is easily removed with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Your get full size ½ ounce bottles of these products which is 66% more than you get in many other Gelish kits.</li>
            <li>This product has given a weeks worth of no chip, no flake, manicure.</li>
            <li>Now I am able to complete the task at home, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>The folks at gelish really have a good bead on a simple product, that anyone can use!</li>
            <li>I did pretty good for the first try, but there is a learning curve, you really have to use a very light coat or it will run down the side of your nail when drying</li>
            <li>maybe that is because I put the product on right.</li>
            <li>and she was so right.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*Cures and hardens right away.</li>
            <li>I do only French manicures on myself and my nails always look beautiful.</li>
            <li>I learned pretty quickly after the first time.</li>
            <li>Easy application and quick dry with UV light.</li>
            <li>After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li>When I get brave enough to try French manicures, I&#x27;ll probably try to extend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes very fast.</li>
            <li>Also, I do not sand my nails very much.</li>
            <li>I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The application is super easy, just like how you would paint your nails with regular polish.</li>
            <li>For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of</li>
            <li>I did a more american manicure vs french (more forgiving, don&#x27;t have to be as exact).</li>
            <li>I thought it was a fluke the first time</li>
            <li>I love the short brushes.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go!  </li>
            <li>They need to make it the same size as the PH Bond and Foundation for more accuracy.</li>
            <li>Ive purchased at cosmoprof beauty supply and this is identical in quality and much cheaper in price!</li>
            <li>Use it the first time I tried gel on my nails</li>
            <li>so you know they are for real!</li>
            <li>Same product, just more of it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>When I find them, I just touch up those spots and cure them again, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the manicure after, but it&#x27;s just easier to prevent it in the first place.</li>
            <li>It Off has a more standard nail brush and liquid consistency.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth, last long, looks shiny and pretty for almost 3 weeks if you do it right.</li>
            <li>Additional benefit includes MY OWN hard, strong</li>
            <li>Regarding cleaning the nail after curing, the instructions on the bottle call for a \\&quot;dry clean of the surface\\&quot; with a lint free wipe.</li>
            <li>; dry in my LED light for 60 seconds, and clean with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails.</li>
            <li>- I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It</li>
            <li>The larger sizes make good financial sense.</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service, and they very promptly sent me out a new bottle of the topcoat, and threw in a full sized bottle of the cuticle oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the gelish system and currently use the \\&quot;Gelly Sandwich\\&quot; technique and my nails are beautiful with such a brilliant shine and long lasting... at least a week or two!</li>
            <li>The trick is to go light with the polish layers (sometimes a 3rd color coat is required because you are going light), and dont get near cuticles.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will be using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to be detailed enough to help the next person. :)</li>
            <li>But I can usually get by  with just polish and some  good hand lotion.</li>
            <li>The Gelish set is by far superior to any other gel polish in my opinion.</li>
            <li>a Gelish manicure will last two weeks, easy.</li>
            <li>each for the large size, and the package deal</li>
            <li>Love the product, goes on fast, lasts reasonably well (not as long a salon application).</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t build up too much, but it dries in no longer than 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much if a difference if any.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I believe the primer really helps.</li>
            <li>have real, grown up nails on both hands now and have had for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li>Bonus, my LED lamp does the whole hand as well.</li>
            <li>but I used too much and the excess settled in the sidewalls of my nails.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li>After curing, it&#x27;s very tacky and requires cleaning.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve only needed one coat to make my nails perfectly smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>When the nail grows out too much, I just start over, instead of trying to do upkeep</li>
            <li>I have a drink with a straw on the table ready to go</li>
            <li>My nails grow out too much with get polish.</li>
            <li>My nails looked as good as the day I did them for at least a week...</li>
            <li>Makes it kind of messy when using it.</li>
            <li>Now, they are long and strong.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than any other Gel system I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I loved the products in the smaller size available at Sally&#x27;s, but getting the larger size (for the same price I might add), is double the pleasure.  </li>
            <li>I soak my finger tips in warm water for a bit, dry, then push back and trim my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I like to fully complete the four fingers on each hand first</li>
            <li>Less is better.</li>
            <li>I have had particular problems growing my thumb nails because I use them to pry and scrape things.</li>
            <li>It is REALLY important to use the foundation and top coat in thin layers.</li>
            <li>I love the red, white, and nude gel colors</li>
            <li>as I had it professionally applied at two different salons where I&#x27;ve had great results in the past.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend this product, I made this decision because it was cheaper to buy as a bundle then separately.</li>
            <li>do my cuticles directly before starting each hand to make sure I can cover as much nail as possible.</li>
            <li>so I can use the thumb on either side to pull back skin on other fingers to fully paint the nail or to tidy up an edge</li>
            <li>so I can use the thumb on either side to pull back skin on other fingers to fully paint the nail or to tidy up an edge</li>
            <li>I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail</li>
            <li>so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing</li>
            <li>Only thing I would change is the size of the brush on the Top coat (too long for my liking).  </li>
            <li>Although it does take practice to apply but once he get use to applying it, it is definitely worth the money considering that one gel french tip manecure can cost between $45-$55.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on clear than every other color since clear is simple, clean, and classy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do regular nail polish manicures that often because of how long they didn&#x27;t last, so I wasn&#x27;t very handy wielding a nail brush, especially with my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li>Seriously, just try it, you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>I may need to buy a new uv lamp...</li>
            <li>I am new to at-home gel manicures and have seen these products in a lot of the YouTube videos I&#x27;ve watched.</li>
            <li>The liquid is very smooth, almost slick.</li>
            <li>It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure.</li>
            <li>Love this little set!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set together with another Gelish color, my UV light nail dryer and a couple of other gel colors from different brands to do my nails at home for the first time.</li>
            <li>These products arrived very fast and they were just what I was looking for at a fraction of the price at local stores!</li>
            <li>videos available online for demonstration of use, just remember not to thick, and wipe it off skin/cuticle before curing and you will have a shine for weeks and weeks and healthy long natural nails.</li>
            <li>The 3 bottles are pretty big</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the shellac products, the opi onces, and a few other brands and none of them are as good as the gelish ones.</li>
            <li>wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture.</li>
            <li>Also since the bottles are large they last forever.</li>
            <li>It Off is the top coat that provides the glossy and hard protective surface to the colored nail polish</li>
            <li>The foundation as well as the top coat are both super thick, so make sure to use VERY thin coats, otherwise it will run over onto your skin.</li>
            <li>I love having nice looking nails, but hate having to spend all the money at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a glossy clear.</li>
            <li>I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far.</li>
            <li>and it just sets it off and provides a professional finish to the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can now have armour on my natural nails</li>
            <li>Products are always on time or early.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading a lot of product reviews, I took the plunge and invested in a few colors and an led light.  </li>
            <li>have thrown away all of my old polishes, too.</li>
            <li>Arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>so these should last much longer.</li>
            <li>I was an early adopter of UV or LED-cured nail</li>
            <li>I went through the mini bottles so fast I had to get the bigger ones this time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep a manicure for at least 3 weeks....</li>
            <li>The key is to not use too much.  </li>
            <li>It works really well with a proper UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>it really allows for control of foundation which is a critical application step.</li>
            <li>When you rub them together, they even make the clacky noise you get with professionally done gel nails or acrylics.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t cap it as much, didn&#x27;t go under the nail at all and pushed back any glitter pieces that were on the edge</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t cap it as much, didn&#x27;t go under the nail at all and pushed back any glitter pieces that were on the edge</li>
            <li>This is the best brand of gel nail polish base that I have used before.  </li>
            <li>The gels form a strong, thick coating that looks like an ordinary polish manicure, but acts more like a sculpt.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular set again, but only because of the Ph Bond.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular set again, but only because of the Ph Bond.</li>
            <li>It really changes how long the manicure lasts, literally the difference between a day and a week.</li>
            <li>far more than when I use Shellac top and base.</li>
            <li>My package arrived first, and one of the bottles hadn&#x27;t been tightly closed and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>The brush bristles are extremely short so its hard to get an even coat without dipping and re-dipping the brush but other than that pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>When you add in how long that manicure is going to last, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Favorite base and top coat</li>
            <li>Love the shine of the top coat and base to.</li>
            <li>You will for sure need the base and top coat for your gel nails, so you can skip those two products.  </li>
            <li>With all the bottles, its easy to get a thick nail when finished</li>
            <li>Favorite brand of gel polish for base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>It has all 3 of the major things you need</li>
            <li>I learned that on my first hand, so on my other</li>
            <li>I learned that on my first hand, so on my other</li>
            <li>My biggest problem is that I get bored with colors on my hands pretty easily.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...</li>
            <li>I usually check around my nail and clean up any drip/excess that is on the skin.</li>
            <li>so keep it thin other wise</li>
            <li>Then I carefully file/smooth down the edges near the outgrown cuticle; then clean the nail surface with alcohol; apply one thin coat of Top It</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference on how long your nails will last.  </li>
            <li>I have only used them twice so far.</li>
            <li>Final product is professional looking.</li>
            <li>If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later.</li>
            <li>so I could do my own gel manicures because they are so expensive at the salon.</li>
            <li>With less than the cost of 2 trips to the salon for gel manicures, I was ready to go!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had extensive experience with all the major brands available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to provide a much longer lasting, even coating than other types of nail polish also.</li>
            <li>I prefer other brands for the colors but this base coat is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>recommend this set in particular because the ph bond cures the one issue I did have, which was having an entire gel coat peel off after some abuse or after a shower or wet chore.  </li>
            <li>The Ph Bonder is fine, but the base and top coat are thick and the brushes are too bulky or flimsy or something and make applying the product a little challenging.</li>
            <li>The PH bond seems to really dry the nail out, eliminating the need to buff the natural nail.</li>
            <li>No matter how hard I tried, I could never get the surface clean with a dry wipe.</li>

            <li> I am pleased!</li>
            <li> Sure beats a day with chips by the days end!</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system!</li>
            <li> Great full size bottles!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great lasts weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> I put them on with a UV light and it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing, period.  </li>
            <li> and the product is absolutly amazing</li>
            <li> but i decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li> This is a nice starter kit for home use.</li>
            <li> After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n</li>
            <li> Just what you need to get started on your own gel nail manicure at home.  </li>
            <li> My wife convinced my daughter in law to do her own fingernails and we recommended that she purchase this kit.</li>
            <li> The thickness is nice because it won&#x27;t run onto your cuticles.</li>
            <li> I bought three packages for myself and my friends that do their own gel nails.</li>
            <li> The ph bond is a must when doing your own gel nails at home.  </li>
            <li> These are essentials for my gel nails, and I was able to purchase them for a good price.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has the absolute best price.</li>
            <li> So, I thought I would invest in some gel polish, a UV lamp, and start doing my own nails at home</li>
            <li> Did my own gel manicure in 30 min.  </li>
            <li> This is a great deal for the full sized version of these products.  </li>
            <li> This is a great price for three full size bottles.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife, she says this product works great, very good quality will purchase from this vendor again in the future.</li>
            <li> They have worked great so far and is a great value for all three items.</li>
            <li> LOVE this top coat!</li>
            <li> Love love this product!</li>
            <li> Very pleased to have found FULL SIZE BOTTLES and a 3 pack at that!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and work well!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and love, love, love this system.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Large sized bottles creates great value.</li>
            <li> Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li> sure if I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> USE A LINT FREE CLOTH!</li>
            <li> It helps the builder gels or top coat...</li>
            <li> It will remove the top layer of your nail.</li>
            <li> I just love this nail system.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
            <li> Gelish is one of the top brands out there</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The Top</li>
            <li> They are okay.</li>
            <li> Also top coat is runny.</li>
            <li> but I think top coat should do the job with one coat.</li>
            <li> Love it would recommend to any do it your sellers:)</li>
            <li> I was on Amazon looking to buy Shellac and decided to give Gelish a try because the price was so much better.</li>
            <li> I think BondAide works better than pH bond however.</li>
            <li> I have done my nails with our a bonder many times though.</li>
            <li> I love that it manages to make my nails completely smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to not do by sunlight or your top it off will stiffen up.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love all Gelish products and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It really gives my nails a great primer for the polish.</li>
            <li> The polish will lift for sure.</li>
            <li> They seem to give better coverage and are easier to control than the longer ones.</li>
            <li> they work better then the ones that I got in the kit.</li>
            <li> I needed to replenish my gelish supplies, and I am so glad I came to Amazon to do so.</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish brand.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Gelish brand and will not use another gel nail product.</li>
            <li> The french tip gelish product always looks very elegant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;For about a year I was sure the Gelish line was the best, but I am convinced Shellac is the longest lasting brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gelish does take a lot more work to remove than Shellac, that is why I thought it was stronger.</li>
            <li> These work fantastic!</li>
            <li> This has solved the issue that arose after I had done so many manicures that I was running out of the basics.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Gelish since they are a more well-known brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these four times now and love the Gelish products.</li>
            <li> but I love Gelish.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products.  </li>
            <li> So glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> better than Calgel, I love them</li>
            <li> Top It Off.</li>
            <li> Great products and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> the top coat is shiny.  </li>
            <li> I also have the CND top coat/base and find that I reach for Gelish more often.</li>
            <li> Top</li>
            <li> No matter how many coats of polish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been able to use the Gelish products with IBD and Fingerpaints gel polish with no problem.</li>
            <li> see too many overweight ladies with dyed and permed hair and overdesigned nails.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly be more pleased with my transaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I apply the bonding product which I think is just acetone kind of to clean the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I did my very first gel nails on my own last night and they came out perfectly!!  </li>
            <li> Many dry perfectly opaque, which is  boon if you&#x27;re like me and work with paints and stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> three pack is great for those new to DIY gel nails.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> My technique isn&#x27;t as good as the nail technician&#x27;s but its good enough to save me money in between time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gel polish can shrink, some more than others, so it&#x27;s important to make sure to cap the tip of your nail with each coat so it&#x27;ll fully shrink onto your nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gel polish can shrink, some more than others, so it&#x27;s important to make sure to cap the tip of your nail with each coat so it&#x27;ll fully shrink onto your nail.</li>
            <li> Also, the products work great and are superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> The top off is SUPER SHINY!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Likewise, the topcoat dries very quickly and is quite glossy, not to mention the gelish colors are generally very awesome, with a very wide range of colors and shines.  </li>
            <li> The polish easily lasts 2 weeks when I want to replace it anyway because of nail growth.</li>
            <li> My nails will look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> The Harmony - 3 pack soaks off easily.</li>
            <li> I make sure to clean my nails before I start and file and buff everything as needed.  </li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to do gel nails at home.  </li>
            <li> So I gave it a try myself and didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to do.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a starter item when I first started doing my own gel nails.</li>
            <li> Was pleased to find a full bottle of the phbond.</li>
            <li> Helps create the perfect gel manicure with a price less than one visit to the salon.</li>
            <li> and they are still fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine but have never used anything else.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and you will get perfect looking nails for much less than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was safely packaged.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and she is satisfied with the product and the fact that it came to her door.</li>
            <li> I have used them once and my nails are strong, shiny, and chip free after 8 days.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing and if you are just using it to do your own nails and toes, it will last you forever.</li>
            <li> Huge difference between store product and this product.</li>
            <li> DID I MENTION TO USE A LINT FREE CLOTH?  </li>
            <li> but it was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...</li>
            <li> I bought a light</li>
            <li> The pH Bond prepares your nail surface and makes it suitable for the first coat of the Foundation Base.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I got the 12 watt LED light from U Spicy</li>
            <li> Quality product, bottle, and brush for smooth application.</li>
            <li> This is a great combo for someone starting out or someone who needs a refill - like I did.  </li>
            <li> It arrived within the ship/delivery window, and package securely.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> so I can smooth out the edge after.</li>
            <li> so I can smooth out the edge after.</li>
            <li> a UV light to cure (AKA harden and set)</li>
            <li> a must have if you are going to do the home UV light.</li>
            <li> Has anyone tried an additional coat of Top-It-Off after a week or so to re-seal free edges, prolong manicure and help protect nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> n free edges</li>
            <li> I do 2 minutes for the clear coats and 1 for each color coat with great success.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is short and I LOVE THIS!!</li>
            <li> Also, because your nails are supposed to be a clean, oil free zone, eat before you start.</li>
            <li> And super easy</li>
            <li> My nails are growing fast and are very strong.  </li>
            <li> Excited to continue practicing and improve my execution.</li>
            <li> and I can see where my nail has grown out significantly since the gelish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been able to use the Gelish products with IBD and Fingerpaints gel polish with no problem.d first</li>
            <li> off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...</li>
            <li> still clean my nails with rubbing alcohol before I use the pH bonder.</li>
            <li> You just lightly clean off your nails then wash your hands</li>
            <li> I use a LED light and the cure time was quick.</li>
            <li> It helps hydrate and clean the nail for the gel base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a wood stick to clean up the nail edges.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes on good and stays on, I do use the Gelish polish with these but have used other brands and it works well.</li>
            <li> now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it</li>
            <li> Love this kit it has save me so much time and money.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon.</li>
            <li> love the new polish and light</li>
            <li> There are other kits available but to be honest this kit is a much better buy.</li>
            <li> i love french manicures and i love the gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li> If there is a sticky layer after curing the top coat layer, just wipe it off with alcohol and it will shine like the high heaven</li>
            <li> The company fixed the issue right away!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Gelish since it very first came on the market.</li>
            <li> Unlike my local beauty supply store, these are full size bottles, and the Harmony Gelish brand is of pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li> work great with the Harmony Gelish polishes and other products!</li>
            <li> I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it</li>
            <li> It is strong and very chip</li>
            <li> remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li> It is HOT and it BURNS!</li>
            <li> Still learning the technique but satisfied so far!</li>
            <li> so I may try that next time around and purchase the 2 pack instead with just the foundation and top coat!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> They cured very well under my LED light, and of course the Top it Off left a sticky residue that is easily removed with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Your get full size ½ ounce bottles of these products which is 66% more than you get in many other Gelish kits.</li>
            <li> This product has given a weeks worth of no chip, no flake, manicure.</li>
            <li> Now I am able to complete the task at home, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> The folks at gelish really have a good bead on a simple product, that anyone can use!</li>
            <li> I did pretty good for the first try, but there is a learning curve, you really have to use a very light coat or it will run down the side of your nail when drying</li>
            <li> maybe that is because I put the product on right.</li>
            <li> and she was so right.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*Cures and hardens right away.</li>
            <li> I do only French manicures on myself and my nails always look beautiful.</li>
            <li> I learned pretty quickly after the first time.</li>
            <li> Easy application and quick dry with UV light.</li>
            <li> After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li> When I get brave enough to try French manicures, I&#x27;ll probably try to extend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes very fast.</li>
            <li> Also, I do not sand my nails very much.</li>
            <li> I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The application is super easy, just like how you would paint your nails with regular polish.</li>
            <li> For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of</li>
            <li> I did a more american manicure vs french (more forgiving, don&#x27;t have to be as exact).</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fluke the first time</li>
            <li> I love the short brushes.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go!  </li>
            <li> They need to make it the same size as the PH Bond and Foundation for more accuracy.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased at cosmoprof beauty supply and this is identical in quality and much cheaper in price!</li>
            <li> Use it the first time I tried gel on my nails</li>
            <li> so you know they are for real!</li>
            <li> Same product, just more of it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> When I find them, I just touch up those spots and cure them again, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the manicure after, but it&#x27;s just easier to prevent it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It Off has a more standard nail brush and liquid consistency.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth, last long, looks shiny and pretty for almost 3 weeks if you do it right.</li>
            <li> Additional benefit includes MY OWN hard, strong</li>
            <li> Regarding cleaning the nail after curing, the instructions on the bottle call for a \\&quot;dry clean of the surface\\&quot; with a lint free wipe.</li>
            <li> ; dry in my LED light for 60 seconds, and clean with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails.</li>
            <li> - I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It</li>
            <li> The larger sizes make good financial sense.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service, and they very promptly sent me out a new bottle of the topcoat, and threw in a full sized bottle of the cuticle oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system and currently use the \\&quot;Gelly Sandwich\\&quot; technique and my nails are beautiful with such a brilliant shine and long lasting... at least a week or two!</li>
            <li> The trick is to go light with the polish layers (sometimes a 3rd color coat is required because you are going light), and dont get near cuticles.</li>
            <li> I love the product and will be using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to be detailed enough to help the next person. :)</li>
            <li> But I can usually get by  with just polish and some  good hand lotion.</li>
            <li> The Gelish set is by far superior to any other gel polish in my opinion.</li>
            <li> a Gelish manicure will last two weeks, easy.</li>
            <li> each for the large size, and the package deal</li>
            <li> Love the product, goes on fast, lasts reasonably well (not as long a salon application).</li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t build up too much, but it dries in no longer than 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much if a difference if any.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I believe the primer really helps.</li>
            <li> have real, grown up nails on both hands now and have had for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li> Bonus, my LED lamp does the whole hand as well.</li>
            <li> but I used too much and the excess settled in the sidewalls of my nails.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> After curing, it&#x27;s very tacky and requires cleaning.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve only needed one coat to make my nails perfectly smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> When the nail grows out too much, I just start over, instead of trying to do upkeep</li>
            <li> I have a drink with a straw on the table ready to go</li>
            <li> My nails grow out too much with get polish.</li>
            <li> My nails looked as good as the day I did them for at least a week...</li>
            <li> Makes it kind of messy when using it.</li>
            <li> Now, they are long and strong.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than any other Gel system I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I loved the products in the smaller size available at Sally&#x27;s, but getting the larger size (for the same price I might add), is double the pleasure.  </li>
            <li> I soak my finger tips in warm water for a bit, dry, then push back and trim my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I like to fully complete the four fingers on each hand first</li>
            <li> Less is better.</li>
            <li> I have had particular problems growing my thumb nails because I use them to pry and scrape things.</li>
            <li> It is REALLY important to use the foundation and top coat in thin layers.</li>
            <li> I love the red, white, and nude gel colors</li>
            <li> as I had it professionally applied at two different salons where I&#x27;ve had great results in the past.</li>
            <li> so i highly recommend this product, I made this decision because it was cheaper to buy as a bundle then separately.</li>
            <li> do my cuticles directly before starting each hand to make sure I can cover as much nail as possible.</li>
            <li> so I can use the thumb on either side to pull back skin on other fingers to fully paint the nail or to tidy up an edge</li>
            <li> so I can use the thumb on either side to pull back skin on other fingers to fully paint the nail or to tidy up an edge</li>
            <li> I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail</li>
            <li> so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is the size of the brush on the Top coat (too long for my liking).  </li>
            <li> Although it does take practice to apply but once he get use to applying it, it is definitely worth the money considering that one gel french tip manecure can cost between $45-$55.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on clear than every other color since clear is simple, clean, and classy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do regular nail polish manicures that often because of how long they didn&#x27;t last, so I wasn&#x27;t very handy wielding a nail brush, especially with my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just try it, you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I may need to buy a new uv lamp...</li>
            <li> I am new to at-home gel manicures and have seen these products in a lot of the YouTube videos I&#x27;ve watched.</li>
            <li> The liquid is very smooth, almost slick.</li>
            <li> It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure.</li>
            <li> Love this little set!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set together with another Gelish color, my UV light nail dryer and a couple of other gel colors from different brands to do my nails at home for the first time.</li>
            <li> These products arrived very fast and they were just what I was looking for at a fraction of the price at local stores!</li>
            <li> videos available online for demonstration of use, just remember not to thick, and wipe it off skin/cuticle before curing and you will have a shine for weeks and weeks and healthy long natural nails.</li>
            <li> The 3 bottles are pretty big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the shellac products, the opi onces, and a few other brands and none of them are as good as the gelish ones.</li>
            <li> wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture.</li>
            <li> Also since the bottles are large they last forever.</li>
            <li> It Off is the top coat that provides the glossy and hard protective surface to the colored nail polish</li>
            <li> The foundation as well as the top coat are both super thick, so make sure to use VERY thin coats, otherwise it will run over onto your skin.</li>
            <li> I love having nice looking nails, but hate having to spend all the money at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a glossy clear.</li>
            <li> I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far.</li>
            <li> and it just sets it off and provides a professional finish to the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can now have armour on my natural nails</li>
            <li> Products are always on time or early.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading a lot of product reviews, I took the plunge and invested in a few colors and an led light.  </li>
            <li> have thrown away all of my old polishes, too.</li>
            <li> Arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> so these should last much longer.</li>
            <li> I was an early adopter of UV or LED-cured nail</li>
            <li> I went through the mini bottles so fast I had to get the bigger ones this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to keep a manicure for at least 3 weeks....</li>
            <li> The key is to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> It works really well with a proper UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> it really allows for control of foundation which is a critical application step.</li>
            <li> When you rub them together, they even make the clacky noise you get with professionally done gel nails or acrylics.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cap it as much, didn&#x27;t go under the nail at all and pushed back any glitter pieces that were on the edge</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cap it as much, didn&#x27;t go under the nail at all and pushed back any glitter pieces that were on the edge</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of gel nail polish base that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> The gels form a strong, thick coating that looks like an ordinary polish manicure, but acts more like a sculpt.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular set again, but only because of the Ph Bond.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular set again, but only because of the Ph Bond.</li>
            <li> It really changes how long the manicure lasts, literally the difference between a day and a week.</li>
            <li> far more than when I use Shellac top and base.</li>
            <li> My package arrived first, and one of the bottles hadn&#x27;t been tightly closed and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are extremely short so its hard to get an even coat without dipping and re-dipping the brush but other than that pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> When you add in how long that manicure is going to last, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Favorite base and top coat</li>
            <li> Love the shine of the top coat and base to.</li>
            <li> You will for sure need the base and top coat for your gel nails, so you can skip those two products.  </li>
            <li> With all the bottles, its easy to get a thick nail when finished</li>
            <li> Favorite brand of gel polish for base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> It has all 3 of the major things you need</li>
            <li> I learned that on my first hand, so on my other</li>
            <li> I learned that on my first hand, so on my other</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that I get bored with colors on my hands pretty easily.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...</li>
            <li> I usually check around my nail and clean up any drip/excess that is on the skin.</li>
            <li> so keep it thin other wise</li>
            <li> Then I carefully file/smooth down the edges near the outgrown cuticle; then clean the nail surface with alcohol; apply one thin coat of Top It</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference on how long your nails will last.  </li>
            <li> I have only used them twice so far.</li>
            <li> Final product is professional looking.</li>
            <li> If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later.</li>
            <li> so I could do my own gel manicures because they are so expensive at the salon.</li>
            <li> With less than the cost of 2 trips to the salon for gel manicures, I was ready to go!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had extensive experience with all the major brands available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to provide a much longer lasting, even coating than other types of nail polish also.</li>
            <li> I prefer other brands for the colors but this base coat is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> recommend this set in particular because the ph bond cures the one issue I did have, which was having an entire gel coat peel off after some abuse or after a shower or wet chore.  </li>
            <li> The Ph Bonder is fine, but the base and top coat are thick and the brushes are too bulky or flimsy or something and make applying the product a little challenging.</li>
            <li> The PH bond seems to really dry the nail out, eliminating the need to buff the natural nail.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried, I could never get the surface clean with a dry wipe.</li>
            <li> Right now it takes at least 1hr to get my nails</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work better or worse than other brands.  </li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top itoff sealer...</li>
            <li> The trick for me has been two VERY thin coats of each, top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I have tried &amp;#34;Gelly Sandwiching&amp;#34; with my regular polishes and they do not last as long as using the actual gelish products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These size bottles will last you a long time as you only use one coat of each product when you do your nails.</li>
            <li> Big bottles will last long.</li>
            <li> It cures quickly and is very hard.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long I could try to keep the same manicure going.</li>
            <li> Full sized bottles for less than half the price at other places for mini bottles.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve already seen a marked improvement since I started doing gel nails, and the time it takes is going down.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, but you can do the same thing with rubbing alcohol (which is the main ingredient in the PH Bond) and you can buy it in a large bottle for a couple bucks.</li>

            <li> Definitely beats going to the salon, and it will be cheaper in the long run!</li>
            <li> I only have to remove product after 2 weeks because I don&#x27;t like my nails very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Lumsing White LED and in only 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Tips: After applying the base, go over the whole nail a few more times with the brush to make sure the coat is thin and even.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of gel base, top and polish.</li>
            <li> but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins</li>
            <li> It was minor, so I filed and even the filing (of the tips) didn&#x27;t effect the gelish..</li>
            <li> I even notice nail growth where before they would always break long before.</li>
            <li> n long nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing some research and being an avid nail polish collector, I was tired of the chipping after a day or two with regular polish.</li>
            <li> The bottles were tightly sealed, so I had to have some help opening them, and on of the bottles had a little spilled out on the side, but nothing much</li>
            <li> Beauty supply stores sell the smaller version, I think it&#x27;s half the size, for a similar price.</li>
            <li> I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry...</li>
            <li> Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n</li>
            <li> and finally I have a French Manicure without destroying my nails with tips or acrylic.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I purchased the gelish kit above</li>
            <li> Like most women in my family, I have had very weak, brittle, slow growing nails my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit sloppy and got either the foundation or the top coat on my fingers (oops), but that was all clumsy user error.</li>
            <li> With Gelish, I had no chip on my natural nails for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the foundation, I thought I was applying a thin layer</li>
            <li> So next time, I&#x27;ll definitely just buy the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> So next time, I&#x27;ll definitely just buy the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry...</li>
            <li> but you can buy those locally for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the strength that gel polish gives to my naturally weak nails.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t by just the base and top coat, you need the PH Bond!</li>
            <li> Do be careful not to let the foundation/top coat drip onto your skin when you stick your hand into a UV lamp.</li>
            <li> and I am rough on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Only used 2 times and the brushes are splitting so the polish is uneven.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I watched some videos on you tube on the gely sandwich where you can use your regular polish with the gel top and base coat to turn it into a gel polish.</li>
            <li> The Foundation Base makes a sticky base to assure proper adhesion of the UV polish to your nail for that long lasting and beautiful nail job that you want to last about 2 weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> I use this brand along with a couple of others, but this is definitely my go-to product for base and top coat, hands down!  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use it in an LED dryer for the fastest drying and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Everything I needed other than the color.</li>
            <li> The other kits have .30 ounces and these bottles have .50 ounces.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve bought these products before from other sellers, sometimes the phbond is evaporated before I even get it.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would just be like other alcohol, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I feel like the other batch I had lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> My foundation bottle is clumpy due to my lack of organization.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands</li>
            <li> I hardly ever go to the salon except when I think I need an actual manicure.</li>
            <li> I used a dark color</li>
            <li> I change my polish when I get bored (plus it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than going to the salon)</li>
            <li> I prefer the OPI brand for top and base coat.</li>
            <li> Oh good grief, if you are paying $40 to get you get manicure done, STOP!!</li>
            <li> Gelish PH Bond, Foundation Base, Top it</li>
            <li> No matter what brand of color you are using, I would still use this Gelish base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I bought an LED lamp about 6 months ago to save money on manicures, but the base and top coats that came with it were a disaster--chipping and cracking within two days.</li>
            <li> I tried the gelish system with these and a gelish color in between the top coat and the base coat.  </li>
            <li> still like some of the Gelish color polish, but I always use Shellac top and base coat.</li>
            <li> I no longer use Gelish base or top coat.</li>
            <li> But now I realize Gelish top and base crack and chip</li>
            <li> : They go about 1-2 weeks before they start to grow down and lift at the edges.</li>
            <li> But the Gelish brand hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> But the Gelish brand hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> And after 2 weeks I file my nails down a bit n re-shape them.</li>
            <li> Every time I do the final cleaning, it&#x27;s still hard for me to believe that 7 coats of nail polish dried in less than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I previously used the mini bottles and those lasted almost 6 months</li>
            <li> This has also made her nails less prone to rip because it strengthens the nail since its a hardened layer.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to cap the nail with each coat from base to top coat, but I&#x27;ve found that if you are using a chunky glitter and you cap the tip, after it cures it feels like an uneven nail edge.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to cap the nail with each coat from base to top coat, but I&#x27;ve found that if you are using a chunky glitter and you cap the tip, after it cures it feels like an uneven nail edge.</li>
            <li> In the last 2-3 years my nails have been extremely brittle, thin and could not grow them at all.</li>
            <li> (push back my cuticles, buff, and file) my nails before applying THIN layers of the PH Bond, base, and top coat.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve made it to 2 weeks with only a very small chip that was just in the shine, not the actual polish color, so it was almost impossible to notice.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t dry or you get thick sides it is NOT the products fault.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The other kits do have a small bottle of alcohol and another of nail polish remover</li>
            <li> I used little so it doesn&#x27;t run then</li>
            <li> and I did manage to chip one or two - it was because I broke my nail a little.  </li>
            <li> Gelish sells a liquid that you use once your done to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; off the sticky coat that remains on your nails, but I just use a little paper towel square with some rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I also come up a little under my nail tip to help solidify the color.</li>
            <li> I also come up a little under my nail tip to help solidify the color.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay the salon prices for nails that only going to make them worse once removed.</li>
            <li> $ wasted.</li>
            <li> It started to chip and peal in a few days twice in a row.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands.</li>
            <li> Not to be used everyday.</li>
            <li> Having polish on your skin can break the seal on your nail and lift up the polish after a few days.</li>
            <li> The key to applying the gel is thin layers you don&#x27;t want to do heavy layers or it will not do what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> The only solution I found previously was expensive sculpture manicures that required bi-weekly appointments to fill, and because I am very active, I would still manage to chip them.  </li>
            <li> Worse, they tended to be pretty obviously fake, thick, and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nail have grown with very little breakage.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow but still within estimated dates.</li>
            <li> : At the beauty store you buy a small bottle for almost the sameprice</li>
            <li> They will grow just past the fingertip and then splinter, crack, and tear.  </li>
            <li> I had a small glitch with the order.</li>
            <li> PH bond is very thin and evaporates almost instantly after applying.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush in the top it off and foundation base began falling apart after only a few uses, makes it very difficult for application of the product.</li>
            <li> the foundation gel seems thick and sticky and i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how its supposed to be</li>
            <li> Sorry this review is so long, but I made almost all of my gel polish choices based off of reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> If the liquid spill out a little it is very thick and get all over the place.</li>
            <li> Found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> and I am hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> like any nail polish (and acts like a thin layer of fake nail without chipping if properly applied)&lt;br /&gt;*Need</li>
            <li> (ME)&lt;br /&gt;*People who are clumsy or have children</li>
            <li> The foundation is REALLY thick</li>
            <li> I try to not put it on too thick</li>
            <li> Gelish had a much thicker base coat.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush shape on the base coat as well.</li>
            <li> Kiss product is so thick.</li>
            <li> Its thick</li>
            <li> I emphasize applying in thin layers because thick layers will give you a messy, melted-onto-your-cuticles</li>
            <li> Apply a very thin coat of the gel polish color you have picked out n cure for 1 minute, 2 minutes for dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even use the base sometimes with a nail form to fill in chips to my natural nail.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for 30 minutes (not 15 as recommended) just because my nails are so weak</li>
            <li> It can also be used to bolster weak spots in the nail or on splits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Foundation Base is very thick and comes with a short stubby brush.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails and the gelish on them</li>
            <li> I am so tired of throwing money out the window when I go to the salons.</li>
            <li> I also have to keep it thin.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending money at the nail salon every 2 weeks for a manicure with gel polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;WHO SHOULD BUY THIS?&lt;br /&gt;*People with thin, brittle nails&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;*People who hate waiting for nails to dry</li>
            <li> The bond prevents the peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the foundation is stronger than any other base I tried.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re supposed to apply a very thin layer,</li>
            <li> Apply a very THIN coat of gelish foundation, cure in LED lamp for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails are very thin and bend no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and brittle nails</li>
            <li> They grow like crazy with the gel polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use the wood stick on, then I do my thumbs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use the wood stick on, then I do my thumbs</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t do that, after curing the polish and cleaning the nail, I find random spots on the nail that don&#x27;t have the base on it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad or old/expired batch, but I&#x27;ve had this applied twice and both times in 2 days it peeled off.</li>
            <li> my nails still don&#x27;t look too bad...</li>
            <li> outgrowth gets bad, but it never chips.  </li>
            <li> I got frustrated and almost gave up on doing manicures</li>
            <li> I have found I have to put the base coat on one finger and then put that finger in the dryer for a bit otherwise</li>
            <li> the base coat doesn&#x27;t stay around the edges of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and convenient base set needed for any gel polish manicures.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the lamp and base color.  </li>
            <li> , so I use a lot of the base and</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve done up to 6: 1 base coat, 3 coats of color and 2 coats of chunky glitter)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reviewer suggested two coats of the Foundation Base to help strengthen nails.</li>
            <li> I hope, one day, these ladies realize how horrifying they look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price for this product. The 3 bottles are pretty big so they will last a while. The application is super easy, just like how you would paint your nails with regular polish. Do be careful not to let the foundation/top coat drip onto your skin when you stick your hand into a UV lamp. It is HOT and it BURNS! I learned pretty quickly after the first time. I usually check around my nail and clean up any drip/excess that is on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great shipping!! Gelish is the bomb!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was safely packaged. Worked great for a first-timer! I was a bit sloppy and got either the foundation or the top coat on my fingers (oops), but that was all clumsy user error. Good product, and my nails look fierce. Excited to continue practicing and improve my execution.</li>
            <li> Everything Gelish is wonderful.  I do my own nails and love, love, love this system.</li>
            <li> I prefer the OPI brand for top and base coat.</li>
            <li> Great, no complaints.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing and if you are just using it to do your own nails and toes, it will last you forever.</li>
            <li> Bought it because of the Harmony but has been chipping within 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;not sure if I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> i was going to the salon but i decided to try it on my own. i love french manicures and i love the gelish nail polish. this set got me started!</li>
            <li> This set is GREAT. I bought it as a starter item when I first started doing my own gel nails. I really like this brand and I would buy again. The foundation is REALLY thick and you&#x27;re supposed to apply a very thin layer, so that&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; part about this set. Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit.  Foundation should be wiped after curing.  USE A LINT FREE CLOTH! Or you will be pulling your hair out.  It will remain tacky.  It helps the builder gels or top coat...whatever you plan to use next adhere.  That is it&#x27;s purpose.  DID I MENTION TO USE A LINT FREE CLOTH?  Very glad I have these.</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally at Sally&#x27;s and it&#x27;s twice the size.</li>
            <li> This is a nice starter kit for home use. It works great with my LED dryer. I do 2 minutes for the clear coats and 1 for each color coat with great success. I&#x27;ve had good adherence and no chipping. The polish easily lasts 2 weeks when I want to replace it anyway because of nail growth.</li>
            <li> Just Great, the top coat gives a perfect finish to your nails. I bought this with the Lumsing White LED and in only 30 sec. finish each coat.</li>
            <li> In the last 2-3 years my nails have been extremely brittle, thin and could not grow them at all. I have been using Gelish for 3 weeks now and finally I have a French Manicure without destroying my nails with tips or acrylic. I refuse to pay the salon prices for nails that only going to make them worse once removed. Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it but it was no longer available. So when I found out about Gelish I instantly bought the basics for French Manicure. - I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It Off. I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to compare; my nails with and without Gelish: I started with no nail growth at all, because I they constantly broke as they grew. With Gelish, I had no chip on my natural nails for the past 3 weeks. Once I removed Gelish and let my nails breathe for a day, I instantly broke two of my nails completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAMP: I use a 9Watt UV lamp I had for years. It works perfectly, but it will cure slower. Instead of 30secs I cure each layer for 4 minutes. Once this lamp goes I will switch over to a 30 watt lamp. Right now it takes at least 1hr to get my nails done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOAK OFF: Buff the surface then I use foil, cotton ball soaked with the Soak Off remover. I leave it on for 30 minutes (not 15 as recommended) just because my nails are so weak I do not want to rish the chance of hurting them. - After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover. My nails will look healthy and clean. DO NOT PRY OR TEAR IT. It will remove the top layer of your nail. - I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails. Then let my nails breathe for a while before putting Gelish on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: At the beauty store you buy a small bottle for almost the sameprice so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I now know about the Cleanser and the Soak off remover, I will probably not reorder refills. I will get 100% acetone for a cheaper price at stores it does not have to be brand name. It goes very fast. I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far. I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it Off. It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure. - While I did not try yet, I read you can sandwich regular polish in between layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURABILITY: They go about 1-2 weeks before they start to grow down and lift at the edges. However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges. It took a little while to get the hang of it. They may last 3 weeks with these but I do a lot of housework so they do go through a lot of wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Soak off: 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- White tip. - Though technically you should not, I find that I need to remove tackiness from the layer on which I am putting the white tip of Sheek White on. For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of solid white.&lt;br /&gt;- Less is better. Do not apply close to the sides and cuticles of your nail. If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later. The product will level a bit during curing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush in the top it off and foundation base began falling apart after only a few uses, makes it very difficult for application of the product.</li>
            <li> Oh good grief, if you are paying $40 to get you get manicure done, STOP!! This stuff is awesome! I have done my nails one time, it&#x27;s been 10 days with no signs of wear, at all! And super easy to doM I did a more american manicure vs french (more forgiving, don&#x27;t have to be as exact). I want I take if off, just so I can do it again! Now, haven&#x27;t soaked off a gel manicure yet, so can&#x27;t speak to that. But, awesome looking nails for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m in! Seriously, just try it, you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I just love this nail system.  My nails are growing fast and are very strong.  They last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Gelish is a great product and this is the best way to get the 3 main items you need to get started doing your own nails.  Love it! Saving tons of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gelish polish for some time now and have never had the issues I&#x27;ve had with this set. Maybe I got a bad or old/expired batch, but I&#x27;ve had this applied twice and both times in 2 days it peeled off. Not chipped, lifted &amp; peeled. The entire application peeled off leaving nothing on my nails. The color polish isn&#x27;t to blame as I have used it before and it wasn&#x27;t user error as I had it professionally applied at two different salons where I&#x27;ve had great results in the past.I thought it was a fluke the first time so I paid to have it applied again and the same thing happened. $ wasted. Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> This polish is great. I did my nails at home with it and the  Melody Suzie 12W LED dryer and it works perfectly. I try to not put it on too thick so it doesn&#x27;t build up too much, but it dries in no longer than 90 seconds. Make sure to use it in an LED dryer for the fastest drying and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use them with all my gel products not just gelish. This is my manicure routine for gel polish n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove all cuticles, I use Sally Hansen \\&quot;instant cuticle remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down. After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n than I use a spoon metal cuticle pusher to push back my cuticles n remover the cuticle that has grown on my nail plate all the way around my nail, sides included...do not cut your cuticles or the skin around your nail plate, that&#x27;s what causes them to split and become callus. Should NEVER touch any of the skin around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash hands good to remove all the cuticle remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail n any remaining cuticle on the my nail plate only. This does not damage the nail plate n by using the E Drill it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...I will NEVER use a block buffer or file on my nails ever again. Since giving up the buffer n file and using the E file only, my nails n the skin around my nail plate has never been healthier. There is a video on YouTube on how to do a proper manicure prep before applying gel polishes n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shape nails with a OPI crystal file, filing in one direction only. Do not file side to side this will only rip your nails and do not file the sides of your nails at all, this weakens the nails support causing them to break. Tips only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I use a brush or nail duster to remover the nail dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry...than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry...than I apply the gelish ph bond air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top itoff sealer...off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...so alway check all nails good before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply a very THIN coat of gelish foundation, cure in LED lamp for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture. I got this tip off the gelish web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Apply a very thin coat of the gel polish color you have picked out n cure for 1 minute, 2 minutes for dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Apply another coat of your color, again cure but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins n cure your 3rd coat 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer. I usually put 2 coats of this on curing the first coat 2 minutes n curing the second coat for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...never use anything cotton with your gels or regular polish it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li> Just what you need to get started on your own gel nail manicure at home.  Love this little set!  quality products</li>
            <li> Everything I needed other than the color. Gelish is one of the top brands out there and it lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I watched some videos on you tube on the gely sandwich where you can use your regular polish with the gel top and base coat to turn it into a gel polish. I have tried it several times and it works. My technique isn&#x27;t as good as the nail technician&#x27;s but its good enough to save me money in between time. I like the gelish line. I have not tried the OPI line at home but I did not hear great reviews about it when I was getting my nails done in the salon. Now that I have bought these and the lamp nail dryer I hardly ever go to the salon except when I think I need an actual manicure. But I can usually get by  with just polish and some  good hand lotion. I would recommend this to anyone that does at home manicures.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes on good and stays on, I do use the Gelish polish with these but have used other brands and it works well. The key to applying the gel is thin layers you don&#x27;t want to do heavy layers or it will not do what it is suppose to. If it doesn&#x27;t dry or you get thick sides it is NOT the products fault. Harmony is the only product I use.</li>
            <li> Great price for all three!!</li>
            <li> it was for my daughter and she is very pleased. It arrived quickly and she is satisfied with the product and the fact that it came to her door.</li>
            <li> I bought a light so I could do my own gel manicures because they are so expensive at the salon. These products are the same products used in the salon and I can now do just as good a job as the professionals saving lots of money. I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great three pack of quality products from Gelish. My wife convinced my daughter in law to do her own fingernails and we recommended that she purchase this kit. There are other kits available but to be honest this kit is a much better buy. Your get full size ½ ounce bottles of these products which is 66% more than you get in many other Gelish kits. The other kits have .30 ounces and these bottles have .50 ounces. The other kits do have a small bottle of alcohol and another of nail polish remover but you can buy those locally for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are three great products and if you want to do a great job of polishing your nails then you need these items.&lt;br /&gt;* The pH Bond prepares your nail surface and makes it suitable for the first coat of the Foundation Base.&lt;br /&gt;* The Foundation Base makes a sticky base to assure proper adhesion of the UV polish to your nail for that long lasting and beautiful nail job that you want to last about 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;* The Top It Off is the top coat that provides the glossy and hard protective surface to the colored nail polish and it just sets it off and provides a professional finish to the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These size bottles will last you a long time as you only use one coat of each product when you do your nails. This is a 5 star set of products and I recommend them to you.</li>
            <li> They are okay. It started to chip and peal in a few days twice in a row. Also top coat is runny. I used little so it doesn&#x27;t run then it chipped, so I applied twice but I think top coat should do the job with one coat.</li>
            <li> Love it would recommend to any do it your sellers:)</li>
            <li> I have used Gelish since it very first came on the market. I was on Amazon looking to buy Shellac and decided to give Gelish a try because the price was so much better. Gelish had a much thicker base coat. The thickness is nice because it won&#x27;t run onto your cuticles. I have found I have to put the base coat on one finger and then put that finger in the dryer for a bit otherwise the base coat doesn&#x27;t stay around the edges of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;I still clean my nails with rubbing alcohol before I use the pH bonder. I think BondAide works better than pH bond however. I have done my nails with our a bonder many times though. I don&#x27;t notice much if a difference if any.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this top coat! I have never had any issues with it! I love that it manages to make my nails completely smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love this kit it has save me so much time and money. It is awesome I absolutely love it and will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this brand because it&#x27;s what my manicurist was using on my nails. It&#x27;s great quality and it looks like I might know what I&#x27;m doing when I use these :)</li>
            <li> Favorite base and top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands. I really like the brush shape on the base coat as well.</li>
            <li> Huge difference between store product and this product. Kiss product is so thick. Just make sure to not do by sunlight or your top it off will stiffen up. Found out the hard way. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Good product for a good price.Love the shine of the top coat and base to.Will buy it again.Big bottles will last long.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in great condition! The bottles were tightly sealed, so I had to have some help opening them, and on of the bottles had a little spilled out on the side, but nothing much or that I couldn&#x27;t handle! They cured very well under my LED light, and of course the Top it Off left a sticky residue that is easily removed with alcohol.</li>
            <li> love the new polish and light I bought off Amazon I got the 12 watt LED light from U Spicy it works great!</li>
            <li> Gelish PH Bond, Foundation Base, Top it Off: EZ products to use. Great results. Quality product, bottle, and brush for smooth application. Love it.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve bought these products before from other sellers, sometimes the phbond is evaporated before I even get it. Was pleased to find a full bottle of the phbond. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of gel nail polish base that I have used before.  This was actually a repurchase because I was running low.  No matter what brand of color you are using, I would still use this Gelish base and top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a great set! I use it with a 36 watt LED curing lamp. The foundation as well as the top coat are both super thick, so make sure to use VERY thin coats, otherwise it will run over onto your skin. If it cures on your skin it&#x27;s a pain to get off.</li>
            <li> You will need all three of these (in addition to color, cleanser, and a UV lamp) if you use the Gelish nail system, so it&#x27;s a great idea to bundle them together. I love all Gelish products and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for DIY gel manicures. I bought an LED lamp about 6 months ago to save money on manicures, but the base and top coats that came with it were a disaster--chipping and cracking within two days. I got frustrated and almost gave up on doing manicures myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gelish! This stuff is simply awesome. My polish stays put and never peels. I believe the primer really helps. Seems like it would just be like other alcohol, but it&#x27;s not. It really gives my nails a great primer for the polish. The trick for me has been two VERY thin coats of each, top and bottom. And keep it off skin! The polish will lift for sure. I do only French manicures on myself and my nails always look beautiful. I even use the base sometimes with a nail form to fill in chips to my natural nail. Great stuff, you&#x27;ll never want to try another brand!!</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are extremely short so its hard to get an even coat without dipping and re-dipping the brush but other than that pretty satisfied. Shipping was quick which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service!</li>
            <li> I have only used Gelish once, I am totally hooked!!! I can now have armour on my natural nails and I don&#x27;t have to ruin my God given nails by putting acrylics on them!! I did pretty good for the first try, but there is a learning curve, you really have to use a very light coat or it will run down the side of your nail when drying and you&#x27;ll get it on the side of your skin. Luckily there are good youtube videos that will help with learning just how to put it on correctly and practice does make perfect!!</li>
            <li> Decided to invest in the Gelish supplies and try my hand at home manicures. With less than the cost of 2 trips to the salon for gel manicures, I was ready to go! The trick is to go light with the polish layers (sometimes a 3rd color coat is required because you are going light), and dont get near cuticles. You want to avoid excess around the cuticle, so keep a good margin inbetween in you can.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the products I received they all work well together. I would definitely buy this set again.</li>
            <li> this is a very good deal for the trio of polish. I have only used them twice so far. if you follow the directions you can find on utube on how to apply gelish Polish , I think you will be very satisfied with your home manicure. I would buy this again .</li>
            <li> I last for around 1-2 weeks. I may need to buy a new uv lamp... I feel like the other batch I had lasted a lot longer. Again it could be my uv lamp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t by just the base and top coat, you need the PH Bond! It really changes how long the manicure lasts, literally the difference between a day and a week. Love the product, goes on fast, lasts reasonably well (not as long a salon application). I put them on with a UV light and it works great.</li>
            <li> Products are always on time or early. I really like this brand of gel base, top and polish. Goes on nice and smooth, last long, looks shiny and pretty for almost 3 weeks if you do it right.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product!! I love the short brushes.They seem to give better coverage and are easier to control than the longer ones.</li>
            <li> Still learning the technique but satisfied so far!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing, period.  Like most women in my family, I have had very weak, brittle, slow growing nails my entire life.  They will grow just past the fingertip and then splinter, crack, and tear.  The only solution I found previously was expensive sculpture manicures that required bi-weekly appointments to fill, and because I am very active, I would still manage to chip them.  Worse, they tended to be pretty obviously fake, thick, and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a lot of product reviews, I took the plunge and invested in a few colors and an led light.  A few weeks later I purchased the gelish kit above and I prefer it to the starter brand I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product about eight weeks now, and I am still amazed.  The gels form a strong, thick coating that looks like an ordinary polish manicure, but acts more like a sculpt.  It is strong and very chip resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have real, grown up nails on both hands now and have had for weeks.  The polish takes a ton of abuse before chipping (laundry, woodworking, painting, gardening, etc are just some tests I have put it through!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this set in particular because the ph bond cures the one issue I did have, which was having an entire gel coat peel off after some abuse or after a shower or wet chore.  The bond prevents the peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the foundation is stronger than any other base I tried.  It can be used alone just as a basic nail strengthener.  It cures quickly and is very hard.  It can also be used to bolster weak spots in the nail or on splits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, the topcoat dries very quickly and is quite glossy, not to mention the gelish colors are generally very awesome, with a very wide range of colors and shines.  Many dry perfectly opaque, which is  boon if you&#x27;re like me and work with paints and stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown away all of my old polishes, too.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for the full sized version of these products.  Beauty supply stores sell the smaller version, I think it&#x27;s half the size, for a similar price. Also, the products work great and are superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> I tried the gelish system with these and a gelish color in between the top coat and the base coat.  My nails looked as good as the day I did them for at least a week... and I am rough on my nails.  With typing and I was doing some furniture assembly and I did manage to chip one or two - it was because I broke my nail a little.  It was minor, so I filed and even the filing (of the tips) didn&#x27;t effect the gelish.. just smoothed out the chip.  After about 2 1/2 weeks... my nails still don&#x27;t look too bad... I used a dark color and I can see where my nail has grown out significantly since the gelish application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it makes my nails feel thicker.  I have thin nails and the gelish on them feels good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. My nail have grown with very little breakage. I have had particular problems growing my thumb nails because I use them to pry and scrape things. Now, they are long and strong.  The Harmony - 3 pack soaks off easily. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Very good. I am happy.</li>
            <li> This set is a lot cheaper here or rather then purchasing them separately.&lt;br /&gt;They work great with the Harmony Gelish polishes and other products!</li>
            <li> The Ph Bonder is fine, but the base and top coat are thick and the brushes are too bulky or flimsy or something and make applying the product a little challenging.</li>
            <li> they work better then the ones that I got in the kit.</li>
            <li> We got this for my daughter as a gift.  She is very happy, and her nails look great.  This seems to provide a much longer lasting, even coating than other types of nail polish also.</li>
            <li> I had a small glitch with the order.The company fixed the issue right away!!! OH and the product is absolutly amazing</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great lasts weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Many videos available online for demonstration of use, just remember not to thick, and wipe it off skin/cuticle before curing and you will have a shine for weeks and weeks and healthy long natural nails.</li>
            <li> I needed to replenish my gelish supplies, and I am so glad I came to Amazon to do so. At the local beauty supply store each of these bottles was $18.95/each for the large size, and the package deal I got these with ended up being 3/$26! I bought three packages for myself and my friends that do their own gel nails. My package arrived first, and one of the bottles hadn&#x27;t been tightly closed and leaked all over the package. I contacted customer service, and they very promptly sent me out a new bottle of the topcoat, and threw in a full sized bottle of the cuticle oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these bottles will last me forever, but when they do finally run out, I&#x27;m coming back to Amazon!</li>
            <li> Aklthough gelish recommends that you get all kinds of things to start off with I think these three products are all the you need.  I make sure to clean my nails before I start and file and buff everything as needed.  Then I apply the bonding product which I think is just acetone kind of to clean the nail bed.  You will for sure need the base and top coat for your gel nails, so you can skip those two products.  Gelish sells a liquid that you use once your done to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; off the sticky coat that remains on your nails, but I just use a little paper towel square with some rubbing alcohol.  You just lightly clean off your nails then wash your hands and you&#x27;re ready to go!  Wooo Wooo to gelish!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish brand.  Only thing I would change is the size of the brush on the Top coat (too long for my liking).  They need to make it the same size as the PH Bond and Foundation for more accuracy.</li>
            <li> Still practicing with these. I am so tired of throwing money out the window when I go to the salons. My foundation bottle is clumpy due to my lack of organization. I need to put them in a sturdy area and not on the bed with me while doing my nails. If the liquid spill out a little it is very thick and get all over the place. Makes it kind of messy when using it. I also have to keep it thin. With all the bottles, its easy to get a thick nail when finished so keep it thin other wise it will lift and peel.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to do gel nails at home.  Save the money and buy the kit, after one application, it&#x27;s paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected. I have bought it as a present for a friend of mine. She is happy!!! Olga</li>
            <li> Favorite brand of gel polish for base coat and top coat. I prefer other brands for the colors but this base coat is the best I have used. It helps the polish stay on even longer.</li>
            <li> Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li> This is a perfect kit to get started on the gel nails!!  It has all 3 of the major things you need and then you can just get whatever colors you want.  I did my very first gel nails on my own last night and they came out perfectly!!  The ph bond is a must when doing your own gel nails at home.  It really makes a difference on how long your nails will last.  I used to get them done every month at the salon and they always used these products and it would last 4 weeks with no problems.  I&#x27;ve tried the shellac products, the opi onces, and a few other brands and none of them are as good as the gelish ones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Gelish brand and will not use another gel nail product. Every time I do my nails using the gelish products people always ask me where did you get your nails done? I consider this to be a hedge complement since I always do my nails myself. The french tip gelish product always looks very elegant and beautiful. Although it does take practice to apply but once he get use to applying it, it is definitely worth the money considering that one gel french tip manecure can cost between $45-$55. Also since the bottles are large they last forever. I previously used the mini bottles and those lasted almost 6 months so these should last much longer.</li>
            <li> These are essentials for my gel nails, and I was able to purchase them for a good price.  I am pleased!</li>
            <li> These came very quickly and in perfect condition! Very pleased to have found FULL SIZE BOTTLES and a 3 pack at that! Although I myself just learned recently that the ph bond is the same as rubbing alcohol so I may try that next time around and purchase the 2 pack instead with just the foundation and top coat! Otherwise this is perfect if you prefer the ph bond! I love the gelish system and currently use the \\&quot;Gelly Sandwich\\&quot; technique and my nails are beautiful with such a brilliant shine and long lasting... at least a week or two! Sure beats a day with chips by the days end! Will be back for more! Thank-You!!!</li>
            <li> This product works better than any other Gel system I&#x27;ve tried. I used the Inoco french nail tips, then . . waaaa laaaa. . used it over my Jamberry nail wraps. My nails are very thin and bend no matter what I do. This product has given a weeks worth of no chip, no flake, manicure. I use a LED light and the cure time was quick.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these for my gel polish!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife, she says this product works great, very good quality will purchase from this vendor again in the future.</li>
            <li> Best deal I have found for all three products. I have been using Gelish for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> Very good price for the combo set. All the bottles are full-sized and work well with my UV nail lamp and Gelish nail colors</li>
            <li> This is week 2 of my nails  working with gelish and they look as great as the day I applied the polish. No chipping. It&#x27;s great. I have tried &amp;#34;Gelly Sandwiching&amp;#34; with my regular polishes and they do not last as long as using the actual gelish products. Ah, well. I&#x27;ll just buy one at a time. It&#x27;s still cheaper than having my nails done weekly.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and convenient base set needed for any gel polish manicures. Easy application and quick dry with UV light. Works with any polish. Final product is professional looking.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.  :)</li>
            <li> Great products! Easy to use and work well!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li> I have been doing gel polish on my nails at home for 3 years now and I have used almost ALL the brands (I am not a nail tech). I LOVE the price of this brand, and it wears and goes on just perfect.  I have NO problems with peeling or chipping....maybe that is because I put the product on right.</li>
            <li> I love having nice looking nails, but hate having to spend all the money at the nail salon. Now I am able to complete the task at home, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for three full size bottles. All you need is a Gelish polish and you&#x27;re set.  I&#x27;m a stay at home mama and a Gelish manicure will last two weeks, easy.</li>
            <li> I was an early adopter of UV or LED-cured nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had extensive experience with all the major brands available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about a year I was sure the Gelish line was the best, but I am convinced Shellac is the longest lasting brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like some of the Gelish color polish, but I always use Shellac top and base coat. I no longer use Gelish base or top coat. I was never convinced that the PH bond made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish does take a lot more work to remove than Shellac, that is why I thought it was stronger. But now I realize Gelish top and base crack and chip far more than when I use Shellac top and base.</li>
            <li> These work fantastic! Looks just like the salon.</li>
            <li> I bought the gel mini kit to start. This has solved the issue that arose after I had done so many manicures that I was running out of the basics. The trio was cheaper than buying them separately.</li>
            <li> all 3 of the essentials, for an unbeatable price! Ive purchased at cosmoprof beauty supply and this is identical in quality and much cheaper in price!</li>
            <li> Got this as a recommendation from another user for doing Gelish at home.  Perfect.  Love it.  Great product and saved me tons of $$ to buy each piece rather than the Gelish starter kit with lamp.  Bonus, my LED lamp does the whole hand as well.</li>
            <li> As alway the Gelish products did what the were supposed to do.  I love the product and will be using it for a long time.  Amazon has the absolute best price.</li>
            <li> After doing some research and being an avid nail polish collector, I was tired of the chipping after a day or two with regular polish. So, I thought I would invest in some gel polish, a UV lamp, and start doing my own nails at home like I have been for the last couple years. I decided to try Gelish since they are a more well-known brand and I must say I received my order and tried it last night and I am pretty happy with the results. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a gel system without doing your research and learning the correct application techniques. But, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these four times now and love the Gelish products. Manicures last two weeks and I am hard on my nails. No chipping and removal is a breeze. I only have to remove product after 2 weeks because I don&#x27;t like my nails very long. They grow like crazy with the gel polish. I haven&#x27;t tried other brands but I love Gelish.</li>
            <li> Use it the first time I tried gel on my nails I didn&#x27;t use the ph bond and they chipped within two days u put it on before the foundation it helps the polish stick</li>
            <li> I will never buy regular nail polish again.  Gelish doesnt crack or chip and it looks beautiful and has a glassy shean.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending money at the nail salon every 2 weeks for a manicure with gel polish. So I gave it a try myself and didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to do. I will continue to save $$$ by doing it myself.</li>
            <li> A must have for any Gelish Manicure. I went through the mini bottles so fast I had to get the bigger ones this time.</li>
            <li> I am new to at-home gel manicures and have seen these products in a lot of the YouTube videos I&#x27;ve watched. It is REALLY important to use the foundation and top coat in thin layers. The reason is because these products are self-leveling. The first time I used the foundation, I thought I was applying a thin layer but I used too much and the excess settled in the sidewalls of my nails. I didn&#x27;t realize this had happened until I put on the 2nd color coat (I used Gelish Harmony June Bride). Instructions on the bottles have cure times for both UV and LED lamps, but you might need a magnifying glass to read the labels.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, looks beautiful.  Lasts only 1 week, but my hands are in water a lot. Also, I do not sand my nails very much.</li>
            <li> For this price!!! It is amazing! Just for the price of one of the bottles it is the same cost as all together... this is awesome... and they work great!!</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products.  I&#x27;ve been able to keep a manicure for at least 3 weeks....outgrowth gets bad, but it never chips.  I really like the strength that gel polish gives to my naturally weak nails.  I would recommend this product again and again!</li>
            <li> The PH Bond is a MUST for gel on your nails. The foundation is awesome it you use the dip method with acrylic powder. Its thick and that is what you want.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the lamp and base color.  It is easy to use and the instructions are clear.  Did my own gel manicure in 30 min.  Definitely beats going to the salon, and it will be cheaper in the long run! So glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Helps create the perfect gel manicure with a price less than one visit to the salon. Large sized bottles creates great value.</li>
            <li> better than Calgel, I love them</li>
            <li> This is a great combo for someone starting out or someone who needs a refill - like I did.  All of these items were packaged well and carry the gelish name so you know they are for real!</li>
            <li> Gelish is one of the best with gel nails to buy so i highly recommend this product, I made this decision because it was cheaper to buy as a bundle then separately.</li>
            <li> I loved the products in the smaller size available at Sally&#x27;s, but getting the larger size (for the same price I might add), is double the pleasure.  Same product, just more of it.  I change my polish when I get bored (plus it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than going to the salon), so I use a lot of the base and Top It Off. The larger sizes make good financial sense.</li>
            <li> Unlike my local beauty supply store, these are full size bottles, and the Harmony Gelish brand is of pretty good quality.  I use this brand along with a couple of others, but this is definitely my go-to product for base and top coat, hands down!  It arrived within the ship/delivery window, and package securely.  The bottles were wrapped in bubble-wrap individually and then in a bubble-lined envelope.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would purchase this set again.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time.  there is a bit of a learning curve  ,but I will master it. The key is to not use too much.  Applying it sparingly and keeping it off your nail bed and skin is key.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and came in nicely ! My nails look amazing!</li>
            <li> Great full size bottles! They have worked great so far and is a great value for all three items. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> It works really well with a proper UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;My friends and I have been using the same bottles for months now and they are still fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these bottles for about 3 years and still haven&#x27;t used it up yet when I paint my nails religiously every 3 weeks. I never tried another brand, but very happy with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent seller I recomend a 100%</li>
            <li> I do my gel nail at home! Great product. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Works fine but have never used anything else.</li>
            <li> Only used 2 times and the brushes are splitting so the polish is uneven.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit to get you started. Great products and reasonably priced. The Gelish system works like a dream for me!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase for the price. I am a gelish addict. Shipped fast too. I recommend getting this set.</li>
            <li> the foundation gel seems thick and sticky and i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how its supposed to be but i can work around it.  i can&#x27;t tell how well the bond works but the top coat is shiny.  doesn&#x27;t work better or worse than other brands.  still peels off...</li>
            <li> The PH bond seems to really dry the nail out, eliminating the need to buff the natural nail. The foundation brush is short and I LOVE THIS!! it really allows for control of foundation which is a critical application step. The top off is SUPER SHINY! I also have the CND top coat/base and find that I reach for Gelish more often. And Yes, you can use Gelish with CND.</li>
            <li> Love love this product! Full sized bottles for less than half the price at other places for mini bottles. Its a no brainer, order this product! I have used them once and my nails are strong, shiny, and chip free after 8 days. I think they will last 14 days plus.</li>
            <li> Have ordered before - use on the onset of gel application under and over gel color. Not to be used everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it!  She used to get her nails all chipped up as soon as she painted them, now they stay on there for 1-2 weeks.  This has also made her nails less prone to rip because it strengthens the nail since its a hardened layer.  Follow the instructions and you will get perfect looking nails for much less than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product. I have very thin and brittle nails and now I never have my nails fall apart. I even notice nail growth where before they would always break long before. Shipping was a little slow but still within estimated dates.</li>
            <li> Sorry this review is so long, but I made almost all of my gel polish choices based off of reviews on Amazon so I wanted to be detailed enough to help the next person. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three pack is great for those new to DIY gel nails. I ordered this set together with another Gelish color, my UV light nail dryer and a couple of other gel colors from different brands to do my nails at home for the first time. It arrived within the shipping time estimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PH bond is very thin and evaporates almost instantly after applying. It helps hydrate and clean the nail for the gel base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foundation Base is very thick and comes with a short stubby brush. It goes on smooth. After curing, it&#x27;s very tacky and requires cleaning. Tips: After applying the base, go over the whole nail a few more times with the brush to make sure the coat is thin and even. If I don&#x27;t do that, after curing the polish and cleaning the nail, I find random spots on the nail that don&#x27;t have the base on it. When I find them, I just touch up those spots and cure them again, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the manicure after, but it&#x27;s just easier to prevent it in the first place. Regarding cleaning the nail after curing, the instructions on the bottle call for a \\&quot;dry clean of the surface\\&quot; with a lint free wipe. No matter how hard I tried, I could never get the surface clean with a dry wipe. It would leave smear marks and stay tacky. Rubbing alcohol works perfectly and I haven&#x27;t had an issue from using a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Top It Off has a more standard nail brush and liquid consistency. The liquid is very smooth, almost slick. This coat is also tacky after curing and requires cleaning with rubbing alcohol. No matter how many coats of polish I put it over (I&#x27;ve done up to 6: 1 base coat, 3 coats of color and 2 coats of chunky glitter), I&#x27;ve only needed one coat to make my nails perfectly smooth and shiny. When you rub them together, they even make the clacky noise you get with professionally done gel nails or acrylics. Every time I do the final cleaning, it&#x27;s still hard for me to believe that 7 coats of nail polish dried in less than 2 hours. When you add in how long that manicure is going to last, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve made it to 2 weeks with only a very small chip that was just in the shine, not the actual polish color, so it was almost impossible to notice. My biggest problem is that I get bored with colors on my hands pretty easily. When the nail grows out too much, I just start over, instead of trying to do upkeep so I don&#x27;t know how long I could try to keep the same manicure going. When I get brave enough to try French manicures, I&#x27;ll probably try to extend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process does take time. I didn&#x27;t do regular nail polish manicures that often because of how long they didn&#x27;t last, so I wasn&#x27;t very handy wielding a nail brush, especially with my non-dominant hand. But I&#x27;ve already seen a marked improvement since I started doing gel nails, and the time it takes is going down. So don&#x27;t start this if you don&#x27;t have a chunk of time without interruptions to do it. Also, because your nails are supposed to be a clean, oil free zone, eat before you start. I have a drink with a straw on the table ready to go so I can stay seated once I start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my cuticles directly before starting each hand to make sure I can cover as much nail as possible. I soak my finger tips in warm water for a bit, dry, then push back and trim my cuticles. When applying the gel, you don&#x27;t want any on your skin before you cure it. Having polish on your skin can break the seal on your nail and lift up the polish after a few days. I use a wood stick to clean up the nail edges. I was doing my entire hand at a time when I saw a comment from a nail technician that stated it was easier to do the four fingers and the thumb separately and she was so right. I like to fully complete the four fingers on each hand first so I can use the thumb on either side to pull back skin on other fingers to fully paint the nail or to tidy up an edge I&#x27;m afraid to use the wood stick on, then I do my thumbs separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel polish can shrink, some more than others, so it&#x27;s important to make sure to cap the tip of your nail with each coat so it&#x27;ll fully shrink onto your nail. I start painting my nail doing this step so I can smooth out the edge after. I also come up a little under my nail tip to help solidify the color. You&#x27;re supposed to cap the nail with each coat from base to top coat, but I&#x27;ve found that if you are using a chunky glitter and you cap the tip, after it cures it feels like an uneven nail edge. I learned that on my first hand, so on my other I didn&#x27;t cap it as much, didn&#x27;t go under the nail at all and pushed back any glitter pieces that were on the edge and it turned out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular set again, but only because of the Ph Bond. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, but you can do the same thing with rubbing alcohol (which is the main ingredient in the PH Bond) and you can buy it in a large bottle for a couple bucks. So next time, I&#x27;ll definitely just buy the base and top coat. But the Gelish brand hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. I&#x27;ve also been able to use the Gelish products with IBD and Fingerpaints gel polish with no problem.d first so I can use the thumb on either side to pull back skin on other fingers to fully paint the nail or to tidy up an edge I&#x27;m afraid to use the wood stick on, then I do my thumbs separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel polish can shrink, some more than others, so it&#x27;s important to make sure to cap the tip of your nail with each coat so it&#x27;ll fully shrink onto your nail. I start painting my nail doing this step so I can smooth out the edge after. I also come up a little under my nail tip to help solidify the color. You&#x27;re supposed to cap the nail with each coat from base to top coat, but I&#x27;ve found that if you are using a chunky glitter and you cap the tip, after it cures it feels like an uneven nail edge. I learned that on my first hand, so on my other I didn&#x27;t cap it as much, didn&#x27;t go under the nail at all and pushed back any glitter pieces that were on the edge and it turned out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular set again, but only because of the Ph Bond. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, but you can do the same thing with rubbing alcohol (which is the main ingredient in the PH Bond) and you can buy it in a large bottle for a couple bucks. So next time, I&#x27;ll definitely just buy the base and top coat. But the Gelish brand hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.

            <li> This is a must have for Gelish nails!</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails myself and this is a great product.</li>
            <li> APPLICATION PROCESS&lt;br /&gt;*Just like any nail polish (and acts like a thin layer of fake nail without chipping if properly applied)&lt;br /&gt;*Need a UV light to cure (AKA harden and set) it&lt;br /&gt;*Cures and hardens right away. If there is a sticky layer after curing the top coat layer, just wipe it off with alcohol and it will shine like the high heaven&lt;br /&gt;I prep (push back my cuticles, buff, and file) my nails before applying THIN layers of the PH Bond, base, and top coat. I emphasize applying in thin layers because thick layers will give you a messy, melted-onto-your-cuticles look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO SHOULD BUY THIS?&lt;br /&gt;*People with thin, brittle nails&lt;br /&gt;*People who hate waiting for nails to dry (ME)&lt;br /&gt;*People who are clumsy or have children (ME times a hundred)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it chip on me and I&#x27;ve had used this product for a year. My nails grow out too much with get polish. They never chip with it on. Then again, I take care of my nails. That means filing my nails maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a glossy clear. I get more compliments on clear than every other color since clear is simple, clean, and classy. I love the red, white, and nude gel colors but I seldom use them because I don&#x27;t care for colors and I know that nobody else cares about the color of the tips of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I see too many overweight ladies with dyed and permed hair and overdesigned nails. I hope, one day, these ladies realize how horrifying they look. Please don&#x27;t be one of those ladies.</li>
            <li> a must have if you are going to do the home UV light.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value, great seller!</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, Harmony Gelish Gel Polish is a great Product. I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon. I love the fact that it makes your nails look great for two weeks. Thank You</li>
            <li> The Gelish set is by far superior to any other gel polish in my opinion. This is a great deal for the set of basics that you need</li>
            <li> This is a great product, works perfectly! I could not be happier! The folks at gelish really have a good bead on a simple product, that anyone can use!</li>
            <li> Super products, in salon-sized bottles, packaged perfectly and delivered without a hitch!! I couldn&#x27;t possibly be more pleased with my transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer suggested two coats of the Foundation Base to help strengthen nails. So I&#x27;m going to try that next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wondering... Has anyone tried an additional coat of Top-It-Off after a week or so to re-seal free edges, prolong manicure and help protect nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added comment:  I now use 2 foundation coats.  And after 2 weeks I file my nails down a bit n re-shape them. Then I carefully file/smooth down the edges near the outgrown cuticle; then clean the nail surface with alcohol; apply one thin coat of Top It Off to all nail surfaces n free edges; dry in my LED light for 60 seconds, and clean with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Gelish manicure is shiny again and my edges are re-sealed, prolonging application for a week or two.  Additional benefit includes MY OWN hard, strong n long nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is an off-label use, but it works wonderfully for me.  Gelish is an incredible product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they&#x27;d partner with Essie&#x27;s color team. Hint!!  Hint!!  😊</li>
            <li> These products arrived very fast and they were just what I was looking for at a fraction of the price at local stores! The products work great! I love the gelish system!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great and lasts forever !!!! Last about 4 weeks on hands and almost 8 weeks on your feet !!!!</li>
