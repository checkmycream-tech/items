            <li>I Love my BB!!!</li>
            <li>My lips love this stuff!!!</li>

            <li>After use effect is very good,</li>
            <li>very good</li>
            <li>Great lip balm, great price!  </li>
            <li>This was a great value and the lip balm itself is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>And along with moisturizing your lips, it just feels great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and soothes.</li>
            <li>No petroleum product was included which I am happy about.</li>
            <li>Amazon had a great deal as always on a multipack.</li>
            <li>All in all Burt&#x27;s Bees is a great product that I would recommend.  </li>
            <li>she has great lips, I wonder what she puts on them?\\&quot;   </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>great, as always.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, does a great job</li>
            <li>Now I buy it on Amazon because of the great price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for men or women because it isnt glossy at all.  </li>
            <li>Great for chapped lip any weather</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always seen people use Burt&#x27;s Bees and since the brand has great reviews</li>
            <li>The cooling peppermint feels great, and it stays on w/o being tacky or slimy.  </li>
            <li>It tastes, smells, and feels great on my lips.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think BB hit the happy medium with this one.</li>
            <li>The color is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>then the acai berry which are both great products however</li>
            <li>This lasts great.  </li>
            <li>Also, great price for a 4-pack.</li>
            <li>finding it here on amazon cheaper was great.</li>
            <li>Feels great, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The texture was perfect, and I really liked the smell and</li>
            <li>The lip balm itself is great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for males or females.</li>
            <li>This 4-pack is a very good deal seeing as how most retailers sell them for $2.99-$3.29 each!</li>
            <li>It smells great, tingles pleasantly, and softens your lips.</li>
            <li>The pack of 4 is a great value, and I can pop one in my purse, leave one at my desk, have one in the car, have one at my bedside table, and I&#x27;ll never be without my beloved burts bees</li>
            <li>Love my Burt&#x27;s Bees, and this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>I love this chapstick and think it is the best stuff out there.</li>
            <li>I love Burts Bees, it is the best Chapstick.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant, neutral scent.</li>
            <li>These are peppermint-flavored, and though pleasant, my lips are not as soothed, and they become chapped.</li>
            <li>Happy and satisfied!</li>
            <li>The Chapstick came quick and in great condition, however, this brand does not work best for me.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t wipe your mouth after eating, the color of the food transfers onto the balm (after I ate watermelon the stick turned bright orange)&lt;br</li>
            <li>THATS GOOD</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>None is good.</li>
            <li>In my opinion nothing is quite like it for wind protection and it is a good all around lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Not cheep stuff but good for the lips and good to smell.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>-- it is &#x27;good stuff&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>There is something about that beeswax on your lips that feels so good.</li>
            <li>and the three pack is a really good deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to stock up for the winter.</li>
            <li>good, works well,</li>
            <li>it is good all day</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells good    </li>
            <li>Purchased this product at a good price.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is a good deal.</li>
            <li>The quality is good.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve loved using it.</li>
            <li>You feel good using it.</li>
            <li>Good lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>The taste and texture are superior to ChapStick and Blistex.</li>
            <li>For example, they have grapefruit, honey, and pomegranate, all excellent lip balms, all but the original.</li>
            <li>I like the original flavor the best.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees original is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste - smooth lips without clumping!!</li>
            <li>I was super happy!  </li>
            <li>This lip balm is, in my opinion, the best out there and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So I would say it works great for many people, just not me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing to put on</li>
            <li>very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I love the product!</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm!</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m yet to find a better lip balm!</li>
            <li>and I was so glad that I didn&#x27;t react to it!</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite out there!</li>
            <li>and I love the tingling sensation!</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm!</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is my all-time favorite!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My wife loves this lip balm and this is the best price consistently that we have found.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and healthier to use on lips than products with all kinds of chemicals in it!  </li>
            <li>I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bee Beeswax Lip Balm in Peony and I love it!</li>
            <li>I just LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this chap stick!  </li>
            <li>so refreshing and heals lips immediately!  </li>
            <li>love the peppermint one!  </li>
            <li>and I just love them!</li>
            <li>Pros: applies smoothly, smells good, pleasant peppermint tingle</li>
            <li>quick to deliver and a good price!</li>
            <li>This lip balm is amazing.</li>
            <li>It seriously is so amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees does an amazing job of hydrating my lips and keeping them feeling good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Despite this I still used it habitually because of how soothing and amazing the minty flavor felt.</li>
            <li>I would never leave the house without it, and it was just absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it seemed like a nice brand  for lip balm.</li>
            <li>It tingles on your lips when you apply which is nice.</li>
            <li>The types I have purchased are the mint kind and the clove kind.</li>
            <li>A nice minty smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice peppermint tingly feeling on your lips.</li>
            <li>i will be using this kind.</li>
            <li>Kind of waxy.</li>
            <li>quality ingredients and highly effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of &amp;#34;better mousetrap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey    Bottom line:</li>
            <li>Buying one tube is never cost effective (and I need 1 for my purse, desk, nightstand, purse)</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find a four pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home.</li>
            <li>They keep your lips moisturized and it has that nice mint sensation on your lips too</li>
            <li>This is the classic, which is the best.</li>
            <li>My face greatly enjoys the cool tingle of the bees.</li>
            <li>I think the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm may be a good product for maintaining and protecting healthy lips, but if you have severe dryness and cracking, there are better repairing products out there.</li>
            <li>and I am super happy.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome, natural lip balm.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best all natural lip balm that I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>I find that I don&#x27;t use it as often as the more popular brand as it seems to be a denser covering (Hey?</li>
            <li>By far the best chapstick out there.</li>
            <li>It was by far your best.  </li>
            <li>by far the best lip balm on the market.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and wonderful scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of chapstick, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried the honey kind as well, but I think they original kind works better.</li>
            <li>you really are great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE BURTS BECAUSE IT IS QUALITY...</li>
            <li>IF YOU LOVE STUFF</li>
            <li>:) I will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I threw this away before it was even finished and have seen better results with another product.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is simply the best!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my lips and the peppermint is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the minty smell and the tingly feeling you get when you use it.</li>
            <li>Simply put, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm out there.</li>
            <li>and I cannot express how much I love it.</li>
            <li>The minty taste is lovely, I understand this can be an annoyance to some people</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lip sticks to make my lip mosturized.</li>
            <li>Read more at [...]</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Store it appropriately, since it comes with so many.</li>
            <li>The mintiness is refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li>The texture is thicker and pastier feeling than most of its competitors.  </li>
            <li>For wind protection I feel that you can&#x27;t do much better than Burt&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>, your lips feel refreshed, you can even feel them tingle as the product does its magic.  </li>
            <li>I love having lip balm on my lips before I go to sleep and</li>
            <li>I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff.</li>
            <li>Bees Wax is better?</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is so MUCH better than chapstick.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees should send me some free stuff because I help them promote it for them!</li>
            <li>It works with you to help your whole body work together (who would be happy at all with chapped lips?).   </li>
            <li>I really love this chapstick.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and smooth and I love the tingling you get from the peppermint</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years on and off because I love the peppermint</li>
            <li>this is my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I know it is a safe product.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s turned me into one of those compulsive chapstick people, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>and I all love Burts Bees.  </li>
            <li>If you apply some Burt&#x27;s Bees then touch your lips, you better not inadvertently rub your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lipbalms.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re lovely, but they&#x27;re not Burts.</li>
            <li>I love Burts.</li>
            <li>The tingly sensation has gone away at times, but I am still in love.</li>
            <li>so you have to use more?</li>
            <li>It is a #7 plastic, which most communities do not recycle.</li>
            <li>So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say that this is the best place on the net I have found to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Love it, the consistency and the mint, also it works so well for me.</li>
            <li>I chose this item because it is my husbands favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see why someone would buy one of the popular petroleum based sticks over this, beeswax and peppermint oil sound a lot better to me.</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love burts bees.</li>
            <li>Best and longest lasting lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an add-on item for sure.</li>
            <li>I personally love this lip balm and give it to my daughter every year as a gift.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips moisturized, but within an hour they feel much more chapped than before.</li>
            <li>I love the beeswax lip balm, it works better than any lip balm I have used.  </li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>Bought more today for a gift.</li>
            <li>Amazons under $10 for 4 is better than Walmart by a couple bucks</li>
            <li>Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>what more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lips would be more chapped after application in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>So refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is also what turned me to try more Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li>It love my lips.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>This is one of my &amp;#34;deserted on an island&amp;#34; products that I would need to have with me :)</li>
            <li>While I love burts bees and all of its minty glory, the picture for the product is deceiving.  </li>
            <li>So ... for now, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Probably will order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Again, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Shea butter works better</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Whats not to love?</li>
            <li>I love the peppermint flavor since it&#x27;s noticeable, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The tingle you get from it on your lips is refreshing, as it cools your lips as well.</li>
            <li>I love this Mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Love me some Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>I have since switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees because it has a more refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>They offer so many verities of lip balm.</li>
            <li>products the lip balm being my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon when I&#x27;m running low is perfectly convenient.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>not until we started to go towards the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; path did we stop and thought about safe lip balms.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to buy it in bulk on amazon.</li>
            <li>It took time more than I thought.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for Christmas last year and is really great!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite chapstick.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better for you.</li>
            <li>I love all products by Burt&#x27;s Bees and the lip balm is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>and now I buy many at a time.</li>
            <li>have them in many convenient places.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love peppermint.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>will buy again this works grand.</li>
            <li>I love these lip balms.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s bees is great for fair skinned people looking for natural and accessible chap sticks.</li>
            <li>I loved it right away.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm but in ever kind except the original.</li>
            <li>The original is kind of medicine/minty.</li>
            <li>A bit of a tingle, great smell, and no negative reaction from my lips.</li>
            <li>(although that stuff&#x27;s wonderful too, I don&#x27;t want to perpetually smell of menthol, y&#x27;know?)</li>
            <li>love that cool felling on my lips!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of really strong mint flabors, but I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>19 tubes out of 20 are fine, but every once in a while you come across one so potent and pungent that the fumes will make your eyes water and people will smell it from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not tinted and that I can use it without looking gay.</li>
            <li>The chance that this product is as amazing for you as it is for me is worth the risk.</li>
            <li>The chance that this product is as amazing for you as it is for me is worth the risk.</li>
            <li>and I find Burt&#x27;s Bees to not only be the best tasting and smelling, but also the most useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried EOS (love the Sweet Mint), SoftLips, and more.</li>
            <li>Great smell, protects lips and is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>our favorite is this original balm.  </li>
            <li>Easy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I need to pitch this to anyone as most of us have heard of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I still can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is.</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t melt in texas heat quite as easily, but that seems unavoidable given the contents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure it felt pretty good at first</li>
            <li>I love the mint that is in it that leaves your lips feeling cool and refreshed after every application.</li>
            <li>Is there anything more glorious that the sweet tingle of Burt&#x27;s upon your lips?  </li>
            <li>for the fragrances, I love the original, my husband loves the clove, and the kids use whatever is available.  </li>
            <li>It has a cool, refreshing peppermint-ish kick that cools your lips and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>This is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>The best, hands down.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST lip balm available.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips super soft and tastes great.</li>
            <li>We were huge fans even before it went mainstream and hit places like Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it couple of times and noticed a huge difference in a way my lips feel.</li>
            <li>Why they come in the HUGE cardboard tube (wasteful) and then have no information on the tube is beyond me.</li>
            <li>This product is compact and smooth.</li>
            <li>Minty and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves lips smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Every time you use it you get a minty, tingly feeling on your lips that feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>However, I will continue to use and enjoy this lip balm because there is nothing that compares.</li>
            <li>have cautioned against using too much chapstick and stopping your lips from creating their own balm...blahblahblah.</li>
            <li>This balm is hydrating and smoothly applied.</li>
            <li>So when I found it this cheap on Amazon</li>
            <li>Everybody knows how awesome this product is, so I won&#x27;t waste my time describing it.  </li>
            <li>With the honey, all the chapped areas heal and stay smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light and smells divine, if you like peppermint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and came in a nice package.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>cheap if bought in bulk</li>
            <li>The four pack was perfect because it is much cheaper than buying them individually.</li>
            <li>good knowing that it&#x27;s natural, not petroleum.</li>
            <li>It feels great on the lips and stays on longer than most other brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other types of burts bees lip balm, they&#x27;re ok but the peppermint one is GREAT.</li>
            <li>My new favorite flavor is Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Rejuvenating&#x27; lip balm with Acai Berry. :-)</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not giving up, and will continue to apply this very natural product, knowing that it probably better for her health than the others!</li>
            <li>Your lips are worth it!</li>
            <li>, the original takes the cake.</li>
            <li>This is the original burts bees wax lip balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff that lasts a long time with no funky ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon offers this fine product!</li>
            <li>Works great in the colder winter months to keep your lips from getting dry.</li>
            <li>Was having a big problem with the most popular brand and decided I needed a change.</li>
            <li>It is oily enough to feel smooth and good, not waxy like some chapstick prodcuts.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip balm I have found, and I am never going back to anything else.</li>
            <li>Clean and tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>The stuff has gotten me back to feeling better than normal, and smells great to boot.</li>
            <li>Plus on amazon the price is right!</li>
            <li>The clove is super strong, but hey, its fun for a change.     </li>
            <li>This works great for chapped lips and doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly.</li>
            <li>This seemed to dry out my lips; my lips peeled a lot more when I used this, and I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms!</li>
            <li>The beeswax and vitamin E do a good job substituting for petroleum jelly used in traditional lip balms, which I don&#x27;t want on my lips.</li>
            <li>Also, the tingly feeling with this lib balm is cool.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips even more chapped  and peels very often.</li>
            <li>True or not, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>This stays on much longer and applies better.</li>
            <li>This lip balm protects well and leaves a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>Every winter when my skin starts to crack I buy ONE tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm a year, and it heals the cracked skin instantly, feels waxy (but in a good way), has no smell, and stays put.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s for over 10 years and it is just hands down the absolute best lip balm!  </li>
            <li>While this is a bit more than your normal brands, it is worth it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the original beeswax is supposed to give a fresh feeling like peppermint or</li>
            <li>I have tried a ridiculous amount of lip balms and this one might be the best of the lot.</li>
            <li>It makes my lip more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite day to day lip balm, and it is slightly different than most.  </li>
            <li>However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for $10.83.</li>
            <li>However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for $10.83.</li>
            <li>It feels good and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel more chapped after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>This works every time, and heals your lips really quick.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my lips are healing quickly.</li>
            <li>It heals lip quick.</li>
            <li>Very much like this peppermint scented lip balm!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lip balms and I&#x27;ve yet to find one as effective and pleasing to use as the classic Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.</li>
            <li>Fast, Easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the other flavors, and while they&#x27;re generally good, nothing beats the original.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy, I highly recommend c.o. bigelow lip balms!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>A lovely tingly feeling upon application, full coverage that lasts, a pleasant lack of strong odor or flavor (I hate strong smelling or tasting chapsticks, a lovely (and distinctive) yellow tube that is easy to find in any purse, consistently a good product, survives hours or days in my car in the heat without leaking or becoming absolute goop (just pop it into the freezer for a bit before using it if necessary</li>
            <li>I use Carmex now which is great and includes SPF so I can wear year round.</li>
            <li>and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Because the product is so hard/dense, I find I have to forcibly drag it across my lips in order to get a good coating.  </li>
            <li>While the cooling mentholated effect is nice, it&#x27;s not enough to make up for the lack of moisturizing benefits.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>price is definitey worth it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft and wears well under most lip glosses.</li>
            <li>That fact that it is all natural makes it all the better.</li>
            <li>While I have met others that find this balm to leave a burning sensation, I find the balm to be fresh and cooling.  </li>
            <li>this is buy far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It is by far the most soothing lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I own 15 different types of lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I used to use carmex exclusively, but when I learned the nastiness of petrolatum products, I tried so many natural lip balms</li>
            <li>it works as good as i expected.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lip balm/chapstick.</li>
            <li>The number one thing for me is that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients and the hint of mint is outstanding</li>
            <li>gets kind of gross after a while</li>
            <li>AMAZON was nice enough to reimburse me $5.00 on my order so it was made right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s different at first, but you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It happily feels like it connects the layers of skin on my lips to each other into a unified whole.</li>
            <li>It is unique in that it does not just sit on your lips like most lip balms it actually penetrates and heals.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, only the original though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that Burt&#x27;s Bees is superior to all of the other brands.</li>
            <li>although it costs twice as much as I can get Chap Stick for, it is worth it!  </li>
            <li>She recommended that I apply a quality product right after the shower to seal in the moisture.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint taste and the consistency are just right.</li>
            <li>And she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I used this product all day and use it right before bed, every night.  </li>
            <li>This particular balm has a light peppermint flavor added, and thankfully not a lot.  </li>
            <li>It quickly became our favorite, and now, it&#x27;s the ONLY  lip balm we purchase.  </li>
            <li>Many lip balms tend to be greasy and oily, and only form a greasy film that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips shiny, full, and really really healthy-looking.     </li>
            <li>It should have been more apparent.</li>
            <li>It really soothes my cracked lips and I like the cool, tingling sensation very much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel nice and smooth when I put it on and wore off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how INTENSELY strong the smells are.</li>
            <li>Young children might find the smells too strong in a chapstick of the kinds that I have tried yet.     </li>
            <li>but it might be too strong for those who have sensitive skin or are probe to irritation.</li>
            <li>The wife uses lip balm at night, and decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees because of the natural ingredients used (bees wax, lanolin, various vegetable and fruit oils, and etc.), and their good reputation.  </li>
            <li>They probably want us to use up the chapstick as fast as possible with some kind of skin drying</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>keeps me coming back for more.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different lip balms, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>The first one I opened is still in use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>And we are avid outdoors people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm five or six years ago and was hooked.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve tried other balms, none has been able to the original peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees balm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date.</li>
            <li>First picked it up at Cracker Barrel.</li>
            <li>It sucked the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li>But living at altitude over 10,000 ft in Colorado this winter, relative humidity hovering around zero, my lips have never been more chapped.</li>
            <li>One caveat; don&#x27;t leave it in a hot car all day...</li>
            <li>The price here is ok, about the same as I get in the store.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the only one I use that does not irritate my lips.</li>
            <li>When this first came out, it was a must have accessory at the time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to try this lip balm for the first time, no need to worry about taking a risk...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff can&#x27;t keep enough in stock for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try!!</li>
            <li>Used to have pretty chopped lips</li>
            <li>First time I tried it,I immediately noticed the tingly/minty feel of it when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s bees has something, I don&#x27;t know what it is, but something that, like, absorbs into your lips and do exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>but this one is the only one I truly love.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms in many different flavors, with one of my favorites being the Mango Butter - that is, until now.</li>
            <li>I can put it on before bed and wake up with ultra soft, smooth lips.</li>
            <li>For freshest results, you&#x27;ll need to find a more recent manufacturing date.</li>
            <li>The price is terrific and with free shipping too!</li>
            <li>I use this lip balm all the time and it really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I moved onto Nivea Milk &amp; Honey and the difference was like when I had first used Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li>we love burts bee, especially the chapstick.</li>
            <li>After find this good deal here it I made my mind up and bought a few sets.</li>
            <li>Thanks to me, right now all of my family member use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and even though I&#x27;ve liked some other brands, nothing matches Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other kind of chap stick EVAR.</li>
            <li>It gives me lips a slight tingle, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews and the Burt&#x27;s Bees reputation, I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>Positively addicting.</li>
            <li>This did pretty much nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Each tube lasts about twice as long as chap-stick and does a much better job moisturizing and protecting.</li>
            <li>I found that my lips dried out more and had to reapply more frequently.</li>
            <li>However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date.</li>
            <li>The old adage does, and always will hold true...</li>
            <li>My lips got even more dry and started to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like when my lips were dry and the skin was coming off, it just kept coming off more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get them mixed up.</li>
            <li>We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry.</li>
            <li>keep several tubes at my house and some at my work, as my lips seem to chap easily.</li>
            <li>I apply this lip balm, it makes my lips much more dry.</li>
            <li>This is a good lip balm: protective and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Has almost a minty scent to it and provides good long lasting coverage on my lips.</li>
            <li>It is really good for dry cracked winter lips within the next day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too oily and thin feeling on the lips and has a nice strong peppermint tingle.</li>
            <li>but it was in the fine print on the on the back amidst the ingredient</li>
            <li>I work in a very dry environment, so I need something to keep my lips from chapping, but most products out there are female-oriented.  </li>
            <li>It fixes my amazingly chapped lips, even in harsh weather.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE Burt&#x27;s Bees fan, but this balm is one of my least favorite in their line.</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend, who&#x27;s very frugal, bought this even though he could buy cheap 50 cents generic balm, because he likes it that much.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I always put these in my kid&#x27;s stocking at Christmas and really was expecting the package.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and you definitely feel like you are adding a layer of protection.  </li>
            <li>You can never have too much of it either.</li>
            <li>THAT much</li>
            <li>and it was appreciated by all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>but she really like the way it protects e her lips from the elements here in south Texas.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really come as a pack of 4</li>
            <li>I really like the minty flavor of this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>but once i starte dusing it, my lips have become so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Really like this minty lip balm.</li>
            <li>Can never use too much</li>
            <li>This lip balm really does the job.</li>
            <li>It rubs and dries well without too much of a shine.</li>
            <li>and we go through it so fast so</li>
            <li>thanks for making it affordable@.</li>
            <li>and I have used it before)to see if the peppermint oil is really the cause, or if it is just a preexisting skin condition</li>
            <li>Even if my lips create their own moisture, they&#x27;ll still have a lag time between harsh changes in climate.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell and find that it actually helps clear my sinuses (I often have sinusitis)</li>
            <li>She has used a lot of the other popular brands that are made with other ingredients (petroleum gel, chemicals, and etc.), and been fine with them.  </li>
            <li>So much better than other high priced lipsticks!</li>
            <li>The extra cost is well worth it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other chapsticks over the years.</li>
            <li>Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper.</li>
            <li>She is still getting used to the properties of the product, as the other brands are more slick/slippery on the lips.  </li>
            <li>I tried them all and then decided to shell out an extra 50 cents to try Burt&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve come back to the original</li>
            <li>i have used many other products before i setteled with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Prefer the basic original.</li>
            <li>I think it keeps the lips moisturized better than other Burt&#x27;s Bees, too.</li>
            <li>This classic flavor is superior to the other Burt&#x27;s Bees flavors (pomegranate) in my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is far superior to any other lip balm!!!</li>
            <li>This Lip Balm last long and has a nice tingling sensation when you apply it.</li>
            <li>wonderful tingling feel and eliminates the dry chapped feel very well while this one seems to stay on the longest without feeling coated nor too thin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put these on I could feel them work on my lips, and visually they improved right away!</li>
            <li>Because of the amazing ingredients and results, this small tube lasts me months.  </li>
            <li>The product is fantastic but with as long as the shipping took to get here</li>
            <li>Keeps her lips from cracking in the winter  but makes her lips feel so smooth she uses it all year long.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a minty flavor and fragrance, that stays with you long after you have put on the lip balm, you will like this.</li>
            <li>Smell and the cool burn you get once put this on a lip is such an addiciton.</li>
            <li>I had to go back to regular chapstick, which gets the job done for the most part.    </li>
            <li>Using anything else makes my lips break out in hives, which is super gross.</li>
            <li>Did you know that most commercial lip balms actually CHAP your lips</li>
            <li>Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year.</li>
            <li>I threw away all my balms containing sunscreen and bought a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Classic to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my lips are back to being soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than chapstick or blistex, but it&#x27;s SO MUCH BETTER.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty flavor is by far my favorite part about this particular lip balm and none other on the market are quite like it.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lip balm if you haven&#x27;t tried it before--</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees solves this issue and it is always high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried this product before then I highly encourage you to do so.  </li>
            <li>I on the other hand will gladly pay the $3 for something that leaves my lips feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Only chapstick I like other than the mint flavored EOS kind.</li>
            <li>Far better than any other lip balm I have used.</li>
            <li>still is far better than other chapsticks.</li>
            <li>cost a little more because of the shipping</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very moisturizing with natural oils &amp; beeswax, plus it is non-toxic, with no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>My husband is obsessed with burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s lip balm, so this was a great stocking stuffer for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use to go through a tube of normal chapstick once a week.  </li>
            <li>I can even go a few days to a week without it before I need to run out and grab more.</li>
            <li>But that may be normal Chapstick because I normally don&#x27;t wear any.</li>
            <li>As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips.</li>
            <li>I had been using Original Carmex for 10 years before trying Burt Bees - and there really is no comparison.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lip balm to try something new.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without one</li>
            <li>but me nephew can’t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>my daughter couldn&#x27;t live without her burt&#x27;s bees lip balm.</li>
            <li>I have really chapped lips and this did absolutely nothing for my overall lip health.</li>
            <li>If I use a different kind for some reason, I find myself missing and longing for the peppermint in Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Now I am pregnant again and having dry lips</li>
            <li>All the other flavored Burt&#x27;s Bees chap-sticks are new and do NOT work as well as this original.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the salt air has a tendency to dehydrate your skin fast.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective enough to make me find it before heading out the door into the cold, but I think it&#x27;s more protective than healing.</li>
            <li>Cheapest by far!  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh smelling, and it keeps my lips moist for a long time.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips so soft!</li>
            <li>In fact, this is a first lip balm I ever tried, and I ain&#x27;t going back.</li>
            <li>I usually use the nourishing (orange top), but my husband loves mint.</li>
            <li>it is an all natural balm which is important bc only natural ones actually moisturize the lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other variations of their lip balm such as the lifeguard and pomegranate variety but just didn&#x27;t enjoy them as much.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>As long as Burt&#x27;s is available to me, I will ONLY be using Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t however, like any other of their varieties because they don&#x27;t refresh your lips anywhere near as well as the original formula does.</li>
            <li>I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
            <li>I live in Ithaca where it can get brutally cold and the beeswax in the product is great for keeping the moisture in your lips.     </li>
            <li>I will say, my love for Burt&#x27;s Bees declined slightly after watching Burt&#x27;s Buzz documentary.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is truly effective in protecting your lips in harsh weather - summer or winter; and it works well in healing dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use, but slightly prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing (Pomegranate) Lip Balm at night.</li>
            <li>apparently peppermint oil in Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Classic&#x27; formula.</li>
            <li>It leaves my lips feeling good and lasts quite a while compared to other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The value in this product is enough for me to pay a little more.</li>
            <li>I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company</li>
            <li>I go through chapstick like crazy and this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>These are so expensive in the store, but buying them bulk here was a great way to still get quality but at a lesser price.</li>
            <li>ITS ALL NATURAL</li>
            <li>This animal will not rip your lips off if they are sensitive.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips soft and is all natural.</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed are all natural products.</li>
            <li>I switched to Blistex Complete Moisture, and my lip problems began healing overnight and were completely repaired within 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>This product is NOT all natural.  </li>
            <li>On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li>On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li>As far as Burt&#x27;s Bees is concerned as a product my wife loves it and buys the stuff all the time.  </li>
            <li>They are no longer truly natural.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much because I&#x27;ve only used them twice</li>
            <li>One of our adult children uses this all the time and requested it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I am sensitive.</li>
            <li>Keeps your mouth soft and healtihy...</li>
            <li>All natural, too.</li>
            <li>the chap stick itself was lumpy, i wont order again, i feel like im getting old or damaged goods</li>
            <li>As far as the chapstick goes though, 5/5.  </li>
            <li>Leaves lips soft and moisturized  </li>
            <li>I do like the natural ingredients and &amp;#34;eucalyptus tingle&amp;#34; that this provides.</li>
            <li>It just drags across your lips and you really have to force it across your lips and mash them together several times to even feel like they&#x27;re covered/lubricated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to apply the honey as frequently, either.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The peppermint lip balm goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, gunky or sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips soft and tingle with the Peppermint.</li>
            <li>Keeps your lips soft.</li>
            <li>ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural.</li>
            <li>I keep one in each car, one in the TV room, and one near my bed</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised people aren&#x27;t complaining about it.</li>
            <li>Both my girlfriend and I use this Burt&#x27;s Bees frequently.</li>
            <li>I like the Burt&#x27;s bee product because they are natural.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is a nice addition for the smell and the added tingle sensation, but is completely unnecessary for me.</li>
            <li>My lips get pretty dry in the winter, but Burt&#x27;s Bees has been a life saver.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li>The honey lip balm cap is just a few shades off from the original lip balm.</li>
            <li>Their scents and tastes can be a little too strong and often taste like they&#x27;re laden with chemicals, the opposite of Burt&#x27;s Bees \\&quot;green\\&quot; or natural approach to their products.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s bees is a classic choice for simple people looking for a quality product.</li>
            <li>This one has peppermint oil and makes a decent second choice.  </li>
            <li>I really have to press down hard and force it on slowly, several times, which I&#x27;m sure just wastes product, in order to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li>I recently bought Carmex&#x27;s new Moisture Plus clear lip balm</li>
            <li>It goes on with a slight minty tingle and then gets absorbed keeping my lips soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>It was the only thing that cleared my lips up and made them look normal again.  </li>
            <li>I tried lots of different chap sticks and nothing would last more that a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>after using a menthol based chapstick for a couple years, i ordered a pack of these and after a couple days of use my lips were back to normal.</li>
            <li>The peppermint provides a cool sensation that lasts for a few minutes and is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>The only regret that you will have after using this will be your new addiction to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I really suffered from dry lips.</li>
            <li>I pop on some of the sunscreen lip balm from Bert&#x27;s Bees and then apply this over it and am ready to go, my lips don&#x27;t get dry or chapped like they used too.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the sticks are sealed, so its not really a huge concern.</li>
            <li>No other lip balm compares.</li>
            <li>No other product comes close.</li>
            <li>There is no other chap stick out there that comes close.</li>
            <li>You may not know this, but other lip balm coats your lips, but that coating actually makes your lips more dry because it doesn&#x27;t allow moisture back in.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a really long time, and I enjoy the slight peppermint kick it has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive that the regular brands which you can find in any gas station or corner grocery store but is worth the extra coin.</li>
            <li>I had never spent over $1 on any chapstick</li>
            <li>I finally tried Burt&#x27;s Bees after reading on the website how it was all natural.</li>
            <li>No bitter taste.</li>
            <li>My mom introduced this to me 6 years ago when I was pregnant and stuck in the hospital for a couple weeks due to preterm labor issues, and the dry hospital air made my lips so chapped.</li>
            <li>My lips have been incredibly dry recently, and I was hoping to find a lip balm that worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is definitely more expensive than other brands of lip balm, but I find it to be worth it.</li>
            <li>Much prefer it over other brands.</li>
            <li>If I leave the house and forget &amp;#34;my Burts Bees,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the first thing I notice; it ruins my day; and I pout until I get back to a tube of it.</li>
            <li>I switched from a major brand to Burt&#x27;s Bees over 10 years ago and have never looked back.  </li>
            <li>prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands.</li>
            <li>Sure, the others suffice when necessary, but despite the admittedly expensive (for a chapstick) cost of Burts Bees, I simply cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in the southwest in a dry climate and my lips constantly peeled with chapstick.</li>
            <li>I used Blistex (the cream, the roll-on and the standard lip balm) and regular, old Chapstick (all different kinds of standard lip balm)</li>
            <li>The item came right on time and it had four tubes in a small plastic bag.</li>
            <li>so I never have to go far to find relief when my lips are dry.</li>
            <li>The only socially acceptable addiction is Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>When I reached the point of being unable to smile, something had to be done - so I bought my first thing of lip balm, ever.</li>
            <li>The menthol instantly sooths my dry lips while the beeswax and oils leave my lips feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I get the same good results from less expensive products, so there you are.</li>
            <li>This one has worked the best, at least for me, in regards to the cold dry weather that we tend to deal with, especially the wind!</li>

            <li> Best chapstick out there!</li>
            <li> The best lip balm for men or women.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 15 years and it works great!</li>
            <li> I Love my BB!!!</li>
            <li> My lips love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I find it very good for winter use and prolonged wind exposure.    </li>
            <li> After use effect is very good,</li>
            <li> very good</li>
            <li> Great lip balm, great price!  </li>
            <li> This was a great value and the lip balm itself is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> And along with moisturizing your lips, it just feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and soothes.</li>
            <li> No petroleum product was included which I am happy about.</li>
            <li> Amazon had a great deal as always on a multipack.</li>
            <li> All in all Burt&#x27;s Bees is a great product that I would recommend.  </li>
            <li> she has great lips, I wonder what she puts on them?\\&quot;   </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> great, as always.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, does a great job</li>
            <li> Now I buy it on Amazon because of the great price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for men or women because it isnt glossy at all.  </li>
            <li> Great for chapped lip any weather</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen people use Burt&#x27;s Bees and since the brand has great reviews</li>
            <li> The cooling peppermint feels great, and it stays on w/o being tacky or slimy.  </li>
            <li> It tastes, smells, and feels great on my lips.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think BB hit the happy medium with this one.</li>
            <li> The color is great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> then the acai berry which are both great products however</li>
            <li> This lasts great.  </li>
            <li> Also, great price for a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> finding it here on amazon cheaper was great.</li>
            <li> Feels great, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The texture was perfect, and I really liked the smell and</li>
            <li> The lip balm itself is great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great for males or females.</li>
            <li> This 4-pack is a very good deal seeing as how most retailers sell them for $2.99-$3.29 each!</li>
            <li> It smells great, tingles pleasantly, and softens your lips.</li>
            <li> The pack of 4 is a great value, and I can pop one in my purse, leave one at my desk, have one in the car, have one at my bedside table, and I&#x27;ll never be without my beloved burts bees</li>
            <li> Love my Burt&#x27;s Bees, and this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love this chapstick and think it is the best stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees, it is the best Chapstick.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant, neutral scent.</li>
            <li> These are peppermint-flavored, and though pleasant, my lips are not as soothed, and they become chapped.</li>
            <li> Happy and satisfied!</li>
            <li> The Chapstick came quick and in great condition, however, this brand does not work best for me.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t wipe your mouth after eating, the color of the food transfers onto the balm (after I ate watermelon the stick turned bright orange)&lt;br</li>
            <li> THATS GOOD</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> None is good.</li>
            <li> In my opinion nothing is quite like it for wind protection and it is a good all around lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Not cheep stuff but good for the lips and good to smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> -- it is &#x27;good stuff&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> There is something about that beeswax on your lips that feels so good.</li>
            <li> and the three pack is a really good deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to stock up for the winter.</li>
            <li> good, works well,</li>
            <li> it is good all day</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always loved it.</li>
            <li> Smells good    </li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a good price.</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is a good deal.</li>
            <li> The quality is good.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve loved using it.</li>
            <li> You feel good using it.</li>
            <li> Good lip balm.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> The taste and texture are superior to ChapStick and Blistex.</li>
            <li> For example, they have grapefruit, honey, and pomegranate, all excellent lip balms, all but the original.</li>
            <li> I like the original flavor the best.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees original is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste - smooth lips without clumping!!</li>
            <li> I was super happy!  </li>
            <li> This lip balm is, in my opinion, the best out there and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> So I would say it works great for many people, just not me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing to put on</li>
            <li> very pleased.</li>
            <li> and I love the product!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m yet to find a better lip balm!</li>
            <li> and I was so glad that I didn&#x27;t react to it!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite out there!</li>
            <li> and I love the tingling sensation!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is my all-time favorite!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lip balm and this is the best price consistently that we have found.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and healthier to use on lips than products with all kinds of chemicals in it!  </li>
            <li> I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bee Beeswax Lip Balm in Peony and I love it!</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this chap stick!  </li>
            <li> so refreshing and heals lips immediately!  </li>
            <li> love the peppermint one!  </li>
            <li> and I just love them!</li>
            <li> Pros: applies smoothly, smells good, pleasant peppermint tingle</li>
            <li> quick to deliver and a good price!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing.</li>
            <li> It seriously is so amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees does an amazing job of hydrating my lips and keeping them feeling good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Despite this I still used it habitually because of how soothing and amazing the minty flavor felt.</li>
            <li> I would never leave the house without it, and it was just absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed like a nice brand  for lip balm.</li>
            <li> It tingles on your lips when you apply which is nice.</li>
            <li> The types I have purchased are the mint kind and the clove kind.</li>
            <li> A nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice peppermint tingly feeling on your lips.</li>
            <li> i will be using this kind.</li>
            <li> Kind of waxy.</li>
            <li> quality ingredients and highly effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of &amp;#34;better mousetrap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey    Bottom line:</li>
            <li> Buying one tube is never cost effective (and I need 1 for my purse, desk, nightstand, purse)</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a four pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home.</li>
            <li> They keep your lips moisturized and it has that nice mint sensation on your lips too</li>
            <li> This is the classic, which is the best.</li>
            <li> My face greatly enjoys the cool tingle of the bees.</li>
            <li> I think the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm may be a good product for maintaining and protecting healthy lips, but if you have severe dryness and cracking, there are better repairing products out there.</li>
            <li> and I am super happy.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome, natural lip balm.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best all natural lip balm that I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t use it as often as the more popular brand as it seems to be a denser covering (Hey?</li>
            <li> By far the best chapstick out there.</li>
            <li> It was by far your best.  </li>
            <li> by far the best lip balm on the market.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and wonderful scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of chapstick, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried the honey kind as well, but I think they original kind works better.</li>
            <li> you really are great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE BURTS BECAUSE IT IS QUALITY...</li>
            <li> IF YOU LOVE STUFF</li>
            <li> :) I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I threw this away before it was even finished and have seen better results with another product.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is simply the best!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my lips and the peppermint is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and the tingly feeling you get when you use it.</li>
            <li> Simply put, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> and I cannot express how much I love it.</li>
            <li> The minty taste is lovely, I understand this can be an annoyance to some people</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lip sticks to make my lip mosturized.</li>
            <li> Read more at [...]</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Store it appropriately, since it comes with so many.</li>
            <li> The mintiness is refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li> The texture is thicker and pastier feeling than most of its competitors.  </li>
            <li> For wind protection I feel that you can&#x27;t do much better than Burt&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> , your lips feel refreshed, you can even feel them tingle as the product does its magic.  </li>
            <li> I love having lip balm on my lips before I go to sleep and</li>
            <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff.</li>
            <li> Bees Wax is better?</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is so MUCH better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees should send me some free stuff because I help them promote it for them!</li>
            <li> It works with you to help your whole body work together (who would be happy at all with chapped lips?).   </li>
            <li> I really love this chapstick.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and smooth and I love the tingling you get from the peppermint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on and off because I love the peppermint</li>
            <li> this is my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> I know it is a safe product.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s turned me into one of those compulsive chapstick people, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> and I all love Burts Bees.  </li>
            <li> If you apply some Burt&#x27;s Bees then touch your lips, you better not inadvertently rub your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lipbalms.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re lovely, but they&#x27;re not Burts.</li>
            <li> I love Burts.</li>
            <li> The tingly sensation has gone away at times, but I am still in love.</li>
            <li> so you have to use more?</li>
            <li> It is a #7 plastic, which most communities do not recycle.</li>
            <li> So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that this is the best place on the net I have found to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> I used to love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Love it, the consistency and the mint, also it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because it is my husbands favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why someone would buy one of the popular petroleum based sticks over this, beeswax and peppermint oil sound a lot better to me.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love burts bees.</li>
            <li> Best and longest lasting lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an add-on item for sure.</li>
            <li> I personally love this lip balm and give it to my daughter every year as a gift.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips moisturized, but within an hour they feel much more chapped than before.</li>
            <li> I love the beeswax lip balm, it works better than any lip balm I have used.  </li>
            <li> Ok product.</li>
            <li> Bought more today for a gift.</li>
            <li> Amazons under $10 for 4 is better than Walmart by a couple bucks</li>
            <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> what more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips would be more chapped after application in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> So refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is also what turned me to try more Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li> It love my lips.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is one of my &amp;#34;deserted on an island&amp;#34; products that I would need to have with me :)</li>
            <li> While I love burts bees and all of its minty glory, the picture for the product is deceiving.  </li>
            <li> So ... for now, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Probably will order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Again, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Shea butter works better</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love?</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint flavor since it&#x27;s noticeable, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The tingle you get from it on your lips is refreshing, as it cools your lips as well.</li>
            <li> I love this Mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Love me some Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> I have since switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees because it has a more refreshing feel.</li>
            <li> They offer so many verities of lip balm.</li>
            <li> products the lip balm being my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon when I&#x27;m running low is perfectly convenient.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> not until we started to go towards the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; path did we stop and thought about safe lip balms.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to buy it in bulk on amazon.</li>
            <li> It took time more than I thought.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas last year and is really great!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite chapstick.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better for you.</li>
            <li> I love all products by Burt&#x27;s Bees and the lip balm is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> and now I buy many at a time.</li>
            <li> have them in many convenient places.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love peppermint.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> will buy again this works grand.</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees is great for fair skinned people looking for natural and accessible chap sticks.</li>
            <li> I loved it right away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm but in ever kind except the original.</li>
            <li> The original is kind of medicine/minty.</li>
            <li> A bit of a tingle, great smell, and no negative reaction from my lips.</li>
            <li> (although that stuff&#x27;s wonderful too, I don&#x27;t want to perpetually smell of menthol, y&#x27;know?)</li>
            <li> love that cool felling on my lips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of really strong mint flabors, but I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> 19 tubes out of 20 are fine, but every once in a while you come across one so potent and pungent that the fumes will make your eyes water and people will smell it from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not tinted and that I can use it without looking gay.</li>
            <li> The chance that this product is as amazing for you as it is for me is worth the risk.</li>
            <li> The chance that this product is as amazing for you as it is for me is worth the risk.</li>
            <li> and I find Burt&#x27;s Bees to not only be the best tasting and smelling, but also the most useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EOS (love the Sweet Mint), SoftLips, and more.</li>
            <li> Great smell, protects lips and is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> our favorite is this original balm.  </li>
            <li> Easy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I need to pitch this to anyone as most of us have heard of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I still can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t melt in texas heat quite as easily, but that seems unavoidable given the contents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure it felt pretty good at first</li>
            <li> I love the mint that is in it that leaves your lips feeling cool and refreshed after every application.</li>
            <li> Is there anything more glorious that the sweet tingle of Burt&#x27;s upon your lips?  </li>
            <li> for the fragrances, I love the original, my husband loves the clove, and the kids use whatever is available.  </li>
            <li> It has a cool, refreshing peppermint-ish kick that cools your lips and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> The best, hands down.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST lip balm available.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips super soft and tastes great.</li>
            <li> We were huge fans even before it went mainstream and hit places like Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it couple of times and noticed a huge difference in a way my lips feel.</li>
            <li> Why they come in the HUGE cardboard tube (wasteful) and then have no information on the tube is beyond me.</li>
            <li> This product is compact and smooth.</li>
            <li> Minty and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves lips smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Every time you use it you get a minty, tingly feeling on your lips that feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> However, I will continue to use and enjoy this lip balm because there is nothing that compares.</li>
            <li> have cautioned against using too much chapstick and stopping your lips from creating their own balm...blahblahblah.</li>
            <li> This balm is hydrating and smoothly applied.</li>
            <li> So when I found it this cheap on Amazon</li>
            <li> Everybody knows how awesome this product is, so I won&#x27;t waste my time describing it.  </li>
            <li> With the honey, all the chapped areas heal and stay smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light and smells divine, if you like peppermint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and came in a nice package.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> cheap if bought in bulk</li>
            <li> The four pack was perfect because it is much cheaper than buying them individually.</li>
            <li> good knowing that it&#x27;s natural, not petroleum.</li>
            <li> It feels great on the lips and stays on longer than most other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other types of burts bees lip balm, they&#x27;re ok but the peppermint one is GREAT.</li>
            <li> My new favorite flavor is Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Rejuvenating&#x27; lip balm with Acai Berry. :-)</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not giving up, and will continue to apply this very natural product, knowing that it probably better for her health than the others!</li>
            <li> Your lips are worth it!</li>
            <li> , the original takes the cake.</li>
            <li> This is the original burts bees wax lip balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff that lasts a long time with no funky ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So glad Amazon offers this fine product!</li>
            <li> Works great in the colder winter months to keep your lips from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Was having a big problem with the most popular brand and decided I needed a change.</li>
            <li> It is oily enough to feel smooth and good, not waxy like some chapstick prodcuts.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have found, and I am never going back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Clean and tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> The stuff has gotten me back to feeling better than normal, and smells great to boot.</li>
            <li> Plus on amazon the price is right!</li>
            <li> The clove is super strong, but hey, its fun for a change.     </li>
            <li> This works great for chapped lips and doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly.</li>
            <li> This seemed to dry out my lips; my lips peeled a lot more when I used this, and I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms!</li>
            <li> The beeswax and vitamin E do a good job substituting for petroleum jelly used in traditional lip balms, which I don&#x27;t want on my lips.</li>
            <li> Also, the tingly feeling with this lib balm is cool.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips even more chapped  and peels very often.</li>
            <li> True or not, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> This stays on much longer and applies better.</li>
            <li> This lip balm protects well and leaves a cool feeling.</li>
            <li> Every winter when my skin starts to crack I buy ONE tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm a year, and it heals the cracked skin instantly, feels waxy (but in a good way), has no smell, and stays put.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s for over 10 years and it is just hands down the absolute best lip balm!  </li>
            <li> While this is a bit more than your normal brands, it is worth it!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the original beeswax is supposed to give a fresh feeling like peppermint or</li>
            <li> I have tried a ridiculous amount of lip balms and this one might be the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> It makes my lip more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite day to day lip balm, and it is slightly different than most.  </li>
            <li> However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for $10.83.</li>
            <li> However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for $10.83.</li>
            <li> It feels good and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel more chapped after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This works every time, and heals your lips really quick.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my lips are healing quickly.</li>
            <li> It heals lip quick.</li>
            <li> Very much like this peppermint scented lip balm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lip balms and I&#x27;ve yet to find one as effective and pleasing to use as the classic Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.</li>
            <li> Fast, Easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the other flavors, and while they&#x27;re generally good, nothing beats the original.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, I highly recommend c.o. bigelow lip balms!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> A lovely tingly feeling upon application, full coverage that lasts, a pleasant lack of strong odor or flavor (I hate strong smelling or tasting chapsticks, a lovely (and distinctive) yellow tube that is easy to find in any purse, consistently a good product, survives hours or days in my car in the heat without leaking or becoming absolute goop (just pop it into the freezer for a bit before using it if necessary</li>
            <li> I use Carmex now which is great and includes SPF so I can wear year round.</li>
            <li> and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Because the product is so hard/dense, I find I have to forcibly drag it across my lips in order to get a good coating.  </li>
            <li> While the cooling mentholated effect is nice, it&#x27;s not enough to make up for the lack of moisturizing benefits.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> price is definitey worth it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips soft and wears well under most lip glosses.</li>
            <li> That fact that it is all natural makes it all the better.</li>
            <li> While I have met others that find this balm to leave a burning sensation, I find the balm to be fresh and cooling.  </li>
            <li> this is buy far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Completely worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> It is by far the most soothing lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I own 15 different types of lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I used to use carmex exclusively, but when I learned the nastiness of petrolatum products, I tried so many natural lip balms</li>
            <li> it works as good as i expected.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lip balm/chapstick.</li>
            <li> The number one thing for me is that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients and the hint of mint is outstanding</li>
            <li> gets kind of gross after a while</li>
            <li> AMAZON was nice enough to reimburse me $5.00 on my order so it was made right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different at first, but you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It happily feels like it connects the layers of skin on my lips to each other into a unified whole.</li>
            <li> It is unique in that it does not just sit on your lips like most lip balms it actually penetrates and heals.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, only the original though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that Burt&#x27;s Bees is superior to all of the other brands.</li>
            <li> although it costs twice as much as I can get Chap Stick for, it is worth it!  </li>
            <li> She recommended that I apply a quality product right after the shower to seal in the moisture.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint taste and the consistency are just right.</li>
            <li> And she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I used this product all day and use it right before bed, every night.  </li>
            <li> This particular balm has a light peppermint flavor added, and thankfully not a lot.  </li>
            <li> It quickly became our favorite, and now, it&#x27;s the ONLY  lip balm we purchase.  </li>
            <li> Many lip balms tend to be greasy and oily, and only form a greasy film that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips shiny, full, and really really healthy-looking.     </li>
            <li> It should have been more apparent.</li>
            <li> It really soothes my cracked lips and I like the cool, tingling sensation very much.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel nice and smooth when I put it on and wore off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how INTENSELY strong the smells are.</li>
            <li> Young children might find the smells too strong in a chapstick of the kinds that I have tried yet.     </li>
            <li> but it might be too strong for those who have sensitive skin or are probe to irritation.</li>
            <li> The wife uses lip balm at night, and decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees because of the natural ingredients used (bees wax, lanolin, various vegetable and fruit oils, and etc.), and their good reputation.  </li>
            <li> They probably want us to use up the chapstick as fast as possible with some kind of skin drying</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> keeps me coming back for more.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different lip balms, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> The first one I opened is still in use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> And we are avid outdoors people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm five or six years ago and was hooked.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve tried other balms, none has been able to the original peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees balm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date.</li>
            <li> First picked it up at Cracker Barrel.</li>
            <li> It sucked the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li> But living at altitude over 10,000 ft in Colorado this winter, relative humidity hovering around zero, my lips have never been more chapped.</li>
            <li> One caveat; don&#x27;t leave it in a hot car all day...</li>
            <li> The price here is ok, about the same as I get in the store.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only one I use that does not irritate my lips.</li>
            <li> When this first came out, it was a must have accessory at the time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to try this lip balm for the first time, no need to worry about taking a risk...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff can&#x27;t keep enough in stock for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try!!</li>
            <li> Used to have pretty chopped lips</li>
            <li> First time I tried it,I immediately noticed the tingly/minty feel of it when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees has something, I don&#x27;t know what it is, but something that, like, absorbs into your lips and do exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> but this one is the only one I truly love.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms in many different flavors, with one of my favorites being the Mango Butter - that is, until now.</li>
            <li> I can put it on before bed and wake up with ultra soft, smooth lips.</li>
            <li> For freshest results, you&#x27;ll need to find a more recent manufacturing date.</li>
            <li> The price is terrific and with free shipping too!</li>
            <li> I use this lip balm all the time and it really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I moved onto Nivea Milk &amp; Honey and the difference was like when I had first used Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li> we love burts bee, especially the chapstick.</li>
            <li> After find this good deal here it I made my mind up and bought a few sets.</li>
            <li> Thanks to me, right now all of my family member use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and even though I&#x27;ve liked some other brands, nothing matches Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other kind of chap stick EVAR.</li>
            <li> It gives me lips a slight tingle, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews and the Burt&#x27;s Bees reputation, I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> Positively addicting.</li>
            <li> This did pretty much nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Each tube lasts about twice as long as chap-stick and does a much better job moisturizing and protecting.</li>
            <li> I found that my lips dried out more and had to reapply more frequently.</li>
            <li> However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date.</li>
            <li> The old adage does, and always will hold true...</li>
            <li> My lips got even more dry and started to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like when my lips were dry and the skin was coming off, it just kept coming off more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get them mixed up.</li>
            <li> We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry.</li>
            <li> keep several tubes at my house and some at my work, as my lips seem to chap easily.</li>
            <li> I apply this lip balm, it makes my lips much more dry.</li>
            <li> This is a good lip balm: protective and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Has almost a minty scent to it and provides good long lasting coverage on my lips.</li>
            <li> It is really good for dry cracked winter lips within the next day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too oily and thin feeling on the lips and has a nice strong peppermint tingle.</li>
            <li> but it was in the fine print on the on the back amidst the ingredient</li>
            <li> I work in a very dry environment, so I need something to keep my lips from chapping, but most products out there are female-oriented.  </li>
            <li> It fixes my amazingly chapped lips, even in harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Burt&#x27;s Bees fan, but this balm is one of my least favorite in their line.</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who&#x27;s very frugal, bought this even though he could buy cheap 50 cents generic balm, because he likes it that much.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I always put these in my kid&#x27;s stocking at Christmas and really was expecting the package.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and you definitely feel like you are adding a layer of protection.  </li>
            <li> You can never have too much of it either.</li>
            <li> THAT much</li>
            <li> and it was appreciated by all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> but she really like the way it protects e her lips from the elements here in south Texas.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really come as a pack of 4</li>
            <li> I really like the minty flavor of this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> but once i starte dusing it, my lips have become so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Really like this minty lip balm.</li>
            <li> Can never use too much</li>
            <li> This lip balm really does the job.</li>
            <li> It rubs and dries well without too much of a shine.</li>
            <li> and we go through it so fast so</li>
            <li> thanks for making it affordable@.</li>
            <li> and I have used it before)to see if the peppermint oil is really the cause, or if it is just a preexisting skin condition</li>
            <li> Even if my lips create their own moisture, they&#x27;ll still have a lag time between harsh changes in climate.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell and find that it actually helps clear my sinuses (I often have sinusitis)</li>
            <li> She has used a lot of the other popular brands that are made with other ingredients (petroleum gel, chemicals, and etc.), and been fine with them.  </li>
            <li> So much better than other high priced lipsticks!</li>
            <li> The extra cost is well worth it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other chapsticks over the years.</li>
            <li> Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper.</li>
            <li> She is still getting used to the properties of the product, as the other brands are more slick/slippery on the lips.  </li>
            <li> I tried them all and then decided to shell out an extra 50 cents to try Burt&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve come back to the original</li>
            <li> i have used many other products before i setteled with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Prefer the basic original.</li>
            <li> I think it keeps the lips moisturized better than other Burt&#x27;s Bees, too.</li>
            <li> This classic flavor is superior to the other Burt&#x27;s Bees flavors (pomegranate) in my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is far superior to any other lip balm!!!</li>
            <li> This Lip Balm last long and has a nice tingling sensation when you apply it.</li>
            <li> wonderful tingling feel and eliminates the dry chapped feel very well while this one seems to stay on the longest without feeling coated nor too thin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put these on I could feel them work on my lips, and visually they improved right away!</li>
            <li> Because of the amazing ingredients and results, this small tube lasts me months.  </li>
            <li> The product is fantastic but with as long as the shipping took to get here</li>
            <li> Keeps her lips from cracking in the winter  but makes her lips feel so smooth she uses it all year long.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a minty flavor and fragrance, that stays with you long after you have put on the lip balm, you will like this.</li>
            <li> Smell and the cool burn you get once put this on a lip is such an addiciton.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to regular chapstick, which gets the job done for the most part.    </li>
            <li> Using anything else makes my lips break out in hives, which is super gross.</li>
            <li> Did you know that most commercial lip balms actually CHAP your lips</li>
            <li> Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year.</li>
            <li> I threw away all my balms containing sunscreen and bought a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Classic to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my lips are back to being soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than chapstick or blistex, but it&#x27;s SO MUCH BETTER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty flavor is by far my favorite part about this particular lip balm and none other on the market are quite like it.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lip balm if you haven&#x27;t tried it before--</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees solves this issue and it is always high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried this product before then I highly encourage you to do so.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand will gladly pay the $3 for something that leaves my lips feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Only chapstick I like other than the mint flavored EOS kind.</li>
            <li> Far better than any other lip balm I have used.</li>
            <li> still is far better than other chapsticks.</li>
            <li> cost a little more because of the shipping</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very moisturizing with natural oils &amp; beeswax, plus it is non-toxic, with no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed with burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s lip balm, so this was a great stocking stuffer for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to go through a tube of normal chapstick once a week.  </li>
            <li> I can even go a few days to a week without it before I need to run out and grab more.</li>
            <li> But that may be normal Chapstick because I normally don&#x27;t wear any.</li>
            <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips.</li>
            <li> I had been using Original Carmex for 10 years before trying Burt Bees - and there really is no comparison.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm to try something new.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without one</li>
            <li> but me nephew can’t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> my daughter couldn&#x27;t live without her burt&#x27;s bees lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have really chapped lips and this did absolutely nothing for my overall lip health.</li>
            <li> If I use a different kind for some reason, I find myself missing and longing for the peppermint in Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Now I am pregnant again and having dry lips</li>
            <li> All the other flavored Burt&#x27;s Bees chap-sticks are new and do NOT work as well as this original.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the salt air has a tendency to dehydrate your skin fast.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective enough to make me find it before heading out the door into the cold, but I think it&#x27;s more protective than healing.</li>
            <li> Cheapest by far!  </li>
            <li> The scent is fresh smelling, and it keeps my lips moist for a long time.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips so soft!</li>
            <li> In fact, this is a first lip balm I ever tried, and I ain&#x27;t going back.</li>
            <li> I usually use the nourishing (orange top), but my husband loves mint.</li>
            <li> it is an all natural balm which is important bc only natural ones actually moisturize the lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other variations of their lip balm such as the lifeguard and pomegranate variety but just didn&#x27;t enjoy them as much.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> As long as Burt&#x27;s is available to me, I will ONLY be using Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t however, like any other of their varieties because they don&#x27;t refresh your lips anywhere near as well as the original formula does.</li>
            <li> I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
            <li> I live in Ithaca where it can get brutally cold and the beeswax in the product is great for keeping the moisture in your lips.     </li>
            <li> I will say, my love for Burt&#x27;s Bees declined slightly after watching Burt&#x27;s Buzz documentary.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is truly effective in protecting your lips in harsh weather - summer or winter; and it works well in healing dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use, but slightly prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing (Pomegranate) Lip Balm at night.</li>
            <li> apparently peppermint oil in Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Classic&#x27; formula.</li>
            <li> It leaves my lips feeling good and lasts quite a while compared to other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The value in this product is enough for me to pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company</li>
            <li> I go through chapstick like crazy and this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> These are so expensive in the store, but buying them bulk here was a great way to still get quality but at a lesser price.</li>
            <li> ITS ALL NATURAL</li>
            <li> This animal will not rip your lips off if they are sensitive.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips soft and is all natural.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed are all natural products.</li>
            <li> I switched to Blistex Complete Moisture, and my lip problems began healing overnight and were completely repaired within 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> This product is NOT all natural.  </li>
            <li> On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li> On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li> As far as Burt&#x27;s Bees is concerned as a product my wife loves it and buys the stuff all the time.  </li>
            <li> They are no longer truly natural.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much because I&#x27;ve only used them twice</li>
            <li> One of our adult children uses this all the time and requested it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I am sensitive.</li>
            <li> Keeps your mouth soft and healtihy...</li>
            <li> All natural, too.</li>
            <li> the chap stick itself was lumpy, i wont order again, i feel like im getting old or damaged goods</li>
            <li> As far as the chapstick goes though, 5/5.  </li>
            <li> Leaves lips soft and moisturized  </li>
            <li> I do like the natural ingredients and &amp;#34;eucalyptus tingle&amp;#34; that this provides.</li>
            <li> It just drags across your lips and you really have to force it across your lips and mash them together several times to even feel like they&#x27;re covered/lubricated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to apply the honey as frequently, either.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The peppermint lip balm goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, gunky or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips soft and tingle with the Peppermint.</li>
            <li> Keeps your lips soft.</li>
            <li> ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural.</li>
            <li> I keep one in each car, one in the TV room, and one near my bed</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised people aren&#x27;t complaining about it.</li>
            <li> Both my girlfriend and I use this Burt&#x27;s Bees frequently.</li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s bee product because they are natural.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is a nice addition for the smell and the added tingle sensation, but is completely unnecessary for me.</li>
            <li> My lips get pretty dry in the winter, but Burt&#x27;s Bees has been a life saver.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li> The honey lip balm cap is just a few shades off from the original lip balm.</li>
            <li> Their scents and tastes can be a little too strong and often taste like they&#x27;re laden with chemicals, the opposite of Burt&#x27;s Bees \\&quot;green\\&quot; or natural approach to their products.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees is a classic choice for simple people looking for a quality product.</li>
            <li> This one has peppermint oil and makes a decent second choice.  </li>
            <li> I really have to press down hard and force it on slowly, several times, which I&#x27;m sure just wastes product, in order to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Carmex&#x27;s new Moisture Plus clear lip balm</li>
            <li> It goes on with a slight minty tingle and then gets absorbed keeping my lips soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> It was the only thing that cleared my lips up and made them look normal again.  </li>
            <li> I tried lots of different chap sticks and nothing would last more that a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> after using a menthol based chapstick for a couple years, i ordered a pack of these and after a couple days of use my lips were back to normal.</li>
            <li> The peppermint provides a cool sensation that lasts for a few minutes and is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The only regret that you will have after using this will be your new addiction to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I really suffered from dry lips.</li>
            <li> I pop on some of the sunscreen lip balm from Bert&#x27;s Bees and then apply this over it and am ready to go, my lips don&#x27;t get dry or chapped like they used too.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the sticks are sealed, so its not really a huge concern.</li>
            <li> No other lip balm compares.</li>
            <li> No other product comes close.</li>
            <li> There is no other chap stick out there that comes close.</li>
            <li> You may not know this, but other lip balm coats your lips, but that coating actually makes your lips more dry because it doesn&#x27;t allow moisture back in.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a really long time, and I enjoy the slight peppermint kick it has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive that the regular brands which you can find in any gas station or corner grocery store but is worth the extra coin.</li>
            <li> I had never spent over $1 on any chapstick</li>
            <li> I finally tried Burt&#x27;s Bees after reading on the website how it was all natural.</li>
            <li> No bitter taste.</li>
            <li> My mom introduced this to me 6 years ago when I was pregnant and stuck in the hospital for a couple weeks due to preterm labor issues, and the dry hospital air made my lips so chapped.</li>
            <li> My lips have been incredibly dry recently, and I was hoping to find a lip balm that worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is definitely more expensive than other brands of lip balm, but I find it to be worth it.</li>
            <li> Much prefer it over other brands.</li>
            <li> If I leave the house and forget &amp;#34;my Burts Bees,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the first thing I notice; it ruins my day; and I pout until I get back to a tube of it.</li>
            <li> I switched from a major brand to Burt&#x27;s Bees over 10 years ago and have never looked back.  </li>
            <li> prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands.</li>
            <li> Sure, the others suffice when necessary, but despite the admittedly expensive (for a chapstick) cost of Burts Bees, I simply cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I live in the southwest in a dry climate and my lips constantly peeled with chapstick.</li>
            <li> I used Blistex (the cream, the roll-on and the standard lip balm) and regular, old Chapstick (all different kinds of standard lip balm)</li>
            <li> The item came right on time and it had four tubes in a small plastic bag.</li>
            <li> so I never have to go far to find relief when my lips are dry.</li>
            <li> The only socially acceptable addiction is Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When I reached the point of being unable to smile, something had to be done - so I bought my first thing of lip balm, ever.</li>
            <li> The menthol instantly sooths my dry lips while the beeswax and oils leave my lips feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I get the same good results from less expensive products, so there you are.</li>
            <li> This one has worked the best, at least for me, in regards to the cold dry weather that we tend to deal with, especially the wind!</li>
            <li> its also very thick so it stays on better than any other brand ive tried.</li>
            <li> and they generally seem dry, so I&#x27;m always applying lip balm.</li>
            <li> The only other brand that I like is Natural Ice.</li>
            <li> I like this product due to the fact it is mainly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Has a cooling (due to the peppermint), soothing texture that protects well and leaves my lips feeling soft, moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality although the out is a little sticky because of the plastic adhesive tape.</li>
            <li> I am now becoming obsessed with this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> when I didn&#x27;t have any  Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s they all chapped my lips, so I went back to my Burt&#x27;s and been using it for a long time, I will not switch again.</li>
            <li> It is a must have product, even if you&#x27;re on a budget plus they last long too if you can keep track of it.</li>
            <li> Others don&#x27;t seem to last as long as Burt&#x27;s or are too mediciny.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the mint tingle is nice, other times it is almost irritating to my lips and leaves them feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida and spend a lot of time outdoors so my lips take a beating year round.  </li>
            <li> have the 4 pack so this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> even keep one next to my bed in case my lips get dry during the night.</li>
            <li> The balm does nothing to help the dry peeling skin, and now my mouth becomes slightly red whenever I apply this product.  </li>
            <li> Five stars is not a high enough rating for this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other chapsticks, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it isn&#x27;t slimy, it isn&#x27;t smeary - in short, it isn&#x27;t gross.</li>
            <li> My lips are very dry and this balm just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.</li>
            <li> of caution, only use this line of burt&#x27;s bees; their other lip balms don&#x27;t have beeswax, and are greasier and don&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> So, this is a good everyday use, but if your lips are really bad, you might want to consider something else to get them back into shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for a long time now</li>
            <li> If I go too long (20 minutes?</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is also the only lip balm that I feel like penetrates and sinks in to moisturize my lips fully.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take long before I need to order another pack.  </li>
            <li> All the others either have a strange texture, smell, or taste to me.</li>
            <li> It has a grey cap</li>
            <li> The texture is pleasing and stays on long after application.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and lasts a fairly long time before you need to reapply.</li>
            <li> The product is solid and not soft like some other chapsticks.</li>
            <li> I feel like, with the Burt&#x27;s Bees, I actually use less (reapply less often) than when I used to with the old stuff.  </li>
            <li> Plus, a little tube will easily last a couple months of daily applications.</li>
            <li> I will buy another package for her!!!Also, I will definitely try other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not seem to help heal chapped lips any faster than other brands but definitely soothes them.    </li>
            <li> The only thing lacking is substantial sun protection but other than that this product is a must have.</li>
            <li> But there are some people who refuse to use Petroleum-based lip balms (Chapstick/Blistex) on their lips due to the fact that it&#x27;s made from petroleum (same stuff as gasoline comes from) and some say that can cause cancer.</li>
            <li> But there are some people who refuse to use Petroleum-based lip balms (Chapstick/Blistex) on their lips due to the fact that it&#x27;s made from petroleum (same stuff as gasoline comes from) and some say that can cause cancer.</li>
            <li> I will never go back or even bother tying any other kinds of lip balm now.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from severe chapped lips due to perioral dermatitis and this was the only thing that didn&#x27;t burn putting on.  </li>
            <li> I have the occasional dry lips due to 8 hrs a day/5 days a week exposure to dry a/c office environment.</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona, the weather is dry</li>
            <li> I persistently have dry lips because I lick them a lot</li>
            <li> However, after almost two weeks of liberally and repeatedly applying, it did nothing to relieve my dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry lips forever.</li>
            <li> lips were dry and cracked before using this lip balm and now they&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my lips moisturized in the dry heat.</li>
            <li> If you apply it morning, noon and night, it should keep your lips from drying out and cracking if you&#x27;re in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; but now they make my lips really dry within 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from a very wet climate to a very dry one.</li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of lip balms over the past 40 years and now this is a clear winner.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure it offers any sun protection.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty much addicted to Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm (my family will attest).</li>
            <li> When my order arrived, there were 4 loose containers in a baggie.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little more expensive than other lip balms, but hey you get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers nailed it - once you go Burt&#x27;s, you never go back!</li>
            <li> My lips get very dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pricier than other lip balm but this one lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> Even if my lips aren&#x27;t chapped or dry to begin with, putting this on will ensure chapped lips within the next few hours.</li>
            <li> Any other product I would use I would wake up with dry, chapped lips or gunky, sticky lips.</li>
            <li> The balms that I have tried that are almost all coconut oil get too soft in the summer and too hard in the winter.</li>
            <li> The lifeguard type leaves an icky white coating on your lips, and the pomegranate one stains them a bit red - a bit too feminine for me.</li>
            <li> If you do, it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> If you do, it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> ot use as much, and am no longer addicted to lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be careful to avoid lip balms containing mint as well as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not really much to comment about otherwise.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are a fan of the honey lip balm, be careful...</li>
            <li> Devotees will know the truth when I say that I&#x27;ve never finished one of these without having the sticker peel off (every month ends with a plain yellow tube).</li>
            <li> The dates are a little old in manufacturing, so, so far one of the tubes has broken up a little upon use.</li>
            <li> If you have to reapply your chapstick in less than 30 minutes, that&#x27;s NOT normal.</li>
            <li> It goes on thicker feeling than any other over the counter lip balm</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend any of the other flavors, however.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use other lipbalms anymore.</li>
            <li> We never have to worry about the extreme cracking.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned before in my past reviews, buying anything with an expiration date online sometimes becomes a concern for me simply because you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re buying is something that&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for months (or years) after the expiration date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have chapped lips than use some other brand-</li>
            <li> I have started using other products made by Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> Every other product in the multiverse either has a smell, feels greasy, or doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin.</li>
            <li> other products would leave my lips chapped &amp; peeling, Burt&#x27;s healed them in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t image using any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to Burt&#x27;s Bees corporate page, it is stated that there is a shelf life (due to natural ingredients) but they are unable to provide an expiration date.</li>
            <li> Everyday my lips dry out and peel  whenever I use this, ending up with chapped,bloody lips.  </li>
            <li> The most irritating thing about this balm is that it&#x27;s obnoxiously difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste on $!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like a lot of other lip</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my body chemistry or the dry climate that I live in, but unfortunately I have to give Burt&#x27;s Bees 2 thumbs down.  </li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry environment, and the dry, cold weather combined with indoor heating wrecked havoc on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Spending the $ on Burts Bees is a small drop of water in the long run.</li>
            <li> Spending the $ on Burts Bees is a small drop of water in the long run.</li>
            <li> But the resulting chapped lips are not worth it</li>
            <li> I had a complaint, it would be that sometimes a batch seems to get a hearty extra splash of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with Burt&#x27;s Bees Chapstick, so this 4 pack really saves the money and time</li>
            <li> It beats the fake-flavored lip balms hands down.</li>
            <li> But until then I&#x27;m going to keep using this like a drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin e &amp; peppermint from Burt&#x27;s Bees is hands down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s minty, and it has THAT</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been let down.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to try it to understand what I mean though.</li>
            <li> The peppermint might sting a little on extremely broken/chapped lips.</li>
            <li> but I only put this on NO MORE than 2 times a day!  </li>
            <li> That coming from a guy who usually doesn&#x27;t care if his lips are dry.</li>
            <li> Too bad Burt&#x27;s Bees, aka Johnson and Johnson, are promoting the crappy flavored junk instead of the quality original product.</li>
            <li> The mint seems slightly stinging, but since I know it is taking care of my body</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be overly scented, just a slight peppermint aroma.  </li>
            <li> As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> want something less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 10 years now, long before they were taken over by Clorox.</li>
            <li> usually I have this balm in winter to keep my lip wet.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly minty smell that gives it a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> Save a little $ and buy it on Amazon if you use it often.</li>
            <li> I found the packaging to be a little sketchy though.</li>
            <li> It is not slippery and really hydrates through the cold colorado winter and beyond</li>
            <li> My co-worker recommended Burt&#x27;s, and practically every reviewer loves this balm, but it actually seemed to make my lips worse.  </li>
            <li> With Winter coming on...hopefully, felt I needed to order a few of these.</li>
            <li> Its not light moisture.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I had an allergic reaction to one of the lip balms I tried.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always a struggle when I have to go a few days without chapstick.</li>
            <li> My lips were far from soothed; they felt chapped, tingly and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> After going through just about everything else on the market and getting nothing but seriously dried out lips, I decided to give Burt&#x27;s a try.</li>
            <li> hand creme a few times a day, but</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for a few years and have no intention of trying anything else.</li>
            <li> I live in Ottawa, ON Canada and the winters here are pretty nasty, with wind chills averaging around</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms and found that this is one of the least hydrating that they produce.</li>
            <li> Slightly thicker texture than Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing (Pomegranate) Lip Balm, but not as thick feeling as plain ChapStick.</li>
            <li> But the tint is subtle and stays on way longer than other lipsticks.</li>
            <li> that, once you use it, you simply can&#x27;t go back (I tried, once, to revert to the Big Brand of this stuff, thinking I was misremembering how bad it was.</li>
            <li> A few years ago a female friend turned me on to Burt&#x27;s Bees and I have been unable to use any lip balm since.</li>
            <li> My fiance on the other hand, suffers from severe dry/chapped lips and usually goes through several sticks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Chapstick in the past, but recently started having a weird reaction to it.</li>
            <li> However it is usually one of those after the fact things.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a small envelope with the 4 tubes of lip balm.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use lip balm.</li>
            <li> no more menthol for me</li>
            <li> satisfied!But when after transportation, please note, because sent the lid of one of the broken, is not very convenient!</li>
            <li> Before I used to apply balms every 2 hours, now, hardly twice day.</li>
            <li> I was a die hard Carmex girl.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a negative with the product.</li>
            <li> To all the naysayers who complain about the price; feel free to save a buck and swallow nasty chemicals all day.  </li>
            <li> negative is that i wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> It will work but not thrilled with product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, goes on without feeling sticky or thick, and lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and stays on well.</li>
            <li> I mean that.</li>
            <li> With an incredibly unpleasant, thick and waxy texture, this is definitely a product I would not recommend or repurchase.  </li>
            <li> But it has a serious flaw:</li>
            <li> The peppermint lip balm also leaves a subtle yet somewhat noticeable plumpness to my lips after using, and has a shiny but not over done gloss to it after application.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this company&#x27;s products and won&#x27;t waste my money on them again.</li>
            <li> The kids use it on a regular basis when the North Dakota winters get especially cold and dry.  </li>
            <li> I also live in Texas where the sun if brutal, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li> After moving to Arizona I had a very hard time finding any Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> something in all those \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients (maybe the peppermint) is irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am hopelessly addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> lips are addicted.</li>
            <li> Even my husband is addicted.</li>
            <li> This package is a serious steal!</li>
            <li> But I found the peppermint in particular dries my lips insanely.</li>
            <li> The smell of it is horrible - like an old woman&#x27;s scented talcum powder!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very hard to apply when it is cold, becomes rather lumpish and waxy&lt;</li>
            <li> I hate using any other lip glass.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not the one.  </li>
            <li> I tried the honey lip balm by burts bees and that has some nasty chemicals (such as benzyl benzoate - a stabilizer) in it.</li>
            <li> Sad to say I&#x27;m not a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  </li>
            <li> After putting it on, her lips swelled up, turned red from a rash and burned terribly.  </li>
            <li> Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot find this one in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the menthol that did it, but I consider this product falsely advertised!</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips from being chapped, especially in cold or dry weather.</li>
            <li> With all the other balms, if I ran out of the product or if I didn&#x27;t have them with me to re-apply immediately, my lips would be in terrible shape within a day or two.</li>
            <li> Years after years of chapped lips and applying chapstick a thousand times a day just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  </li>
            <li> but it dries out my lips like crazy.</li>
            <li> also am crazy about the tinted ones.</li>
            <li> This lip balm holds up for me through heat, wind, cold and sun.</li>
            <li> Are they cutting corners or adding something in?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks  and absolutely hate it!</li>
            <li> Their products are also very expensive (I paid $5 for the honey lip balm).</li>
            <li> but I hate the price -- nothing against Amazon; Burt&#x27;s Bees is too expensive no matter where you buy it.</li>
            <li> My lips used to get so bad that they would flake and crack, but this has gotten rid of that problem for me.</li>
            <li> I have cracked skin on my fingers every winter, so bad that the joints bleed.</li>
            <li> but I found it annoying.</li>
            <li> hate to give this product 3 stars, but this product just isn&#x27;t working so well for me anymore.</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> my mom had horribly chapped and peeling lips, so I recommended this, but it didn&#x27;t work for her.  </li>
            <li> A friend who has an allergy to zinc just tried Burts and had a terrible allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Of course if you hate peppermint, stay away from it!</li>
            <li> However,you can apply this to the surface of the eyelid to keep you awake when driving a car or listening to boring stuff.</li>
            <li> Something must&#x27;ve changed because it is extremely annoying having to reapply so often!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast, Easy and I love the product! keeps me coming back for more. thank you so much. you really are great.</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida and spend a lot of time outdoors so my lips take a beating year round.  Before using this my lips were chapping to the point that I went to see a dermatologist.  Apparently the salt air has a tendency to dehydrate your skin fast.  She recommended that I apply a quality product right after the shower to seal in the moisture.  Voila!  Nary a problem since.  This lip balm is, in my opinion, the best out there and worth every penny.  To all the naysayers who complain about the price; feel free to save a buck and swallow nasty chemicals all day.  I on the other hand will gladly pay the $3 for something that leaves my lips feeling soft and supple.  Plus, a little tube will easily last a couple months of daily applications.</li>
            <li> I LOVE BURTS BECAUSE IT IS QUALITY... PLUS ITS ALL NATURAL SO I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF IT GETS IN MY BODY. IF YOU LOVE STUFF THATS GOOD FOR YOU USE BURTS BEES!! OPPA BURTS BEES STYLE!</li>
            <li> I like this product due to the fact it is mainly natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve used Chapstick in the past, but recently started having a weird reaction to it. I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees and haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects.  So far I like it!</li>
            <li> No, seriously - this is better than chapstick, and in fact less expensive when purchased here on line.  Pleasant taste - smooth lips without clumping!!</li>
            <li> My co-worker recommended Burt&#x27;s, and practically every reviewer loves this balm, but it actually seemed to make my lips worse.  This seemed to dry out my lips; my lips peeled a lot more when I used this, and I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms! This and SoftLips are two balms I would never buy, because they just don&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry.  My boyfriend, who&#x27;s very frugal, bought this even though he could buy cheap 50 cents generic balm, because he likes it that much.  That coming from a guy who usually doesn&#x27;t care if his lips are dry. So I would say it works great for many people, just not me.</li>
            <li> Our family was introduced to Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm by a commercial beekeeper several years ago. It quickly became our favorite, and now, it&#x27;s the ONLY  lip balm we purchase.  It beats the fake-flavored lip balms hands down. We like to keep an ample supply for use when outdoors, but also find indoor air can often be just as drying to the lips. Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm is a must-have for our family.   So glad Amazon offers this fine product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 10 years now, long before they were taken over by Clorox. It still seems to be the same formula. The beeswax and vitamin E do a good job substituting for petroleum jelly used in traditional lip balms, which I don&#x27;t want on my lips. The peppermint is a nice addition for the smell and the added tingle sensation, but is completely unnecessary for me.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing. It also saves you about a dollar between buying it here and buying it in a store. Also, the tingly feeling with this lib balm is cool.</li>
            <li> The only chapstick I use!! The pack of 4 is a great value, and I can pop one in my purse, leave one at my desk, have one in the car, have one at my bedside table, and I&#x27;ll never be without my beloved burts bees :) I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm and I really like it. The flavor is minty and keeps my lips moist. Good product.</li>
            <li> I know I should be using this as a preventative. However it is usually one of those after the fact things. This animal will not rip your lips off if they are sensitive. It also does not smell like you have been kissing a koala.</li>
            <li> I have really chapped lips and this did absolutely nothing for my overall lip health. Sure it felt pretty good at first but once it wears off, my lips actually seemed drier and flakier than before. I threw this away before it was even finished and have seen better results with another product.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. It smells great, tingles pleasantly, and softens your lips. Plus, it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is simply the best! It moisturizes my lips and the peppermint is so refreshing. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different lip balms, and this is definitely my favorite. If I use a different kind for some reason, I find myself missing and longing for the peppermint in Burt&#x27;s Bees. I keep several of these in various places in the house, such as my purse and my nightstand. I highly recommend this lip balm if you haven&#x27;t tried it before--it&#x27;s different at first, but you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Great product. The best I have ever found. No other lip balm compares. I like the tingling of this one.</li>
            <li> My lips have been incredibly dry recently, and I was hoping to find a lip balm that worked really well.  Unfortunately, this is not the one.  Within 10 minutes of putting this product on, it feels like I haven&#x27;t applied anything.  It&#x27;s like not wearing lip balm at all. I had to go back to regular chapstick, which gets the job done for the most part.    I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my body chemistry or the dry climate that I live in, but unfortunately I have to give Burt&#x27;s Bees 2 thumbs down.  I recommend not starting off with the multi pack if you&#x27;ve never tried it.</li>
            <li> The only socially acceptable addiction is Burt&#x27;s. Using anything else makes my lips break out in hives, which is super gross.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick I have ever used and will never try anything else!!! I have tried the honey kind as well, but I think they original kind works better. I love the minty smell and the tingly feeling you get when you use it. That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working!! Makes your lips soft and is all natural. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed like a nice brand  for lip balm. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks  and absolutely hate it! It makes my lips even more chapped  and peels very often. Everyday my lips dry out and peel  whenever I use this, ending up with chapped,bloody lips.  Don&#x27;t buy, I highly recommend c.o. bigelow lip balms!!! You  can either buy them onlibe or go to bath and body works!!</li>
            <li> With Winter coming on...hopefully, felt I needed to order a few of these. As always, Burts never disappoints. The peppermint taste and the consistency are just right.</li>
            <li> This is not a review for the product.  Burts Bees is what it is and you  either like it or you don&#x27;t.  What I&#x27;m reviewing here is that I thought I was purchasing a 4pack, like is sold in stores.  When my order arrived, there were 4 loose containers in a baggie.  Not a big deal if it is for yourself, but I always put these in my kid&#x27;s stocking at Christmas and really was expecting the package.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome, natural lip balm. It may be a little more expensive than other lip balms, but hey you get what you pay for here. I&#x27;m not a fan of really strong mint flabors, but I love this lip balm. It&#x27;s minty without being overkill. And along with moisturizing your lips, it just feels great. You definitely have to try it to understand what I mean though.</li>
            <li> The only reason I continue to use it is because I \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as though it is safer to smear on my mouth than petroleum products.  It&#x27;s effective enough to make me find it before heading out the door into the cold, but I think it&#x27;s more protective than healing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this balm for over 10 years- it&#x27;s the best all natural lip balm that I&#x27;ve found (i try to stay away from petroleum products). It has a slightly minty smell that gives it a little tingle.  I&#x27;ve also tried the pomegranate version, but I didn&#x27;t think it moisturized as well.  It&#x27;s worked great for me.  Different story- my mom had horribly chapped and peeling lips, so I recommended this, but it didn&#x27;t work for her.  Eventually, she said the vaseline intensive care was the only thing that healed them.  So, this is a good everyday use, but if your lips are really bad, you might want to consider something else to get them back into shape.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2KYYA37ZRDBUH]]DISCLAIMER: I like Amazon not just for buying products but for the reviews. Before I make a purchase I like to look at what people think, not just go head and make a purchase. I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm to try something new. I had been using Original Carmex for 10 years before trying Burt Bees - and there really is no comparison. I live in Ottawa, ON Canada and the winters here are pretty nasty, with wind chills averaging around -22F. I need something that will moisturize and protect my lips from drying and cracking. This did pretty much nothing for me. It didn&#x27;t feel nice and smooth when I put it on and wore off after a few minutes. My lips got even more dry and started to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Burts Bees are not as \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; as one might think. I tried the honey lip balm by burts bees and that has some nasty chemicals (such as benzyl benzoate - a stabilizer) in it. The smell of it is horrible - like an old woman&#x27;s scented talcum powder! I tried my friend&#x27;s tinted burt bees lip balm on the back of my hand to see the colour. I must have then touched my face because my eye then immediately swelled shut. Obviously I can&#x27;t use their tinted products since I must be allergic to the dye in it or something. Their products are also very expensive (I paid $5 for the honey lip balm). Not impressed with this company&#x27;s products and won&#x27;t waste my money on them again. I recently bought Carmex&#x27;s new Moisture Plus clear lip balm and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is wonderful!! I use it every day! It seems to be very moisturizing with natural oils &amp; beeswax, plus it is non-toxic, with no harmful chemicals. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Simply put, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm out there. It seriously is so amazing and I cannot express how much I love it. I love the mint that is in it that leaves your lips feeling cool and refreshed after every application. This package is a serious steal! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best deal I could find anywhere was here on Amazon. Smells great and soothes. Love this lip balm! Works great in the colder winter months to keep your lips from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I have the occasional dry lips due to 8 hrs a day/5 days a week exposure to dry a/c office environment. This product is compact and smooth. The minty taste is lovely, I understand this can be an annoyance to some people so know you taste and scent buds. It tingles on your lips when you apply which is nice. The staying power is 7/10. I have to reapply throughout the day. Its not light moisture. You can feel the oiliness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not break my skin out. The ingredients listed are all natural products. No petroleum product was included which I am happy about. Petro products does not react to my skin on my face that well. Breakouts alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricier than other lip balm but this one lasted me a long time. The product is solid and not soft like some other chapsticks. So it maybe the product is compressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the 4 pack so this will last me a very long time. The first one I opened is still in use.  When the time comes, I will consider to buy this again.</li>
            <li> Only chapstick I like other than the mint flavored EOS kind.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lip sticks to make my lip mosturized. None is good. This lip stip is actually for my sister, who was pregenant. But I couldn&#x27;t find my Kihels&#x27; lip stick. So just grab hers, it&#x27;s aswsome!!! I will buy another package for her!!!Also, I will definitely try other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> Sad to say I&#x27;m not a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  With an incredibly unpleasant, thick and waxy texture, this is definitely a product I would not recommend or repurchase.  The most irritating thing about this balm is that it&#x27;s obnoxiously difficult to apply.  Because the product is so hard/dense, I find I have to forcibly drag it across my lips in order to get a good coating.  Flakies are not eliminated, but rather coated in wax and accentuated on the lips - gross!  While the cooling mentholated effect is nice, it&#x27;s not enough to make up for the lack of moisturizing benefits.  I bought a tube, but only used it a handful of times before I tossed it - sadness!    Read more at [...]</li>
            <li> I love this product but I hate the price -- nothing against Amazon; Burt&#x27;s Bees is too expensive no matter where you buy it. I get the same good results from less expensive products, so there you are.</li>
            <li> Is there anything more glorious that the sweet tingle of Burt&#x27;s upon your lips?  Indeed there is, four tubes of Burt&#x27;s for $10 is a great deal!</li>
            <li> It is real good. It makes my lip more soft and smooth. It fits for the season of fall and winter. I use it every day before I go to bed. I like it very much. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Worth every penny. The peppermint might sting a little on extremely broken/chapped lips. Store it appropriately, since it comes with so many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie, and this is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and even though I&#x27;ve liked some other brands, nothing matches Burt&#x27;s Bees. It&#x27;s moisturizing, goes on without feeling sticky or thick, and lasts. It fixes my amazingly chapped lips, even in harsh weather. The mintiness is refreshing and soothing. I also like that it&#x27;s all-natural, since I use a lot of chapstick and want to minimize chemical intake where I can.   I&#x27;ve also tried the other flavors, and while they&#x27;re generally good, nothing beats the original. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has coconut oil in it. The balms that I have tried that are almost all coconut oil get too soft in the summer and too hard in the winter. It is cheaper to buy the four pack at Amazon than to buy them at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm.  You can feel it going to work as soon as you apply it.  Amazon had a great deal as always on a multipack.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite day to day lip balm, and it is slightly different than most.  The texture is thicker and pastier feeling than most of its competitors.  It goes on smooth and you definitely feel like you are adding a layer of protection.  It&#x27;s minty flavor is by far my favorite part about this particular lip balm and none other on the market are quite like it.    For wind protection I feel that you can&#x27;t do much better than Burt&#x27;s.  It goes on thicker feeling than any other over the counter lip balm and I feel like it lasts for quite a while.  I find it very good for winter use and prolonged wind exposure.    With that said, I do not see any SPF rating so I&#x27;m not sure it offers any sun protection.  While I haven&#x27;t tried it in the sun yet, I don&#x27;t plan to.  I will stick with brands that show some sun protection for that.  Also, it does not seem to help heal chapped lips any faster than other brands but definitely soothes them.    All in all Burt&#x27;s Bees is a great product that I would recommend.  In my opinion nothing is quite like it for wind protection and it is a good all around lip balm.  The only thing lacking is substantial sun protection but other than that this product is a must have.</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona, the weather is dry and so therefore are my lips.  Years after years of chapped lips and applying chapstick a thousand times a day just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  I finally splurged on buying chapstick when I bought Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I had never spent over $1 on any chapstick - I just didn&#x27;t&#x27; understand why people did.  Now I do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment you try this, your lips feel refreshed, you can even feel them tingle as the product does its magic.  Not only that, but I only put this on NO MORE than 2 times a day!  Because of the amazing ingredients and results, this small tube lasts me months.  I use to go through a tube of normal chapstick once a week.  While this is a bit more than your normal brands, it is worth it!  I PROMISE you will never try another chapstick once you try this!!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees! I&#x27;m yet to find a better lip balm! Save a little $ and buy it on Amazon if you use it often.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I had an allergic reaction to one of the lip balms I tried. I tried several different brands after that, all with the same result. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was allergic to. I finally tried Burt&#x27;s Bees after reading on the website how it was all natural. This was my last resort and I was so glad that I didn&#x27;t react to it! I love having lip balm on my lips before I go to sleep and Burt&#x27;s Bees does an amazing job of hydrating my lips and keeping them feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;The price is definitey worth it. This lip balm lasts a while and it doesn&#x27;t color your lips at all.</li>
            <li> I switched from a major brand to Burt&#x27;s Bees over 10 years ago and have never looked back.  Best stuff ever!  I feel like, with the Burt&#x27;s Bees, I actually use less (reapply less often) than when I used to with the old stuff.  Try it.  The extra cost is well worth it!  Your lips are worth it!</li>
            <li> Happened on to this product when I was out on the California desert. Was having a big problem with the most popular brand and decided I needed a change. I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff. A bit of a tingle, great smell, and no negative reaction from my lips. I find that I don&#x27;t use it as often as the more popular brand as it seems to be a denser covering (Hey? Bees Wax is better? Imagine!). Not cheep stuff but good for the lips and good to smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for a long time now and I think they are awesome stuff. I persistently have dry lips because I lick them a lot and they generally seem dry, so I&#x27;m always applying lip balm. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands and I&#x27;ve found that Burt&#x27;s Bees is superior to all of the other brands. The only other brand that I like is Natural Ice. I buy them on amazon because it is always cheaper although I sometimes forget to reorder when I&#x27;m nearing the end on my last stick so it&#x27;s always a struggle when I have to go a few days without chapstick. I think they used to be on Subscribe and Save, but not anymore, which is a shame.</li>
            <li> Burts bees lip balm line is the only stuff i buy. Im a guy so i like the peppermint instead of something fruity that might give a colored tinge to your lips. its also very thick so it stays on better than any other brand ive tried.</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry environment, and the dry, cold weather combined with indoor heating wrecked havoc on my skin.  My lips began to severely peel and crack.  Based on the positive reviews and the Burt&#x27;s Bees reputation, I bought this product.  However, after almost two weeks of liberally and repeatedly applying, it did nothing to relieve my dry lips.  I switched to Blistex Complete Moisture, and my lip problems began healing overnight and were completely repaired within 48 hours.  I think the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm may be a good product for maintaining and protecting healthy lips, but if you have severe dryness and cracking, there are better repairing products out there.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  I use to use chapstick, but it started giving me skin irritation.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems since using Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It stays on for a really long time, and I enjoy the slight peppermint kick it has.</li>
            <li> Great!  Always quality.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is so MUCH better than chapstick. I&#x27;ve had dry lips forever. I live in the southwest in a dry climate and my lips constantly peeled with chapstick. It took about 2 weeks of always using Burts and then my lips stopped peeling. This is a miracle for me so I use it all the time. It goes over your lipstick with no problem. Do yourself a favor and buy some. You won&#x27;t believe how perfect it is.</li>
            <li> Best Chapstick ever! Minty and smooth.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is definitely more expensive than other brands of lip balm, but I find it to be worth it. I live in Ithaca where it can get brutally cold and the beeswax in the product is great for keeping the moisture in your lips.     I used Blistex (the cream, the roll-on and the standard lip balm) and regular, old Chapstick (all different kinds of standard lip balm) and I find Burt&#x27;s Bees to not only be the best tasting and smelling, but also the most useful. I don&#x27;t recommend any of the other flavors, however. Their scents and tastes can be a little too strong and often taste like they&#x27;re laden with chemicals, the opposite of Burt&#x27;s Bees \\&quot;green\\&quot; or natural approach to their products.</li>
            <li> Leaves lips smooth and moisturized. Smells of tea tree oil. Not an oily residue. No bitter taste. Wonderful item! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for over ten years. This is the only chapstick that works for me. You can never have too much of it either. I have tubes all over my house, just in case.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I never had. love that cool felling on my lips! Love it! Thanks to me, right now all of my family member use it. Burt&#x27;s Bees should send me some free stuff because I help them promote it for them!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year. I used to use Medicated Chapstick and regular Chapstick, but they made my lips feather. Like when my lips were dry and the skin was coming off, it just kept coming off more. From the moment I put on Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm it felt like some oil was penetrating deep into my body (lips). It happily feels like it connects the layers of skin on my lips to each other into a unified whole. It works with you to help your whole body work together (who would be happy at all with chapped lips?).   When I use this product I get looks that say, \\&quot;Wow she has great lips, I wonder what she puts on them?\\&quot;   It makes my lips shiny, full, and really really healthy-looking.     The types I have purchased are the mint kind and the clove kind. I was surprised at how INTENSELY strong the smells are. The mint seems slightly stinging, but since I know it is taking care of my body I like it anyway. The clove is super strong, but hey, its fun for a change.     I recommend these to anyone. Young children might find the smells too strong in a chapstick of the kinds that I have tried yet.     Thank you to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I really love this chapstick. It feels nice and smooth and I love the tingling you get from the peppermint but it dries out my lips like crazy. Even if my lips aren&#x27;t chapped or dry to begin with, putting this on will ensure chapped lips within the next few hours. I&#x27;ve used this for years on and off because I love the peppermint THAT much but I&#x27;m finally giving it up because I can&#x27;t deal with having cracked lips just because I like when my lips tingle</li>
            <li> this is my favorite lip balm. it is an all natural balm which is important bc only natural ones actually moisturize the lips. products like Chapstick don&#x27;t work bc they&#x27;re basically just petroleum jelly which doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it just coats the lips and you find yourself constantly reapplying.</li>
            <li> I always keep a tube of Burts Bees lip balm in my purse. It makes my lips feel softer. I know it is a safe product. I Love my BB!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It goes on smooth and is long lasting. It keeps my lips soft and wears well under most lip glosses. I like the tingling from the peppermint but it might be too strong for those who have sensitive skin or are probe to irritation.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s is awesome. Every time you use it you get a minty, tingly feeling on your lips that feels fantastic. Burt&#x27;s turned me into one of those compulsive chapstick people, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite out there! I can&#x27;t use other lipbalms anymore. Smell and the cool burn you get once put this on a lip is such an addiciton.</li>
            <li> It feels great on the lips and stays on longer than most other brands.  That fact that it is all natural makes it all the better.</li>
            <li> My husband, my eight kids and I all love Burts Bees.  We were huge fans even before it went mainstream and hit places like Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Burts, my husband was a Blistex fan.  He has a thing for the &#x27;burn&#x27;!  But he never got the same theraputic relief that he gets now.  The kids use it on a regular basis when the North Dakota winters get especially cold and dry.  We never have to worry about the extreme cracking.  And we are avid outdoors people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrances, I love the original, my husband loves the clove, and the kids use whatever is available.  I have even spulged on the tinted and been very happy.</li>
            <li> This is a good lip balm: protective and long lasting.  But 3 times more expensive than Chapstick for the same amount of product?.....I think not. But it has a serious flaw: something in all those \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients (maybe the peppermint) is irritating to the eyes. If you apply some Burt&#x27;s Bees then touch your lips, you better not inadvertently rub your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees. Five stars is not a high enough rating for this product. I have been using it for well over a decade. Prior, I was a Carmex user. Doesn&#x27;t even compare to Burt&#x27;s. Once you start using Burt&#x27;s Bees, nothing will ever compare. The only regret that you will have after using this will be your new addiction to Burt&#x27;s Bees. I will say, my love for Burt&#x27;s Bees declined slightly after watching Burt&#x27;s Buzz documentary. However, I will continue to use and enjoy this lip balm because there is nothing that compares.</li>
            <li> great, as always.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lipbalms.  This works great for chapped lips and doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT all natural.  A friend who has an allergy to zinc just tried Burts and had a terrible allergic reaction.  After putting it on, her lips swelled up, turned red from a rash and burned terribly.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the menthol that did it, but I consider this product falsely advertised!</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Burts Bees for every one of my 21 years. My mother was a Burts Bees devotee even before I was born and I have been one as well since the day I was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: A lovely tingly feeling upon application, full coverage that lasts, a pleasant lack of strong odor or flavor (I hate strong smelling or tasting chapsticks, a lovely (and distinctive) yellow tube that is easy to find in any purse, consistently a good product, survives hours or days in my car in the heat without leaking or becoming absolute goop (just pop it into the freezer for a bit before using it if necessary&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: Truly none in my opinion. Maybe a dependency on it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to chapstick. There are several things I am never without: eye drops (LASIK), Camelbak (hydration is key), and chapstick--always Burts Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other chapsticks over the years. Sure, the others suffice when necessary, but despite the admittedly expensive (for a chapstick) cost of Burts Bees, I simply cannot live without it. I&#x27;ve tried EOS (love the Sweet Mint), SoftLips, and more. They&#x27;re lovely, but they&#x27;re not Burts. I always return to Burts, compare every chapstick to Burts, and find them all inferior to Burts. Call me a Burts Bees Devotee as well, because I won&#x27;t change my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have cautioned against using too much chapstick and stopping your lips from creating their own balm...blahblahblah. True or not, I don&#x27;t care. I love Burts. If my \\&quot;dependency\\&quot; is already here, then why the heck would I stop using it? Fact is, the weather changes. Even if my lips create their own moisture, they&#x27;ll still have a lag time between harsh changes in climate. We travel home often, changing the climate and chapping our lips. As state above, I simply don&#x27;t care. If chapstick is my only vice, then so be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees is truly wonderful. The tingly sensation has gone away at times, but I am still in love. No other product comes close. Perhaps I&#x27;m biased from birth, but please, do yourself a favor and give it a try. Spending the $ on Burts Bees is a small drop of water in the long run. If you don&#x27;t like it, it won&#x27;t break the bank. If you do, it was money well spent. The chance that this product is as amazing for you as it is for me is worth the risk. If you have several leftover when you&#x27;ve decided against it for yourself, include them as stocking stuffers for family or friends.other product comes close.

            <li> Did you know that most commercial lip balms actually CHAP your lips so you have to use more? Well I decided to try Burt&#x27;s and I am super happy.  I don&#x27;t have ot use as much, and am no longer addicted to lip balm.  Plus on amazon the price is right!</li>
            <li> I need lip balm at my immediate disposal - in my car, purse, desk, bathroom, sock drawer...you get the idea.  I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm five or six years ago and was hooked.  While I&#x27;ve tried other balms, none has been able to the original peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees balm.  This balm is hydrating and smoothly applied. While I have met others that find this balm to leave a burning sensation, I find the balm to be fresh and cooling.  I don&#x27;t find it to be overly scented, just a slight peppermint aroma.  The one issue I have with this product is its packaging.  It is a #7 plastic, which most communities do not recycle.</li>
            <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips. Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year. My fiance on the other hand, suffers from severe dry/chapped lips and usually goes through several sticks a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands. So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date. As I mentioned before in my past reviews, buying anything with an expiration date online sometimes becomes a concern for me simply because you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re buying is something that&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for months (or years) after the expiration date. I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company that my item was *SOLD FROM*. Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper. Looking at the Burt&#x27;s Bees balms I have received, I immediately started searching for a date and saw the stamp \\&quot;3221101\\&quot; on all my lip balms. So any consumer, especially me would have thought that maybe 32211 &#x3D; March 22, 2011. But is this an expiration date or a manufacturered date? I started doing some investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Burt&#x27;s Bees corporate page, it is stated that there is a shelf life (due to natural ingredients) but they are unable to provide an expiration date. However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date. Further explanation shows that the number stamp I see on my lip balms is actually a lot code that consists of the date it was manufactured and the last 2 digits being the lot code. HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year. So my number of 3221101 is actually:&lt;br /&gt; 322 Julian Date (actually November 18th in Gregorian)&lt;br /&gt; 11 &#x3D; 2011&lt;br /&gt; 01 &#x3D; Batch Number&lt;br /&gt;So based on their explanation, my tubes were made on Nov 18, 2011 and will last until Nov 18, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax vs Petroleum: This is an ongoing debate that has advocates for each side. The effects of each are the same (helps moisturize/seal moisture) on your lips. But there are some people who refuse to use Petroleum-based lip balms (Chapstick/Blistex) on their lips due to the fact that it&#x27;s made from petroleum (same stuff as gasoline comes from) and some say that can cause cancer. On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects. But since there is the danger of the honeybees declining in population, it may not be around forever and in turn, is usually more expensive than petroleum based lip balms. As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Around here in Nashville, TN, Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is over $3 per stick + tax. Compared to the .99 cent generic petroleum-based lip balms or $1.29 for a brand name like Chapstick, it&#x27;s no wonder why you would reach for the $1.29 option. However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for $10.83. The end price per stick is $2.71, so you save over 30 cents. So if you&#x27;re looking to save money and like Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, just buy it from Amazon unless you can get it cheaper locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!d and the last 2 digits being the lot code.

            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees is a classic choice for simple people looking for a quality product. Burt&#x27;s bees is great for fair skinned people looking for natural and accessible chap sticks.</li>
            <li> I admit it. I am a lip balm junkie. I cannot live without one and I use it several times a day. I have tried a ridiculous amount of lip balms and this one might be the best of the lot. It&#x27;s not greasy, does a great job and I love the tingling sensation! Of course if you hate peppermint, stay away from it!</li>
            <li> I have tried the entire line of Burts Bees lip balms...this is buy far my favorite. I gave this as Christmas gifts and it was appreciated by all.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that this is the best place on the net I have found to buy this product.  Cheapest by far!  As far as Burt&#x27;s Bees is concerned as a product my wife loves it and buys the stuff all the time.  So when I found it this cheap on Amazon I was super happy!  If you are trying to find the cheapest place to buy this product look no further!</li>
            <li> Bought as stocking stuffers. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> After using them for years, several kinds of lip balms started making my lips feel chapped/burned.&lt;br /&gt;I saw that these contained sunscreen (SPF). Only my Burt&#x27;s Bees Nourishing Lip Balm with Mango butter did not cause a reaction. It has no sunscreen in it. I threw away all my balms containing sunscreen and bought a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Classic to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, when I put it on my lips they started to tingle and burn, Ow! This time the cause was not sunscreen but apparently peppermint oil in Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Classic&#x27; formula. My lips were far from soothed; they felt chapped, tingly and uncomfortable. The packaging did not say the lip balms were peppermint but it was in the fine print on the on the back amidst the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I&#x27;ll be careful to avoid lip balms containing mint as well as sunscreen. I do like  Burt&#x27;s Bees Nourishing Lip Balm with Mango butter, which does soothe my lips.  Update Feb 2014: My new favorite flavor is Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Rejuvenating&#x27; lip balm with Acai Berry. :-)</li>
            <li> The wife uses lip balm at night, and decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees because of the natural ingredients used (bees wax, lanolin, various vegetable and fruit oils, and etc.), and their good reputation.  She has used a lot of the other popular brands that are made with other ingredients (petroleum gel, chemicals, and etc.), and been fine with them.  This particular balm has a light peppermint flavor added, and thankfully not a lot.  She is still getting used to the properties of the product, as the other brands are more slick/slippery on the lips.  She&#x27;s not giving up, and will continue to apply this very natural product, knowing that it probably better for her health than the others!</li>
            <li> Completely worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;I cost a little more because of the shipping but I would definitelly buy one of this packages again!</li>
            <li> I admit it. I am hopelessly addicted to this product. I have one in every purse and pocket. I really suffered from dry lips. This solved it!</li>
            <li> I used to love this lip balm. But Clorox bought out Burts Bees and the 1st thing they did was change the formulas on all the BB&#x27;s products. They are no longer truly natural. they are using cheaper oils. They now add Limonene to the lip balm which is a degreasing agent. This will actually make your lips drier.</li>
            <li> My mom introduced this to me 6 years ago when I was pregnant and stuck in the hospital for a couple weeks due to preterm labor issues, and the dry hospital air made my lips so chapped. I loved it right away. Now I am pregnant again and having dry lips so I got this awesome lip balm. Love it, the consistency and the mint, also it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm for about 6 years now. After going through just about everything else on the market and getting nothing but seriously dried out lips, I decided to give Burt&#x27;s a try. Burt&#x27;s is the only balm that doesn&#x27;t create for me a \\&quot;dependency\\&quot; on the balm to keep my lips moisturized. With all the other balms, if I ran out of the product or if I didn&#x27;t have them with me to re-apply immediately, my lips would be in terrible shape within a day or two. With Burt&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t have to constantly re-apply the balm. I can even go a few days to a week without it before I need to run out and grab more. I believe this helps nourish my lips on a deeper level. As long as Burt&#x27;s is available to me, I will ONLY be using Burt&#x27;s. Previous reviewers nailed it - once you go Burt&#x27;s, you never go back!</li>
            <li> A nice minty smell. I can&#x27;t say much because I&#x27;ve only used them twice but il when I put it on it seems to...stiffen...kinda, my lips. But that may be normal Chapstick because I normally don&#x27;t wear any.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because it is my husbands favorite lip balm. Great smell, protects lips and is 100% natural. First picked it up at Cracker Barrel. Now I buy it on Amazon because of the great price. Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> One of our adult children uses this all the time and requested it for Christmas.  One way you know they like it is they give you one in return the following Christmas.  And she&#x27;s right -- it is &#x27;good stuff&#x27;.  I now keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> A few years ago a female friend turned me on to Burt&#x27;s Bees and I have been unable to use any lip balm since. I just ordered 8 sticks online because I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores. There is something about that beeswax on your lips that feels so good.</li>
            <li> Everybody knows how awesome this product is, so I won&#x27;t waste my time describing it.  Believe me.  BEST chap stick ever.  ADDICTiVE!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! I do not use anything else. It is non greasy and the peppermint instantly cools irritated lips. It is unique in that it does not just sit on your lips like most lip balms it actually penetrates and heals. It is really good for dry cracked winter lips within the next day my lips are back to being soft and smooth. Hands down the BEST lip balm available.</li>
            <li> This is a Wonderful lip balm.  It is not slippery and really hydrates through the cold colorado winter and beyond</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Chapstick to mousturize and help my crackly lips (during summer and fall) so I got this. It sucked the first time I applied it. My lips were burning after I put it on. It&#x27;s not like I am sensitive. It&#x27;s just the Chapstick burning my lips. I thought it would be better because ITS SO EXPENSIVE. It did nothing. Don&#x27;t reccomend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to regular chapstick...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s the only lip balm I can use without my lips swelling up :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Arrived in a small envelope with the 4 tubes of lip balm. Happy and satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm, great price!  What more could you ask for?  I think everyone loves this stuff (minty!) and the three pack is a really good deal.  It&#x27;s good to stock up for the winter.</li>
            <li> By far the best chapstick out there. This is the only one that I feel works instantly. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet try it...</li>
            <li> But living at altitude over 10,000 ft in Colorado this winter, relative humidity hovering around zero, my lips have never been more chapped. When I reached the point of being unable to smile, something had to be done - so I bought my first thing of lip balm, ever. I have to use it and hand creme a few times a day, but the difference is amazing. The stuff has gotten me back to feeling better than normal, and smells great to boot. I can&#x27;t see why someone would buy one of the popular petroleum based sticks over this, beeswax and peppermint oil sound a lot better to me. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I’ve never gotten anything from them I didn’t like but me nephew can’t live without this stuff. It does have a nice peppermint tingly feeling on your lips.</li>
            <li> Keeps your mouth soft and healtihy...</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick. It&#x27;s thick and stays on well. It tastes and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips are addicted. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I won&#x27;t be without it. I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and appreciate the quality.  Easy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. Personally, I&#x27;ve never used it but she really like the way it protects e her lips from the elements here in south Texas. She never leaves home without it. One caveat; don&#x27;t leave it in a hot car all day...</li>
            <li> I love burts bees. It is by far the most soothing lip balm I have ever used. I found the packaging to be a little sketchy though. You simply get four sticks in a ziplock baggie. Luckily, the sticks are sealed, so its not really a huge concern.</li>
            <li> Best and longest lasting lip balm I&#x27;ve used. The beeswax gives this product a waxy consistency, which helps its to stay on longer and apply easier. Many lip balms tend to be greasy and oily, and only form a greasy film that disappears quickly. This stays on much longer and applies better. The peppermint provides a cool sensation that lasts for a few minutes and is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note of caution, only use this line of burt&#x27;s bees; their other lip balms don&#x27;t have beeswax, and are greasier and don&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> Pros: applies smoothly, smells good, pleasant peppermint tingle&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not as long-lasting as one might hope&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips were dry and cracked before using this lip balm and now they&#x27;re not. Since this item comes in a pack of 4, my roommates are also grateful for this product. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I need to have my Burt&#x27;s bees with me at all times. I mean that. The price here is ok, about the same as I get in the store. The quality is the same too. It&#x27;s an add-on item for sure.</li>
            <li> I chose Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm as a gift for my daughter. I personally love this lip balm and give it to my daughter every year as a gift.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is my all-time favorite! This is the classic, which is the best. Not really much to comment about otherwise.</li>
            <li> It feels good and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel more chapped after a few minutes.  It just lasts and lasts.  It&#x27;s very refreshing to put on and it&#x27;s great for men or women because it isnt glossy at all.  This is my forever chapstick for the rest of my life i will be using this kind.</li>
            <li> The Chapstick came quick and in great condition, however, this brand does not work best for me. It keeps my lips moisturized, but within an hour they feel much more chapped than before.</li>
            <li> In the title it says pack of FOUR.  I received three tubes.  AMAZON was nice enough to reimburse me $5.00 on my order so it was made right.</li>
            <li> I love the beeswax lip balm, it works better than any lip balm I have used.  Great for chapped lip any weather</li>
            <li> Ok product. Kind of waxy. Has a pleasant, neutral scent. Would recommend this to friends family. Bought more today for a gift.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than chapstick or blistex, but it&#x27;s SO MUCH BETTER.  But just this one, it MUST be the peppermint one.  It smells wonderful, feels wonderful, and STAYS ON.  I have tubes of this stuff all over the house, in my purse, desk, nightstand, everywhere.  I&#x27;ve tried the other types of burts bees lip balm, they&#x27;re ok but the peppermint one is GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! I tried them all and then decided to shell out an extra 50 cents to try Burt&#x27;s original. It has a cool, refreshing peppermint-ish kick that cools your lips and moisturizes. I will never go back or even bother tying any other kinds of lip balm now. This is indeed the best! Amazons under $10 for 4 is better than Walmart by a couple bucks so you might as well get them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t however, like any other of their varieties because they don&#x27;t refresh your lips anywhere near as well as the original formula does.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as described. Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Arrived on time with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm out there!&lt;br /&gt;  If you are looking for something that actually works, this is the stuff you need.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic but with as long as the shipping took to get here its easier to just grab a handful of these at the store. It didn&#x27;t really come as a pack of 4 it was just 4 tubes thrown in a shipping baggy. Not sure what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I own 15 different types of lip balm.  I may have a problem, and I may need help. But until then I&#x27;m going to keep using this like a drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin e &amp; peppermint from Burt&#x27;s Bees is hands down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s minty, and it has THAT TINGLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels good, works well, what more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIX out of FIVE stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only one I use that does not irritate my lips. I tried chap stick, vaseline &amp; etc.,once when I didn&#x27;t have any  Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s they all chapped my lips, so I went back to my Burt&#x27;s and been using it for a long time, I will not switch again.</li>
            <li> my daughter couldn&#x27;t live without her burt&#x27;s bees lip balm. She says that it is the best. Keeps her lips from cracking in the winter  but makes her lips feel so smooth she uses it all year long.</li>
            <li> Very much like this peppermint scented lip balm! Has a cooling (due to the peppermint), soothing texture that protects well and leaves my lips feeling soft, moisturized and refreshed. Slightly thicker texture than Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing (Pomegranate) Lip Balm, but not as thick feeling as plain ChapStick. Untinted. Keeps my lips from being chapped, especially in cold or dry weather. Much prefer it over other brands. Good for everyday use, but slightly prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing (Pomegranate) Lip Balm at night. All natural, too. Not too expensive. Love it!</li>
            <li> When this first came out, it was a must have accessory at the time. But I found the peppermint in particular dries my lips insanely. My lips would be more chapped after application in about 30 minutes. Despite this I still used it habitually because of how soothing and amazing the minty flavor felt. So refreshing. But the resulting chapped lips are not worth it and I finally grew out of it. I use Vaseline now, just one use overnight and viola! My lips are repaired the next morning.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lip balm and this is the best price consistently that we have found. Each tube lasts about twice as long as chap-stick and does a much better job moisturizing and protecting.</li>
            <li> the chap stick itself was lumpy, i wont order again, i feel like im getting old or damaged goods</li>
            <li> My lips get very dry and irritated. Burt&#x27;s Bees solves this issue and it is always high quality. Great Product.</li>
            <li> Far better than any other lip balm I have used. I&#x27;ve always seen people use Burt&#x27;s Bees and since the brand has great reviews, I figured I would finally try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just using the lip balm once each day has drastically helped, and using it a couple times each day has been perfect.</li>
            <li> This Lip Balm last long and has a nice tingling sensation when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for YEARS, and it&#x27;s always been my go-to for lip care and always will be. It gives me lips a slight tingle, and I love it! I also don&#x27;t feel like I have to put it on a lot because it lasts. The scent is fresh smelling, and it keeps my lips moist for a long time. This is also what turned me to try more Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I&#x27;ve never been let down. If you&#x27;re going to try this lip balm for the first time, no need to worry about taking a risk...it will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Love my Burt&#x27;s Bees, and this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I used to us this over chapstick brand except when I&#x27;m in the sun and need SPF. They should add some SPF! I use Carmex now which is great and includes SPF so I can wear year round.</li>
            <li> this is the best lip balm.  quality ingredients and highly effective.  i buy them individually in the store, but when i saw them here for this price i figured i&#x27;d try this seller.   very pleased.</li>
            <li> The best to take care of your lips, you do not feel like wax, and repairs everything, you could use it as a lip stick if you want.</li>
            <li> For me this is the best lip balm on the market.  I buy this constantly over any others.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I always have one of these in my pocket. And when I say always, that&#x27;s not an exaggeration. If I leave the house and forget &amp;#34;my Burts Bees,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the first thing I notice; it ruins my day; and I pout until I get back to a tube of it. Devotees will know the truth when I say that I&#x27;ve never finished one of these without having the sticker peel off (every month ends with a plain yellow tube). Call me an addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other chapsticks, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it isn&#x27;t slimy, it isn&#x27;t smeary - in short, it isn&#x27;t gross. It&#x27;s the kind of &amp;#34;better mousetrap&amp;#34; that, once you use it, you simply can&#x27;t go back (I tried, once, to revert to the Big Brand of this stuff, thinking I was misremembering how bad it was. Big mistake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a complaint, it would be that sometimes a batch seems to get a hearty extra splash of the peppermint oil. 19 tubes out of 20 are fine, but every once in a while you come across one so potent and pungent that the fumes will make your eyes water and people will smell it from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t care. Nothing else (that I&#x27;ve tried anyway) works this well. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff can&#x27;t keep enough in stock for me. It love my lips. I do a sugar scrub and place this on my lips and viola it is good all day</li>
            <li> Nothing heals like burts bees.  I&#x27;ve tried others, and been dissapointed with the results.  This works every time, and heals your lips really quick.  The cooling peppermint feels great, and it stays on w/o being tacky or slimy.  I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> All the other flavored Burt&#x27;s Bees chap-sticks are new and do NOT work as well as this original.  Unfortunately I cannot find this one in the stores anymore.  I am so glad to find it on Amazon and so I buy it in bulk.  Too bad Burt&#x27;s Bees, aka Johnson and Johnson, are promoting the crappy flavored junk instead of the quality original product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s for over 10 years and it is just hands down the absolute best lip balm!  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if it ever stopped being made.  This is one of my &amp;#34;deserted on an island&amp;#34; products that I would need to have with me :)</li>
            <li> While I love burts bees and all of its minty glory, the picture for the product is deceiving.  The picture and description both claim that the chapsticks are peppermint flavored, but all four of the tubes I got were just regular Burt&#x27;s Bees, which is still minty enough I guess.  As far as the chapstick goes though, 5/5.  But since I received a different product than the one pictured I&#x27;ll give it a 3.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s why did you quit making the clove oil lip balm?  It was by far your best.  This one has peppermint oil and makes a decent second choice.  I like the menthol feeling of the clove and the peppermint.  It is oily enough to feel smooth and good, not waxy like some chapstick prodcuts. So ... for now, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really like the minty flavor of this lip balm.  It is refreshing and healthier to use on lips than products with all kinds of chemicals in it!  I highly recommend giving it a try!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Beeswax lip balm for about a decade now and I&#x27;ve always loved it. It tastes, smells, and feels great on my lips. I&#x27;ve tried the other variations of their lip balm such as the lifeguard and pomegranate variety but just didn&#x27;t enjoy them as much. The lifeguard type leaves an icky white coating on your lips, and the pomegranate one stains them a bit red - a bit too feminine for me. So I&#x27;ve come back to the original and I&#x27;ll probably stick with it for awhile. The menthol instantly sooths my dry lips while the beeswax and oils leave my lips feeling soft and moisturized. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, you should.    Pros:  Minty  Leaves lips soft and moisturized  Smells good    Cons:  Kind of pricey    Bottom line: There&#x27;s a reason people swear by this stuff. Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed with burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s lip balm, so this was a great stocking stuffer for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> I admit, I am a Burt&#x27;s Bees addict. If I go too long (20 minutes? 1 hour?) without applying it, my lips are screaming out for the pepperminty goodness. Burt&#x27;s Bees is also the only lip balm that I feel like penetrates and sinks in to moisturize my lips fully. Buying one tube is never cost effective (and I need 1 for my purse, desk, nightstand, purse) so this is a great price as well!</li>
            <li> I do like the natural ingredients and &amp;#34;eucalyptus tingle&amp;#34; that this provides. I&#x27;m a guy, so I don&#x27;t like fruity flavours, and I don&#x27;t like overly greasy petroleum-based stuff like a generic Labello chapstick. But I don&#x27;t think BB hit the happy medium with this one. It&#x27;s just too dang sticky/waxy. It just drags across your lips and you really have to force it across your lips and mash them together several times to even feel like they&#x27;re covered/lubricated. I really have to press down hard and force it on slowly, several times, which I&#x27;m sure just wastes product, in order to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bee Beeswax Lip Balm in Peony and I love it! It makes my lips so soft! The color is great. The minty taste is an awesome plus. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. So much better than other high priced lipsticks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of chapstick, and this is by far the best. I will never use another brand, EVER.</li>
            <li> Used to have pretty chopped lips so I decided to try this. The item came right on time and it had four tubes in a small plastic bag. First time I tried it,I immediately noticed the tingly/minty feel of it when you put it on. It leaves no residue whatsoever and I feel my lips are healing quickly. I used it couple of times and noticed a huge difference in a way my lips feel.I love this little thing. Probably will order more when I run out.  I don&#x27;t usually use lip balm. In fact, this is a first lip balm I ever tried, and I ain&#x27;t going back. Again, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Best Chapstick ever made!!! I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I thought this was the regular, honey-flavored balm, so I bought 4. These are peppermint-flavored, and though pleasant, my lips are not as soothed, and they become chapped. With the honey, all the chapped areas heal and stay smooth. I don&#x27;t have to apply the honey as frequently, either.&lt;br /&gt;This still is far better than other chapsticks. I wish Burt&#x27;s Bees had a honey with some SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I also am crazy about the tinted ones. Why they come in the HUGE cardboard tube (wasteful) and then have no information on the tube is beyond me. But the tint is subtle and stays on way longer than other lipsticks. Not flavored at all.</li>
            <li> It works fine. Shea butter works better</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a good price. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to be obsessed with the minty Burt&#x27;s Bees tingle and always had many tubes of this stuff on hand. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms and found that this is one of the least hydrating that they produce. My lips are very dry and this balm just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. Sometimes the mint tingle is nice, other times it is almost irritating to my lips and leaves them feeling dried out. I am a HUGE Burt&#x27;s Bees fan, but this balm is one of my least favorite in their line.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this stuff! I use it all the time - even keep one next to my bed in case my lips get dry during the night. I LOVE the smell and find that it actually helps clear my sinuses (I often have sinusitis) and I prefer using this to constantly using/smelling like Vick&#x27;s VapoRub (although that stuff&#x27;s wonderful too, I don&#x27;t want to perpetually smell of menthol, y&#x27;know?)</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not tinted and that I can use it without looking gay. It really soothes my cracked lips and I like the cool, tingling sensation very much.</li>
            <li> This was a great value and the lip balm itself is wonderful.  Has almost a minty scent to it and provides good long lasting coverage on my lips.</li>
            <li> by far the best lip balm on the market.  i refuse to use anything else</li>
            <li> This product is actually HELPFUL to your lips instead of chapstick which dries your lips out over time. This 4-pack is a very good deal seeing as how most retailers sell them for $2.99-$3.29 each!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm out there....and its made in Durham, NC where I&#x27;m from! Whats not to love?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like peppermint on my lips. It makes me want to lick my lips especially when I am hungry. want something less noticeable. However,you can apply this to the surface of the eyelid to keep you awake when driving a car or listening to boring stuff.</li>
            <li> usually I have this balm in winter to keep my lip wet. I like the scent and the flavor, definately keep one in winter!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price. I am obsessed with Burt&#x27;s Bees Chapstick, so this 4 pack really saves the money and time (the time from going to the store because you ran out or lost your chapstick!)</li>
            <li> The only lip balm that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing lip-gloss all the time. Yes, I&#x27;m a dude and I don&#x27;t want my lips to shine and glitter. Burt&#x27;s bees has something, I don&#x27;t know what it is, but something that, like, absorbs into your lips and do exactly what it needs to do. Before I used to apply balms every 2 hours, now, hardly twice day. The mint is an added bonus! Recommended for anyone with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> My lips get pretty dry in the winter, but Burt&#x27;s Bees has been a life saver.  I love the peppermint flavor since it&#x27;s noticeable, but not overpowering.  It leaves my lips feeling good and lasts quite a while compared to other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The value in this product is enough for me to pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from a very wet climate to a very dry one. Burt&#x27;s Bees is the only thing that keeps me from chapping.</li>
            <li> I used to use carmex exclusively, but when I learned the nastiness of petrolatum products, I tried so many natural lip balms but this one is the only one I truly love.  It&#x27;s not too oily and thin feeling on the lips and has a nice strong peppermint tingle.</li>
            <li> i have used many other products before i setteled with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I had relatively flaky lips before i used this product but once i starte dusing it, my lips have become so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that i wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my lips moisturized in the dry heat. My face greatly enjoys the cool tingle of the bees.</li>
            <li> After use effect is very good, satisfied!But when after transportation, please note, because sent the lid of one of the broken, is not very convenient!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands and this is the one that works for me best. It&#x27;s more expensive that the regular brands which you can find in any gas station or corner grocery store but is worth the extra coin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know I was buying the mint version.  It will work but not thrilled with product.  It should have been more apparent.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms in many different flavors, with one of my favorites being the Mango Butter - that is, until now. The peppermint lip balm goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, gunky or sticky at all. It is light and smells divine, if you like peppermint. This lip balm holds up for me through heat, wind, cold and sun. I pop on some of the sunscreen lip balm from Bert&#x27;s Bees and then apply this over it and am ready to go, my lips don&#x27;t get dry or chapped like they used too. My lips used to get so bad that they would flake and crack, but this has gotten rid of that problem for me. The tingle you get from it on your lips is refreshing, as it cools your lips as well. I can put it on before bed and wake up with ultra soft, smooth lips. Any other product I would use I would wake up with dry, chapped lips or gunky, sticky lips. The peppermint lip balm also leaves a subtle yet somewhat noticeable plumpness to my lips after using, and has a shiny but not over done gloss to it after application. This is by far the best lip balm I have found, and I am never going back to anything else. Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Great product. I ordered beeswax but somehow I feel peppermint in it. I later found another burt&#x27;s bees lip balm has peppermint. I don&#x27;t know if the original beeswax is supposed to give a fresh feeling like peppermint or the one has peppermint giving a stronger taste of peppermint. However, burt&#x27;s bee is still the best lip balm I&#x27;ve used. The price on amazon is a good deal. Will probably try a different flavor next time.</li>
            <li> Only chap stick I use. I&#x27;d rather have chapped lips than use some other brand- only one that provides relief for me.</li>
            <li> The quality is good.I love this Mint flavor. Always use.At the same time, I also give my children in this, she also likes.</li>
            <li> Love me some Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Really like this minty lip balm.</li>
            <li> Only lip balm I buy.  I have tried them all.  Lip smack addict here.</li>
            <li> I am now becoming obsessed with this lip balm.  I was a die hard Carmex girl.  I have since switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees because it has a more refreshing feel.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax lip balm is wonderful, it&#x27;s like heaven in a tube for your lips. I started out by using their lip balm with pomegranate oil and then the acai berry which are both great products however, the original takes the cake. I&#x27;m a college student that goes to school in west central rural Minnesota and I have a graveyard of chopsticks/lip balms. This one has worked the best, at least for me, in regards to the cold dry weather that we tend to deal with, especially the wind! It is a must have product, even if you&#x27;re on a budget plus they last long too if you can keep track of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm but in ever kind except the original. The original is kind of medicine/minty. They offer so many verities of lip balm. For example, they have grapefruit, honey, and pomegranate, all excellent lip balms, all but the original. Also, if you are a fan of the honey lip balm, be careful... The honey lip balm cap is just a few shades off from the original lip balm. It&#x27;s easy to get them mixed up.</li>
            <li> I have always been a big fan of Burt&#x27;s bees products the lip balm being my favorite.  Can never use too much</li>
            <li> Came in a ziploc bag big enough for 4 tubes. The dates are a little old in manufacturing, so, so far one of the tubes has broken up a little upon use. For freshest results, you&#x27;ll need to find a more recent manufacturing date. I&#x27;ll probably buy in-store in the future, for this reason.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much addicted to Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm (my family will attest). They know I ALWAYS have one with me. Ordering from Amazon when I&#x27;m running low is perfectly convenient.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a four pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm on Amazon.  I used this product all day and use it right before bed, every night.  It won&#x27;t take long before I need to order another pack.  The price is terrific and with free shipping too!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use when your lips are actually cut because it just irritates them.  Otherwise it is my holy grail.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put these on I could feel them work on my lips, and visually they improved right away!</li>
            <li> This is THE Best lip balm I have ever tried. although it costs twice as much as I can get Chap Stick for, it is worth it!  If you have never tried this product before then I highly encourage you to do so.  You won&#x27;t regret the additional cost.  The old adage does, and always will hold true...&amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of lip balms over the past 40 years and now this is a clear winner.  The taste, durability, and ingreients are deciding factors.  Nothing else compares in my book.</li>
            <li> My lips love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. I use this lip balm all the time and it really works!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I was suffering from severe chapped lips due to perioral dermatitis and this was the only thing that didn&#x27;t burn putting on.  It was the only thing that cleared my lips up and made them look normal again.  Has a nice cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Very good!!!! very good I love it. it works as good as i expected. impressive. I will come back again</li>
            <li> not until we started to go towards the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; path did we stop and thought about safe lip balms.  we are constantly ingesting the balm on our lips!  yuk on the un-green products.  we have tried all the flavors and brand as they come out and they keep your lips moisturized.  our favorite is this original balm.  wonderful tingling feel and eliminates the dry chapped feel very well while this one seems to stay on the longest without feeling coated nor too thin.</li>
            <li> I became allergic to it</li>
            <li> I love this chapstick and think it is the best stuff out there. I am glad I was able to buy it in bulk on amazon.</li>
            <li> I drive a shuttle bus at a university for 10 hours a day.  I also live in Texas where the sun if brutal, even in the winter.  I tried lots of different chap sticks and nothing would last more that a few minutes.  This lasts great.  I have one on my shirt pocket, one in my purse and numerous around the house.  I panic if I cant find one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice these were flavored. Prefer the basic original.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> This is far superior to any other lip balm!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm around. The peppermint is cooling and soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everyone. I found that my lips dried out more and had to reapply more frequently. It&#x27;s not bad but I found it annoying.</li>
            <li> It took time more than I thought.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other kind of chap stick EVAR. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, only the original though. All the others either have a strange texture, smell, or taste to me.</li>
            <li> You may not know this, but other lip balm coats your lips, but that coating actually makes your lips more dry because it doesn&#x27;t allow moisture back in. Burt&#x27;s Bees actually doesn&#x27;t do that. It was the only lip balm recommended to me by a doctor friend and I&#x27;ve loved using it. I don&#x27;t think I need to pitch this to anyone as most of us have heard of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I still can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees, it is the best Chapstick. The four pack was perfect because it is much cheaper than buying them individually.</li>
            <li> This lip balm protects well and leaves a cool feeling. Have been using it for years. I definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lip balm really does the job. It rubs and dries well without too much of a shine. It definitely helps my chapped lips and I feel good knowing that it&#x27;s natural, not petroleum.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas last year and is really great! Makes my lips soft and tingle with the Peppermint. Yummy! Try it...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite chapstick. It smells amazing and goes on smoothly. Keeps your lips soft. We keep a handful of these around the apartment at all times!</li>
            <li> The best, hands down. I will never use another lip balm.I have used Burts Bees for several years. I like the original flavor the best.</li>
            <li> We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry. Someone recommended this Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. It stays on your lips for awhile. The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home. If you apply it morning, noon and night, it should keep your lips from drying out and cracking if you&#x27;re in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to buy several at once. It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one. I don&#x27;t like to go a day without applying this, so don&#x27;t want to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural. You feel good using it.</li>
            <li> Love this chap stick!  so refreshing and heals lips immediately!  love the peppermint one!  Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Burts Bees original is the best I&#x27;ve found. My wife has always used burts and I finally got on board. I will not us anything else. I do not like the Burts 4 hour moisturizing lip balm however. It has a grey cap and I swear it takes all moisture OUT of my lips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for a few years and have no intention of trying anything else. I have started using other products made by Burt&#x27;s Bees and I just love them! All natural ingredients and wonderful scents.</li>
            <li> These are so expensive in the store, but buying them bulk here was a great way to still get quality but at a lesser price.</li>
            <li> It shows on their tracking system that I received this and I did NOT. Complete waste on $!!! This is unbelieveable!</li>
            <li> Good lip balm.  No petroleum so it&#x27;s better for you.</li>
            <li> I try to buy in bulk when I can because we use this everywhere. It is the best! Clean and tingly feeling. I hate using any other lip glass. Even my husband is addicted.</li>
            <li> Positively addicting. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried beats Burts Bees. Always have it on hand. This is a bargain compared to retail pricing.</li>
            <li> I love all products by Burt&#x27;s Bees and the lip balm is no exception.  Also, great price for a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> Growing up in Oregon Burt&#x27;s Bees was just part of your life. After moving to Arizona I had a very hard time finding any Burt&#x27;s Bees products. After find this good deal here it I made my mind up and bought a few sets. Shipping was fast and came in a nice package.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a minty flavor and fragrance, that stays with you long after you have put on the lip balm, you will like this. The texture is pleasing and stays on long after application. Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is truly effective in protecting your lips in harsh weather - summer or winter; and it works well in healing dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Solid stuff, here. Best chapstick around and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I think it keeps the lips moisturized better than other Burt&#x27;s Bees, too.</li>
            <li> quick to deliver and a good price!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm. It&#x27;s the only one we use in my house and we go through it so fast so finding it here on amazon cheaper was great. It heals lip quick.</li>
            <li> This is the only chapstick men should use. My girlfriend likes it too.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm. I discovered it years ago and now I buy many at a time. The peppermint gives your lips a tingly sensation. It moisturizes well and lasts a fairly long time before you need to reapply. It&#x27;s not super greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like a lot of other lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have them in many convenient places. I keep one in each car, one in the TV room, and one near my bed so I never have to go far to find relief when my lips are dry.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees, man. It is what it is. There is no other chap stick out there that comes close. Feels great, works like a charm. If you&#x27;ve only ever had crappy ChapStick brand, or Carmex, or Blistex generic stuff, you&#x27;re in for a treat with Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have used Burt&#x27;s Bee for the longest time and all their \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; but now they make my lips really dry within 30 minutes or so. Are they cutting corners or adding something in? Something must&#x27;ve changed because it is extremely annoying having to reapply so often! They probably want us to use up the chapstick as fast as possible with some kind of skin drying agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved onto Nivea Milk &amp; Honey and the difference was like when I had first used Burt&#x27;s Bee. Lasts longer and you wouldn&#x27;t have to reapply so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised people aren&#x27;t complaining about it. If you have to reapply your chapstick in less than 30 minutes, that&#x27;s NOT normal.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best lip balm. No flavor or color just the healing power of the lip balm. I always have one with me.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube is the best lip balm I have ever used. I brought some to China for friends. This product is high quality although the out is a little sticky because of the plastic adhesive tape.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lip balm/chapstick. I love peppermint. Makes my lips super soft and tastes great. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I can never go without my Burt&#x27;s.  It goes on with a slight minty tingle and then gets absorbed keeping my lips soft and supple.  Others don&#x27;t seem to last as long as Burt&#x27;s or are too mediciny.</li>
            <li> I have cracked skin on my fingers every winter, so bad that the joints bleed. Every other product in the multiverse either has a smell, feels greasy, or doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin. Every winter when my skin starts to crack I buy ONE tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm a year, and it heals the cracked skin instantly, feels waxy (but in a good way), has no smell, and stays put. REBRAND THIS AS HAND BALM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the peppermint Burt&#x27;s Bees balm on my lips for years.&lt;br /&gt;When other products would leave my lips chapped &amp; peeling, Burt&#x27;s healed them in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was then, this is now: Clorox currently owns Burt&#x27;s Bees product line - and something is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have went through 3 of these 4 tubes in the last couple of months and my lips are still red &amp; peeling.&lt;br /&gt;It is now MAY and my lips are still peeling when I use Burt&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to find something else.  I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lip balms and I&#x27;ve yet to find one as effective and pleasing to use as the classic Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. The taste and texture are superior to ChapStick and Blistex. This classic flavor is superior to the other Burt&#x27;s Bees flavors (pomegranate) in my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a negative with the product. I wish it didn&#x27;t melt in texas heat quite as easily, but that seems unavoidable given the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep several tubes at my house and some at my work, as my lips seem to chap easily.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick out there!</li>
            <li> after using a menthol based chapstick for a couple years, i ordered a pack of these and after a couple days of use my lips were back to normal. no more menthol for me</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is fantastic stuff. The number one thing for me is that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients and the hint of mint is outstanding</li>
            <li> The best lip balm for men or women. Both my girlfriend and I use this Burt&#x27;s Bees frequently. I couldn&#x27;t image using any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> I usually use the nourishing (orange top), but my husband loves mint. This is the original burts bees wax lip balm. If someone has never used Burts before, there is nothing else like it. And they sell different types for different needs and preferences.</li>
            <li> Have looked at this item from years.. bought it 10 mins back from Tom Thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its like Vicks Vaporub on my lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest the World&#x27;s best lip butter.. Himalaya Lip Butter..</li>
            <li> thanks for making it affordable@. we love burts bee, especially the chapstick. i think this is cheaper than 2.99 in the store!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-pepperminty tingliness&lt;br /&gt;-freshens your breath&lt;br /&gt;-natural&lt;br /&gt;-rather cheap if bought in bulk&lt;br /&gt;-good quality for the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-made my lips peel after a while&lt;br /&gt;-very hard to apply when it is cold, becomes rather lumpish and waxy&lt;br /&gt;-texture changes after you have been using for a couple of days&lt;br /&gt;-if you don&#x27;t wipe your mouth after eating, the color of the food transfers onto the balm (after I ate watermelon the stick turned bright orange)&lt;br /&gt;-build up on the rim of the plastic gets kind of gross after a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this lip balm for 1.5 years, and during that time it was my holy grail.  I would use up 1 stick of this stuff in about 3 weeks.  I would never leave the house without it, and it was just absolutely amazing.  The texture was perfect, and I really liked the smell and how the peppermint made my lips feel tingly.&lt;br /&gt;Recently however, I have realized that the skin above my upper lip is peeling, possibly because of this lip balm.  I used to never have this issue up until a couple months ago.  The balm does nothing to help the dry peeling skin, and now my mouth becomes slightly red whenever I apply this product.  I think that it might be a sensitivity to the peppermint oil, but I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;I am probably going to switch to another lip balm for a while (eos, it is 95% organic and I have used it before)to see if the peppermint oil is really the cause, or if it is just a preexisting skin condition&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give this product 3 stars, but this product just isn&#x27;t working so well for me anymore.</li>
            <li> I have one of these in almost every room of the house.  I love it.  I would never be without it.  It&#x27;s great stuff that lasts a long time with no funky ingredients.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of lip balms, but this is my all-time fave.</li>
            <li> This is about on-par with the price at our local Target store.  And I get the added bonus of not having to go there.  Or anywhere else.  The lip balm itself is great.  I work in a very dry environment, so I need something to keep my lips from chapping, but most products out there are female-oriented.  This stuff is great for males or females.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]After I apply this lip balm, it makes my lips much more dry. I would go back to chapstick again.</li>
            <li> I go through chapstick like crazy and this is a great deal. The four tubes are held together by a big white sticker, which does not come off when you unwrap them, leaving them really sticky and messy looking.</li>
            <li> will buy again this works grand. I use regularly as I have a chronic issue with my lips. also is safer for oxygen use which I use at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 15 years and it works great! I like the Burt&#x27;s bee product because they are natural.</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms. They keep your lips moisturized and it has that nice mint sensation on your lips too</li>
