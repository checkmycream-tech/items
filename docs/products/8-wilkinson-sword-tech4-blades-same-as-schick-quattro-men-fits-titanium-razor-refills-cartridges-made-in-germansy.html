            <li>Good blades.  </li>
            <li>Good price per unit.  </li>
            <li>Loved the Tech3 blades.  </li>
            <li>I use to use the Wilkerson twin blades and loved them  </li>
            <li>Found that I could get just as good a shave with them</li>
            <li>as good as others that cost twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Good blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades were $1.50 each, no tax, delivered to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Still a fabulous deal, great blades, and I will use again.</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>Even Bic disposable razor can do better than this.  </li>
            <li>They cut me a bit more than the shick quattro blades which never cut me.</li>
            <li>Will try to find more like this deal.</li>
            <li>Lasts many times longer than Gillette.</li>
            <li>Wish they sold a 16 or 24 pack for even greater savings.</li>
            <li>Much better than the name brand....</li>
            <li>Now I have a favorite razor :-)</li>
            <li>Wilkinson razors are equal in quality to the best names, but are a much better value.  </li>
            <li>A good economical blade.</li>
            <li>In case you buyers don&#x27;t know it, Wilkinson Sword makes some of the best blades around - they hold their sharpness and last.  </li>
            <li>AND at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I think they are better than the name brand.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but then the cost might be greater.</li>
            <li>Am very familiar with Wilkinson</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with them and will continue using them for as long as I can find them.</li>
            <li>Compared to Mach 4, they give a very close shave and best of all the cost per cartridge is in a reasonable ballpark figure.</li>
            <li>good  blades, for the money very satisfied with my  old man baby smooth face</li>
            <li>These blades are as good as the Schick brand at much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>The blades fit my razor fine; give close as well many shaves for the money.</li>
            <li>I found the Wilkinson Blades in Wal Mart, tried them, and liked them very much.  </li>
            <li>Somehow the original set I had originally bought along with the razor at Walmart was lot better.</li>
            <li>It almost appeared it was one of those cheap knock off&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34; on line as well.&lt;br /&gt;IF they were in stock, AND you got free delivery to store, the blades would be $1.21 each with my 8% California sales tax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The coating edge that smooth&#x27;s the glide of the blade breaks into clumps on the blade after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>they fit my Schick</li>
            <li>Wilkinson Tech4 Blades leave my face smooth without any irritation, nicks or stubble.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Was looking thru Amazon and noticed blades husband is happy with the find says the blades have a extremely long use LIFE.</li>
            <li>Clean Shave and blades</li>
            <li>I think they are quite an adequate replacement.</li>
            <li>Have used them after many years forgoten and found them near as good&#x27; if not equal to the Schick Quatro Pro Power blades.</li>
            <li>i have been using these, they are cheaper and work very well!!</li>
            <li>I liked the 3 blades a little better but can&#x27;t find them</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then the original</li>
            <li>as good as other name brand razors at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I have only used one of the cartridges so far, but the give as good  a shave as the brand name refills.</li>
            <li>The frame for the blades was reasonable in cost too!</li>
            <li>I like the idea of these razors, especially since they are much more affordable then others.</li>
            <li>Seems to be getting harder to find them, so I was thrilled to find them here</li>
            <li>the first cartridge fell apart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these several times and love them.</li>
            <li>as I could with the higher priced blades.  </li>
            <li>On my first blade, and can&#x27;t tell the difference versus the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li>you could always call them &amp;#34;Schick Quattro&amp;#34; and charge quadruple the price ;)</li>
            <li>My order was filled quickly and the razors were the same as those I had purchased from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are the best, smooth long lasting and 10 bucks less money.</li>
            <li>Unless I catch Quattros on a good sale, I&#x27;ll probably make the Wilkinsons my standard blade as long as the quality remains consistent.  </li>
            <li>As good of not better than Gillette and Schick.</li>
            <li>Excellent replacements for my Schick at less than half the cost.</li>
            <li>I can no longer find these blade locally, so this was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Saved a lot of looking for these blades - thanks for finding them for us.  </li>
            <li>Also I was credited for my whole order.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The blades are excellent but their angle makes cleaning the blades very difficult.</li>
            <li>Not quite as inexpensive as the major discount store where I usually buy them, but a good price nevertheless.  </li>
            <li>Shame got a few nice shaves so far, and will try the Schick blades recommended.</li>
            <li>If it had the little trim blade on top</li>
            <li>Long as I use lather I can go 5-7 full shaves before I have to replace the blade.</li>
            <li>Then, I went out to buy a new razor and ended up buying a schick women&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>I sort of missed the fifth blade that&#x27;s on the Titanium at first, but that&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>Bought husband and all other men on Christmas stocking list this razor and blade combo set 2 years ago have been looking for replacement blades for a year now in all Walmart where originally found razor set,</li>
            <li>I think I will stick to the actual schick brand and suffer the higher price.</li>
            <li>These are OK, but not better than the Tech3.  </li>
            <li>With the old Q+uattro blade</li>
            <li>My guess is that they were old stock.  </li>
            <li>getting clogged all the time and rinsing frequently, I prefer these over the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li>Could not find them in retail stores near me.</li>
            <li>The right side clicks into the back, but for some reason the left side will not.</li>
            <li>then the one on the right, probably to prevent the use of other razor blades.</li>
            <li>We live in a rural area and couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  </li>
            <li>Head hair is rough on blades, but this is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>They are also much cheaper than the other blades I have used</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell they work just as well as the more expensive blades.</li>

            <li> They are also much cheaper than the other blades I have used</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell they work just as well as the more expensive blades.</li>
            <li> The blades got dull before I finished my first shave.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting lubrication strip.</li>
            <li> and they last just as long</li>
            <li> last long too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their edge is not nearly as sharp as the Wilkinson blades I have previously purchased from another Amazon supplier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are sharp, last as long or longer than competing brands, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> My impression is that they are not quite as close or sharp a shave, but for the price difference these are close enough for me.</li>
            <li> but these did not live up</li>
            <li> It is my understanding that razor blades loose sharpness</li>
            <li> Since my face has not gotten bigger to match the Tech4, it works less well.</li>
            <li> I only recieved half my order.</li>
            <li> When being careful will not cut.</li>
            <li> Minus</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these blades to anyone who is tired of paying for Mach3 blades.  </li>
            <li> as they age (due to oxidation?).</li>
            <li> Shaving against the grain is no problem because this blade stays so sharp.</li>
            <li> All the function of the big name brand razor without he ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> This means that it fits the face less well.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison between the quality and comfort of my Wilkinson Sword Tech4 Blades and the Schick 4 blade disposable razor I previously used.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t see paying for  expensive name brand razor blades when these work just as well and last just as long.</li>
            <li> After a few months they have never had the blades again (typical) .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Quattro bladeds for years and after having used a few of these</li>
            <li> However these did not fit my schick hydro razor.</li>
            <li> These refills still do not fit this razor either.</li>
            <li> Same product as Schick, but MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> and they are no better than the Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li> I began using W,S, blades in the late 1950s.</li>
            <li> But sadly Schick d.b.a.</li>
            <li> i recommend them as an option when the schick quattro is so expensive</li>
            <li> This purchase of Wilkinson blades was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> The prices they demand for Gillette razors are insane.  </li>

            <li> Great blades and a good price!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacements for my Schick at less than half the cost.</li>
            <li> The blades got dull before I finished my first shave.  Upon closer examination, the razor blades were actually made in China.  The seller did not disclose this part.  (The seller can&#x27;t even spell Germany.)  Even Bic disposable razor can do better than this.  Excerpt from the box: &amp;#34;Wilkinson Sword Razor is made in China and assembled with blade cartridge made in Germany by Wilkinson Sword GMBH.&amp;#34;  For comparison, the Gillette Fusion lasts a week for me.  The Schick Quattro Titanium can last 10 days.</li>
            <li> Same as Schick made in Germany cheaper price than Schick!!</li>
            <li> Great blades at a Great value.</li>
            <li> I began using W,S, blades in the late 1950s. I lost track of them as my shaving habits changed. Found them in Walmart recently. The best razor blade I have ever used....5 STARS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Quattro bladeds for years and after having used a few of these I think they are quite an adequate replacement. My impression is that they are not quite as close or sharp a shave, but for the price difference these are close enough for me. I&#x27;ve not noticed any irregularities or tendencies to nick. Unless I catch Quattros on a good sale, I&#x27;ll probably make the Wilkinsons my standard blade as long as the quality remains consistent.  I sort of missed the fifth blade that&#x27;s on the Titanium at first, but that&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> FOUND THESE WITH THE RAZOR SO ALL IS SO WELL!</li>
            <li> Good blades.  They cut me a bit more than the shick quattro blades which never cut me. +Were 1/2 the price.  When being careful will not cut. With the old Q+uattro blade no matter what I deed I could not make me bleed.</li>
            <li> Best buy for the money</li>
            <li> Like these razors-reasonably priced also</li>
            <li> I have only used one of the cartridges so far, but the give as good  a shave as the brand name refills.</li>
            <li> What I wanted. Good price per unit.  Will try to find more like this deal.</li>
            <li> Have used them after many years forgoten and found them near as good&#x27; if not equal to the Schick Quatro Pro Power blades.</li>
            <li> Long lasting lubrication strip. Lasts many times longer than Gillette.</li>
            <li> Compared to Mach 4, they give a very close shave and best of all the cost per cartridge is in a reasonable ballpark figure. The frame for the blades was reasonable in cost too!</li>
            <li> Bought husband and all other men on Christmas stocking list this razor and blade combo set 2 years ago have been looking for replacement blades for a year now in all Walmart where originally found razor set, haven&#x27;t seen since. Was looking thru Amazon and noticed blades husband is happy with the find says the blades have a extremely long use LIFE.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these blades to anyone who is tired of paying for Mach3 blades.  They give a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> Best shaving blade I have used.  And, they last for several shaves.  WalMart is supposed to sell them but I had to order from Amazon because I could only find them one time at WalMart.  They are also much cheaper than the other blades I have used and they are no better than the Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price and quality.  These blades are as good as the Schick brand at much lower cost.  Wish they sold a 16 or 24 pack for even greater savings.</li>
            <li> good  blades, for the money very satisfied with my  old man baby smooth face will definitely  by them again when needed</li>
            <li> best razors. Can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
            <li> Much better than the name brand....only had to go over my face ONCE!!! Now I have a favorite razor :-) Noah Coop</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these razors, especially since they are much more affordable then others. However these did not fit my schick hydro razor. The right side clicks into the back, but for some reason the left side will not. Upon inspection, I noticed that the latch on the left side is slightly larger then the one on the right, probably to prevent the use of other razor blades. I even tried using different razors from the package and it still did not work. Then, I went out to buy a new razor and ended up buying a schick women&#x27;s razor. These refills still do not fit this razor either. I think I will stick to the actual schick brand and suffer the higher price.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best, smooth long lasting and 10 bucks less money.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these razors from my local store, but they stopped selling them.  Wilkinson razors are equal in quality to the best names, but are a much better value.  My order was filled quickly and the razors were the same as those I had purchased from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp, last as long or longer than competing brands, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The prices they demand for Gillette razors are insane.  Do yourself a favor and try these out.</li>
            <li> Same product as Schick, but MUCH less expensive.  Maybe that&#x27;s why big box quit selling them.</li>
            <li> All the function of the big name brand razor without he ridiculous price. I shave my head and face. Long as I use lather I can go 5-7 full shaves before I have to replace the blade. Head hair is rough on blades, but this is holding up very well. I will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Great razors. I&#x27;ve re-ordered them multiple times. Much cheaper then the original and they last just as long</li>
            <li> Best blades ever used</li>
            <li> Loved the Tech3 blades.  They worked and were only $5.00 for 4.  But sadly Schick d.b.a. Wilkinson went to &amp;#34;Tech4&amp;#34;.  These are OK, but not better than the Tech3.  the angle of the head has changed.  The size of the head is slightly bigger than the Tech3.  This means that it fits the face less well.  Faces have contours.  Since my face has not gotten bigger to match the Tech4, it works less well. Oh well. not all progress is forward.</li>
            <li> Very good and work well, will recommend them. Clean Shave and blades last long too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edd</li>
            <li> Great Buy. Price was great.</li>
            <li> Great blades, great price.  My face and head (I&#x27;m almost totally bald, so why not just shave it!) are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> Was looking all over for these, couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore. Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Saved a lot of looking for these blades - thanks for finding them for us.  They will make my husband happy for awhile.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find these blade locally, so this was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I only recieved half my order. Which I believe was because they were out of stock. Shame got a few nice shaves so far, and will try the Schick blades recommended. Also I was credited for my whole order. Very happy with Amazon, and it&#x27;s affiliates. Ihave one suggestion Put in a spell checker. Thank You Bob...</li>
            <li> The blades fit my razor fine; give close as well many shaves for the money. Recommend to anyone who uses these type blades.</li>
            <li> Not quite as inexpensive as the major discount store where I usually buy them, but a good price nevertheless.  I just can&#x27;t see paying for  expensive name brand razor blades when these work just as well and last just as long. A good economical blade.</li>
            <li> I like these blades.  I use to use the Wilkerson twin blades and loved them  Perhaps they use an angle on the blades that suits my face.  I don&#x27;t know but their products work well.</li>
            <li> I liked the 3 blades a little better but can&#x27;t find them</li>
            <li> In case you buyers don&#x27;t know it, Wilkinson Sword makes some of the best blades around - they hold their sharpness and last.  Seems to be getting harder to find them, so I was thrilled to find them here AND at such a great price!</li>
            <li> the first cartridge fell apart</li>
            <li> these are really excellent blades......</li>
            <li> the same as Quattro blades luv it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the quality of the product. It almost appeared it was one of those cheap knock off&#x27;s. Somehow the original set I had originally bought along with the razor at Walmart was lot better. Don&#x27;t think I am getting this again. Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> As good of not better than Gillette and Schick. In fact, I believe they are the same as Schick Quatro.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only place now to get them.  Wal Mart no longer carries them.  These are the same price.</li>
            <li> Great value for the quality and quantity..</li>
            <li> This purchase of Wilkinson blades was disappointing.  Their edge is not nearly as sharp as the Wilkinson blades I have previously purchased from another Amazon supplier.  My guess is that they were old stock.  It is my understanding that razor blades loose sharpness as they age (due to oxidation?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times and love them. Great price, fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband says they are the best!!</li>
            <li> Returned them  They were blunt.  Am very familiar with Wilkinson but these did not live up tot he name.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  We live in a rural area and couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  GREAT VALUE!</li>
            <li> I found the Wilkinson Blades in Wal Mart, tried them, and liked them very much.  Found that I could get just as good a shave with them as I could with the higher priced blades.  Wal Mart then quit carrying them, so I turned to the internet and found them. I&#x27;m very happy with them and will continue using them for as long as I can find them.</li>
            <li> Bought Wilkinson Sword Tech4 razor last year at Walmart. After a few months they have never had the blades again (typical) . &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34; on line as well.&lt;br /&gt;IF they were in stock, AND you got free delivery to store, the blades would be $1.21 each with my 8% California sales tax.&lt;br /&gt;These blades were $1.50 each, no tax, delivered to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Still a fabulous deal, great blades, and I will use again.</li>
            <li> i have been using these, they are cheaper and work very well!! i recommend them as an option when the schick quattro is so expensive</li>
            <li> The coating edge that smooth&#x27;s the glide of the blade breaks into clumps on the blade after a couple of uses.  The blades are excellent but their angle makes cleaning the blades very difficult.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I think they are better than the name brand.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell they work just as well as the more expensive blades. No complaints or issues.</li>
            <li> great shave at a great price a really good deal. I think this is one of the best purchases  I have made.</li>
            <li> as good as other name brand razors at a fraction of the price.  Would order this product again without hesitation</li>
            <li> So far so good...they fit my Schick</li>
            <li> great razor for the money. as good as others that cost twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> matches the performance of the equivalent Gillette blade.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between the quality and comfort of my Wilkinson Sword Tech4 Blades and the Schick 4 blade disposable razor I previously used. Wilkinson Tech4 Blades leave my face smooth without any irritation, nicks or stubble. Shaving against the grain is no problem because this blade stays so sharp. I will never return to disposables...</li>
            <li> I prefer these over the newer titanium series.  Minus getting clogged all the time and rinsing frequently, I prefer these over the Schick Hydro 5.  These don&#x27;t get goopy like the Hydro series.  Also the smaller heads make maneuvering easier.  It may be the angle of the blades for my skin, but I think I get a cleaner shave with the Quattro over the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> On my first blade, and can&#x27;t tell the difference versus the Schick Quattro.  If it had the little trim blade on top I would have given it 5 stars, but then the cost might be greater.</li>
            <li> Very good blades that are a lot cheaper than some brand names. Could not find them in retail stores near me.</li>
            <li> Best bang for your Buck!</li>
            <li> Great quality, really great price.</li>
            <li> you could always call them &amp;#34;Schick Quattro&amp;#34; and charge quadruple the price ;)</li>
            <li> Great price.  Good blades.</li>
            <li> Been using for years since they came out. Local retail quit carrying (and the mainstream brand they do carry just doesn&#x27;t make the the grade) so Amazon is now my source.</li>
