            <li>the consistency is interesting!</li>
            <li>Best primer I&#x27;ve found, really like!</li>
            <li>Very light and feels good to the touch not greassy at all.</li>
            <li>but, Clinique offered me a nice size sample of their Primer.  </li>
            <li>I did research the company and liked what i read.</li>
            <li>The product is nice however</li>
            <li>This product is nice</li>
            <li>I love this product because of how good my skin feels and how well it holds my makeup in place.</li>
            <li>Yes, my makeup went on nice and stays on</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitly worth a try!!!</li>
            <li>To top it off, the customer service I received was top notch!</li>
            <li>Also, amazingly, I noticed that once I put it on with my foundation, the longer it is on my face the better</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>So far though I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I had so many hopes for this primer.</li>
            <li>had a face and neck lift as well as my top eyelids done</li>
            <li>I love amazon-  </li>
            <li>Love the silky feel to it.</li>
            <li>Customer service was also outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth!</li>
            <li>The primer sort of absorbs that powdery texture leaving a much more flawless-looking appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product rocks, and I&#x27;m so glad I made the investment.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE THIS SMASHBOX FOUNDATION &amp; MAKE-UP</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin...</li>
            <li>Makes my face really smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>I was just able to start using it , I had poison ivy and needed it to be gone.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft, it evens everything out and just makes my skin a perfect surface.</li>
            <li>Spread a drop of this on them with some chap stick and its better than any lip softening bull I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>Love that it is colorless as well.</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on nicely and smoothly and my makeup just looks</li>
            <li>Love this primer, applies and feels like silk on your face.</li>
            <li>i have also used smashbox and love that</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>If it was thinner it would be much better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.bswitched from lancome primer bc of price.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love it.</li>
            <li>Makes enlarged pores even more prominent</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this primer and have bought it repeatedly -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it really helps with the scars but it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on smooth and the product itself goes on very smooth as well.</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a very smooth undercoat and helps foundation gone on so smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>At first I did not see much difference in my makeup, but I now know it is better to let it sit on your face first like it says on the bottle for best results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this primer!</li>
            <li>that only means my makeup looks great. :)</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be easily irritated.  </li>
            <li>Make up still wares off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy apply foundation.</li>
            <li>This primer is the best one I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>I have tried many over time but this is absolutely the best and goes on smooth, helping my make-up to stay on for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Hey thats fine by me..</li>
            <li>Decreases the appearance of fine lines, makes foundation go farther.</li>
            <li>Performs as promised:  minimizes pores and fine lines</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you have fine lines and want to cover them up.</li>
            <li>Really great product that left my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day that I am applying makeup - adds to a smooth sheen for my face and helps keep my foundation in place.  </li>
            <li>Makes foundation go on smoothly</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly smooth and it is not oily.</li>
            <li>skin is so silky smooth and keeps my make up on all day without getting oily...</li>
            <li>smooth feels silky ...</li>
            <li>It also locks in moisturizers (if used before application), leaving my skin feeling comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>IT IS IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my face so smooth.</li>
            <li>When I take off my makeup at night, my skin is still smooth and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is light and goes on well.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t even rub on my face and if I did manage to get some.to smooth on it</li>
            <li>but this has no parabens (which is great) and also has the same feel to it as smashbox.</li>
            <li>Works great, makes my make up last all day and night!</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>This silky smooth primer keeps my face</li>
            <li>I received an email from &amp;#34;Denise&amp;#34; from the company stating she was sending me another bottle free of charge.</li>
            <li>only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to help as much as I thought it would with my ice pick scars, but it still is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>It makes applying under eye cover up super easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like someone shackled my face nice and smooth, but you can&#x27;t feel it on, it&#x27;s not heavy at all!!</li>
            <li>I love that there is no air in the bottle and one little pump is the perfect amount for my whole face.</li>
            <li>and I think it is equally as good as Bare Escentuals Prime Time but cheaper.</li>
            <li>i love this product.at first</li>
            <li>I have used many of these primers, but this one really does what it says!</li>
            <li>MY MAKE-UP IS LOOKING FRESH!</li>
            <li>Overall love this primer, not shiny which is nice too.</li>
            <li>Not anything special and</li>
            <li>Sticky and does not perform as good as the brands from your local Walmart or drugstore!</li>
            <li>Foundation will stay true all day.</li>
            <li>This product is a good pore reducer, too, and, though I shivered at the price upon my initial purchase, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product again---and again.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it in love with this product</li>
            <li>I loved it and recently ran out of it</li>
            <li>Often such products seem to be superior, but at what a cost eventually to your health.</li>
            <li>Shockingly smooth and overall effective product.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t thought to check the ounces for comparison of the two products until I ran out quickly of this one.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>This product did not meet my expectations for a good face primer - fine lines and large pores were not smoothed over like you would expect them to be - this product did not make my makeup last longer - about 4 hours into my day</li>
            <li>l like the product very much!</li>
            <li>okay it went on a really smooth and silky seemIng to somewhat keep my makeup in place but not really it turned out more oily than anything.</li>
            <li>It is a breeze to apply; very silky, don&#x27;t need much; smooth and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really leaves your skin feeling so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I saw the reviews for this and figured maybe it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love that it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>So soft and soothing on my skin; I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the packaging was superior and received before I expected it.</li>
            <li>and my makeup still looks fresh.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>My one suggestion - as others have also mentioned - is to put on the primer a good 10 minutes before other makeup, to let it set.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of holding my makeup together and also keeping shine to a minimum(in conjunction with some other skin control products)</li>
            <li>I tried this based on other good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first clear primer but feel like it makes a better canvas than the tinted that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other primers that cost a lot more and I feel that this works as well as, maybe even better than most.</li>
            <li>The powder really shows on the surface of my skin, however, when I wear the primer, the powder looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li>This product, however, creates a smooth service on my face so that my makeup glides on and stays smooth and even throughout the day and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different primers, but most seem to dissolve into my skin as the day wears on, leaving my skin tone blotchy and uneven .</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makes your face feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I have used lots of primers,my makeup by 5 slid off my face,as a53 year old woman with huge pores,this one did the job!!!best</li>
            <li>It goes on light and clear and prevents my makeup from settling during the day.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft,  my makeup went on smooth and stayed in all day.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a makeup primer.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like it in every way at a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it</li>
            <li>In fact I think it makes me more greasy, and inevitably takes my makeup off because of it.</li>
            <li>My make up goes on really well with this and stays!</li>
            <li>This product came so fast!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was Christmas day</li>
            <li>And now with this stuff, I look even better and younger!!</li>
            <li>I have used so many different face primers in my life I have lost count.</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation last longer and look better.</li>
            <li>Put it on about 9:30 am, danced for about 4 hours, it was hot &amp; humid.  </li>
            <li>It holds up well in hot &amp; humid weather.  </li>
            <li>primer at first seemed</li>
            <li>AND THIS IS THE FIRST PRIMER I HAVE EVER</li>
            <li>EVEN MY HUSBAD WHISTLED AT ME YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.</li>
            <li>AND IT COMES IN A REALLY CUTE LITTLE BOTTLE THAT FITS EASILY INTO MY MAKE-UP BAG</li>
            <li>I have pretty clean and clear skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>Not thick or cloying like many primers - leaves a soft gentle surface to work with.</li>
            <li>But this product works just as good as the more expensive product I was using.</li>
            <li>and this was the second kind I tried, and It feels light weight compared to the other brand I tried.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and it worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe I have gone my whole life and never used a product like this before.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Crazy awesome</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of makeup, and I notice that it doesn&#x27;t really stay on by itself for longer than a couple hours, so I wanted to try a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the actual texture of my skin after I use the primer, my skin feels smooth and even.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really hold my makeup on even for an hour.</li>
            <li>This primer DOES work well, very well.  </li>
            <li>So much better than what I had expected.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really trust companies as they want to sell.</li>
            <li>This is thicker than I expected but it works a lot better than lancome</li>
            <li>It also makes my foundation go on so much easier and stay on all day.</li>
            <li>I Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I had previously only used Arbonne&#x27;s facial primer, and truly liked it.  </li>
            <li>and it gives a more natural overall look to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am changing my review to WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I also read reviews that you should let it sink in first for a few minutes, I do at least 15 mins before applying foundation and its just wonderful.</li>
            <li>shine free yet soft all day long and helps my makeup go on easy and last so much longer.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, but does not last very long for the $.</li>
            <li>i thought it would leave my face sticky,but wow its super soft.</li>
            <li>This makes a huge difference in how your makeup looks and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>Wow this really makes a HUGE difference when I apply my daily foundation.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and was looking for something to keep my Lanc√¥me 24 hour foundation on my face.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different primers, I do love this one it goes on so smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel silky soft and allow your make up to stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was using Smash Box but the price was way to high for a primer.</li>
            <li>the price is too high.</li>
            <li>i would highly recomment</li>
            <li>I have large pores and it completely camouflages them.</li>
            <li>And only after I day or first use I noticed it blended my blotchy skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, soft and does its job!!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t look my age, I got my moms genes</li>
            <li>I dread using it because most are heavy and don&#x27;t let me face breath.</li>
            <li>IT HELPS ME FEEL FRESH AND YOUNGER FEELING</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wearing primer</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a new believer in primer.</li>
            <li>I am a new user of face primer.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and silky.    </li>
            <li>makes face slippery and very soft feeling but do not think i will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling sooo soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46, people have assumed I was in my early thirties!</li>
            <li>I gave it the ultimate test the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 years old, and don&#x27;t wear makeup very often because it can actually make my skin look older.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and holds your makeup all day.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, at times, and I am 58 years old.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and gives the foundation I wear staying power.</li>
            <li>So far my makeup has stayed on.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft natural look and my makeup goes on over it without issue.</li>
            <li>and you skin is baby soft after you glide in on your face.  </li>
            <li>I put this on even when I don&#x27;t have time to do my makeup because it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin, &amp; NO issues.  </li>
            <li>Almost complete formula of dimethicone formulations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M 56 YEARS YOUNG</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a silky finish and doesn&#x27;t agitate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product really does deserve 5 stars, and even if the second pump doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts &amp; I tend to be sensitive to a lot of face products.</li>
            <li>My skin so soft and silk.</li>
            <li>I will also say that usually when I wear powder makeup, it&#x27;s so easy to tell.</li>
            <li>, I have large pores, uneven skin color, I was like wow!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better value than I expected when I saw just how small the bottle was.</li>
            <li>On a hot/humid day, I wore this under my Bare Minerals, &amp; went dancing.  </li>
            <li>I normally use big brands like Napoleon perdis and Mac and pay double the price</li>
            <li>I live in the Deep South and makeup turns into water or something shiny as soon as I step outside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, it is half the cost and equal in quality to my previous brand.  </li>
            <li>Was very disappointed in this product not the best by far.</li>
            <li>Feels very smooth unfortunately I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After using Clinique&#x27;s Primer for the first time, I did not like the way it felt on my skin i.e., too creamy and a little heavier than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>i used to use the revlon primer which worked great (and is a few dollars cheaper than this when i last bought it) but it had that weird glue/B.O. smell that i couldn&#x27;t take anymore.</li>
            <li>Not a natural product not one I would recommend for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I definitely used less foundation-didn&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, large pores, uneven colored skin, you have got to try this, I even looked younger!</li>

            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve found, really like!</li>
            <li> Very light and feels good to the touch not greassy at all.</li>
            <li> but, Clinique offered me a nice size sample of their Primer.  </li>
            <li> I did research the company and liked what i read.</li>
            <li> The product is nice however</li>

            <li> nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitly worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> To top it off, the customer service I received was top notch!</li>
            <li> Also, amazingly, I noticed that once I put it on with my foundation, the longer it is on my face the better</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with it.</li>

            <li> I love the way it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product rocks, and I&#x27;m so glad I made the investment.</li>

            <li> Makes my face really smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I was just able to start using it , I had poison ivy and needed it to be gone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and soft, it evens everything out and just makes my skin a perfect surface.</li>
            <li> Spread a drop of this on them with some chap stick and its better than any lip softening bull I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> Love that it is colorless as well.</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on nicely and smoothly and my makeup just looks</li>
            <li> Love this primer, applies and feels like silk on your face.</li>
            <li> i have also used smashbox and love that</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> If it was thinner it would be much better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.bswitched from lancome primer bc of price.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love it.</li>
            <li> Makes enlarged pores even more prominent</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this primer and have bought it repeatedly -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it really helps with the scars but it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on smooth and the product itself goes on very smooth as well.</li>
            <li> It gives your skin a very smooth undercoat and helps foundation gone on so smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> At first I did not see much difference in my makeup, but I now know it is better to let it sit on your face first like it says on the bottle for best results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this primer!</li>
            <li> that only means my makeup looks great. :)</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be easily irritated.  </li>
            <li> Make up still wares off easily.</li>
            <li> Easy apply foundation.</li>
            <li> This primer is the best one I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over time but this is absolutely the best and goes on smooth, helping my make-up to stay on for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> Hey thats fine by me..</li>
            <li> Decreases the appearance of fine lines, makes foundation go farther.</li>
            <li> Performs as promised:  minimizes pores and fine lines</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you have fine lines and want to cover them up.</li>
            <li> Really great product that left my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day that I am applying makeup - adds to a smooth sheen for my face and helps keep my foundation in place.  </li>
            <li> Makes foundation go on smoothly</li>
            <li> It goes on perfectly smooth and it is not oily.</li>
            <li> skin is so silky smooth and keeps my make up on all day without getting oily...</li>
            <li> smooth feels silky ...</li>
            <li> It also locks in moisturizers (if used before application), leaving my skin feeling comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> IT IS IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my face so smooth.</li>
            <li> When I take off my makeup at night, my skin is still smooth and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> It is light and goes on well.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t even rub on my face and if I did manage to get some.to smooth on it</li>
            <li> but this has no parabens (which is great) and also has the same feel to it as smashbox.</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my make up last all day and night!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This silky smooth primer keeps my face</li>
            <li> I received an email from &amp;#34;Denise&amp;#34; from the company stating she was sending me another bottle free of charge.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to help as much as I thought it would with my ice pick scars, but it still is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> It makes applying under eye cover up super easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like someone shackled my face nice and smooth, but you can&#x27;t feel it on, it&#x27;s not heavy at all!!</li>
            <li> I love that there is no air in the bottle and one little pump is the perfect amount for my whole face.</li>
            <li> and I think it is equally as good as Bare Escentuals Prime Time but cheaper.</li>
            <li> i love this product.at first</li>
            <li> I have used many of these primers, but this one really does what it says!</li>
            <li> MY MAKE-UP IS LOOKING FRESH!</li>
            <li> Overall love this primer, not shiny which is nice too.</li>
            <li> Not anything special and</li>
            <li> Sticky and does not perform as good as the brands from your local Walmart or drugstore!</li>
            <li> Foundation will stay true all day.</li>
            <li> This product is a good pore reducer, too, and, though I shivered at the price upon my initial purchase, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product again---and again.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it in love with this product</li>
            <li> I loved it and recently ran out of it</li>
            <li> Often such products seem to be superior, but at what a cost eventually to your health.</li>
            <li> Shockingly smooth and overall effective product.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t thought to check the ounces for comparison of the two products until I ran out quickly of this one.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations for a good face primer - fine lines and large pores were not smoothed over like you would expect them to be - this product did not make my makeup last longer - about 4 hours into my day</li>
            <li> l like the product very much!</li>
            <li> okay it went on a really smooth and silky seemIng to somewhat keep my makeup in place but not really it turned out more oily than anything.</li>
            <li> It is a breeze to apply; very silky, don&#x27;t need much; smooth and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> It really leaves your skin feeling so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I saw the reviews for this and figured maybe it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love that it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> So soft and soothing on my skin; I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the packaging was superior and received before I expected it.</li>
            <li> and my makeup still looks fresh.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> My one suggestion - as others have also mentioned - is to put on the primer a good 10 minutes before other makeup, to let it set.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job of holding my makeup together and also keeping shine to a minimum(in conjunction with some other skin control products)</li>
            <li> I tried this based on other good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first clear primer but feel like it makes a better canvas than the tinted that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other primers that cost a lot more and I feel that this works as well as, maybe even better than most.</li>
            <li> The powder really shows on the surface of my skin, however, when I wear the primer, the powder looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li> This product, however, creates a smooth service on my face so that my makeup glides on and stays smooth and even throughout the day and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different primers, but most seem to dissolve into my skin as the day wears on, leaving my skin tone blotchy and uneven .</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and makes your face feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I have used lots of primers,my makeup by 5 slid off my face,as a53 year old woman with huge pores,this one did the job!!!best</li>
            <li> It goes on light and clear and prevents my makeup from settling during the day.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft,  my makeup went on smooth and stayed in all day.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a makeup primer.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like it in every way at a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it</li>
            <li> In fact I think it makes me more greasy, and inevitably takes my makeup off because of it.</li>
            <li> My make up goes on really well with this and stays!</li>
            <li> This product came so fast!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was Christmas day</li>
            <li> And now with this stuff, I look even better and younger!!</li>
            <li> I have used so many different face primers in my life I have lost count.</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation last longer and look better.</li>
            <li> Put it on about 9:30 am, danced for about 4 hours, it was hot &amp; humid.  </li>
            <li> It holds up well in hot &amp; humid weather.  </li>
            <li> primer at first seemed</li>
            <li> AND THIS IS THE FIRST PRIMER I HAVE EVER</li>
            <li> EVEN MY HUSBAD WHISTLED AT ME YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.</li>
            <li> AND IT COMES IN A REALLY CUTE LITTLE BOTTLE THAT FITS EASILY INTO MY MAKE-UP BAG</li>
            <li> I have pretty clean and clear skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> Not thick or cloying like many primers - leaves a soft gentle surface to work with.</li>
            <li> But this product works just as good as the more expensive product I was using.</li>
            <li> and this was the second kind I tried, and It feels light weight compared to the other brand I tried.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I have gone my whole life and never used a product like this before.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Crazy awesome</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of makeup, and I notice that it doesn&#x27;t really stay on by itself for longer than a couple hours, so I wanted to try a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the actual texture of my skin after I use the primer, my skin feels smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hold my makeup on even for an hour.</li>
            <li> This primer DOES work well, very well.  </li>
            <li> So much better than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really trust companies as they want to sell.</li>
            <li> This is thicker than I expected but it works a lot better than lancome</li>
            <li> It also makes my foundation go on so much easier and stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I had previously only used Arbonne&#x27;s facial primer, and truly liked it.  </li>
            <li> and it gives a more natural overall look to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am changing my review to WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I also read reviews that you should let it sink in first for a few minutes, I do at least 15 mins before applying foundation and its just wonderful.</li>
            <li> shine free yet soft all day long and helps my makeup go on easy and last so much longer.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, but does not last very long for the $.</li>
            <li> i thought it would leave my face sticky,but wow its super soft.</li>
            <li> This makes a huge difference in how your makeup looks and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Wow this really makes a HUGE difference when I apply my daily foundation.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and was looking for something to keep my Lanc√¥me 24 hour foundation on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different primers, I do love this one it goes on so smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel silky soft and allow your make up to stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was using Smash Box but the price was way to high for a primer.</li>
            <li> the price is too high.</li>
            <li> i would highly recomment</li>
            <li> I have large pores and it completely camouflages them.</li>
            <li> And only after I day or first use I noticed it blended my blotchy skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, soft and does its job!!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t look my age, I got my moms genes</li>
            <li> I dread using it because most are heavy and don&#x27;t let me face breath.</li>
            <li> IT HELPS ME FEEL FRESH AND YOUNGER FEELING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing primer</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a new believer in primer.</li>
            <li> I am a new user of face primer.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and silky.    </li>
            <li> makes face slippery and very soft feeling but do not think i will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling sooo soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, people have assumed I was in my early thirties!</li>
            <li> I gave it the ultimate test the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, and don&#x27;t wear makeup very often because it can actually make my skin look older.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and holds your makeup all day.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, at times, and I am 58 years old.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and gives the foundation I wear staying power.</li>
            <li> So far my makeup has stayed on.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> It leaves a soft natural look and my makeup goes on over it without issue.</li>
            <li> and you skin is baby soft after you glide in on your face.  </li>
            <li> I put this on even when I don&#x27;t have time to do my makeup because it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin, &amp; NO issues.  </li>
            <li> Almost complete formula of dimethicone formulations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M 56 YEARS YOUNG</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a silky finish and doesn&#x27;t agitate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product really does deserve 5 stars, and even if the second pump doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts &amp; I tend to be sensitive to a lot of face products.</li>
            <li> My skin so soft and silk.</li>
            <li> I will also say that usually when I wear powder makeup, it&#x27;s so easy to tell.</li>
            <li> , I have large pores, uneven skin color, I was like wow!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better value than I expected when I saw just how small the bottle was.</li>
            <li> On a hot/humid day, I wore this under my Bare Minerals, &amp; went dancing.  </li>
            <li> I normally use big brands like Napoleon perdis and Mac and pay double the price</li>
            <li> I live in the Deep South and makeup turns into water or something shiny as soon as I step outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, it is half the cost and equal in quality to my previous brand.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product not the best by far.</li>
            <li> Feels very smooth unfortunately I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After using Clinique&#x27;s Primer for the first time, I did not like the way it felt on my skin i.e., too creamy and a little heavier than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> i used to use the revlon primer which worked great (and is a few dollars cheaper than this when i last bought it) but it had that weird glue/B.O. smell that i couldn&#x27;t take anymore.</li>
            <li> Not a natural product not one I would recommend for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I definitely used less foundation-didn&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, large pores, uneven colored skin, you have got to try this, I even looked younger!</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s a bit thick and not as smooth as expected.</li>
            <li> and my foundation seems to last a little longer then normal but not all day.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird, but I love the product!</li>
            <li> After years of spending money on remedies that never accomplished what I&#x27;d hoped they would, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that solves my complexion problems---on the surface anyway.  </li>
            <li> It does not have any strange aromas.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive products for the same purpose and had wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I think the conistency is slightly different than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman and when I use this product; I look and feel 30 -</li>
            <li> I will be a long time customer.  </li>
            <li> My make-up lasts all day long even I work from 8am to 3pm and play soccer from 6pm to 8pm.</li>
            <li> Just the other day it was 85 degrees outside</li>
            <li> Feels similar to other primers like smashbox but without the breakouts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.  </li>
            <li> I did apply moisturizer allowed it to dry then applied primer</li>
            <li> I have combination oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Every day I wear a liquid concealer, a mousse foundation, loose powder, and a bronzer.</li>
            <li> my biggest problem with this was by the time I was down to the last couple weeks of use the product again falling apart</li>
            <li> when trying something new, this did not have any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> It is in fact half the product amount and brings the price to equal that of the Arbonne primer.</li>
            <li> Does not work as I expected</li>
            <li> to describe the product, it is a thick and clear material.</li>
            <li> not what expected for the money</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way ....</li>
            <li> ALSO A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY....</li>
            <li> Used a small amount, following others&#x27; suggestions, waited 10 minutes and the applied foundation.</li>
            <li> so I am extremely cautious about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> I have such problematic skin and it was so hard to find a primer for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way or it will feel heavy</li>
            <li> I had been using  Smash box primer for the past year,  but when going to order another bottle even though it is so expensive, because it kept my makeup looking fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> apply Simply Balanced primer by Delicate Caress Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price to me</li>
            <li> The primer is just thick enough to serve its purpose while giving my skin the air</li>
            <li> mom says you look good even when you look horrible</li>
            <li> let it dry and applied my makeup as usual.</li>
            <li> I went to the bathroom, I was shocked, my skin was as fresh as if I just did my make up!</li>
            <li> I had previously rated it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always review things on Amazon, but when I do the product is either exceptional or horrible.</li>
            <li> (The Lancome pore eraser that I used turned into a shiny mess within a few hours of application).</li>
            <li> Just a little in the summer.</li>
            <li> literally I couldn&#x27;t rub it between my fingers without it turning into a little Goo balls..</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who gets frustrated with their makeup not staying fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> I dislike the fact that it makes me shiny after a few hours.</li>
            <li> the PUMP inside the bottle is missing, therefore every time I use the primer I have to unscrew the cap, and with a qtip get the product out if the bottle.</li>
            <li> mine was missing the pump</li>
            <li> My skin did not have any trouble breathing either.</li>
            <li> and im a black girl!</li>
            <li> Not worth your money!!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin and, in the past, I&#x27;ve had to re-apply foundation throughout the day to cover blemishes and my ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li> I usually breakout</li>
            <li> Could be from what I was eating, just not sure.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and it stays on for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Thick but silky b</li>
            <li> This primer is not too thick at all</li>
            <li> I have the worst oily skin, putting powder on every other hour, we were getting ready to go on vacation to the beach, I was sweating, took 3 hours to get there</li>
            <li> Seriously you want kissable lips?</li>
            <li> Seriously if you are shopping around and trying to decide just order this, stop searching.</li>
            <li> Not a good primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as my skin doesn&#x27;t have any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> This foundation primer is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I WILL BE USING THIS PRIMER EVERYDAY FOR LIFE FROM NOW ON!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my already oil skin even worse.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> I got bad acne when I used this.  </li>
            <li> and I needed something  for my makeup to adhere to because my lancome wasn&#x27;t cutting it alone and this product works!</li>
            <li> And my makeup looks magazine quality - and I&#x27;m usually horrible with makeup!  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! It goes on light and clear and prevents my makeup from settling during the day.</li>
            <li> I had been using  Smash box primer for the past year,  but when going to order another bottle even though it is so expensive, because it kept my makeup looking fresh all day.  I saw the reviews for this and figured maybe it was worth a try.  Sso glad I did! Blends immediately into my skin and makeup looks good all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It makes applying under eye cover up super easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this primer! My skin is so soft,  my makeup went on smooth and stayed in all day.  To top it off, the customer service I received was top notch! Definitely going to be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> It is good to put on before applying foundation. works well and last&lt;br /&gt;throughout day.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS AS I HOPED FOR! When I finish this bottle, I&#x27;ll purchase another and another!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for my skin.  I have large pores and it completely camouflages them. And my makeup looks magazine quality - and I&#x27;m usually horrible with makeup!  My one suggestion - as others have also mentioned - is to put on the primer a good 10 minutes before other makeup, to let it set. Looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P S. I&#x27;m using GOSH foundation over it, if that helps anyone.  The combination also does great at ridding me of redness.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was using Merle Norman foundation primer which is about twice the price. But this product works just as good as the more expensive product I was using. Would recommend this. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product and received exactly like they said it would.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOVE this product!! Worth every penny. I have been told that my face looks flawless and that it looks like a filtered picture lol .. Hey thats fine by me.. that only means my makeup looks great. :)</li>
            <li> Brought this for my mom, she use it for a while and love the results, but then she started to break out with pimples and it made her skin oily.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Especially for my eye make-up.  Love that it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> Shockingly smooth and overall effective product.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer. You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face. Holds makeup on longer.</li>
            <li> The seller kept in touch with my until I received the product. Everything is perfect!</li>
            <li> So soft and soothing on my skin; I love how it feels. I dislike the fact that it makes me shiny after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Very nice primer.  I followed the directions and it worked very well for me.  I recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a makeup primer. Dont have anything else to compare it to but it goes on well and my foundation seems to last a little longer then normal but not all day.</li>
            <li> OMGoodness!  I love this product!  It is a breeze to apply; very silky, don&#x27;t need much; smooth and non greasy.  I&#x27;ve used Clinique&#x27;s Primer and, it does not even come close to this Primer. It was time for me to re-order Best Foundation Primer but, Clinique offered me a nice size sample of their Primer.  I have oily skin, at times, and I am 58 years old.  So, I prefer gels and non-creamy serums for my face and eyes. After using Clinique&#x27;s Primer for the first time, I did not like the way it felt on my skin i.e., too creamy and a little heavier than I&#x27;d like and, it did not last thru the day.  So, the sample from Clinique was  placed in my make-up cabinet and, I quickly re-ordered Best Foundation Primer!  I&#x27;m spoiled now and will continue to use this Primer, without question or hesitation!</li>
            <li> Still getting used to this product - substance melts in your hand (and on your face) which is good. No complaints so far</li>
            <li> Wow! First of all, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and was looking for something to keep my Lanc√¥me 24 hour foundation on my face. (The Lancome pore eraser that I used turned into a shiny mess within a few hours of application). I did research the company and liked what i read. I live in the Deep South and makeup turns into water or something shiny as soon as I step outside. Got this yesterday. Used a small amount, following others&#x27; suggestions, waited 10 minutes and the applied foundation. I definitely used less foundation-didn&#x27;t need as much. Coverage was nice and smooth. I&#x27;m sitting here, 5 hours later and my makeup has not moved. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been in MS for two years with my (department) makeup sweating off. As the makeup sits on top of the primer, it gets this airbrushed look which is what I&#x27;ve been striving for for years! By the way- I&#x27;ll be 32 in August but I constantly get carded for alcohol (and rated R movies) and hit on by younger people. They say I look 21. I try to take care of my skin, take vitamans, drink water, avoid sun.  This is going to be a permanent fixture to my makeup routine. Highly recommend. It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.  My morning routine is below: 1. apply Vit C serum(Nu nutrients Vitamin C Serum) Found on amazon. 2. apply sunscreen La Roche-Porsay Anthelios sunscreen, Found on amazon. -LOVE this stuff. 3. apply Simply Balanced primer by Delicate Caress Cosmetics. 4. Lanc√¥me Teinte Idole Ultra 24 Hr. 5. Physicians&#x27; Mineral ware correcting formula(cheaper on amazon).</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Stays on all day. Thick but silky b</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I have gone my whole life and never used a product like this before.  This makes a huge difference in how your makeup looks and how long it lasts.  I love it and will never be without it again.</li>
            <li> Does not work as I expected</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird, but I love the product!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be easily irritated.  Most primer products I&#x27;ve tried either cause severe dryness or break outs, so when I stumbled across this product on Amazon and read some of the glowing reviews, I was skeptical.  However, Best Foundation and Makeup Face Primer neither dries nor irritates my skin!  It totally lives up to the description, the reviews, and fully exceeded my expectations.  I absolutely love this product.  It prolongs the life of my foundation while preventing it from looking cakey or settling into lines and pores.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works, and I hope to never have to go without it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this saran wrap-like layer would not let my skin breathe. I totally ignored my skin&#x27;s pleas for help being all awe struck by the smoothness of the primer. After one week of use, my skin rebelled and I felt like I went backwards in time and hit puberty all over again. Wow. I want to look younger, but not in that way.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product not the best by far. Sticky and does not perform as good as the brands from your local Walmart or drugstore!</li>
            <li> Not a good primer. It feels greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel good, sticky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and holds your makeup all day. I was using Smash Box but the price was way to high for a primer. This is exactly like it in every way at a quarter of the price. Works very well and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Very nice! Happy with it. I sweat quite a bit when I dance or move a bit and it does a good job of holding my makeup together and also keeping shine to a minimum(in conjunction with some other skin control products)</li>
            <li> Not at all liking this! Going back to my Oz products!</li>
            <li> It does help to minimize  the spots</li>
            <li> This is the best face primer I have ever used in my life. Just the other day it was 85 degrees outside and I put on foundation after applying my moisturizer and this face primer! I was literally sweating and my makeup stayed on all day, all night! I use this primer and the &amp;#34;Skindinavia bridal makeup setting spray&amp;#34;! Two awesome products put together&#x3D;  Perfection!</li>
            <li> I use it every day that I am applying makeup - adds to a smooth sheen for my face and helps keep my foundation in place.  Not thick or cloying like many primers - leaves a soft gentle surface to work with.</li>
            <li> Great base for your make up.  Foundation will stay true all day.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different primers, I do love this one it goes on so smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was superior and received before I expected it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and gives the foundation I wear staying power. I put it on in the morning and it stays on for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the answer!  I use this primer before I apply foundation and powder and it sets my make up for the rest of the day.  I have acne-prone skin and, in the past, I&#x27;ve had to re-apply foundation throughout the day to cover blemishes and my ruddy complexion.  After experimenting---and failing--- to find a foundation that persists, I tried this primer and, voila, my make up stays put even after ten hours.  After years of spending money on remedies that never accomplished what I&#x27;d hoped they would, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that solves my complexion problems---on the surface anyway.  This product is a good pore reducer, too, and, though I shivered at the price upon my initial purchase, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product again---and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost a week now and I love it. At first I did not see much difference in my makeup, but I now know it is better to let it sit on your face first like it says on the bottle for best results. Also, amazingly, I noticed that once I put it on with my foundation, the longer it is on my face the better it looks! Crazy awesome and I think it is equally as good as Bare Escentuals Prime Time but cheaper. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The product is nice however the PUMP inside the bottle is missing, therefore every time I use the primer I have to unscrew the cap, and with a qtip get the product out if the bottle. Seriously?! Ugh</li>
            <li> Makes foundation go on smoothly</li>
            <li> Great combination of anti aging and primer. I usually breakout when trying something new, this did not have any negative side effects. I really liked this product, but does not last very long for the $.</li>
            <li> This primer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used...I normally use big brands like Napoleon perdis and Mac and pay double the price but I&#x27;ll be using this one from now on. I could not be happier. Highly recommend this Beautiful product.</li>
            <li> I think I finally found the perfect primer after 40 years! The first day I wore it I recieved compliments about how perfect my skin/make up looked. I work 16 hour shifts as a nurse and my make up looked the same as it did 5 minutes after I put it on. Feels similar to other primers like smashbox but without the breakouts. I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> mine was missing the pump so I have to take the lid off and smack it on my hand to get the product out</li>
            <li> Decreases the appearance of fine lines, makes foundation go farther.</li>
            <li> I had so many hopes for this primer. I hoped it would stop the greasy way in which my face gets during the summer. I hoped it would keep my makeup on longer. It seems to do neither. In fact I think it makes me more greasy, and inevitably takes my makeup off because of it. Oh, and I&#x27;m not all that greasy either. Just a little in the summer. I have pretty clean and clear skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> l like the product very much! It goes on perfectly smooth and it is not oily. You cannot beat the price.  So far my makeup has stayed on.  I&lt;br /&gt;recently had a face and neck lift as well as my top eyelids done and I needed something  for my makeup to adhere to because my lancome wasn&#x27;t cutting it alone and this product works! It helped my makeup cover my bruises from the cosmetic surgery!  I the ordered on  a friday morning and it arrived on the same day.  I love amazon-  will you marry me!</li>
            <li> Love this primer! Love the silky feel to it. I&#x27;m new to wearing primer and this was the second kind I tried, and It feels light weight compared to the other brand I tried. Works great!</li>
            <li> i love this product.at first i thought it would leave my face sticky,but wow its super soft.</li>
            <li> Really great product that left my skin silky smooth.  Customer service was also outstanding.</li>
            <li> This product is nice however it&#x27;s a bit thick and not as smooth as expected. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as my skin doesn&#x27;t have any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> Love this product... skin is so silky smooth and keeps my make up on all day without getting oily... definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> Love it. Feels smooth!</li>
            <li> My make up goes on really well with this and stays!</li>
            <li> It has no scent goes on smooth feels silky ... A little goes a long way .... Make up goes on great and stays on .... You do need to give it several minutes to set in before applying make up</li>
            <li> was what I needed and wanted very pleased</li>
            <li> This product came so fast! I ordered it on Thursday afternoon (I think) and it came Saturday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have never used a foundation primer, but I&#x27;ve been told that primers extend the wear of foundation. Every day I wear a liquid concealer, a mousse foundation, loose powder, and a bronzer. I wear a lot of makeup, and I notice that it doesn&#x27;t really stay on by itself for longer than a couple hours, so I wanted to try a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Simply balanced primer is a miracle-worker. I swear I&#x27;ve had this makeup on (all of my makeup) for 7 hours and counting and my makeup still looks fresh. I will also say that usually when I wear powder makeup, it&#x27;s so easy to tell. The powder really shows on the surface of my skin, however, when I wear the primer, the powder looks so much more natural. The primer sort of absorbs that powdery texture leaving a much more flawless-looking appearance to my skin. As for the actual texture of my skin after I use the primer, my skin feels smooth and even. I love the way it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to describe the product, it is a thick and clear material. It does not have any strange aromas. It also locks in moisturizers (if used before application), leaving my skin feeling comfortable all day. My skin did not have any trouble breathing either. The primer is just thick enough to serve its purpose while giving my skin the air it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a new believer in primer. This product rocks, and I&#x27;m so glad I made the investment.</li>
            <li> I love this product because of how good my skin feels and how well it holds my makeup in place. I would buy it again, definitely.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and tried it this morning. So far...I don&#x27;t even feel like I have makeup on and it made my foundation look wonderful! So far I am very happy with it. I have extremely sensitive skin so I will be back with a update this weekend so that I have a chance to wear it for a couple day. So far though I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
            <li> This primer is not too thick at all and I love the way it feels on my skin.  It is very soft and silky.    I just got home from church and after 6 1/2 hours my makeup is still in place.  It looks great, so I am changing my review to WOW!!!  Can&#x27;t believe it. I had previously rated it 3 stars. The only thing different is I waited longer to put it on because I got distracted this morning.    So I&#x27;m changing my review to 5 stars.  Try it!!!  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU WAIT BEFORE APPLYING YOUR FOUNDATION.  I WAITED AROUND 20 MINUTES.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!!!!! I JUST LOVE THIS SMASHBOX FOUNDATION &amp; MAKE-UP PRIMER. APPLIES SMOOTHLY AND FEELS WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> This primer is the bomb.com!, I absolutely love it! It leaves your face feeling sooo soft and silky! My makeup last longer than it would without it! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! This primer is AMAZING! It goes on smoothly and makes your face feel so soft! It also helps your make up last longer through out the day. I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a primer for a while &amp; came across this one &amp; decided to take the plunge &amp; purchase it. I have sensitive skin so I am extremely cautious about what I put on my face. The first time I used this was Christmas day and I was pleasently surprised. It had my face feeling like silk, but not oily. I&#x27;ve never felt my face so smooth. I did apply moisturizer allowed it to dry then applied primer let it dry and applied my makeup as usual. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on other good reviews.  Performs as promised:  minimizes pores and fine lines, skin feels amazing, and foundation make up lasts all day!  I have tried more expensive products for the same purpose and had wasted my money.  I will continue to use Best Foundation and Makeup face primer!</li>
            <li> I have been asked what I&#x27;m using in my skin! And only after I day or first use I noticed it blended my blotchy skin! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this primer, it makes my skin look and feel flawless! I have actually bought two bottles of it and will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I love how it feels on my skin...very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again. I loved it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best primer I have ever used</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve never used anything like this.. I have used many of these primers, but this one really does what it says! I have the worst oily skin, putting powder on every other hour, we were getting ready to go on vacation to the beach, I was sweating, took 3 hours to get there, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to my make up, I didn&#x27;t put any powder on, after we got there and unpacked, I had face timed my mom to let her know we got there. She had said I looked really good, I just thought you know mom says you look good even when you look horrible lol.. I went to the bathroom, I was shocked, my skin was as fresh as if I just did my make up! It gave me that air brushed look, I have large pores, uneven skin color, I was like wow!! It&#x27;s like someone shackled my face nice and smooth, but you can&#x27;t feel it on, it&#x27;s not heavy at all!! If you have oily skin, large pores, uneven colored skin, you have got to try this, I even looked younger! I normally don&#x27;t look my age, I got my moms genes lol, she&#x27;s 76 and looks like shes 60!! Thank you mom! I&#x27;m 46, people have assumed I was in my early thirties! And now with this stuff, I look even better and younger!! I will continue to use this and buy it again!!!! It&#x27;s definitly worth a try!!! I just bought my mom some lol, she wanted this stuff after she saw how good my skin looked...</li>
            <li> This is the BEST primer ever!!! It&#x27;s lightweight, soft and does its job!! The only thing I wish they offered is a bigger bottle. This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Great primer! Makes my face really smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of primers,my makeup by 5 slid off my face,as a53 year old woman with huge pores,this one did the job!!!best primer ever!a bit gloppy but if you use damp fingers and let it set for about 2 min perfect.even in 93 degree heat!</li>
            <li> I was just able to start using it , I had poison ivy and needed it to be gone. I m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am 56 years old, and don&#x27;t wear makeup very often because it can actually make my skin look older. This product, however, creates a smooth service on my face so that my makeup glides on and stays smooth and even throughout the day and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different primers, but most seem to dissolve into my skin as the day wears on, leaving my skin tone blotchy and uneven . This primer is different though. When I take off my makeup at night, my skin is still smooth and silky to the touch. I recommend this to anyone who gets frustrated with their makeup not staying fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like foundation at all. I dread using it because most are heavy and don&#x27;t let me face breath. This however, is not like that. It is light and goes on well. It leaves a soft natural look and my makeup goes on over it without issue.</li>
            <li> Not impressed! Doesn&#x27;t really hold my makeup on even for an hour. Not worth your money!!</li>
            <li> I really recommend it in love with this product</li>
            <li> I got bad acne when I used this.  Could be from what I was eating, just not sure.  Silicones can cause acne though.</li>
            <li> I never used a silicone primer before but I did notice the difference. My foundation goes on smooth and the product itself goes on very smooth as well. Its almost like a gel consistency and you skin is baby soft after you glide in on your face.  I recommend this if you have fine lines and want to cover them up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before, but I must say I am very impressed with how it kept my makeup in place all day.</li>
            <li> Nice product..works fine.I think the conistency is slightly different than I had expected. It appears to be doing its job as a primer. The packaging is very nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always review things on Amazon, but when I do the product is either exceptional or horrible. In this case it&#x27;s exceptional. I have used so many different face primers in my life I have lost count. This primer is the best one I have ever used hands down. I just bought my second bottle and didn&#x27;t even notice it comes in a bigger size until I had already clicked &amp;#34;place my order&amp;#34; I will totally order the bigger size next time. This stuff is like magic. It makes my skin smooth and soft, it evens everything out and just makes my skin a perfect surface. It makes my foundation last longer and look better. I put this on even when I don&#x27;t have time to do my makeup because it makes my skin so soft and my boyfriend loves it. Seriously you want kissable lips? Spread a drop of this on them with some chap stick and its better than any lip softening bull I&#x27;ve ever encountered. Seriously if you are shopping around and trying to decide just order this, stop searching. This is it. Buy this.</li>
            <li> I totally love this primer! It works very great on my skin and im a black girl!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!  The way it feels on my face is amazing and it is great under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It is like liquid silk.  Non-greasy, non-oily.  This primer DOES work well, very well.  I gave it the ultimate test the first time I used it.  On a hot/humid day, I wore this under my Bare Minerals, &amp; went dancing.  Put it on about 9:30 am, danced for about 4 hours, it was hot &amp; humid.  Went to dinner afterwards, arrived home about 7:00 &amp; my make-up looked as good as it did when I put it on.  No smears, runs, streaks.  I am truly impressed w/this product.  So much better than what I had expected. Have sensitive skin, &amp; NO issues.  It really leaves your skin feeling so smooth.  It holds up well in hot &amp; humid weather.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a new user of face primer. I like this product. It works quite well - no makeup creases or smudges. Nice and fresh all day. Love that it is colorless as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I finish the product before I wrote a review. This face primer at first seemed okay it went on a really smooth and silky seemIng to somewhat keep my makeup in place but not really it turned out more oily than anything. my biggest problem with this was by the time I was down to the last couple weeks of use the product again falling apart literally I couldn&#x27;t rub it between my fingers without it turning into a little Goo balls..it wouldn&#x27;t even rub on my face and if I did manage to get some.to smooth on it broke me out. Not a natural product not one I would recommend for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman and when I use this product; I look and feel 30 - Since I have been using, I&#x27;ve received many compliments and even asked if I got &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done!  I will be a long time customer.  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> not what expected for the money</li>
            <li> Feels very smooth unfortunately I have sensitive skin and it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to work for the owner of this company and received a sample bottle. I loved it and recently ran out of it so I bought 1 for myself! I have such problematic skin and it was so hard to find a primer for me. This primer is just so awesome. I also read reviews that you should let it sink in first for a few minutes, I do at least 15 mins before applying foundation and its just wonderful. My foundation goes on nicely and smoothly and my makeup just looks good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this primer!!!</li>
            <li> makes face slippery and very soft feeling but do not think i will purchase again. Not worth the price to me</li>
            <li> Almost complete formula of dimethicone formulations. No no according to Environmental  Working Group. My fault in not checking out  what was in it.  Can&#x27;t really trust companies as they want to sell. Often such products seem to be superior, but at what a cost eventually to your health.</li>
            <li> Awful. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Does nothing for my makeup.</li>
            <li> It made no difference rather if I left it on for 2 minutes or 20 before applying my makeup. Yes, my makeup went on nice and stays on but, nothing my $11 primer couldn&#x27;t do also. Not anything special and the price is too high.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too greasy and you have to wait ages before applying makeup wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I have to have it in makeup routine now.Very light and feels good to the touch not greassy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this primer, applies and feels like silk on your face. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations for a good face primer - fine lines and large pores were not smoothed over like you would expect them to be - this product did not make my makeup last longer - about 4 hours into my day and I was having to touch up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M 56 YEARS YOUNG AND THIS IS THE FIRST PRIMER I HAVE EVER USED. I LOVE IT!!! NOW MY MAKE-UP LOOKS FRESH ALL DAY AND INTO THE EVENING!!!!!! EVEN MY HUSBAD WHISTLED AT ME YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS. IT HELPS ME FEEL FRESH AND YOUNGER FEELING WHEN I KNOW MY MAKE-UP IS LOOKING FRESH! I WILL BE USING THIS PRIMER EVERYDAY FOR LIFE FROM NOW ON!!! AND IT COMES IN A REALLY CUTE LITTLE BOTTLE THAT FITS EASILY INTO MY MAKE-UP BAG SO I CAN TAKE IT WITH ME ON OVER NIGHTERS! ALSO A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY.... THANK-YOU</li>
            <li> Makes my already oil skin even worse. Make up still wares off easily.</li>
            <li> but without the price! nice. i used to use the revlon primer which worked great (and is a few dollars cheaper than this when i last bought it) but it had that weird glue/B.O. smell that i couldn&#x27;t take anymore. i have also used smashbox and love that but this has no parabens (which is great) and also has the same feel to it as smashbox. i would highly recomment</li>
            <li> the stuff works great!! the consistency is interesting! it looks matte-ish when you squirt a dab into your hand. Overall love this primer, not shiny which is nice too. Works great, makes my make up last all day and night! thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I had previously only used Arbonne&#x27;s facial primer, and truly liked it.  I decided to give this a try based on the cost and great reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did, it is half the cost and equal in quality to my previous brand.  Update:  I hadn&#x27;t thought to check the ounces for comparison of the two products until I ran out quickly of this one.  It is in fact half the product amount and brings the price to equal that of the Arbonne primer.</li>
            <li> Works well, great price. Quick shipping</li>
            <li> This foundation primer is very thick.  If it was thinner it would be much better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.bswitched from lancome primer bc of price. This is thicker than I expected but it works a lot better than lancome so now I prefer the thickness. Gives my skin a silky finish and doesn&#x27;t agitate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff. It is smooth and silky. Feels different than the others I have tried. It does not seem to make me break out like another product I had been using.</li>
            <li> Primer was good. A little goes a long way or it will feel heavy</li>
            <li> My make-up lasts all day long even I work from 8am to 3pm and play soccer from 6pm to 8pm.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product! I have combination oily and dry skin.  This silky smooth primer keeps my face shine free yet soft all day long and helps my makeup go on easy and last so much longer. I love that there is no air in the bottle and one little pump is the perfect amount for my whole face. My daughter and I both love it. Great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard that makeup face primer can help &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; ice pick scars from acne. I don&#x27;t know how much it really helps with the scars but it makes my skin feel amazing! My make up does last a lot longer with it on as well. The bottle is small but you only need a small amount. It&#x27;s a better value than I expected when I saw just how small the bottle was. You really don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel silky soft and allow your make up to stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to help as much as I thought it would with my ice pick scars, but it still is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Wow this really makes a HUGE difference when I apply my daily foundation. It gives your skin a very smooth undercoat and helps foundation gone on so smooth and sleek. I like to mix a bit of foundation with it and it gives a more natural overall look to my skin. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Second time .love the product.</li>
            <li> I rated this product earlier giving it a lower rating because of the pump not working. Loved the product just didn&#x27;t like digging it out with a q-tip. I received an email from &amp;#34;Denise&amp;#34; from the company stating she was sending me another bottle free of charge. It arrived today ( a Saturday I might add) and I&#x27;m upgrading my review. The product really does deserve 5 stars, and even if the second pump doesn&#x27;t work well I have plenty of the primer to last me a while so I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Doesn&#x27;t do a thing. Makes enlarged pores even more prominent</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price! I&#x27;ve tried several other primers that cost a lot more and I feel that this works as well as, maybe even better than most. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth! It also makes my foundation go on so much easier and stay on all day. I would definitely recommend this and I plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I Really like this product. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts &amp; I tend to be sensitive to a lot of face products. It&#x27;s my first clear primer but feel like it makes a better canvas than the tinted that I&#x27;ve used before. I love the silky feel too. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this primer and have bought it repeatedly - I have tried many over time but this is absolutely the best and goes on smooth, helping my make-up to stay on for the entire day.  Also allows the application to go on evenly!</li>
            <li> My skin so soft and silk. Easy apply foundation. My foundation stays longer than before. Thank you for good primer everüòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve found, really like!</li>
