    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Totally wonderful lip balm.</li>
            <li>but it seems the chapstick brand is just the best value.  </li>
            <li>FEELS WONDERFUL</li>
            <li>This mint and minerals by Nivea has the perfect combination of everything!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li>It is the best lip balm ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip stuff ever!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love both!!!</li>
            <li>in all... a great lip balm, with an excellent package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awhile ago, I purchased Nivea&#x27;s A Kiss of Smoothness, and thought that it was great.  </li>
            <li>And so glad to have found it again, thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>) case was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be good because of the minerals and the mint flavor.</li>
            <li>While traveling in Holland I found a lip balm that I loved, this one is the closest I&#x27;ve found stateside.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my lips as A Kiss of Smoothness.  </li>
            <li>These two reasons are why I am not giving this product five stars, but I still consider it a good purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Stated it was a good mint flavor.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t sting, it has the perfect cool feeling without making you feel like you put a ice cube on your lips.</li>
            <li>Nivea makes your lips feel great, it has a very light mint smell.</li>
            <li>This has a very light menthol taste and smell that is very pleasant and appropriate for men, women, and kids.  </li>
            <li>Within a day, my lips were markedly better, and the product felt great when I applied it to my lips.  </li>
            <li>so I was very glad to find it.</li>
            <li>Flavor is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I bought one of these in a store somewhere and have never been able to find it since!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>and it makes my lips feel nice.</li>
            <li>and she stated she liked it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of  glossy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the Chapstick brand because I feel that it doesn&#x27;t spread on my lips very well, nor does it do a very good moisturizing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I linked the 6 pack because that&#x27;s the best price on Amazon so far.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is very smooth when applying and leaves your lips feeling very smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love all the Nivea products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it didn&#x27;t feel like I had anything on my lips.</li>
            <li>This is an okay chap stick.</li>
            <li>I love the mint and minerals combo.</li>
            <li>Not tingly but still so refreshing.</li>

            <li>It is a pretty good product, which is worth its price.</li>

            <li>also really love the Nivea Kiss of Olive Oil &amp; Lemon Moisture Rich lip balm and alternate between the two to keep things interesting [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just perfect, it isn&#x27;t even really minty, it&#x27;s subtle &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>So soft and smell so light, I love it.</li>
            <li>so far Jack Black&#x27;s lip balms are the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s summer, so my lips can get very chapped in the warm dry air, but this stuff seems to protect for a quite a while and the minty flavor/tingly feeling is cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>this makes my lips so soft and the mint taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is good for normal lips that are chapped, but not dry....</li>
            <li>Great hydration and creates a nice layer of protection from the elements but is not waxy, thick, or gross.</li>
            <li>This goes on a bit like a gloss, but it&#x27;s not slick or greasy, just light and quite soothing.</li>
            <li>Lightly mint, soft sheen, not waxy.</li>
            <li>This balm keeps my lips so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in quality lip balm, this should be your choice.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to figure out what ingredient it is in lip balm that makes the back of my throat itch, but it&#x27;s NOT in this balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite flavor, but it&#x27;s the only Nivea I could find via Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your lips soft and it has a fresh minty smell to it!</li>
            <li>The carmax stick does a better job at soothing dry lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to open it up, apply some lip balm, and replace the cover.  </li>
            <li>The mint is an added bonus, the slight tingling feels nice.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and left lips hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My wife really swears by this stuff and pays a premium over chapstick to use it.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip treatment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always try new lip balms or chapsticks but now as I am getting older</li>
            <li>The product was sealed so you know that it&#x27;s a brand new.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, last a few hours (depending on conditions), and has a nice flavor.  </li>
            <li>Once that stick ran out, I decided to give Mint and Minerals a chance simply because it sounded pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;It travels well, and stays solid even in a hot</li>
            <li>Still searching for that one with that WOW factor.</li>
            <li>SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>During the winter, my lips become very chapped, and I always keep some type of moisturizer nearby, which I use on my lips several times a day.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I buy Nivea products frequently.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick, goes up and down with ease; my wife always wants it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of having the typical small cap that&#x27;s easy to lose, this Nivea lip balm comes with a large sturdy cap that covers about 3/4 of the tube.  </li>
            <li>It is as refreshing as a tall cold glass of water on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can stand sweet lip balms, the last thing I want to taste all day is crappy fruit flavored lip balm, it taste so fake and sweet and gross.</li>

            <li> Still searching for that one with that WOW factor.</li>
            <li> SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> During the winter, my lips become very chapped, and I always keep some type of moisturizer nearby, which I use on my lips several times a day.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I buy Nivea products frequently.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, goes up and down with ease; my wife always wants it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of having the typical small cap that&#x27;s easy to lose, this Nivea lip balm comes with a large sturdy cap that covers about 3/4 of the tube.  </li>
            <li> It is as refreshing as a tall cold glass of water on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can stand sweet lip balms, the last thing I want to taste all day is crappy fruit flavored lip balm, it taste so fake and sweet and gross.</li>
            <li> and when I get back home I run to it like its a long lost relative.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this especially in the dry heat.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this brand and flavor for anyone who uses chapstick or lives in a dry weather state.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does not dry out the lips like other chap sticks.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this above the other lip cremes because when the cap is on you can&#x27;t accidently turn it up and have everything gush out.</li>
            <li> I put it back in and am very careful with handling it.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t soothe dry lips.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it is long-wearing, so one tube will last you quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Found it to actually dry out my lips instead of moisturize them!</li>
            <li> I love that it works and doesn&#x27;t get too greasy or have a bad taste</li>
            <li> I have bought several lip balms on Amazon in the past week searching for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of lip balms for winter and</li>
            <li> She has done that with other types</li>
            <li> I like the slight minty flavor and smell, but if mints not you thing Nivea has other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; to chose from ...</li>
            <li> But I prefer popping off a lid to the twist up, twist down applicator.</li>
            <li> Kiss of Mint and Minerals does the job as well as any other product, but it doesn&#x27;t taste of mint at all, which is a little bit of a let down.  </li>
            <li> Just slightly minty.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;m out and if I forget it, I have to use another brand or flavor and the whole time I am so mad</li>
            <li> No more small caps to fumble with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this plenty while traveling up north over the holidays and during the current cold spell in the south.</li>
            <li> I seem to always seem to come back to the one balm that makes winter not seem so bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on thick but isn&#x27;t thin either.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Because in Maine it gets really cold and with that cold comes wind which means it&#x27;s chapped ill season.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> It leaves your lips soft and it has a fresh minty smell to it! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this , it is very helpful in all seasons.  The lips will look as if nothing has been applied.</li>
            <li> The price is cheap and it works wonderful. I like the minty smell and it makes my lips feel nice. One of my current favorites.</li>
            <li> I love all the Nivea products. They stay on the lips for a good time and keep them moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this lip care, the mint makes it very refreshing and yet not too much, it does the right jobs on protecting my lips!</li>
            <li> Goes on light and left lips hydrated.  I love the fact it didn&#x27;t feel like I had anything on my lips.</li>
            <li> This is an okay chap stick. It&#x27;s does not dry out the lips like other chap sticks. However, it doesn&#x27;t soothe dry lips. The carmax stick does a better job at soothing dry lips. This is good for normal lips that are chapped, but not dry....if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Lightly mint, soft sheen, not waxy. But I prefer popping off a lid to the twist up, twist down applicator. Prefer it to the Bee brand, but prefer Bronner&#x27;s over this one.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the Add-on program on Amazon. Thought it would be good because of the minerals and the mint flavor. Found it to actually dry out my lips instead of moisturize them! Very disappointing. I have bought several lip balms on Amazon in the past week searching for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of lip balms for winter and so far Jack Black&#x27;s lip balms are the best. I rate them 4 stars. Still searching for that one with that WOW factor.</li>
            <li> I love that it works and doesn&#x27;t get too greasy or have a bad taste either if I were to accidentally lick my lips.</li>
            <li> I love the mint and minerals combo. Flavor is very light and pleasant. Just slightly minty. Not tingly but still so refreshing. This balm keeps my lips so smooth and soft. I&#x27;m obsessed. Great hydration and creates a nice layer of protection from the elements but is not waxy, thick, or gross. So nice and gentle, I put it on my baby sometimes and she loves it. Fantastic! Totally wonderful lip balm. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the Nivea Kiss of Olive Oil &amp; Lemon Moisture Rich lip balm and alternate between the two to keep things interesting [[ASIN:B00J407QZY Nivea A Kiss of Olive Oil &amp; Lemon Moisture Rich Lip Care (6 Pack)]]. I linked the 6 pack because that&#x27;s the best price on Amazon so far. Try it. You&#x27;ll love both!!!</li>
            <li> My wife really swears by this stuff and pays a premium over chapstick to use it. If you&#x27;re interested in quality lip balm, this should be your choice.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is very smooth when applying and leaves your lips feeling very smooth and hydrated. While traveling in Holland I found a lip balm that I loved, this one is the closest I&#x27;ve found stateside. I like the slight minty flavor and smell, but if mints not you thing Nivea has other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; to chose from ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but it seems the chapstick brand is just the best value.  I&#x27;m going to switch to doing that.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, goes up and down with ease; my wife always wants it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No lie.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to figure out what ingredient it is in lip balm that makes the back of my throat itch, but it&#x27;s NOT in this balm. This goes on a bit like a gloss, but it&#x27;s not slick or greasy, just light and quite soothing. It&#x27;s summer, so my lips can get very chapped in the warm dry air, but this stuff seems to protect for a quite a while and the minty flavor/tingly feeling is cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Nivea makes your lips feel great, it has a very light mint smell. It has just enough of everything, not too glossy</li>
            <li> this makes my lips so soft and the mint taste is refreshing. I will keep using this especially in the dry heat.</li>
            <li> FEELS WONDERFUL ON MY LIPS.&lt;br /&gt;GOES ON SMOOTH, WITHOUT PULLING MY LIPS.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE HINT OF MINT.MAKES MY LIPS SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> So soft and smell so light, I love it.</li>
            <li> This has a very light menthol taste and smell that is very pleasant and appropriate for men, women, and kids.  A little bit goes a long way, and it is long-wearing, so one tube will last you quite a while.  The only possible improvement would be added SPF for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture, lightly flavored.  Moisturizes and supports my lip balm addiction.  It&#x27;s a new favorite, and I&#x27;m glad we can find it in the US easily now.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip treatment. The packaging is why it lost a star. When I opened the tube, the lip treatment stick fell out of the container. I put it back in and am very careful with handling it. It goes on smoothly has a nice minty freshness and soften my lips.</li>
            <li> love good for lip cause my lips so dry all time</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this above the other lip cremes because when the cap is on you can&#x27;t accidently turn it up and have everything gush out. She has done that with other types so she was excited this one didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> During the winter, my lips become very chapped, and I always keep some type of moisturizer nearby, which I use on my lips several times a day.  I don&#x27;t like the Chapstick brand because I feel that it doesn&#x27;t spread on my lips very well, nor does it do a very good moisturizing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awhile ago, I purchased Nivea&#x27;s A Kiss of Smoothness, and thought that it was great.  Within a day, my lips were markedly better, and the product felt great when I applied it to my lips.  Once that stick ran out, I decided to give Mint and Minerals a chance simply because it sounded pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Kiss of Mint and Minerals does the job as well as any other product, but it doesn&#x27;t taste of mint at all, which is a little bit of a let down.  It also doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my lips as A Kiss of Smoothness.  These two reasons are why I am not giving this product five stars, but I still consider it a good purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this brand and flavor for anyone who uses chapstick or lives in a dry weather state.</li>
            <li> I like this product, except I wish it had SPF in it. I didn&#x27;t know it didn&#x27;t, otherwise I would have purchased something else. Otherwise I buy Nivea products frequently.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good product, which is worth its price. However, if you can&#x27;t accept mint, do not choose it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in a store somewhere and have never been able to find it since! I tested close to a dozen others trying to find one to take its place... None succeeded! Either they are to waxy, or make my lips burn once they have already become chapped. This mint and minerals by Nivea has the perfect combination of everything! Texture, smell, and the cool effect it has on chapped lips! Love it! And so glad to have found it again, thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Used this plenty while traveling up north over the holidays and during the current cold spell in the south. The smell is refreshing anf the twist up (like a lipstick) case was a pleasant surprise. It seems to do the job protecting and softening my lips.</li>
            <li> I love lip balm, why? Because in Maine it gets really cold and with that cold comes wind which means it&#x27;s chapped ill season. I always try new lip balms or chapsticks but now as I am getting older I seem to always seem to come back to the one balm that makes winter not seem so bad. That balm is Nivea Mint &amp; minerals. Sometimes when I&#x27;m out and if I forget it, I have to use another brand or flavor and the whole time I am so mad I forgot it and when I get back home I run to it like its a long lost relative. I can stand sweet lip balms, the last thing I want to taste all day is crappy fruit flavored lip balm, it taste so fake and sweet and gross. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invites mint &amp; minerals - t&#x27;s soothing - but it doesn&#x27;t sting, it has the perfect cool feeling without making you feel like you put a ice cube on your lips. It doesn&#x27;t go on thick but isn&#x27;t thin either. It&#x27;s just perfect. The scent/flavor isn&#x27;t fruity or gross it&#x27;s just perfect, it isn&#x27;t even really minty, it&#x27;s subtle &amp; refreshing. It is as refreshing as a tall cold glass of water on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Lip balm so much my husband buys me 12 of them for my stocking each christmas. It is the best lip balm ever.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and she stated she liked it.  Stated it was a good mint flavor. Kind of  glossy.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip stuff ever!  It is very hard to find so I was very glad to find it.</li>
            <li> I love this Nivea lip balm mostly for its packaging.  Instead of having the typical small cap that&#x27;s easy to lose, this Nivea lip balm comes with a large sturdy cap that covers about 3/4 of the tube.  It&#x27;s so easy to open it up, apply some lip balm, and replace the cover.  No more small caps to fumble with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm itself is a fine product too.  It goes on smoothly, last a few hours (depending on conditions), and has a nice flavor.  It&#x27;s not my favorite flavor, but it&#x27;s the only Nivea I could find via Subscribe and Save.  I do wish it incorporated sunscreen, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It travels well, and stays solid even in a hot car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great lip balm, with an excellent package.</li>
            <li> I liked fresh mint smell and the color is mint color too. The product was sealed so you know that it&#x27;s a brand new.</li>
            <li> My favorite! I won&#x27;t use anything besides nivea. I love the smooth feel. The mint is an added bonus, the slight tingling feels nice.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips soft and smooth! Love it!!</li>
