            <li>Kind of regret buying this product.</li>
            <li>, I can feel my face skin is getting brighter and better.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s clean in there.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find these imported here in the US.</li>
            <li>I used the full line of these in Japan.</li>
            <li>I got items very earlier than the expected date, what a happy thing!</li>
            <li>30 Masks are not in their own convenient storage container,but like wet paper towels packed together</li>
            <li>Less water, face mask is so bad,I never use this products again,how even is cheap,the products sure let customer fill comfortable after used it.</li>
            <li>Using a sticker to close the opening of the container isn&#x27;t convenient really.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and each of the masks felt different.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The only thing I have an issue with is the closure. Using a sticker to close the opening of the container isn&#x27;t convenient really.</li>
            <li> Received has been damaged, there is no way to use.</li>
            <li> It is just ok.the package of mask is so simply.</li>
            <li> I received this product with broken bottom that liquid flow out from that hole... put all the masks to a bowl to use it TT&lt;br /&gt;be careful about the package damaging!</li>
            <li> The masks are a little small for my face.</li>
            <li> I got items very earlier than the expected date, what a happy thing! I use it every day, I can feel my face skin is getting brighter and better.</li>
            <li> The package broke last time, I sent feedback twice, no reply</li>
            <li> the blue box was broken when i recieved. The masks were almost dry. Very bad package. Can use it anymore and be careful to buy it.</li>
            <li> The package of this product was broken. All liquid poured out and masks were dry.</li>
            <li> the wife loves these Help even out skin tone.</li>
            <li> 30 Masks are not in their own convenient storage container,but like wet paper towels packed together</li>
            <li> I used the full line of these in Japan. The price was right, and each of the masks felt different. These are supposed to whiten, but I use other whitening things. Anyway, all together, it works. These are not individually wrapped, but they don&#x27;t dry out in the months it takes me to go through them. I&#x27;m careful when I pull masks out so I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s clean in there. I was excited to find these imported here in the US. Pricier than Japan, but cheaper than comparable products here. Sold!</li>
            <li> There is not much liquid on the sheet. Kind of regret buying this product. The mask will dry off only after about five minutes you put on.</li>
            <li> Less water, face mask is so bad,I never use this products again,how even is cheap,the products sure let customer fill comfortable after used it.</li>
