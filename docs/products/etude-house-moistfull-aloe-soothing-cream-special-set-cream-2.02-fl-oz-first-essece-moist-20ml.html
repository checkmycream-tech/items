    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>cream feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>I am also not a fan of the somewhat floral scent of the product but it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My came in good condition not like others leak etc.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>Good products,</li>
            <li>I love this product and bought it twice already!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>I really like this, the cream is the best part.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>The gel has been the most effective component of this set for me.  </li>
            <li>This feels great and absorbs quickly into the skin which is important to me in a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but I just make sure my hands are washed before applying because I&#x27;m a germaphobe when it comes to my hands touching my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight too and feels great.</li>
            <li>I thought it came with the spoon also, should of read more comments.  </li>
            <li>Lovely aroma and feels like water in the skin.</li>
            <li>the cream, my favorite.</li>
            <li>I still love this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the essence.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Etude House Moistfull Collagen cream over the aloe though because I feel my skin responds better to it from an anti-aging perspective.  </li>
            <li>I love their products but felt I had better results from the Collagen cream.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product!</li>
            <li>For my combination skin (quite dry cheeks/forehead), it is perfect as a lighter weight moisturizer under makeup.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky, very light, absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li>This a great product I recomanded but just to let u guys know that white spoon looking thingy is not included with the order.</li>
            <li>I also dotted this all around my face and lightly rubbed/patted into my skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is SO SMOOTH like glossy butter.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin by the way.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when applying make-up I use this cream as a primer because I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything else to smooth over pores or make my bb cream stay on longer.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer that leaves the skin soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>The cream has a light fresh scent and a light consistency as well, but it&#x27;s not as a watery or gel feeling as I was expecting (because I&#x27;ve seen reviews from the Collagen Moistfull Cream).</li>
            <li>Part of me is glad we do not have the stores in the U.S., as it is easy to go a bit wild!  </li>
            <li>The first essence does leave my skin tacky; it&#x27;s supposed to; this is where knowing the routine and what to expect really come in handy.</li>
            <li>The essence is just okay, more of an extra moisture bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to for face creams :).</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, with a light aloe scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to calm the redness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Some people seemed to have problems with the first essence bottle being cracked or leaking, but for me, both bottles were intact and full.</li>
            <li>The Soothing Cream is very nice and smells lovely, but the First Essence did absolutely nothing for me (good nor bad).  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was good</li>
            <li>While I noticed an improvement in the texture and comfort of my face right away, the effect has been cumulative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sunburn healed faster &amp; the redness was greatly reduced in a few days!</li>
            <li>recommend having a good understanding of the basic Korean skincare routine before purchasing this product so that you can get the most out of it, mostly due to the sample of first essence.</li>
            <li>I love this formula, especially during summer months.  </li>
            <li>Essence is a bit sticky at first, but your probably using too much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like them as much as I do the Soothing Gel.  </li>
            <li>This is what really helped me with my sunburn.</li>
            <li>My skin stopped peeling after 3 days &amp; my skin didn&#x27;t burn, it really felt cooling &amp; soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has really helped.</li>
            <li>First off, my skin type: acne prone, sensitive, combination, and dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is okay, broke me out a little, but it was sort of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to absorb, so, like with most Korean skin care products, be patient.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and after using it a few days, the skin on my face has felt seemingly softer.</li>
            <li>that my skin is normal again</li>
            <li>The aloe serum is been used but the aloe cream is brand new.</li>
            <li>Only put a dime size on your middle finger and lightly dot it over your face.</li>
            <li>It distributes evenly and leaves your skin really soft and</li>
            <li>나의 skin is 정말로 soft &amp; I</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s with combination/dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The bottle wasn&#x27;t broken so the top must had been unscrewed or something.</li>
            <li>I typically use just the cream during the day and then apply the cream after the First Essence after cleansing at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in a very dry (high desert) climate for about a month.</li>
            <li>marked it down a star because amazon is really nipping you guys some $$ on these Asian products!</li>
            <li>essence has the same scent and it lingers a little, also it gives a little bit more hydrate if you applied it underneath the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> really smoothed down my rough skin</li>
            <li> But for now, I highly recommend the Aloe version if you do not like or need a heavy,  mask-like cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, a few months ago I got extremely bad sunburn, so for my face was sore, skin was peeling, lips were cracking, redness overload &amp; many of my moisturizers weren&#x27;t penetrating my skin, or leaving a greasy film, THIS however is very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pat it in for 30 sec all over, wait a min before applying cream or serum whatever you do next</li>
            <li> It actually comes faster than expected!</li>
            <li> skin is very dry and this is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried countless moisturizers that, when coupled with any type of foundation, leave my face feeling oily within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It instantly relieves any tightness from cleansing, yet leaves absolutely no greasy feeling behind.  </li>
            <li> that i don&#x27;t breakout into a rash like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll probably be a little too heavy once summer time gets here though.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small.</li>
            <li> The essence is really small but it lasts long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> our climate goes from humid to cold and dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t come with the small spatula(?)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This a great product I recomanded but just to let u guys know that white spoon looking thingy is not included with the order.</li>
            <li> The aloe serum is been used but the aloe cream is brand new.</li>
            <li> When I received this product a lot of the serum had leaked out. I am also not a fan of the somewhat floral scent of the product but it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set from an Etude House store while on a business trip to Singapore.  Part of me is glad we do not have the stores in the U.S., as it is easy to go a bit wild!  I love this formula, especially during summer months.  It instantly relieves any tightness from cleansing, yet leaves absolutely no greasy feeling behind.  For my combination skin (quite dry cheeks/forehead), it is perfect as a lighter weight moisturizer under makeup.  I have tried countless moisturizers that, when coupled with any type of foundation, leave my face feeling oily within a few hours.  Using the product alone, you can actually feel skin continuing to get softer and smoother after each application.  I typically use just the cream during the day and then apply the cream after the First Essence after cleansing at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Collagen Moistfull version (peach-colored packaging)and will give that a try as winter arrives and our climate goes from humid to cold and dry.  But for now, I highly recommend the Aloe version if you do not like or need a heavy,  mask-like cream.</li>
            <li> To get it out of the way...there is no spatula included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream feels wonderful. It is very moisturizing, with a light aloe scent. It takes a few minutes to absorb, so, like with most Korean skin care products, be patient. It&#x27;s especially soothing after a day in the sunlight and wind. I&#x27;ve been using it in a very dry (high desert) climate for about a month. While I noticed an improvement in the texture and comfort of my face right away, the effect has been cumulative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend having a good understanding of the basic Korean skincare routine before purchasing this product so that you can get the most out of it, mostly due to the sample of first essence. Yes, it IS a sample. The bottle is small. That being said, one only needs a small drop of the stuff for each use; the size of a dime is too much. The first essence does leave my skin tacky; it&#x27;s supposed to; this is where knowing the routine and what to expect really come in handy.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product. The cream has a light fresh scent and a light consistency as well, but it&#x27;s not as a watery or gel feeling as I was expecting (because I&#x27;ve seen reviews from the Collagen Moistfull Cream). It distributes evenly and leaves your skin really soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The essence has the same scent and it lingers a little, also it gives a little bit more hydrate if you applied it underneath the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It didn&#x27;t come with the spatula.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product! Some people seemed to have problems with the first essence bottle being cracked or leaking, but for me, both bottles were intact and full.

            <li> 사랑 this product 나는 can&#x27;t get enough of it. It&#x27;s 최고 i 정말로 정말로 like it. 나의 skin is 정말로 soft &amp; I 사랑 that i don&#x27;t breakout into a rash like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this product and bought it twice already! It actually comes faster than expected!</li>
            <li> Good products, but I don&#x27;t like them as much as I do the Soothing Gel.  The gel has been the most effective component of this set for me.  The Soothing Cream is very nice and smells lovely, but the First Essence did absolutely nothing for me (good nor bad).  I will be repurchasing just the gel and the cream when I run out.</li>
            <li> I really like this, the cream is the best part. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months every day and the essence is almost gone but there&#x27;s still plenty of cream &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;Only marked it down a star because amazon is really nipping you guys some $$ on these Asian products! I bought this on Ebay for $10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, a few months ago I got extremely bad sunburn, so for my face was sore, skin was peeling, lips were cracking, redness overload &amp; many of my moisturizers weren&#x27;t penetrating my skin, or leaving a greasy film, THIS however is very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Essence is a bit sticky at first, but your probably using too much. Only put a dime size on your middle finger and lightly dot it over your face. Pat it in for 30 sec all over, wait a min before applying cream or serum whatever you do next so it can absorb &amp; the stickiness will go away.&lt;br /&gt;This really smoothed down my rough skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the cream, my favorite. I also dotted this all around my face and lightly rubbed/patted into my skin. The texture is SO SMOOTH like glossy butter. Not sticky, very light, absorbs so quickly. This is what really helped me with my sunburn. My sunburn healed faster &amp; the redness was greatly reduced in a few days! My skin stopped peeling after 3 days &amp; my skin didn&#x27;t burn, it really felt cooling &amp; soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out I&#x27;m going to buy the jumbo size of this cream. The essence is just okay, more of an extra moisture bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Now that my skin is normal again I still love this. It never over-moisturizes my face, never gets greasy or oily. I have combination skin by the way.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when applying make-up I use this cream as a primer because I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything else to smooth over pores or make my bb cream stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This has really helped. I think it&#x27;ll probably be a little too heavy once summer time gets here though. I LOVE the essence. I wish it came with a bigger bottle. It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> The cream wasn&#x27;t damaged but the essence was spilled inside. The bottle wasn&#x27;t broken so the top must had been unscrewed or something. Other than that it was good oh and</li>
            <li> This feels great and absorbs quickly into the skin which is important to me in a moisturizer.  I prefer the Etude House Moistfull Collagen cream over the aloe though because I feel my skin responds better to it from an anti-aging perspective.  I am in my early 30&#x27;s with combination/dry skin.  I love their products but felt I had better results from the Collagen cream.</li>
            <li> First off, my skin type: acne prone, sensitive, combination, and dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is okay, broke me out a little, but it was sort of moisturizing.</li>
