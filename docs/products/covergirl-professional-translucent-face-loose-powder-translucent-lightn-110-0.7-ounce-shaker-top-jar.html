            <li>However, this does cover nicely, smells great and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Works great to keep me shine free.</li>
            <li>consistency of the powder is thicker than mineral, so it doesn&#x27;t come out of the holes effectively.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell</li>
            <li>The color seems to blend well with a  range of skin tones, and it has a nice smell to it.</li>

            <li>But the product is so nice that I overlook that.</li>

            <li>This powder is quite nice for the price.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>, the color fits perfectly and the size is very convenient -not</li>
            <li>Nice translucent powder.</li>

            <li>It still smells very nice and goes on smoothly.  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff always an amazing product thank u</li>

            <li>Great product, great pricing, does not need to reapplied constantly.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love powder over liquid.</li>
            <li>do like how you can twist the hole section to close it off (prevents spilling, since the top just pulls on and off</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>So glad I re-ordered it</li>
            <li>As always thank you Amazon :-)</li>
            <li>Cheap product for a matte look!</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this powder by Cover Girl; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>So much better, than the pressed powder.</li>
            <li>I love how the coverage of the powder into my face and also i love the color it matches my skin</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It takes away the shine so much better than compact powder.</li>
            <li>It sets your makeup quite well too :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use most foundations, they make my face feel suffocated.</li>
            <li>So most of my life I&#x27;ve gone without.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many, many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I applied it on top of my make it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a better product out there than this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping to find something better.</li>
            <li>a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li>I love this powder</li>
            <li>and I just love the way it goes on and stays on it</li>
            <li>I applied the power once in the morning and once more after about 5 hours just to refresh my face.</li>
            <li>but I always come back to this product it works great for me and its a good price.</li>
            <li>I order 2 of these and both of them were busted on the top.  </li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>love covergirl..</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that if you have to draw on your eyebrows</li>
            <li>And no nasty powder puff to contend with.</li>
            <li>It almost just sits on top.</li>
            <li>I love love love that I could order this powder on Amazon for a lower price AND not have to search through every container on the shelves for my color!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>powder will not cake up, feels light and airy, and has a nice tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on oily/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>way to finish a makeup look by creating an airbrushed affect to the skin and sets your foundation :)</li>
            <li>Everything is ok besides the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the powder puff that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I just apply more power and maybe another layer of mascara</li>
            <li>I find this product to be outstanding , I recommend it to all to have in your makeup collection .</li>
            <li>Gave it as gift and they love it, thank you :-)</li>
            <li>and I must say i love how weightless it is.</li>
            <li>Most face powders I&#x27;ve used the packaging is flimsy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Kind of light and see through</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time and gives a flawless look that I love.</li>
            <li>It smells weired but it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are looking for something cheap and wonderful at the same time.</li>
            <li>i love covergirl products, this goes on light and no irritation</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love CoverGirl and all their products but this one&#x27;s my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>it spilling easily or anything.</li>
            <li>The puff it comes with has been easy to use and I have not had any clumping or issues.</li>
            <li>I get allergy just because of the hideous strong smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell when you are putting it on.  </li>
            <li>product is fine but the lid cracked and broke very quickly after receiving it</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging was really nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>so I just use a brush and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Works Fine</li>
            <li>This loose powder is very good</li>
            <li>eventhough I bought Light color.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>You can lightly brush it onto your face and you don&#x27;t wind up with cakey looking makeup.  </li>
            <li>THis product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I ordered medium and use it to lightly dust my face for a finished look.  </li>
            <li>And its a light powder that covers.</li>
            <li>This powder smooth paste clothes.</li>
            <li>Right when I got it I put some on and I love how it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I apply this on top of eye primer, and it blends right in with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It had a very distinct perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It is so light, quick, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The powder itself is alright, it&#x27;s not the best quality, but for the price the actual powder itself is decent</li>
            <li>it goes on great as a finish or even by itself,  offers beautiful coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and cakey at all.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good powder, just don&#x27;t use too much or it looks cakey..</li>
            <li>It is packaged well and has the familiar smell I remember from being a teenager.  </li>
            <li>Although I love Covergirl products, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this powder</li>
            <li>It has a sort of clean soapy scent to it which I adore</li>
            <li>I love how it really keeps my face free from oiliness for a maximum of almost eight hours.</li>
            <li>I always buy this make up powder, and I&#x27;m glad I can just order it right here on Amazon and have it come right to my house.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have foundation caked on so much that I look like plastic or that my face will melt off in the rain :)</li>
            <li>the holes allow too much powder to come through into the top, which also contributes to the mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but doesn&#x27;t cover enough for me</li>
            <li>Overall good.</li>
            <li>It is full of glitter</li>
            <li>This foundation is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>It will not compare to Mary Kay products, but works for a quick application when in a hurry.</li>
            <li>My new favorite powder.</li>
            <li>It also leave me looking more natural whilst covering up any flaws.</li>
            <li>But it was worth it here.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive and it isn’t safe.</li>
            <li>Helped soak up some oil and keep my make-up looking fresh longer.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>However the description needs to be changed or they need to send the right product.</li>
            <li>the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on the right way.</li>
            <li>I still decided to open the package and I love what I got.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recomend to buy it as long as you don&#x27;t mind the powder smell, becuase it really does go on the face really nice</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>the top already cracked - I am not rough with my makeup materials, this container seems to be very flimsy</li>
            <li>I use translucent face powder to touch up my makeup and also after I first apply liquid foundation in the morning.</li>
            <li>[...] Thanks!</li>
            <li>so i think it is really light and natural.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I expected/wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>For the price it is great and boy does it last a long time.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using translucent face powder</li>
            <li>Stays on good and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face like some makeup do.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very helpful for my skin, I currently wear a liquid foundation and applied this make up very lightly after my foundation and It reduced the greasy/oily look</li>
            <li>At 43 years old I wanted a little coverage occasionally &amp; thus powder worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>With this it pretty much stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The powder itself was light weight, soaked up the oil on my skin leaving it fresh all day long and provided coverage for my blemishes.</li>
            <li>They suggest using the enclosed buffing pad to capture the powder for application, but I gave up on that immediately and used my large makeup brush...</li>
            <li>There are pre-cut holes for the powder to come through which are rather large</li>
            <li>my favorite loose powder to set my liquid foundation</li>
            <li>Have been using this CG loose powder for years and just love.</li>
            <li>LOVE this loose powder.  </li>
            <li>Love Cover Girl loose powder.</li>
            <li>Been using this loose powder for many years</li>
            <li>I love this loose powder.</li>
            <li>Love the loose powder over the pressed.  </li>
            <li>, it has a little fragance, but its nice.</li>
            <li>Nice, light finishing tough</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite loose powder makeup!</li>
            <li>I have had it for a while and hardly scratched the surface as far as amount goes, so I&#x27;m sure this will last me a good while.</li>
            <li>I would have removed the hole section if I could, but it seems to be part of the whole unit</li>
            <li>Who wants to put this on their face?</li>
            <li>Very orange</li>
            <li>When I was pulling off the sticker off the sifter the whole thing came off.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It is simply the perfect amount of coverage and a nice finish to the base makeup.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>they should really warn you that there is a smell.</li>
            <li>The powder puff isn&#x27;t as fluffy as the original one of years ago, but is fine.</li>
            <li>I love Cover Girl products usually, and this powder is excellent (if slightly lighter than I expected).</li>
            <li>This will work well for you if you are very careful and maybe tape up most of the holes</li>
            <li>So far it is my favorite translucent loose powder.</li>
            <li>This is one of CG&#x27;s classic products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this powder for people who have oily skin.</li>
            <li>How could they get so many easy things wrong?</li>
            <li>, it provides the right amount of coverage I need for my daily makeup needs!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, right color for me, hard to find color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cakey at all, and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Usually in drug stores or beauty supply store&#x27;s they cost a lot more?</li>
            <li>I usually use a brush to apply, but the little spongey thing is great while out and about.  </li>
            <li>This is going to sound strange, but I&#x27;ve even used a makeup brush and lightly brushed it at the roots of my hair when I didn&#x27;t have time to wash</li>
            <li>It made a huge mess and then when you try to just get a bit on there, a lot comes up.</li>
            <li>If you want to use a better brush than the powder puff it comes with, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time because a ton of powder comes out and good luck shaking it off, because well it IS loose powder.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy caked on feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>plus I still look natural (I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;fake skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am not liking this product so far.</li>
            <li>The last one was much lighter than this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally tan (I&#x27;m an nw40 in Mac studio fix foundation)</li>
            <li>It feels soft on my skin, though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Feel so well and natural in this powder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but if you are sensitive smells</li>
            <li>I stray and try new products, and then end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li>and I use the light translucent powder on my eyelids to keep it from creasing all day (and it does the job as I hardly wear any shadow) and place it on all areas to highlight (ADVICE:</li>
            <li>The squirt top thing was broken, but I can still use it .</li>
            <li>My powder was pressed, not loose</li>
            <li>A little lighter than expected but has a light texture.  </li>
            <li>But..the  down side is the smell, I find it a little too strong.</li>
            <li>I wish the powder puff could be also sold separately, I love it and the powder puffs for sale at the store are flat and thin.</li>

            <li> Great product, lasts for the majority of the day and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> However, this does cover nicely, smells great and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep me shine free.</li>
            <li> consistency of the powder is thicker than mineral, so it doesn&#x27;t come out of the holes effectively.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell</li>
            <li> The color seems to blend well with a  range of skin tones, and it has a nice smell to it.</li>

            <li> But the product is so nice that I overlook that.</li>

            <li> This powder is quite nice for the price.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> , the color fits perfectly and the size is very convenient -not</li>
            <li> Nice translucent powder.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the consistency, love the look!!</li>
            <li> It still smells very nice and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap for great quality!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff always an amazing product thank u</li>
            <li> Too light both color and texture wise.</li>
            <li> nice light feeling powder!</li>
            <li> Great product, great pricing, does not need to reapplied constantly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love powder over liquid.</li>
            <li> do like how you can twist the hole section to close it off (prevents spilling, since the top just pulls on and off</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> So glad I re-ordered it</li>
            <li> As always thank you Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> Cheap product for a matte look!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this powder by Cover Girl; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> So much better, than the pressed powder.</li>
            <li> I love how the coverage of the powder into my face and also i love the color it matches my skin</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It takes away the shine so much better than compact powder.</li>
            <li> It sets your makeup quite well too :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most foundations, they make my face feel suffocated.</li>
            <li> So most of my life I&#x27;ve gone without.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I applied it on top of my make it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a better product out there than this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping to find something better.</li>
            <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li> I love this powder</li>
            <li> and I just love the way it goes on and stays on it</li>
            <li> I applied the power once in the morning and once more after about 5 hours just to refresh my face.</li>
            <li> but I always come back to this product it works great for me and its a good price.</li>
            <li> I order 2 of these and both of them were busted on the top.  </li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> love covergirl..</li>
            <li> My favorite thing is that if you have to draw on your eyebrows</li>
            <li> And no nasty powder puff to contend with.</li>
            <li> It almost just sits on top.</li>
            <li> I love love love that I could order this powder on Amazon for a lower price AND not have to search through every container on the shelves for my color!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> powder will not cake up, feels light and airy, and has a nice tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on oily/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> way to finish a makeup look by creating an airbrushed affect to the skin and sets your foundation :)</li>
            <li> Everything is ok besides the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the powder puff that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I just apply more power and maybe another layer of mascara</li>
            <li> I find this product to be outstanding , I recommend it to all to have in your makeup collection .</li>
            <li> Gave it as gift and they love it, thank you :-)</li>
            <li> and I must say i love how weightless it is.</li>
            <li> Most face powders I&#x27;ve used the packaging is flimsy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Kind of light and see through</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time and gives a flawless look that I love.</li>
            <li> It smells weired but it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are looking for something cheap and wonderful at the same time.</li>
            <li> i love covergirl products, this goes on light and no irritation</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl and all their products but this one&#x27;s my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> it spilling easily or anything.</li>
            <li> The puff it comes with has been easy to use and I have not had any clumping or issues.</li>
            <li> I get allergy just because of the hideous strong smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell when you are putting it on.  </li>
            <li> product is fine but the lid cracked and broke very quickly after receiving it</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging was really nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> so I just use a brush and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Works Fine</li>
            <li> This loose powder is very good</li>
            <li> eventhough I bought Light color.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> You can lightly brush it onto your face and you don&#x27;t wind up with cakey looking makeup.  </li>
            <li> THis product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered medium and use it to lightly dust my face for a finished look.  </li>
            <li> And its a light powder that covers.</li>
            <li> This powder smooth paste clothes.</li>
            <li> Right when I got it I put some on and I love how it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I apply this on top of eye primer, and it blends right in with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It had a very distinct perfume smell.</li>
            <li> It is so light, quick, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is alright, it&#x27;s not the best quality, but for the price the actual powder itself is decent</li>
            <li> it goes on great as a finish or even by itself,  offers beautiful coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and cakey at all.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good powder, just don&#x27;t use too much or it looks cakey..</li>
            <li> It is packaged well and has the familiar smell I remember from being a teenager.  </li>
            <li> Although I love Covergirl products, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this powder</li>
            <li> It has a sort of clean soapy scent to it which I adore</li>
            <li> I love how it really keeps my face free from oiliness for a maximum of almost eight hours.</li>
            <li> I always buy this make up powder, and I&#x27;m glad I can just order it right here on Amazon and have it come right to my house.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have foundation caked on so much that I look like plastic or that my face will melt off in the rain :)</li>
            <li> the holes allow too much powder to come through into the top, which also contributes to the mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but doesn&#x27;t cover enough for me</li>
            <li> Overall good.</li>
            <li> It is full of glitter</li>
            <li> This foundation is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> It will not compare to Mary Kay products, but works for a quick application when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> My new favorite powder.</li>
            <li> It also leave me looking more natural whilst covering up any flaws.</li>
            <li> But it was worth it here.</li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive and it isn’t safe.</li>
            <li> Helped soak up some oil and keep my make-up looking fresh longer.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> However the description needs to be changed or they need to send the right product.</li>
            <li> the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on the right way.</li>
            <li> I still decided to open the package and I love what I got.</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recomend to buy it as long as you don&#x27;t mind the powder smell, becuase it really does go on the face really nice</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> the top already cracked - I am not rough with my makeup materials, this container seems to be very flimsy</li>
            <li> I use translucent face powder to touch up my makeup and also after I first apply liquid foundation in the morning.</li>
            <li> [...] Thanks!</li>
            <li> so i think it is really light and natural.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I expected/wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> For the price it is great and boy does it last a long time.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using translucent face powder</li>
            <li> Stays on good and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face like some makeup do.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very helpful for my skin, I currently wear a liquid foundation and applied this make up very lightly after my foundation and It reduced the greasy/oily look</li>
            <li> At 43 years old I wanted a little coverage occasionally &amp; thus powder worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> With this it pretty much stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The powder itself was light weight, soaked up the oil on my skin leaving it fresh all day long and provided coverage for my blemishes.</li>
            <li> They suggest using the enclosed buffing pad to capture the powder for application, but I gave up on that immediately and used my large makeup brush...</li>
            <li> There are pre-cut holes for the powder to come through which are rather large</li>
            <li> my favorite loose powder to set my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> Have been using this CG loose powder for years and just love.</li>
            <li> LOVE this loose powder.  </li>
            <li> Love Cover Girl loose powder.</li>
            <li> Been using this loose powder for many years</li>
            <li> I love this loose powder.</li>
            <li> Love the loose powder over the pressed.  </li>
            <li> , it has a little fragance, but its nice.</li>
            <li> Nice, light finishing tough</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite loose powder makeup!</li>
            <li> I have had it for a while and hardly scratched the surface as far as amount goes, so I&#x27;m sure this will last me a good while.</li>
            <li> I would have removed the hole section if I could, but it seems to be part of the whole unit</li>
            <li> Who wants to put this on their face?</li>
            <li> Very orange</li>
            <li> When I was pulling off the sticker off the sifter the whole thing came off.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It is simply the perfect amount of coverage and a nice finish to the base makeup.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> they should really warn you that there is a smell.</li>
            <li> The powder puff isn&#x27;t as fluffy as the original one of years ago, but is fine.</li>
            <li> I love Cover Girl products usually, and this powder is excellent (if slightly lighter than I expected).</li>
            <li> This will work well for you if you are very careful and maybe tape up most of the holes</li>
            <li> So far it is my favorite translucent loose powder.</li>
            <li> This is one of CG&#x27;s classic products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this powder for people who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> How could they get so many easy things wrong?</li>
            <li> , it provides the right amount of coverage I need for my daily makeup needs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, right color for me, hard to find color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cakey at all, and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Usually in drug stores or beauty supply store&#x27;s they cost a lot more?</li>
            <li> I usually use a brush to apply, but the little spongey thing is great while out and about.  </li>
            <li> This is going to sound strange, but I&#x27;ve even used a makeup brush and lightly brushed it at the roots of my hair when I didn&#x27;t have time to wash</li>
            <li> It made a huge mess and then when you try to just get a bit on there, a lot comes up.</li>
            <li> If you want to use a better brush than the powder puff it comes with, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time because a ton of powder comes out and good luck shaking it off, because well it IS loose powder.</li>
            <li> It is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy caked on feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> plus I still look natural (I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;fake skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am not liking this product so far.</li>
            <li> The last one was much lighter than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally tan (I&#x27;m an nw40 in Mac studio fix foundation)</li>
            <li> It feels soft on my skin, though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Feel so well and natural in this powder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it, but if you are sensitive smells</li>
            <li> I stray and try new products, and then end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li> and I use the light translucent powder on my eyelids to keep it from creasing all day (and it does the job as I hardly wear any shadow) and place it on all areas to highlight (ADVICE:</li>
            <li> The squirt top thing was broken, but I can still use it .</li>
            <li> My powder was pressed, not loose</li>
            <li> A little lighter than expected but has a light texture.  </li>
            <li> But..the  down side is the smell, I find it a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I wish the powder puff could be also sold separately, I love it and the powder puffs for sale at the store are flat and thin.</li>
            <li> im pretty pale</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> CoverGirl Professional Translucent Loose Face Powder stays on and keeps my skin from looking oily by the end of the workday.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply once and it lasts all day long .</li>
            <li> I have also tried other more expensive brands but always come back to Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that there is no mirror, and its a little large if you&#x27;re looking to use it as a compact.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes get after a long days work.</li>
            <li> Like I said, strange maybe,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a fresher-upper when having long days and</li>
            <li> Takes away any oiliness that has appeared and I have had no trouble with reapplying looking or feeling heavy or caked on.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts me a really long time as well!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as dry like others.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that the design is apparently trying to copy the mineral makeup brands and how the product comes out of little holes a bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the first powder I started using to up my make-up game.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this loose powder and will continue to do so, I do have to blot my face halfway through the day</li>
            <li> like this loose powder.  </li>
            <li> The applicator it comes with kept leaving little white feathers all over my face.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t twist closed) but it is a chore to get enough powder out of the little holes.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs loose translucent powder in their beauty supplies!  </li>
            <li> lighter than expected</li>
            <li> It is economical in these times of expensive makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it with a big fluffy brush after concealing and contouring to blend everything.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it, but when mixed with foundation or a liquid base, the color of the powder becomes slightly orange-tinged.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I, like some other reviewers, do not care for the puff that comes with it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that by the time you are halfway through it, the lid sometimes cracks .  </li>
            <li> What is NOT ok is how poorly this is packaged, because it is borderline unusable if it takes so much as one plunge off the shelf.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply this at least once after the initial application.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit messy, but I&#x27;ve learned how to be careful.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that is has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> Now I get it in a couple of days for about half the price.</li>
            <li> Typically, make-up melts off my face in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> the cap just pops off, which causes the powder to go everywhere and cause a mess</li>
            <li> I feel like it irritates my skin a little because of this.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it!</li>
            <li> The smells bothers me a little bit, but works wonders when you&#x27;re trying to correct bronzer.</li>
            <li> Applies easily - No all-over powder mess.</li>
            <li> I now use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d probably end up cracking it or destroying it somehow.</li>
            <li> Plus, the puff looks like a dead animal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the powder puff that is included because I prefer a fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> I could never count on my color being in stock when I went shopping - which wasted a lot of time.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face too.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> The packaging can be a bit messy, but I don&#x27;t carry mind in my purse</li>
            <li> Allows all over coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge problem.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s not full or medium cover.</li>
            <li> Oh well I get past</li>
            <li> and it is very messy.</li>
            <li> It also goes everywhere no matter how hard I try to keep it contained.</li>
            <li> Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> packaging is NOT good -</li>
            <li> Really annoying to mess with because it&#x27;s a loose powder and</li>
            <li> It comes with a powder puff which is a bit awkward to hold but nothing to seriously complain about.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> or if you apply a fake mole with eyebrow pencil, this will set it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the puff that it comes with since it&#x27;s awkward to hold</li>
            <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t screw on and is very insecure.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this :(</li>
            <li> I use a brush anyway, but it just LOOKS annoying.</li>
            <li> This product is awful.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is just horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite product. I now use it everyday. Love it. Thank you for the deal. Gonna keep using it.</li>
            <li> It is working well and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Love powder over liquid. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as dry like others.</li>
            <li> This would have gotten a 5-star review from me except for the sprinkler-system dispersal method. I love Cover Girl products usually, and this powder is excellent (if slightly lighter than I expected). What I don&#x27;t like is that the design is apparently trying to copy the mineral makeup brands and how the product comes out of little holes a bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the powder is thicker than mineral, so it doesn&#x27;t come out of the holes effectively. I had to shake it several times to get any product at all. They suggest using the enclosed buffing pad to capture the powder for application, but I gave up on that immediately and used my large makeup brush...just like I use the mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how you can twist the hole section to close it off (prevents spilling, since the top just pulls on and off, it doesn&#x27;t twist closed) but it is a chore to get enough powder out of the little holes. I would have removed the hole section if I could, but it seems to be part of the whole unit and I&#x27;d probably end up cracking it or destroying it somehow.</li>
            <li> lighter than expected</li>
            <li> Love this stuff always an amazing product thank u</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works great and covers like I want it too.</li>
            <li> You get lots of powder for the price. I have a medium complexion and it looks great. It comes with a powder puff which is a bit awkward to hold but nothing to seriously complain about. It has a nice smell but once it&#x27;s on your face you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
            <li> I always buy this make up powder, and I&#x27;m glad I can just order it right here on Amazon and have it come right to my house. Good stuff. Great make up.</li>
            <li> Great product, great pricing, does not need to reapplied constantly.</li>
            <li> my favorite loose powder to set my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the product I received is not what is in the description. My powder was pressed, not loose but it was still CC Translucent powder. I still decided to open the package and I love what I got. However the description needs to be changed or they need to send the right product.</li>
            <li> Perfect!! Love the smell, love the consistency, love the look!! Super cheap for great quality!!! Recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before &amp; love it! So glad I re-ordered it, it provides the right amount of coverage I need for my daily makeup needs!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this best, mind you. But the powder smells like a urinal cake. Who wants to put this on their face? Why does it even HAVE to be scented? I feel like it irritates my skin a little because of this. Plus, the puff looks like a dead animal. Why so scraggly and unkempt? I use a brush anyway, but it just LOOKS annoying. How could they get so many easy things wrong?</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to find the make up you love for a good price! As always thank you Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I love it! It has a sort of clean soapy scent to it which I adore and it does have an invisible mattifying effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep me shine free.</li>
            <li> It holds my makeup pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this! My new favorite powder. It is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy caked on feeling on your face. It also leave me looking more natural whilst covering up any flaws. I will only be using this cover girl powder from now on.</li>
            <li> Cheap product for a matte look!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product. It is so light, quick, and easy to apply. If feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s perfect. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have foundation caked on so much that I look like plastic or that my face will melt off in the rain :)</li>
            <li> Great product, lasts for the majority of the day and is easy to apply. The only negative is that is has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> I love this powder by Cover Girl; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Good foundation. Really annoying to mess with because it&#x27;s a loose powder and the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on the right way. Not impressed</li>
            <li> Have been using this CG loose powder for years and just love.</li>
            <li> LOVE this loose powder.  Made my friend buy some.  So much better, than the pressed powder.</li>
            <li> Very orange eventhough I bought Light color.</li>
            <li> I love how the coverage of the powder into my face and also i love the color it matches my skin</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great, buildable coverage that doesnt look cakey.  I usually use a brush to apply, but the little spongey thing is great while out and about.  The other thing is that there is no mirror, and its a little large if you&#x27;re looking to use it as a compact.  But I use daily, and bring it in my purse as well with a pocket mirror.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! It takes away the shine so much better than compact powder. I&#x27;m Asian and even though I ordered the &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; color, it matches quite well. It&#x27;s not cakey at all, and is very natural looking. The color seems to blend well with a  range of skin tones, and it has a nice smell to it. Unlike foundation, which smears anytime you rub your face against something (which always happens to be the collar of my shirts!!), this powder doesn&#x27;t leave a residue if you accidentally touch your face to your clothes. It sets your makeup quite well too :)</li>
            <li> Right when I got it I put some on and I love how it goes on smooth. But..the  down side is the smell, I find it a little too strong. I would recomend to buy it as long as you don&#x27;t mind the powder smell, becuase it really does go on the face really nice</li>
            <li> perfect the right color came. exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this loose powder and will continue to do so, I do have to blot my face halfway through the day and I just do a touch up with this.  I wish the powder puff could be also sold separately, I love it and the powder puffs for sale at the store are flat and thin.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of setting your makeup. I don&#x27;t use the powder puff that is included because I prefer a fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- good color&lt;br /&gt;- provides good coverage, doesn&#x27;t come off during the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- packaging is NOT good - the cap just pops off, which causes the powder to go everywhere and cause a mess&lt;br /&gt;- the top already cracked - I am not rough with my makeup materials, this container seems to be very flimsy&lt;br /&gt;- the holes allow too much powder to come through into the top, which also contributes to the mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loose powder tends to be a but cheaper, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with pressed powder from now on.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the translucent face powder.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most foundations, they make my face feel suffocated. So most of my life I&#x27;ve gone without. At 43 years old I wanted a little coverage occasionally &amp; thus powder worked out perfectly. Good coverage without suffocation plus I still look natural (I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;fake skin&amp;#34; look)</li>
            <li> nice smell.will purchased again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years and I love it. I, like some other reviewers, do not care for the puff that comes with it so I just use a brush and it works fine. Before I started buying it through Amazon I could never count on my color being in stock when I went shopping - which wasted a lot of time. Now I get it in a couple of days for about half the price.</li>
            <li> I am not liking this product so far. When I was pulling off the sticker off the sifter the whole thing came off. It made a huge mess and then when you try to just get a bit on there, a lot comes up. I applied it on top of my make it and I saw no difference. I&#x27;m sure there is a better product out there than this.</li>
            <li> I use translucent face powder to touch up my makeup and also after I first apply liquid foundation in the morning. Cover girl doesn&#x27;t disappoint with this product. Great value, great quality. It lasts me a really long time as well!</li>
            <li> It has been going all over my clothes and, my hats I am wearing in the sun has almost received a permanent impression of this powder. It transfers itself on everything I wear on my neck and face. Totally not worth it! It doesn&#x27;t even cover well. I miss my Oriflame compact powder and I&#x27;m hoping to find something better.</li>
            <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li> I got this for an awesome price from coupon site. This is what my daughter uses.</li>
            <li> Love Cover Girl loose powder. The last one was much lighter than this one. However, this does cover nicely, smells great and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> product is fine but the lid cracked and broke very quickly after receiving it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but doesn&#x27;t cover enough for me and it&#x27;s not long lasting.  I prefer Max Factor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it still works like a charm. The price is good on Amazon. I stray and try new products, and then end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It lasts for a long time and gives a flawless look that I love.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Professional Translucent Loose Face Powder stays on and keeps my skin from looking oily by the end of the workday.</li>
            <li> Warning to those with oily skin....</li>
            <li> this is a great color for this time of year</li>
            <li> Long lasting. All day wear. Not oily. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I love this powder it goes on great as a finish or even by itself,  offers beautiful coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and cakey at all.  I will keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> I use the lose powder to always set my foundation (by applying it with a stipling brush and a padded motion) I have never had issues with this and only need to apply this once in the morning. This will help my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over ten years and I just love the way it goes on and stays on it covers blemishes I have I have some age spots and it covers them real good</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very helpful for my skin, I currently wear a liquid foundation and applied this make up very lightly after my foundation and It reduced the greasy/oily look I sometimes get after a long days work. I applied the power once in the morning and once more after about 5 hours just to refresh my face. I really like this product however I could use a darker shade. I highly recommend this powder for people who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I always use this powder to set my foundation. Usually in drug stores or beauty supply store&#x27;s they cost a lot more? But it was worth it here. I just wish it had a nicer scent. It smells like it has medicine or something. Oh well I get past it cause it doesn&#x27;t last the smell.</li>
            <li> Okay when I put it on, it looked really great but my skin is sensitive and it isn’t safe.</li>
            <li> I have tried different powders but I always come back to this product it works great for me and its a good price.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs loose translucent powder in their beauty supplies!  Goes on great without caking!  Nice, light finishing tough that will keep your foundation fresher longer.&lt;br /&gt; [...] Thanks!</li>
            <li> It smells great.  A little lighter than expected but has a light texture.  Doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I am caking my face with makeup</li>
            <li> I order 2 of these and both of them were busted on the top.  I can still use but when you shake it powder spills out the side and it is very messy.</li>
            <li> Not the same color as shown</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for YEARS! I&#x27;m naturally tan (I&#x27;m an nw40 in Mac studio fix foundation) and I use the light translucent powder on my eyelids to keep it from creasing all day (and it does the job as I hardly wear any shadow) and place it on all areas to highlight (ADVICE: place powder under the eye and let it &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; while you do the rest of your makeup. When you&#x27;re done, take a fluffy brush and gently brush off the excess and you&#x27;ll get that highlighted look that&#x27;s all the craze these days!)  I stopped using this to try out Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder which I like also but you can&#x27;t beat the price of this CoverGirl powder.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin color and this works. I use it over a daily moisturizer to reduce shine. Overall good.</li>
            <li> Great product but I will be getting pressed powder because I have oily skin. Good for your vanity though! The smells bothers me a little bit, but works wonders when you&#x27;re trying to correct bronzer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It works ok. My shine comes through midday. the price is good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS.  It is simply the perfect amount of coverage and a nice finish to the base makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is awful. It is full of glitter (yes, like I want to be seen as a shiny clown in the middle of the day). Has NO COVERAGE and smells horrendous...I get allergy just because of the hideous strong smell. Ughhh</li>
            <li> Too light both color and texture wise. It feels soft on my skin, though. I use it as a finishing touch.</li>
            <li> This is one of CG&#x27;s classic products. It still smells very nice and goes on smoothly.  Only disadvantage is when you take it in your purse, it won&#x27;t stay contained like a pressed powder.  Then you have to dust off the puff thing.</li>
            <li> Been using this loose powder for many years and it provides just enough coverage.  My only complaint is that by the time you are halfway through it, the lid sometimes cracks .  But the product is so nice that I overlook that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really good results with this powder. Typically, make-up melts off my face in a couple hours. With this it pretty much stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> love covergirl..nice light feeling powder!</li>
            <li> This loose powder is very good and it&#x27;s light. I mean it&#x27;s not full or medium cover. Perfect to apply it in the morning or for work. It smells weired but it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are looking for something cheap and wonderful at the same time.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for my skin color.  It is packaged well and has the familiar smell I remember from being a teenager.  Great product will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl and all their products but this one&#x27;s my absolute favorite! I love how it really keeps my face free from oiliness for a maximum of almost eight hours. This doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face too. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this loose powder. It&#x27;s become a part of my daily makeup routine. Its also cheaper online than in stores.</li>
            <li> Love the loose powder over the pressed.  You can lightly brush it onto your face and you don&#x27;t wind up with cakey looking makeup.  It sets your makeup for the entire day with perhaps a second application during the day, depending on skin type or humidity, sweating, etc.  This is going to sound strange, but I&#x27;ve even used a makeup brush and lightly brushed it at the roots of my hair when I didn&#x27;t have time to wash and it doesn&#x27;t clump up like baby powder and it isn&#x27;t white.  It matches your scalp.  Like I said, strange maybe, but in a pinch it works.  My favorite thing is that if you have to draw on your eyebrows (I don&#x27;t, but my daughter does) or if you apply a fake mole with eyebrow pencil, this will set it and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it sweating or rubbing off.  And no nasty powder puff to contend with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had foundation from CoverGirl before so i think it is really light and natural. Doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I am caking my face with makeup. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I have to give this three out of five stars for the packaging. The powder itself is alright, it&#x27;s not the best quality, but for the price the actual powder itself is decent What is NOT ok is how poorly this is packaged, because it is borderline unusable if it takes so much as one plunge off the shelf. The lid doesn&#x27;t screw on and is very insecure. It almost just sits on top. I don&#x27;t recommend traveling with this at all. There are pre-cut holes for the powder to come through which are rather large so you get a lot of powder. If you want to use a better brush than the powder puff it comes with, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time because a ton of powder comes out and good luck shaking it off, because well it IS loose powder. This will work well for you if you are very careful and maybe tape up most of the holes</li>
            <li> I love love love that I could order this powder on Amazon for a lower price AND not have to search through every container on the shelves for my color!&lt;br /&gt;This powder will not cake up, feels light and airy, and has a nice tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on oily/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great way to finish a makeup look by creating an airbrushed affect to the skin and sets your foundation :)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t complain about that!&lt;br /&gt;Very nice powder, will continue buying!</li>
            <li> I apply this on top of eye primer, and it blends right in with my skin tone. Sometimes I use only this to brighten my eyes when I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is just horrible. I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Everything is ok besides the smell. Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
            <li> like this loose powder.  it matches with my loreal foundation.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite loose powder makeup! Love the powder puff that comes with it. Stays on good and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face like some makeup do.</li>
            <li> good product and great coverage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, right color for me, hard to find color.</li>
            <li> Great powder to reduce shine</li>
            <li> This was the first powder I started using to up my make-up game. It did exactly what I expected/wanted it to do. Helped soak up some oil and keep my make-up looking fresh longer. I have not had any troubles with it being &amp;#34;too messy&amp;#34; or it spilling easily or anything. Even when I close it and stick it in my make-up bag for travel, I open it up and the puff inside keeps anything from spilling out. I have had it for a while and hardly scratched the surface as far as amount goes, so I&#x27;m sure this will last me a good while. The puff it comes with has been easy to use and I have not had any clumping or issues. Though I imagine putting it on with a different applicator would work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a fresher-upper when having long days and my make-up needs a touch up. I just apply more power and maybe another layer of mascara and it does wonders. Takes away any oiliness that has appeared and I have had no trouble with reapplying looking or feeling heavy or caked on.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at a reasonable price.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This face power is outstanding , the color is great it matches my skin tone perfectly and was easy to apply .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ordered this and I got 2 because of the quality .It comes in a great package , I don&#x27;t like liquid foundation so buying this product is my preferences ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You only need to apply once and it lasts all day long . I find this product to be outstanding , I recommend it to all to have in your makeup collection .</li>
            <li> It is a nice product. I just wish I knew it had a scent which I didnt like.</li>
            <li> Basic powder. Works Fine</li>
            <li> I like this product.  have used it for years and it&#x27;s still a reliable company!</li>
            <li> Gave it as gift and they love it, thank you :-)</li>
            <li> This product is Excellent. I always use the all covergirl product. THis product is fantastic. the face is beatifull with this product.</li>
            <li> This foundation is my absolute favorite. im pretty pale and I use the color nude beige. Doesnt clog pores or break me out. The squirt top thing was broken, but I can still use it .</li>
            <li> Received in good condition</li>
            <li> I ordered medium and use it to lightly dust my face for a finished look.  The puff is a bit whimpy but I purchases others separately.  For the price it is great and boy does it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Got this at a awesome price. This is my go to powder and it&#x27;s always sold out locally. I was a happy camper to find it on Amazon at a good price. Super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Product arrived packaged well. There was no damage. Covergirl is a great product and this was no exception. Easy to use, color was excellent, and great coverage.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Adore this powder. I&#x27;ve had compliments on my complexion after using. Gives me a wonderful finish over my CoverGirl Radiance Liquid Makeup. Best I&#x27;ve used. It can be a bit messy, but I&#x27;ve learned how to be careful.</li>
            <li> This powder is quite nice for the price. It is economical in these times of expensive makeup. And its a light powder that covers. I have been using it for years. I have also tried other more expensive brands but always come back to Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of powder for the price, it&#x27;s a steal. 10/10 Perfection.</li>
            <li> Love It!  Great product and so convenient not to have to remember it when I go shopping.</li>
            <li> Te foundation I ordered ended up not matching my skin tone so it looks caked on - will re-order a shade darker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, keeps a matte face and keeps makeup in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it, but when mixed with foundation or a liquid base, the color of the powder becomes slightly orange-tinged.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday. So far it is my favorite translucent loose powder. I use it with a big fluffy brush after concealing and contouring to blend everything. It works wonderfully and is very lightweight. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Good price and product</li>
            <li> Although I love Covergirl products, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this powder and it&#x27;s great, the color fits perfectly and the size is very convenient -not too big- Just one thing, it has a little fragance, but its nice.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this :( they should really warn you that there is a smell. it&#x27;s perfumy and I do not like it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using translucent face powder and I must say i love how weightless it is. The color tone i ordered was perfect for my skin. It helps to hind imperfections on your face. I&#x27;m freckly and oily so this truly helped to hid both of my issues.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Stays on a long time. Applies easily - No all-over powder mess. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product was one of the best face powders I&#x27;ve used. First of all, the packaging was really nice and sturdy. Most face powders I&#x27;ve used the packaging is flimsy. The powder itself was light weight, soaked up the oil on my skin leaving it fresh all day long and provided coverage for my blemishes. I would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> Pretty good powder, just don&#x27;t use too much or it looks cakey..</li>
            <li> I like this powder. It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply this at least once after the initial application.</li>
            <li> Awesome and delivered in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This powder smooth paste clothes. Feel so well and natural in this powder.</li>
            <li> It will not compare to Mary Kay products, but works for a quick application when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Works great.  The packaging can be a bit messy, but I don&#x27;t carry mind in my purse so it&#x27;s not a huge problem.  I don&#x27;t use the puff that it comes with since it&#x27;s awkward to hold and I prefer a brush anyway.  It does have a strong smell when you are putting it on.  I don&#x27;t mind it, but if you are sensitive smells, you may want to skip this product.  This is a good amount of product for the money though and may repurchase when it is used up.</li>
            <li> The applicator it comes with kept leaving little white feathers all over my face.</li>
            <li> Very nice powder for the price! Kind of light and see through but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> It had a very distinct perfume smell. I&#x27;m not a fan. It also goes everywhere no matter how hard I try to keep it contained.</li>
            <li> This is my fav powder to set my foundation. It&#x27;s translucent and doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation. The powder puff isn&#x27;t as fluffy as the original one of years ago, but is fine. It lasts for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Nice translucent powder. Allows all over coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> i love covergirl products, this goes on light and no irritation</li>
