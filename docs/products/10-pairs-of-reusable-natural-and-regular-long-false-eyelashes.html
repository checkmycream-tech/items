            <li>Very good price for value and amount of lashes, BUT</li>
            <li>Good for the price!</li>
            <li>The eyelashes itself are beautiful.</li>
            <li>But for the price I should have realized they weren&#x27;t going to be great.</li>
            <li>but they are great</li>
            <li>They are the perfect length and thickness to make any one of your looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>Great for price.</li>
            <li>Good lashes.</li>
            <li>just to be fair.</li>
            <li>but they look good...</li>
            <li>The packaging was good</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are great and got many uses out of them.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear each pair for 3 uses!</li>
            <li>This came promptly, and I was satisfied with the price!    </li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love these falsies!</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to anyone trying to achieve a very nice full lash look!</li>
            <li>and I have brutally honest friends</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are perfect, they look so real</li>
            <li>try ardells those are nice</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have any eyelashes these would be a perfect natural look, but since I have some of my own</li>
            <li>These lashes are actually pretty good!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for cheap, pretty, reusable lashes, the best I&#x27;ve found are &#x27;elf&#x27; which can be found at target for a dollar a piece.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>These eyelashes do their job, but they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>but I got so many compliments on them</li>
            <li>Also, manipulate the lash (bending) so that they are more flexible and this will help them to stay during the glue drying time.</li>
            <li>I can feel them more than my revlon lashes because they are plastic</li>
            <li>Remember you get what you pay for :-)</li>
            <li>Alot of my co-workers are in love with my falsies.</li>
            <li>then you may have better luck.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I did not spend too much on them.</li>
            <li>I got many complements on them but</li>
            <li>I have had cheap lashes that were better than this.</li>
            <li>Thanks good product.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bend easily to the shape of my eye.</li>
            <li>And for the price they are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>and they thought they looked fine.</li>
            <li>&quot; so i took them out of the packaging and cut them to fit my eye.</li>
            <li>but they worked fabulously and lasted.</li>
            <li>They were cheap</li>
            <li>These are cheap and the suck.</li>
            <li>My own lashes look far better with lash tent on them.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very nice product.</li>
            <li>For the price it is not bad at all and the seller is very responsive and kind.</li>
            <li>They are perfect in length for a natural long lash look.</li>
            <li>well worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Quality wise- same as ones in drugstore, so they work for me.</li>
            <li>They are reusable, but do you really need to reuse a pair when you have so many?     </li>
            <li>they are natural looking but still eye catching.</li>
            <li>But with that being said, these are not bad.</li>
            <li>and i thought maybe i should use a cheap one first</li>
            <li>This is a good gesture as long as they are willing to work with the customer</li>
            <li>The BEST glue for ANY false lash is Duo adhesive...</li>
            <li>The lashes came in the mail pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural and even if there not human hair they look really good</li>
            <li>These are very natural looking and worth the price!</li>
            <li>the other hand, they ARE super cheap, so if you just need a cheap pair to wear for a short period of time, these might be okay.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li>This product came in like 3 days after i placed the order, which was surprisingly fast!</li>
            <li>It looks kinda plastic-y when you first see it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely buying another box :)</li>
            <li>For the price, I would definitely recommend them. :)</li>
            <li>when i first received the lashes and saw them in the packaging, i thought they were hideous.</li>
            <li>when i put them on they looked fabulous and natural but you could still see a difference.</li>
            <li>These lashes came surprisingly fast!</li>
            <li>First of all, know one thing....</li>
            <li>I wear false lashes every day and these are perfect for work/school, very natural.</li>
            <li>They are really thin, but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty darn good!</li>
            <li>The band is stiff (because it is \\&quot;fiber\\&quot;) but just wrap it around your finger and move it around to make it more flexible... easy fix.</li>
            <li>what I like most is that it didn&#x27;t took that long to receive them with out a hasol...</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and I would totally purchase again.</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>They do the job of fake eyelashes and for a very good price.</li>
            <li>The lashes arrived before expected and I love them.</li>
            <li>Saved so much money this way.</li>
            <li>I now order them in advanced when i see that i am running low.</li>
            <li>I would wear these to school and everyone thought they were real lashes.</li>
            <li>then I just stopped wearing them as much</li>
            <li>I really like my eyelashes..</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These false lashes are simply amazing!</li>
            <li>The product is not bad, but if you are a caucasian with regular eyelashes and want something longer, I wouldn&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li>I found my expectations were perhaps too high.</li>
            <li>Product is plastic so for me to like a natural look it doesnt really work for me.</li>
            <li>I was expecting worse but its all good.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t flexible and to clean glue off for reuse means breaking them apart because they do not perform the way other lashes do and again are very brittle.  </li>
            <li>so I will live with it.</li>
            <li>They are very natural looking</li>
            <li>Although shipping does take long, they&#x27;re well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>, they are the exact same length as my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I had to cut them down significantly.</li>
            <li>All ten pairs were neatly packaged in this cute little box.</li>
            <li>At first I thought they were going to be too long</li>
            <li>these are FAR from natural.</li>
            <li>Its soft and looks natural if u know what you doing.  </li>
            <li>These lashes do not look natural at all.</li>
            <li>no one can ever tell that I am wearing them, theses lashes are really long and help my real eyelashes look longer and fuller!</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d spend a few more dollars and get something I can actually wear out next time.</li>
            <li>The only thing that made me a bit uneasy was that the lashes were straight from China, with Chinese prints and all on the label.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not used to buying 10pks of lashes, but I thought the packaging could have been better, that is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li>I tried layering them and that made them look more like normal fake</li>
            <li>These were about the same length as my actual eyelashes, and much less full.</li>
            <li>you have to cut them to fit your own eye, the band in which the lashes are attached is really thick and heavy and hard to wear on ur eyes.</li>
            <li>They are much cheaper than the other lashes at the store</li>
            <li>I am pleased with these false eyelashes, I&#x27;ve ordered other ones that claimed to look natural but were far from it.</li>
            <li>I ordered other lashes in the past and they look completely fake but theses are wonderful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quite long and sparse, and very obviously plastic, so they can&#x27;t blend in with my natural lashes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Chinese cosmetics, but for such low price, I guess I can&#x27;t ask for too much.</li>
            <li> However, they were way to wide and too long for normal eyes.</li>
            <li> They are way too long instead of being full and thick.</li>
            <li> With any set of false lashes, you have to trim them to fit your eye.</li>
            <li> Normally, I can reuse the same lash strip several times but with these, it is a TOTAL waste..  </li>
            <li> It is also quiet long that I had to trim it.  </li>
            <li> They are long and definitely will need to trim them.</li>
            <li> but once its on it looks long and flirty.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are NOT natural looking whatsoever.</li>
            <li> but still not natural</li>
            <li> They are freakishly long, the ends have to be cut, and they itched the heck outta my eye.</li>
            <li> I bought these a long, long time ago</li>
            <li> If you want just a little more umph (still without the fake look), go with Ardell 110/113.     </li>
            <li> The glue will take longer to dry so use a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they lift during the dry cycle.</li>
            <li> Could barely get them to stay on because they were so heavy and plastic like.</li>
            <li> and I am sad to say the box still sits FULL in my make-up drawer.</li>
            <li> I have one main complaint, but other than that, the lashes are all right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened it, 1/2 the lashes fell out of the little tiny holes that were supposed to hold them neatly in place.</li>
            <li> A bit harder to apply then</li>
            <li> but I saw absolutely no difference in length or fullness after putting these on.</li>
            <li> the only thing that is hard is how long the band is  </li>
            <li> I personally like to cut one strip in half and wear one half on the end of one eye and the other on the other eye.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and put them on the outside of my eyes for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> If you or the person your looking to get this for is in to this stuff, you cant go wrong if your willing to wait on the shipping..</li>
            <li> They are really wide!</li>
            <li> The only thing that gives it away is the band that is visible when I close my eyes, but that might be because I am not very good at putting them on just yet.</li>
            <li> This means that when you put them on your eyes, the direction of the lashes is down instead of lifting up.</li>
            <li> band isn&#x27;t all black</li>
            <li> These lashes are very stiff and not that soft making them difficult to apply and not very natural looking.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So if you want everyday lashes, I guess these would be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> They seem too be too heavy for the Revlon eyelash glue that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a false eyelash wearer and thought i should try something that would come out cheaper than buying the individual drug store ones..</li>
            <li> Very obvious they were false lashes.</li>
            <li> I use false eyelashes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> They are stiff and hurt when applied.</li>
            <li> Even after I bent and wiggled them, they remained stiff and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end, I thought them to be boring for events/special occasions and better for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> of course, like any other fake lashes, it does look fake but it blends in with my lashes naturally like im not even wearing one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers complained that the band was too stiff and I have to agree.</li>
            <li> band is also like cardboard, extremely itchy, heavy, and uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They look real fake, and they don&#x27;t really hold their shape well.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend it, it&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t glue well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to squash those delicate false lashes.    </li>
            <li> These false eyelashes are very hard to apply.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a fake lash ever in my life</li>
            <li> band on them is really thick so that it connects with the base of the lashes</li>
            <li> I never used one pair because they look so fake!</li>
            <li> and looked very fake, but i had already bought them</li>
            <li> lashes themselves just look very fake when they&#x27;re</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The lashes arrived before expected and I love them. They are easy to apply and I would totally purchase again. At first I thought they were going to be too long but I got so many compliments on them and I have brutally honest friends and they thought they looked fine. The price is great! I&#x27;m used to spending 4-7 dollars on lashes so for a dollar and some change I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> I know what I said before but it was before I received a call from them. This is a good gesture as long as they are willing to work with the customer I will give them another chance.</li>
            <li> These false lashes are simply amazing! The price for these lashes were a bargain too. I would most definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> These lashes feel totally unnatural.  They are brittle and plastic!  They don&#x27;t curl upward either, which made them feel like hoods on my eyes. They aren&#x27;t flexible and to clean glue off for reuse means breaking them apart because they do not perform the way other lashes do and again are very brittle.  Normally, I can reuse the same lash strip several times but with these, it is a TOTAL waste..  My own lashes look far better with lash tent on them.  Sorry, ladies, if you love lashes, these aren&#x27;t the ones.. keep shopping!!</li>
            <li> these are FAR from natural. They are stiff and hurt when applied. There&#x27;es NO way i could&#x27;ve kept them on all day. I&#x27;m a false eyelash wearer and thought i should try something that would come out cheaper than buying the individual drug store ones.. BIG mistake. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product came in like 3 days after i placed the order, which was surprisingly fast! The eyelashes itself are beautiful. It looks kinda plastic-y when you first see it but once its on it looks long and flirty. I recommend these and I&#x27;m definitely buying another box :)</li>
            <li> The lashes came in the mail pretty quickly. All ten pairs were neatly packaged in this cute little box. For the price, the quality was pretty decent. The only thing that made me a bit uneasy was that the lashes were straight from China, with Chinese prints and all on the label. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Chinese cosmetics, but for such low price, I guess I can&#x27;t ask for too much. Overall, very nice product.</li>
            <li> These lashes are actually pretty good! I wear false lashes every day and these are perfect for work/school, very natural. I was able to wear each pair for 3 uses! For the price, I would definitely recommend them. :)</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are so easy to use!  Just trim to fit, apply a thin line of adhesive and stick on.  The best thing about them is how \\&quot;un-fake\\&quot; they look.</li>
            <li> I got these lashes because I was looking for something not so dramatic and unnatural looking. I think I&#x27;ve missed the mark. If I didn&#x27;t have any eyelashes these would be a perfect natural look, but since I have some of my own these just blend in, they are the exact same length as my natural lashes. The only thing that gives it away is the band that is visible when I close my eyes, but that might be because I am not very good at putting them on just yet. The product is not bad, but if you are a caucasian with regular eyelashes and want something longer, I wouldn&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li> Good lashes. A bit harder to apply then the store bought brand because they are plastic. The glue will take longer to dry so use a hair dryer. Otherwise they lift during the dry cycle. Also, manipulate the lash (bending) so that they are more flexible and this will help them to stay during the glue drying time. I can feel them more than my revlon lashes because they are plastic but I think I i will get used to them after time. They are much cheaper than the other lashes at the store so I will live with it.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend it, it&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t glue well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice makeup artist and I just want to inform buyers that these lashes aren&#x27;t like the one u find in the store....there like a thin plastic or maybe paper?....just to be fair.I cant say if they work well because I haven&#x27;t used them...but they look good...guess I have to try them and update this review</li>
            <li> when i first received the lashes and saw them in the packaging, i thought they were hideous. and looked very fake, but i had already bought them so thought \\&quot;why not just see how they look on me?\\&quot; so i took them out of the packaging and cut them to fit my eye. when i put them on they looked fabulous and natural but you could still see a difference. i&#x27;m very happy with this product. well worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> These were about the same length as my actual eyelashes, and much less full. If you have really really short lashes, they may be alright...but I saw absolutely no difference in length or fullness after putting these on. I just tossed them, since it was cheaper than returning it.</li>
            <li> Its not too bad for its price.  I was expecting worse but its all good.  Its soft and looks natural if u know what you doing.  That is if u know how to put it on properly.  It is also quiet long that I had to trim it.  Thanks good product.</li>
            <li> Crap...My worst lashes every. Never ended up wearing them outside my bathroom. Could barely get them to stay on because they were so heavy and plastic like.</li>
            <li> These lashes came surprisingly fast! However, they were way to wide and too long for normal eyes. In order too make them look even semi-natural on my face I had to cut them down significantly. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap, pretty, reusable lashes, the best I&#x27;ve found are &#x27;elf&#x27; which can be found at target for a dollar a piece.</li>
            <li> Very obvious they were false lashes. Had a thick band very difficult to apply. But for the price I should have realized they weren&#x27;t going to be great.</li>
            <li> This came promptly, and I was satisfied with the price!    For the product itself- They are long and definitely will need to trim them. Maybe I&#x27;m not used to buying 10pks of lashes, but I thought the packaging could have been better, that is my only complaint.  When I opened it, 1/2 the lashes fell out of the little tiny holes that were supposed to hold them neatly in place. You don&#x27;t want to squash those delicate false lashes.    Quality wise- same as ones in drugstore, so they work for me.</li>
            <li> When you open them, they have no shape or anything, so you have to flex them yourself. With that being said, these lashes are for people who have the thickness that they desire already and are looking for length. I found my expectations were perhaps too high. They are very natural looking but they do not make my eyes pop the way I&#x27;d like. I prefer Ardell for that purpose. They are reusable, but do you really need to reuse a pair when you have so many?     In the end, I thought them to be boring for events/special occasions and better for everyday wear. I did get complimented on them but I would not purchase again. So if you want everyday lashes, I guess these would be what you&#x27;re looking for. If you want just a little more umph (still without the fake look), go with Ardell 110/113.     Remember you get what you pay for :-)</li>
            <li> These lashes do not look natural at all. But if you want to use them to make demi lashes, they&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and put them on the outside of my eyes for an everyday look. Halfway through the day though they tend to stick up at the ends, I&#x27;ll blame that on my bad eyelash glue though. Good for the price!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are NOT natural looking whatsoever. They&#x27;re quite long and sparse, and very obviously plastic, so they can&#x27;t blend in with my natural lashes. I tried layering them and that made them look more like normal fake eyelashes- but still not natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers complained that the band was too stiff and I have to agree. Even after I bent and wiggled them, they remained stiff and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, they ARE super cheap, so if you just need a cheap pair to wear for a short period of time, these might be okay.</li>
            <li> I love them! And for the price they are pretty amazing. You just have to cut the corners but when put on it make the eyes bigger!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are perfect, they look so real no one can ever tell that I am wearing them, theses lashes are really long and help my real eyelashes look longer and fuller! I ordered other lashes in the past and they look completely fake but theses are wonderful. I would differently recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a fake lash ever in my life and i thought maybe i should use a cheap one first so if i dont like it on me, i can just take it off. But when i got it, it was great! of course, like any other fake lashes, it does look fake but it blends in with my lashes naturally like im not even wearing one! I can&#x27;t compare these to the ones sephora or mac sells since ive only tried these but they are great and i&#x27;ll definitely buy them once i use the others.</li>
            <li> I should have known by the price. They are freakishly long, the ends have to be cut, and they itched the heck outta my eye. They are way too long instead of being full and thick. Will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 boxes of these to use for my bachelorette party and wedding. They were priced so well and arrived on time. I just had to buy some glue since this doesn&#x27;t come with glue. I would put them on all my friends when when we were partying it up for my bachelorette. Then I used them on the entire wedding party. Saved so much money this way. My make-up artist was going to charge me $15 a set! Of course these are not the quality you would find at a make-up counter...but they worked fabulously and lasted. They didn&#x27;t come off until we took them off. Then we just threw them away!</li>
            <li> First of all, know one thing.... These are plastic (\\&quot;fiber\\&quot;) lashes. Knowing that, you won&#x27;t be disappointed when you get them in the mail. They are not human hair... Nothing like adrell lashes that you buy at the local store. But with that being said, these are not bad. For the price, what do you expect? With any set of false lashes, you have to trim them to fit your eye. The band is stiff (because it is \\&quot;fiber\\&quot;) but just wrap it around your finger and move it around to make it more flexible... easy fix. I personally like to cut one strip in half and wear one half on the end of one eye and the other on the other eye. The BEST glue for ANY false lash is Duo adhesive... Revlon glue isn&#x27;t so bad... everything else is crappy (my opinion). For the price it is not bad at all and the seller is very responsive and kind. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The band of the lashes could have been thinner and the texture could have been softer. The packaging was good</li>
            <li> I knew these were cheapy lashes, but no thank you. Never again. I have had cheap lashes that were better than this. They look awful, the glue refuses to stick and I have very expensive glue. I bought these a long, long time ago and I am sad to say the box still sits FULL in my make-up drawer.</li>
            <li> These lashes are just perfect, they give all the drama you need without over-doing it. They are the perfect length and thickness to make any one of your looks amazing. Alot of my co-workers are in love with my falsies. So i&#x27;ve ordered some for them. Although shipping does take long, they&#x27;re well worth the wait. I now order them in advanced when i see that i am running low. I will recommend this product to anyone trying to achieve a very nice full lash look! ((:</li>
            <li> It all depends on how you feel about the look of your lashes. Product is plastic so for me to like a natural look it doesnt really work for me.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great and got many uses out of them. Perfect for costuming and clubbing as well. Great price too.</li>
            <li> They do the job of fake eyelashes and for a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great for price. Does the trick for daily wear.</li>
            <li> They were cheap so I gave it a shot but these lashes definitely need some modification to wear.&lt;br /&gt;The band isn&#x27;t all black so it&#x27;s really obvious you&#x27;re wearing falsies.&lt;br /&gt;The band is also like cardboard, extremely itchy, heavy, and uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes themselves just look very fake when they&#x27;re on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d spend a few more dollars and get something I can actually wear out next time.</li>
            <li> These false eyelashes are very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Very good price for value and amount of lashes, BUT it didn&#x27;t come with the glue so i don&#x27;t have anything to put them on yet.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural and even if there not human hair they look really good</li>
            <li> These eyelashes do their job, but they are very cheaply made. They look real fake, and they don&#x27;t really hold their shape well.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought but for the price, I took a chance. They don&#x27;t bend easily to the shape of my eye. If you&#x27;re a pro at using these then you may have better luck. I&#x27;m retarded at trying to get fake lashes on so these didn&#x27;t suit me well.</li>
            <li> Worst eyelashes ever. you have to cut them to fit your own eye, the band in which the lashes are attached is really thick and heavy and hard to wear on ur eyes. to make these manageable i had to trim the band and the sides. waste of time and money. try ardells those are nice</li>
            <li> I use false eyelashes on a daily basis. This product is one of the worst I have ever bought. I am so happy that I did not spend too much on them.</li>
            <li> I would wear these to school and everyone thought they were real lashes. they are natural looking but still eye catching. I got many complements on them but the only thing that is hard is how long the band is  but you can just cut the lashes to your size of eye. 10 pairs has lasted me over 5 years, I wore them a lot for about 5 months then I just stopped wearing them as much</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these false eyelashes, I&#x27;ve ordered other ones that claimed to look natural but were far from it. These are very natural looking and worth the price!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and you can&#x27;t beat the price. If you or the person your looking to get this for is in to this stuff, you cant go wrong if your willing to wait on the shipping..</li>
            <li> I love these falsies! They are perfect in length for a natural long lash look. I can&#x27;t do without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> duraderas, solo que muy duras, si fueran mas flexibles serian geniales, para asi poder adherirlas mejor al palpado la cajita deberia ser mas fuerte</li>
            <li> I really like my eyelashes.. what I like most is that it didn&#x27;t took that long to receive them with out a hasol...</li>
            <li> They are really wide! Haha. They are really thin, but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty darn good! A downside is that u have to go out &amp; buy the glue...</li>
            <li> These are cheap and the suck. They are like plastic and they don&#x27;t shape to the eye well. I never used one pair because they look so fake!</li>
            <li> I have one main complaint, but other than that, the lashes are all right.&lt;br /&gt;The band on them is really thick so that it connects with the base of the lashes so they&#x27;re coplanar rather than perpendicular.  This means that when you put them on your eyes, the direction of the lashes is down instead of lifting up.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These lashes are very stiff and not that soft making them difficult to apply and not very natural looking. They seem too be too heavy for the Revlon eyelash glue that I have.</li>
