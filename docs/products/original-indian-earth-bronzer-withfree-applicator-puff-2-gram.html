            <li>I loved this product for years and years.  </li>

            <li>Since the 80&#x27;s when my friend shared it with me, Earth has always been the easiest and best thing available.</li>
            <li>I used it in the 80s and loved it.</li>
            <li>Looks good, I like it</li>
            <li>After you learn the best way to apply for your own face, it gives good color and great high lights to all ages.</li>

            <li>Gives skin a nice glow with no skin reactions to chemicals</li>
            <li>I remembered loving Indian Earth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blend nicely.</li>
            <li>but I know they truly liked the impact.</li>
            <li>I supplement my cheeks with a rose blush.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and very versatile .</li>
            <li>On me, I get this nice, healthy glow and not a lot of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect, natural color.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased I took the time to see if it was still available.</li>
            <li>Very good all natural way to put color in yr cheeks have used this product for a number of years</li>
            <li>I used to use Indian Earth many years ago.</li>
            <li>Before they used an application puff that was much better to use.</li>
            <li>Just how many years has it been since we all used Indian Earth?  </li>
            <li>Love how this adds color &amp; warmth to face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>it gives that healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My mother in law was gifted this for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>My mother received this from a Beauty-Of-The-Month kit and wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it then, have never had to use anything else.</li>
            <li>Love the glow it gives.  </li>
            <li>and I continue to love it.</li>
            <li>My wife hadn&#x27;t seen this item for years and was glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using it as eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The uses are so much more than just bronzing and blushing.  </li>
            <li>Was glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>it makes you look tan and healthy</li>
            <li>love this..............</li>
            <li>I love Indian Earth make-up.</li>
            <li>After so many years of using it of course we ran out and couldn&#x27;t found it anywhere because they discontinued it and</li>
            <li>I love Indian Earth</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m planning to purchase more.    </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>When I got to work, I was asked by more than one person where I got the tan.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT!</li>
            <li>Then as you have a sense of your skin getting darker, consider trying to give yourself an even more tan look; but don&#x27;t overdue it.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t eat the ingredients in many lotions</li>
            <li>It just means no one has been able  PROVE its harmful.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully in highschool many years ago.</li>
            <li>,I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>Unlike many, I like the puff and wish the order had included two.</li>
            <li>I will try it during the summer when I have more color.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even more appealing now than it was then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it many many years</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh I just love this bromzer  best ever and stay on for a long time</li>
            <li>it looks beautiful and natural.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased when I was able to find that it was still available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an avid make up user, but I love this product and was pleased to find it over the years!  </li>
            <li>Great product if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear make-up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available after all these years.</li>
            <li>I brush my cheekbones, then more lightly brush my forehead, across the bridge of my nose, and along my cheeks and jawbone.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I enjoy makeup, however, I find it most helpful when makeup leaves you looking like an improved version if yourself.</li>
            <li>Great product but not as nice as the original back in the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>EAsy to apply if done as directed.my suggestion is to use a cosmetic brush</li>
            <li>and i loved it, it gave me such a nice bronze look that people thought i had a tan.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, this is a classic that has survived the years for good reason.</li>
            <li>your flying, natural, warm color almost a lit from within!</li>
            <li>The puff is fine, but I find that my kabuki brush works just as well too.</li>
            <li>The powder is fine as I have used this in the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versatile as it can be used in many ways!</li>
            <li>Just use it lightly on your cheeks, lips, even as a shadow.</li>
            <li>The bottle came secure with a plastic seal around it and received it promptly.</li>
            <li>Overall it gives a nice glowing color,it&#x27;s smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t have shimmer which makes it nice for winter weather.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing this instead of foundation in the summer and always get compliments.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and this is quite dark.</li>
            <li>Good but only complain is the jar is easy to spill, .</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this on Amazon though.</li>
            <li>It was called &amp;#34;The Beauty Saloon.&amp;#34; I carried the original Body Shop products from Berkeley California.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the original Indian earth.</li>
            <li>It can be used for nice overall color and looks best when a little pressed powder is put over it to smooth it</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product because the pigments are all natural.  </li>
            <li>The truth is, no one understands the long term impacts of all these chemicals we are exposed to each and every day, so do your best to limit those exposures with natural products like this.</li>
            <li>This resulted in a warm but natural look.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it lasts a full workday.</li>
            <li>I used this product back in the 70&#x27;s was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice overall bronzer that looks great when it&#x27;s used properly.</li>
            <li>Be sure to distribute to the chin, around the nostril area, above the lips  and  neck to make sure you get a good overall distribution.  </li>
            <li>Best left as a nostalgic memory of the 70&#x27;s like Chemin de Fer jeans &amp; going to great concerts for $8.</li>
            <li>SO, VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li>I used it a long time ago and loved it</li>
            <li>I apply the pure product area and them rub in using the light and medium side.</li>
            <li>Color is as light or as intense as you make it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it looks so natural</li>
            <li>young and still love it.  </li>
            <li>And, as far as I am concerned there isn&#x27;t a better existing make up for anyone&#x27;s face....</li>
            <li>Later that side works nice for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>so I guess you can say we get out moneys worth.  </li>
            <li>Just because a product is sold, doesn&#x27;t mean its safe or good for you.</li>
            <li>In cases where I need to use a cover up due to blotches, I can then use Indian Earth to get a nice uniform and darker shade color that will hide the impacted areas and give me a nice natural glow.  </li>
            <li>thing I love about it is unlike many other blushes, etc.</li>
            <li>It is dark, so just be sure to use a VERY light amount and build up for desired color.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is good,.</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t very user friendly.</li>
            <li>If you can get it right</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up it provides just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>You can mix a little with any of your face creams to blend it more easily (my favorite for cheeks).</li>
            <li>I love the soft glow and natural look that can be obtained by using this original product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I think this product is even well suited for men; who struggle with pale winter skin; because its so very easy and really isn&#x27;t as feminine as most make ups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to adjust the amount you use for more or less of a tan look.</li>
            <li>Interestingly the lighter powder came in this dark bottle &amp; the medium color (the darker of the 2) arrived in the light colored bottle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Use my first Indian Earth in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so really be sure to use the smallest amount possible and build from there.</li>
            <li>Its exactly how I remembered.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer and is the only one I use.....</li>
            <li>Used it years ago, and this was the first time since then</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>thanks again Amazon..!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely ORANGE!</li>
            <li>I purchased the smaller bottle, I didn&#x27;t realize it at first because I was so excited to find it again!</li>
            <li>It may also make a nice supplement to other make up colors.</li>
            <li>I suggest same method if applying on with a blush brush, but be careful it doesn&#x27;t fly all over the room.  </li>
            <li>Always keep in mind that natural products like this are far better than chemical laden ones.</li>
            <li>and since I have fair skin the other was a little better.  </li>
            <li>All it is a large cotton ball.</li>
            <li>not the real earth color I wanted.</li>
            <li>But, I bought another jar recently, and I must say, lightly applied, I have gotten compliments on my &#x27;health&#x27; every day.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of mineral cosmetics, Indian Earth really does work on ALL skin tones</li>
            <li>but when I did as instructed by working product into it with fingers it applies product very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>That has always worked for me and keeps me from getting too much or wasting any.  </li>
            <li>One doesn&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>People have always assumed I just didn&#x27;t wear much make up and would ask me if I had been in the sun.  </li>
            <li>If the color appears to get orange,  you probably used too much..</li>
            <li>I think its important to have multiple colors on your checks and lips in this way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it came in because the cork doesn&#x27;t contain it very well.  </li>
            <li>It is much darker than I remember.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Forget about using that puff that comes with it, use a nice fluffy brush, and get the excess off of the brush before you apply it to skin.</li>
            <li>The flexability is what makes it so nice, you can be as formal and fussy with it as you need but can just dust it on and go for everyday too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rub onto nails and cover with clear top coat, more for darker color, less for barely there.  </li>
            <li>I use a different brush; for nails over clean, dry and then put on a clear coat - love the look.&lt;br /&gt;Always has a natural feel and gets the compliments that make taking the time to apply worth it!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and dont need very much.</li>
            <li>The small container is nice for travel.</li>
            <li>my guess is you need to experiment more and should consider less of it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product; but now I have a mess that I won&#x27;t put in my purse or travel with.</li>
            <li>I did not like this because it was very dark and was not a bronzer it was more like a blush.</li>
            <li>Applicator is pretty much just a giant cotton ball</li>
            <li>The jar is way smaller now but still worth it.</li>
            <li>I normally apply makeup before I&#x27;m dressed, so FYI.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely see how this would be a miracle product if your skin is darker or has golden undertones, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>It had its own following back in the day, but the idea of bronzers was not so big then.</li>
            <li>It is larger than the one shown and cost 19.99, if I remember right, which seemed like a lot back then, but it&#x27;s lasted so was pretty cheap in the long run.  </li>
            <li>you are not a &#x27;girly-girl&#x27; and just want something quick and basic to brighten up, this does the trick and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I was written up in New York Magazine about this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.....</li>
            <li>WARNING: a little teeny tiny but goes a long way color wise, and too much on the lips</li>
            <li>a good old stand by, a little goes a long way, and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking if you aren&#x27;t heavy-handed.</li>
            <li>Back when I originally was using it, there was only one shade.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same as when I bought it in the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I wanted to test it out first to see if in fact it was the same a yester year!</li>
            <li>Other than the darker shade and loose cork, I am delighted that Indian Earth is back and I will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep the bottle in a place where it won&#x27;t get knocked or tip over because if it spills, its can be a messy clean up; its very concentrated.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I think you will be absolutely amazed that such a little goes a long way and how nice this product will boosts your appearance.  </li>
            <li>I use the applicator in a way to where I have one side of it that has a light-medium amount for touch ups and another area with pure product for when I am starting my application.  </li>
            <li>better hours after you put it on, it does not fade out like chemical makeup, in fact it will work with the chemisty of your skin and look a little different on everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some have mentioned eye shadow and liner, but also put it on your lips for long-lasting color, alone or use clear gloss over for shimmer.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I purchased it this time, the bottle was much smaller and the applicator puff that was included does not work real well.</li>
            <li>but of course we didn&#x27;t have near the makeup selection we have now.</li>
            <li>In the early 80s in NYC, I introduced my customers to this product.</li>
            <li>It makes you look naturally</li>
            <li>looks like a natural  blush</li>
            <li>I especially like the pot as compared to the compact because on the cork you don&#x27;t get too much at a time.  </li>
            <li>and I tend to be overly sensitive to cosmetics.</li>
            <li>and I have always received a lot of compliments on the natural glow this product gives me.</li>
            <li>This is a natural bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a natural glow without looking orange.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE i WAS 15 YRS OLD</li>
            <li>THE COLOR LOOKS NATURAL</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s super dark.  </li>
            <li>The powder last for a very long time since little is used to get a nice color.</li>
            <li>Long before the popularity of pure mineral makeup, there was Indian Earth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a small bottle of the light &amp; one of the medium Indian Earth.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I also use other products, but I still keep the Indian earth as the main staple of my make up regiment.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I think its hardest when the applicator is new and has no skin oils or power on it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how very important it is that you use VERY VERY VERY small amounts at first, to get a sense of how little you need.</li>
            <li>:( I spilt over half on carpeting I will buy more because you can mix it with lotion and everything for s tan look! :)</li>
            <li>The power is very fine therefore is a little messy to use</li>
            <li>It is very economical and can last almost forever because it requires only little amount of it for each application.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to be introduced to this product in the late 80&#x27;s when I was a young teen</li>
            <li>I also tried using a soft kabuki &amp; it was no different.</li>
            <li>I do believe I heard the creator of the Bare Essentials line state that she credits this product as the inspiration for hers</li>
            <li>but this just made my fair, pinkish skin look muddy and dirty, even when I barely applied it.</li>
            <li>If this happens, just take a clean tissue and wipe it off slowly by rubbing the area.  </li>
            <li>You are all right about only needing a little, and we were shown to shake the jar, with the cork in it, then put Indian Earth onto puff or brush from the cork.  </li>
            <li>If you are NEW TO THIS product you risk making the common mistake of applying too much the first time  (thinking of it like other  make ups).  </li>
            <li>Hold onto the cork with bottle closed tightly, tip gently, then rap gently to remove excess.</li>
            <li>Product can appear heavy on the skin if not applied in small and very light portions.</li>
            <li>The cost has increased considerably but it does last a long time</li>
            <li>I love this little jar and yes, a little definitely goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The biggest issue you will have with this product is getting that sense of understanding how little you really need.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using it for the first time, just a caution that a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Since the 80&#x27;s when my friend shared it with me, Earth has always been the easiest and best thing available.</li>
            <li> I used it in the 80s and loved it.</li>
            <li> Looks good, I like it</li>
            <li> After you learn the best way to apply for your own face, it gives good color and great high lights to all ages.</li>

            <li> I have been using it for over 30 years and LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> Gives skin a nice glow with no skin reactions to chemicals</li>
            <li> I remembered loving Indian Earth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend nicely.</li>
            <li> but I know they truly liked the impact.</li>
            <li> I supplement my cheeks with a rose blush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very versatile .</li>
            <li> On me, I get this nice, healthy glow and not a lot of shimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect, natural color.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased I took the time to see if it was still available.</li>
            <li> Very good all natural way to put color in yr cheeks have used this product for a number of years</li>
            <li> I used to use Indian Earth many years ago.</li>
            <li> Before they used an application puff that was much better to use.</li>
            <li> Just how many years has it been since we all used Indian Earth?  </li>
            <li> Love how this adds color &amp; warmth to face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> it gives that healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My mother in law was gifted this for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> My mother received this from a Beauty-Of-The-Month kit and wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this color.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it then, have never had to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love the glow it gives.  </li>
            <li> and I continue to love it.</li>
            <li> My wife hadn&#x27;t seen this item for years and was glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using it as eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The uses are so much more than just bronzing and blushing.  </li>
            <li> Was glad to find it again.</li>
            <li> it makes you look tan and healthy</li>
            <li> love this..............</li>
            <li> I love Indian Earth make-up.</li>
            <li> After so many years of using it of course we ran out and couldn&#x27;t found it anywhere because they discontinued it and</li>
            <li> I love Indian Earth</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m planning to purchase more.    </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> When I got to work, I was asked by more than one person where I got the tan.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT!</li>
            <li> Then as you have a sense of your skin getting darker, consider trying to give yourself an even more tan look; but don&#x27;t overdue it.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t eat the ingredients in many lotions</li>
            <li> It just means no one has been able  PROVE its harmful.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully in highschool many years ago.</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> Unlike many, I like the puff and wish the order had included two.</li>
            <li> I will try it during the summer when I have more color.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even more appealing now than it was then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it many many years</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I just love this bromzer  best ever and stay on for a long time</li>
            <li> it looks beautiful and natural.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I was able to find that it was still available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an avid make up user, but I love this product and was pleased to find it over the years!  </li>
            <li> Great product if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear make-up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available after all these years.</li>
            <li> I brush my cheekbones, then more lightly brush my forehead, across the bridge of my nose, and along my cheeks and jawbone.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I enjoy makeup, however, I find it most helpful when makeup leaves you looking like an improved version if yourself.</li>
            <li> Great product but not as nice as the original back in the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> EAsy to apply if done as directed.my suggestion is to use a cosmetic brush</li>
            <li> and i loved it, it gave me such a nice bronze look that people thought i had a tan.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, this is a classic that has survived the years for good reason.</li>
            <li> your flying, natural, warm color almost a lit from within!</li>
            <li> The puff is fine, but I find that my kabuki brush works just as well too.</li>
            <li> The powder is fine as I have used this in the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very versatile as it can be used in many ways!</li>
            <li> Just use it lightly on your cheeks, lips, even as a shadow.</li>
            <li> The bottle came secure with a plastic seal around it and received it promptly.</li>
            <li> Overall it gives a nice glowing color,it&#x27;s smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t have shimmer which makes it nice for winter weather.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this instead of foundation in the summer and always get compliments.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and this is quite dark.</li>
            <li> Good but only complain is the jar is easy to spill, .</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this on Amazon though.</li>
            <li> It was called &amp;#34;The Beauty Saloon.&amp;#34; I carried the original Body Shop products from Berkeley California.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original Indian earth.</li>
            <li> It can be used for nice overall color and looks best when a little pressed powder is put over it to smooth it</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product because the pigments are all natural.  </li>
            <li> The truth is, no one understands the long term impacts of all these chemicals we are exposed to each and every day, so do your best to limit those exposures with natural products like this.</li>
            <li> This resulted in a warm but natural look.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it lasts a full workday.</li>
            <li> I used this product back in the 70&#x27;s was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice overall bronzer that looks great when it&#x27;s used properly.</li>
            <li> Be sure to distribute to the chin, around the nostril area, above the lips  and  neck to make sure you get a good overall distribution.  </li>
            <li> Best left as a nostalgic memory of the 70&#x27;s like Chemin de Fer jeans &amp; going to great concerts for $8.</li>
            <li> SO, VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li> I used it a long time ago and loved it</li>
            <li> I apply the pure product area and them rub in using the light and medium side.</li>
            <li> Color is as light or as intense as you make it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it looks so natural</li>
            <li> young and still love it.  </li>
            <li> And, as far as I am concerned there isn&#x27;t a better existing make up for anyone&#x27;s face....</li>
            <li> Later that side works nice for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> so I guess you can say we get out moneys worth.  </li>
            <li> Just because a product is sold, doesn&#x27;t mean its safe or good for you.</li>
            <li> In cases where I need to use a cover up due to blotches, I can then use Indian Earth to get a nice uniform and darker shade color that will hide the impacted areas and give me a nice natural glow.  </li>
            <li> thing I love about it is unlike many other blushes, etc.</li>
            <li> It is dark, so just be sure to use a VERY light amount and build up for desired color.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is good,.</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t very user friendly.</li>
            <li> If you can get it right</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up it provides just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> You can mix a little with any of your face creams to blend it more easily (my favorite for cheeks).</li>
            <li> I love the soft glow and natural look that can be obtained by using this original product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think this product is even well suited for men; who struggle with pale winter skin; because its so very easy and really isn&#x27;t as feminine as most make ups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to adjust the amount you use for more or less of a tan look.</li>
            <li> Interestingly the lighter powder came in this dark bottle &amp; the medium color (the darker of the 2) arrived in the light colored bottle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Use my first Indian Earth in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so really be sure to use the smallest amount possible and build from there.</li>
            <li> Its exactly how I remembered.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and is the only one I use.....</li>
            <li> Used it years ago, and this was the first time since then</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> thanks again Amazon..!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely ORANGE!</li>
            <li> I purchased the smaller bottle, I didn&#x27;t realize it at first because I was so excited to find it again!</li>
            <li> It may also make a nice supplement to other make up colors.</li>
            <li> I suggest same method if applying on with a blush brush, but be careful it doesn&#x27;t fly all over the room.  </li>
            <li> Always keep in mind that natural products like this are far better than chemical laden ones.</li>
            <li> and since I have fair skin the other was a little better.  </li>
            <li> All it is a large cotton ball.</li>
            <li> not the real earth color I wanted.</li>
            <li> But, I bought another jar recently, and I must say, lightly applied, I have gotten compliments on my &#x27;health&#x27; every day.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of mineral cosmetics, Indian Earth really does work on ALL skin tones</li>
            <li> but when I did as instructed by working product into it with fingers it applies product very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> That has always worked for me and keeps me from getting too much or wasting any.  </li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> People have always assumed I just didn&#x27;t wear much make up and would ask me if I had been in the sun.  </li>
            <li> If the color appears to get orange,  you probably used too much..</li>
            <li> I think its important to have multiple colors on your checks and lips in this way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> it came in because the cork doesn&#x27;t contain it very well.  </li>
            <li> It is much darker than I remember.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Forget about using that puff that comes with it, use a nice fluffy brush, and get the excess off of the brush before you apply it to skin.</li>
            <li> The flexability is what makes it so nice, you can be as formal and fussy with it as you need but can just dust it on and go for everyday too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rub onto nails and cover with clear top coat, more for darker color, less for barely there.  </li>
            <li> I use a different brush; for nails over clean, dry and then put on a clear coat - love the look.&lt;br /&gt;Always has a natural feel and gets the compliments that make taking the time to apply worth it!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and dont need very much.</li>
            <li> The small container is nice for travel.</li>
            <li> my guess is you need to experiment more and should consider less of it.  </li>
            <li> Love the product; but now I have a mess that I won&#x27;t put in my purse or travel with.</li>
            <li> I did not like this because it was very dark and was not a bronzer it was more like a blush.</li>
            <li> Applicator is pretty much just a giant cotton ball</li>
            <li> The jar is way smaller now but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally apply makeup before I&#x27;m dressed, so FYI.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely see how this would be a miracle product if your skin is darker or has golden undertones, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It had its own following back in the day, but the idea of bronzers was not so big then.</li>
            <li> It is larger than the one shown and cost 19.99, if I remember right, which seemed like a lot back then, but it&#x27;s lasted so was pretty cheap in the long run.  </li>
            <li> you are not a &#x27;girly-girl&#x27; and just want something quick and basic to brighten up, this does the trick and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was written up in New York Magazine about this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.....</li>
            <li> WARNING: a little teeny tiny but goes a long way color wise, and too much on the lips</li>
            <li> a good old stand by, a little goes a long way, and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking if you aren&#x27;t heavy-handed.</li>
            <li> Back when I originally was using it, there was only one shade.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as when I bought it in the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I wanted to test it out first to see if in fact it was the same a yester year!</li>
            <li> Other than the darker shade and loose cork, I am delighted that Indian Earth is back and I will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep the bottle in a place where it won&#x27;t get knocked or tip over because if it spills, its can be a messy clean up; its very concentrated.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I think you will be absolutely amazed that such a little goes a long way and how nice this product will boosts your appearance.  </li>
            <li> I use the applicator in a way to where I have one side of it that has a light-medium amount for touch ups and another area with pure product for when I am starting my application.  </li>
            <li> better hours after you put it on, it does not fade out like chemical makeup, in fact it will work with the chemisty of your skin and look a little different on everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some have mentioned eye shadow and liner, but also put it on your lips for long-lasting color, alone or use clear gloss over for shimmer.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it this time, the bottle was much smaller and the applicator puff that was included does not work real well.</li>
            <li> but of course we didn&#x27;t have near the makeup selection we have now.</li>
            <li> In the early 80s in NYC, I introduced my customers to this product.</li>
            <li> It makes you look naturally</li>
            <li> looks like a natural  blush</li>
            <li> I especially like the pot as compared to the compact because on the cork you don&#x27;t get too much at a time.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to be overly sensitive to cosmetics.</li>
            <li> and I have always received a lot of compliments on the natural glow this product gives me.</li>
            <li> This is a natural bronzer.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a natural glow without looking orange.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE i WAS 15 YRS OLD</li>
            <li> THE COLOR LOOKS NATURAL</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s super dark.  </li>
            <li> The powder last for a very long time since little is used to get a nice color.</li>
            <li> Long before the popularity of pure mineral makeup, there was Indian Earth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a small bottle of the light &amp; one of the medium Indian Earth.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I also use other products, but I still keep the Indian earth as the main staple of my make up regiment.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I think its hardest when the applicator is new and has no skin oils or power on it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how very important it is that you use VERY VERY VERY small amounts at first, to get a sense of how little you need.</li>
            <li> :( I spilt over half on carpeting I will buy more because you can mix it with lotion and everything for s tan look! :)</li>
            <li> The power is very fine therefore is a little messy to use</li>
            <li> It is very economical and can last almost forever because it requires only little amount of it for each application.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to be introduced to this product in the late 80&#x27;s when I was a young teen</li>
            <li> I also tried using a soft kabuki &amp; it was no different.</li>
            <li> I do believe I heard the creator of the Bare Essentials line state that she credits this product as the inspiration for hers</li>
            <li> but this just made my fair, pinkish skin look muddy and dirty, even when I barely applied it.</li>
            <li> If this happens, just take a clean tissue and wipe it off slowly by rubbing the area.  </li>
            <li> You are all right about only needing a little, and we were shown to shake the jar, with the cork in it, then put Indian Earth onto puff or brush from the cork.  </li>
            <li> If you are NEW TO THIS product you risk making the common mistake of applying too much the first time  (thinking of it like other  make ups).  </li>
            <li> Hold onto the cork with bottle closed tightly, tip gently, then rap gently to remove excess.</li>
            <li> Product can appear heavy on the skin if not applied in small and very light portions.</li>
            <li> The cost has increased considerably but it does last a long time</li>
            <li> I love this little jar and yes, a little definitely goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The biggest issue you will have with this product is getting that sense of understanding how little you really need.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using it for the first time, just a caution that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Used this in high school.(a few years back!)</li>
            <li> looks very natural...and a little goes a long way..!</li>
            <li> They complained at the idea at first (men don&#x27;t wear make up after all)  </li>
            <li> Will probably last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and instead of using the puff; I use a natural broad brush applicator - need to use very little - it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also go easy when putting it on your face as it can look scary when applied,</li>
            <li> I believe the applicator really needs to get broken in and to adsorb some of the powder and even some of your natural skin oils</li>
            <li> Also, if the link to breast cancer is truly related to chemical deodorants, I&#x27;m not going to be victim to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a loose powder blush with no shimmer for YEARS and thought I&#x27;d finally found it...</li>
            <li> Long time.  </li>
            <li> I had this a long time ago</li>
            <li> Some tends to gather around the edges so be careful when applying (I wouldn&#x27;t apply this with white on).</li>
            <li> It only needs to be (minimally) re-applied if you plan on going out after work for the evening.  </li>
            <li> I will empty the jar and put it in a different container without the cork.  .</li>
            <li> I generally like to tone it down with a lighter Bronzer, but this one does not have a lighter bronzer to mix with it.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, even as a tomboy I fell in love with the little jar that could--and did.  </li>
            <li> The key being that so very little goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I was surprised to see how the small amount of bronzer  </li>
            <li> Comes out too dark and just not the same it used to be.</li>
            <li> A lot goes a very long way, so be careful.</li>
            <li> This goes on so roughly.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful it can get all over the sink, but it wipes up and doesn&#x27;t stain the sink.</li>
            <li> I was forced to search for another foundation makeup after the company stopped making &amp;#34;Indian Earth&amp;#34; in the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to help my male friends who looked overly pale.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m dark-skinned) since it doesn&#x27;t contain talc (which makes dark skin look dry and ashy).  </li>
            <li> Spent quite a bit of money on other products, but could not get the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to remember that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Then with a small two finger area behind the tissue, rub it slightly onto your Upper cheeks, Forehead and Upper eyelids (the eyelid gives that natural sun kissed look) then rub it in and distribute it evenly using the buff (which will pick up some of the product and help distribute it).</li>
            <li> Applicator cotton puff is not very consistent, but use a Blush Brush and a paper towel to daub it on, and voila!  </li>
            <li> I do not know if this is the regular content of I received one that did not have the usual amount.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other bronzer...</li>
            <li> All other foundation makeups made me look like &amp;#34;Ronald McDonald&#x27;s&amp;#34;wife.</li>
            <li> ago!&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> The jar is smaller than I recall and the cork does not fit tightly, so some of the product escapes the container.</li>
            <li> You must be very careful and hold the puff to the bottle when getting out powder.</li>
            <li> Each generation has its product related victims in this way (people who died or became very ill from a regularly sold item such as red jelly)  </li>
            <li> It streaks &amp; goes on clumpy but impossible to smooth out if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> as mentioned by another person a little goes a Long way , keep cork in shake and then run your brush or puff over cork!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend you put just a little bit on a white tissue (so that you can hardly see only a the specks you picked up and know it is a very small limited amount on that tissue.</li>
            <li> Very little goe a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have Irish fair skin that can look just awful and dull in the winter</li>
            <li> Goes on really dark, even with my tan.  </li>
            <li> I have been using as a teen in the late 70&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a foundation because it is too dark for my skin</li>
            <li> And be careful not to spill, it can get a little messy.</li>
            <li> It was less than one quarter of the jar.  </li>
            <li> Looked like a replica of the previous Indian Earth Bronzer.</li>
            <li> But the cork broke off half way; can&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li> There are non-ground up pieces of Indian Earth that, when applied by the sheepskin puff, leave little dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the little plastic bag</li>
            <li> I use it for a lip tint, blush, mix with my lotion for a little glow, eye shadow............</li>
            <li> Just got this product and it is like my 80&#x27;s bronze but a little darker.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get use to this..</li>
            <li> The Indian Earth is still the same but not happy with the applicator puff.</li>
            <li> but I do not use it often as it is messy.</li>
            <li> Am grateful it is around again since I looked for it a few years ago and could not find it.</li>
            <li> I have always used Indian Earth and have had trouble finding it from time to time</li>
            <li> It also dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess in a plastic bag with half a cork in the bottle and the other half useless.</li>
            <li> this powder is VERY dark!  </li>
            <li> Use very, very, very little even if you have so called \\&quot;olive\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> I had a small shop on Columbus Ave.</li>
            <li> after simply using it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will repurchase unless they have some sort of price break on it.</li>
            <li> I bought the small size</li>
            <li> When I try to dab them off, they smear and make a REAL mess.  </li>
            <li> Repeat these steps using just a VERY LITTLE each time; increasing the impact each time and taking it slow in this way.</li>
            <li> and I mean small, once you get used to what miracles</li>
            <li> Using too small of a brush makes you look dirty, need a giant powder brush to apply</li>
            <li> I think its very difficult to impossible to tell the difference from my true tan color vs. this make up.  </li>
            <li> Very small amount of product in the bottle.....</li>
            <li> I apply a very small amount to the cotton applicator and use if for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe my eyes when I came upon this product!</li>
            <li> OUR SECRET..</li>
            <li> Humorously, I&#x27;ve made the mistake of using a liberal amount in the winter; after being sick (thinking of how awful I looked) .</li>
            <li> Not sure why they include the puff since it is almost worthless, and the amount you get anymore especially for what they charge is disappointing, but I do like the product.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need make-up base because it hides freckles and minor flaws.</li>
            <li> --It is difficult to put on --</li>
            <li> Sadly, the truth is that it has to be proven that people have become ill from a product; before they are banned from use.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that for the price I paid there is so little Indian Earth.  </li>
            <li> This was disappointing, given the price paid.</li>
            <li> No manufacturer who is making profits from a use is going to look to prove that use is bad for us, or volunteer to stop selling it.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s terrible to get off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not the real earth color I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear make-up.  Gives skin a nice glow with no skin reactions to chemicals - it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I generally like to tone it down with a lighter Bronzer, but this one does not have a lighter bronzer to mix with it.  Other than that it is good,.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product because the pigments are all natural.  However, it&#x27;s super dark.  Applying it is an art as you literally use a tiny, minuscule amount for your entire face.  If you can get it right it looks beautiful and natural.  If not your face will look like its part of a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> I used to use Indian Earth many years ago. When I purchased it this time, the bottle was much smaller and the applicator puff that was included does not work real well. All it is a large cotton ball. Before they used an application puff that was much better to use. The Indian Earth is still the same but not happy with the applicator puff.</li>
            <li> a good old stand by, a little goes a long way, and it looks so natural. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available after all these years.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it looks so natural and it lasts all day.  It enhances face features.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I was surprised to see how the small amount of bronzer  there was in the jar.  It was less than one quarter of the jar.  I do not know if this is the regular content of I received one that did not have the usual amount.  This was disappointing, given the price paid.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small bottle of the light &amp; one of the medium Indian Earth. Interestingly the lighter powder came in this dark bottle &amp; the medium color (the darker of the 2) arrived in the light colored bottle. No rhyme or reason to that. Nonetheless I dislike both equally. I used Indian Earth for years in the 70&#x27;s. I loved it then but of course we didn&#x27;t have near the makeup selection we have now. We didn&#x27;t have all these &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; makeups then. I was so excited when I saw this on Amazon though. I remembered loving Indian Earth. So I ordered it is a regrettable purchase. Plan to return both bottles. This goes on so roughly. Only way I know to explain. It doesn&#x27;t blend nicely. Even using the puff that came with it. I also tried using a soft kabuki &amp; it was no different. It streaks &amp; goes on clumpy but impossible to smooth out if you make a mistake. Instead you have to wash it off &amp; start all over. It gets everywhere too. So disappointed. Best left as a nostalgic memory of the 70&#x27;s like Chemin de Fer jeans &amp; going to great concerts for $8. Good times</li>
            <li> Just how many years has it been since we all used Indian Earth?  Long time.  But, I bought another jar recently, and I must say, lightly applied, I have gotten compliments on my &#x27;health&#x27; every day.  \\&quot;You look great!\\&quot;  Just the Earth.  Applicator cotton puff is not very consistent, but use a Blush Brush and a paper towel to daub it on, and voila!  With all the cosmetics that have been invented, and I have bought, since Indian Earth arrived, I still like Indian Earth the best.  Gives a great glow to the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Love how this adds color &amp; warmth to face &amp; neck. Had to go to local beauty store to buy a giant nail brush to apply. Using too small of a brush makes you look dirty, need a giant powder brush to apply</li>
            <li> I loved this product for years and years.  I&#x27;m 70 yrs. young and still love it.  I was so happy to find it again .  The color is great it gives that healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My mother in law was gifted this for her birthday.  She absolutely loves this product.  You can use it as a foundation, eye shadow and even lipstick. It&#x27;s got a great color to it but, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s still the best. In the early 80s in NYC, I introduced my customers to this product. I had a small shop on Columbus Ave. at that time. It was called &amp;#34;The Beauty Saloon.&amp;#34; I carried the original Body Shop products from Berkeley California. I was written up in New York Magazine about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it since then. It&#x27;s still the only bronzer for me. Just use it lightly on your cheeks, lips, even as a shadow. You can mix a little with any of your face creams to blend it more easily (my favorite for cheeks). On your lips, mix it with lip balm. A lot goes a very long way, so be careful. Also, for traveling, put some in another container. If you break this one, it goes everywhere and it&#x27;s terrible to get off.</li>
            <li> Long before the popularity of pure mineral makeup, there was Indian Earth.  My mother received this from a Beauty-Of-The-Month kit and wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.  Needless to say, even as a tomboy I fell in love with the little jar that could--and did.  Unlike a lot of mineral cosmetics, Indian Earth really does work on ALL skin tones (I&#x27;m dark-skinned) since it doesn&#x27;t contain talc (which makes dark skin look dry and ashy).  On me, I get this nice, healthy glow and not a lot of shimmer.  I got my jar in the mail and went to the bathroom to put it on and after all these years Indian Earth is as good now as it was then.  I definitely plan on taking this on vacation. I love this little jar and yes, a little definitely goes a long way.  The puff is fine, but I find that my kabuki brush works just as well too.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  There are non-ground up pieces of Indian Earth that, when applied by the sheepskin puff, leave little dark spots on my skin. When I try to dab them off, they smear and make a REAL mess.  I have used Indian Earth for years and never had this problem before!</li>
            <li> Still using this now over a year.  Last one lasted 8 years!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Applicator is pretty much just a giant cotton ball but when I did as instructed by working product into it with fingers it applies product very well. Love this color. Very natural looking and dont need very much. Will probably last a really long time. Very happy</li>
            <li> Use my first Indian Earth in the 70&#x27;s. I fell in love with it then, have never had to use anything else. A little bit goes a long way!!! I can&#x27;t live without it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life User&lt;br /&gt;Diane</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Love the glow it gives.  I used it a long time ago and loved it and I continue to love it.</li>
            <li> I bought Indian Earth back in the 1980s and used it all the time. Then it disappeared from the shelves and I was bereft. It&#x27;s a great product. You don&#x27;t need make-up base because it hides freckles and minor flaws. Nothing works like this product to make my face look sun kissed without being exposed to UV rays. I think it&#x27;s a bit darker than I recall. Or perhaps I purchased a different shade? Back when I originally was using it, there was only one shade. The jar is smaller than I recall and the cork does not fit tightly, so some of the product escapes the container. Other than the darker shade and loose cork, I am delighted that Indian Earth is back and I will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using it for the first time, just a caution that a little goes a long way. Gently brush your cheekbone, then wait a few minutes for the Indian Earth to interact with the warmth of your skin. I brush my cheekbones, then more lightly brush my forehead, across the bridge of my nose, and along my cheeks and jawbone. Experiment. It makes you look naturally suntanned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I do like this product but I do not use it often as it is messy. You must be very careful and hold the puff to the bottle when getting out powder. Also go easy when putting it on your face as it can look scary when applied, blending well will help.</li>
            <li> Since the 80&#x27;s when my friend shared it with me, Earth has always been the easiest and best thing available. After you learn the best way to apply for your own face, it gives good color and great high lights to all ages. The jar is way smaller now but still worth it. Am grateful it is around again since I looked for it a few years ago and could not find it. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife hadn&#x27;t seen this item for years and was glad to see it on Amazon. She&#x27;s happy about it.</li>
            <li> Just like it used to be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and instead of using the puff; I use a natural broad brush applicator - need to use very little - it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for years.  This is exactly the same as when I bought it in the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s and I love it.</li>
            <li> looks like a natural  blush</li>
            <li> I had this a long time ago and I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> I remember using this in the &#x27;70s.  Adore it as a blush (use sparingly) and eye shadow.  I&#x27;ve received compliments about my tan!!  Very natural looking if you aren&#x27;t heavy-handed.</li>
            <li> this powder is VERY dark!  I have olive skin and have a great tan--It is difficult to put on --</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I enjoy makeup, however, I find it most helpful when makeup leaves you looking like an improved version if yourself. I feel that Indian earth does just that. I had a wedding to go to and after applying foundation used this as blush,eyeshadow and mixed it with balm for lip color. This resulted in a warm but natural look. WARNING: a little teeny tiny but goes a long way color wise, and too much on the lips isn&#x27;t a pleasant texture so really be sure to use the smallest amount possible and build from there.</li>
            <li> This one product that is so versatile.  It is very economical and can last almost forever because it requires only little amount of it for each application.</li>
            <li> Great product but not as nice as the original back in the 70&#x27;s.  Goes on really dark, even with my tan.  Give me a ruddy reddish color.  I kept it and mixed it with a paler power for a bronzer/blush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the smaller bottle, I didn&#x27;t realize it at first because I was so excited to find it again! Its exactly how I remembered. The bottle came secure with a plastic seal around it and received it promptly. I don&#x27;t use the powder puff for applying it, but you can use it for blending if you use it as a blush.  I love using it as eye makeup. Hold onto the cork with bottle closed tightly, tip gently, then rap gently to remove excess. Remove cork and I rub eye shadow applier onto the cork to collect the bronzer. Some tends to gather around the edges so be careful when applying (I wouldn&#x27;t apply this with white on). I normally apply makeup before I&#x27;m dressed, so FYI.  If you aren&#x27;t careful it can get all over the sink, but it wipes up and doesn&#x27;t stain the sink. I suggest same method if applying on with a blush brush, but be careful it doesn&#x27;t fly all over the room.  Just dap the brush, don&#x27;t wipe the brush on the cork.  It&#x27;s the beautiful &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; eyemakeup I can never find.  All others were too orange or too red. This is the perfect, natural color.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  Comes out too dark and just not the same it used to be. Would definitely not buy again.  Looked like a replica of the previous Indian Earth Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product in the 80&#x27;s and swear I am still using a jar I got back then.  It is larger than the one shown and cost 19.99, if I remember right, which seemed like a lot back then, but it&#x27;s lasted so was pretty cheap in the long run.  You are all right about only needing a little, and we were shown to shake the jar, with the cork in it, then put Indian Earth onto puff or brush from the cork.  That has always worked for me and keeps me from getting too much or wasting any.  The uses are so much more than just bronzing and blushing.  Some have mentioned eye shadow and liner, but also put it on your lips for long-lasting color, alone or use clear gloss over for shimmer.  Rub onto nails and cover with clear top coat, more for darker color, less for barely there.  It is the all in one accessory.</li>
            <li> Used this in high school.(a few years back!) Was glad to find it again.</li>
            <li> Very small amount of product in the bottle..... I used Indian Earth years ago... It isn&#x27;t the way I remembered it to be..&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the delivery.... I have no issues with whom mailed me the order... Very happy with them!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and is the only one I use.....it makes you look tan and healthy and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other bronzer...love this..............</li>
            <li> I have always used Indian Earth and have had trouble finding it from time to time so I was thrilled to know I could get it through Amazon!  I especially like the pot as compared to the compact because on the cork you don&#x27;t get too much at a time.  One doesn&#x27;t need much so it&#x27;s perfect. And, as far as I am concerned there isn&#x27;t a better existing make up for anyone&#x27;s face....it&#x27;s minerals are great for your skin.  Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> I love Indian Earth make-up. I began using it as a teen ager and now my daughters, 17 and 15 use it too. The small container is nice for travel. The powder last for a very long time since little is used to get a nice color.</li>
            <li> My mother, grandmother and aunts used indian earth years ago and as a teenager i would use it and i loved it, it gave me such a nice bronze look that people thought i had a tan.  After so many years of using it of course we ran out and couldn&#x27;t found it anywhere because they discontinued it and years later my cousin told me about the website i immediately placed my order and i&#x27;m so happy that i found my bronzer. I love Indian Earth and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m planning to purchase more.    thank you</li>
            <li> I find it actually was looking for. EAsy to apply if done as directed.my suggestion is to use a cosmetic brush</li>
            <li> Bought this before way back...in the 70&#x27;s? Loved it! Just happened to be on Amazon looking for something else and saw it!!  I have 10 blushes and like this the best!!</li>
            <li> BEST MAKE UP  I have ever used and I will use it forever!! I have Irish fair skin that can look just awful and dull in the winter and I tend to be overly sensitive to cosmetics. This product is fantastic! I believe this would make a WONDERFUL GIFT for many people because it can nicely supplement any make up routine. and especially help in covering up problem areas while giving a sun kissed look. In fact, I think this product is even well suited for men; who struggle with pale winter skin; because its so very easy and really isn&#x27;t as feminine as most make ups. I&#x27;ve used it to help my male friends who looked overly pale. They complained at the idea at first (men don&#x27;t wear make up after all)  but I know they truly liked the impact. In cases where I need to use a cover up due to blotches, I can then use Indian Earth to get a nice uniform and darker shade color that will hide the impacted areas and give me a nice natural glow.  I was fortunate to be introduced to this product in the late 80&#x27;s when I was a young teen and I have always received a lot of compliments on the natural glow this product gives me. People have always assumed I just didn&#x27;t wear much make up and would ask me if I had been in the sun.  I think its very difficult to impossible to tell the difference from my true tan color vs. this make up.  It&#x27;s also easy to adjust the amount you use for more or less of a tan look. It may also make a nice supplement to other make up colors. Humorously, I&#x27;ve made the mistake of using a liberal amount in the winter; after being sick (thinking of how awful I looked) . When I got to work, I was asked by more than one person where I got the tan. IMPORTANT! Keep the bottle in a place where it won&#x27;t get knocked or tip over because if it spills, its can be a messy clean up; its very concentrated. If you are NEW TO THIS product you risk making the common mistake of applying too much the first time  (thinking of it like other  make ups).  Please take my advise ON HOW TO FIRSTTRY INDIAN EARTH, because you risk thinking you won&#x27;t like it. after simply using it the wrong way. I can&#x27;t tell you how very important it is that you use VERY VERY VERY small amounts at first, to get a sense of how little you need. I recommend you put just a little bit on a white tissue (so that you can hardly see only a the specks you picked up and know it is a very small limited amount on that tissue. Then with a small two finger area behind the tissue, rub it slightly onto your Upper cheeks, Forehead and Upper eyelids (the eyelid gives that natural sun kissed look) then rub it in and distribute it evenly using the buff (which will pick up some of the product and help distribute it). Repeat these steps using just a VERY LITTLE each time; increasing the impact each time and taking it slow in this way. Be sure to distribute to the chin, around the nostril area, above the lips  and  neck to make sure you get a good overall distribution.  If you are wearing your hair up, consider the back areas of your neck as well. Then as you have a sense of your skin getting darker, consider trying to give yourself an even more tan look; but don&#x27;t overdue it.  If the color appears to get orange,  you probably used too much.. If this happens, just take a clean tissue and wipe it off slowly by rubbing the area.  I supplement my cheeks with a rose blush. I think its important to have multiple colors on your checks and lips in this way. Anyway, I think you will be absolutely amazed that such a little goes a long way and how nice this product will boosts your appearance.  If you don&#x27;t like it, my guess is you need to experiment more and should consider less of it.  The key being that so very little goes such a long way. The biggest issue you will have with this product is getting that sense of understanding how little you really need. Lastly, I think its hardest when the applicator is new and has no skin oils or power on it.  I believe the applicator really needs to get broken in and to adsorb some of the powder and even some of your natural skin oils (sounds gross when I say it though). I use the applicator in a way to where I have one side of it that has a light-medium amount for touch ups and another area with pure product for when I am starting my application.  I apply the pure product area and them rub in using the light and medium side. Later that side works nice for touch ups.  As I have gotten older, I also use other products, but I still keep the Indian earth as the main staple of my make up regiment. Always keep in mind that natural products like this are far better than chemical laden ones. The truth is, no one understands the long term impacts of all these chemicals we are exposed to each and every day, so do your best to limit those exposures with natural products like this. knowing that products you put on your skin will be adsorbed into your body.  I&#x27;m just as careful with lotions and only use Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant. I wouldn&#x27;t eat the ingredients in many lotions so I don&#x27;t use them. Also, if the link to breast cancer is truly related to chemical deodorants, I&#x27;m not going to be victim to it.  Sadly, the truth is that it has to be proven that people have become ill from a product; before they are banned from use. No manufacturer who is making profits from a use is going to look to prove that use is bad for us, or volunteer to stop selling it.  Just because a product is sold, doesn&#x27;t mean its safe or good for you. It just means no one has been able  PROVE its harmful. Each generation has its product related victims in this way (people who died or became very ill from a regularly sold item such as red jelly)  and you don&#x27;t want to be one of them. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I just love this bromzer  best ever and stay on for a long time</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe I found this product on Amazon! I used it faithfully in highschool many years ago. It works just as well now as it did then. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good but only complain is the jar is easy to spill, .:( I spilt over half on carpeting I will buy more because you can mix it with lotion and everything for s tan look! :)it was here in 3 days ,I&#x27;ll be buying more soon. Thanks</li>
            <li> The powder is fine as I have used this in the 70&#x27;s.  The puff is no help at all because it is like a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very versatile .</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t very user friendly. Product can appear heavy on the skin if not applied in small and very light portions. Otherwise it looks great once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they include the puff since it is almost worthless, and the amount you get anymore especially for what they charge is disappointing, but I do like the product.  Used it years ago, and this was the first time since then I have thought to purchase it again.  Not sure if I will repurchase unless they have some sort of price break on it.</li>
            <li> It is dark, so just be sure to use a VERY light amount and build up for desired color. And be careful not to spill, it can get a little messy. Overall it gives a nice glowing color,it&#x27;s smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t have shimmer which makes it nice for winter weather.</li>
            <li> Very little goe a long way.  I love the soft glow and natural look that can be obtained by using this original product.  If you like mineral makeup, give Indian Earth a try.  I do believe I heard the creator of the Bare Essentials line state that she credits this product as the inspiration for hers</li>
            <li> The best bronzer ever...I have been using it for over 30 years and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and this is quite dark. I used it in the 80s and loved it. I must have had a tan back then. ;)</li>
            <li> My sister and I have used this product for years and continue to do so.  The cost has increased considerably but it does last a long time so I guess you can say we get out moneys worth.  It only needs to be (minimally) re-applied if you plan on going out after work for the evening.  Otherwise, it lasts a full workday.</li>
            <li> Spent quite a bit of money on other products, but could not get the look I wanted.  The Indian Earth Bronzer did&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an avid make up user, but I love this product and was pleased to find it over the years!  The powder can be used on lips, nails, cheeks and as an overall bronzer.  I use a different brush; for nails over clean, dry and then put on a clear coat - love the look.&lt;br /&gt;Always has a natural feel and gets the compliments that make taking the time to apply worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Indian Earth for years! It&#x27;s very versatile as it can be used in many ways!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this again..! got flash backs to the 80&#x27;s and my younger days..! love the touch of sun it gives...! looks very natural...and a little goes a long way..! thanks again Amazon..!</li>
            <li> I used this product back in the 70&#x27;s was delighted to find it. But the cork broke off half way; can&#x27;t travel with it. It&#x27;s a mess in a plastic bag with half a cork in the bottle and the other half useless. Love the product; but now I have a mess that I won&#x27;t put in my purse or travel with. What use is it to me.</li>
            <li> I a m a woman of color with a red/brown complexion. I was forced to search for another foundation makeup after the company stopped making &amp;#34;Indian Earth&amp;#34; in the early 80&#x27;s. All other foundation makeups made me look like &amp;#34;Ronald McDonald&#x27;s&amp;#34;wife. Now that I have reconnected with a source that sells &amp;#34;Indian Earth&amp;#34;, I look like myself again! In my religion,I cannot wear makeup. THANK&#x27;S SO, VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li> ...As my Amazon order reflects my last bottle has lasted since 2011 and we are entering 2015... I have been using as a teen in the late 70&#x27;s..and now I am 56..I have never been A LIQUID MAKEUP girl growing up in the mountains of Oregon.. worked then and still works on the beach of North Carolina.. as mentioned by another person a little goes a Long way , keep cork in shake and then run your brush or puff over cork!!! evryone thinks i wear nothing and I just am tan all season..OUR SECRET..</li>
            <li> I used Indian Earth in the 70&#x27;s in all the years I have not found anything that can compare to it. I was very pleased I took the time to see if it was still available. Cannot wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a loose powder blush with no shimmer for YEARS and thought I&#x27;d finally found it... but this just made my fair, pinkish skin look muddy and dirty, even when I barely applied it. I can definitely see how this would be a miracle product if your skin is darker or has golden undertones, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember from the 70&#x27;s, except for the powder puff and leakage from the container.  I keep it in the little plastic bag it came in because the cork doesn&#x27;t contain it very well.  This and the powder puff issue which others mentioned is not the same as it used to be.</li>
            <li> This is a natural bronzer.  A little goes a long way.  Instructions are included as it has multiple uses as makeup.  There is no shimmer or sparkles.  I like the container, too.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and use it everyday.  The only problem? is that it is a darker shade than my last and since I have fair skin the other was a little better.  Unlike many, I like the puff and wish the order had included two.</li>
            <li> I did not like this because it was very dark and was not a bronzer it was more like a blush. It also dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this in the 80&#x27;s!!  I&#x27;m so glad they still make it! One bottle lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;I still love it now!  It gives you a natural glow without looking orange.  Taking away any extra&lt;br /&gt;Shine you might have.&lt;br /&gt;The puffy ball to apply with is so perfect to blend in the color.&lt;br /&gt;Best product and only make up you&#x27;ll need!</li>
            <li> Very good all natural way to put color in yr cheeks have used this product for a number of years</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!! Nothing like the original Indian earth. This is absolutely ORANGE!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for 35 years.It is much darker than I remember.I will try it during the summer when I have more color.</li>
            <li> Looks good, I like it</li>
            <li> What can you not use Indian Earth for????  This size bottle will last you yars.  I use it for a lip tint, blush, mix with my lotion for a little glow, eye shadow............&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that for the price I paid there is so little Indian Earth.  I like the stuff but it is almost as though I didn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago and ran out. I was so pleased when I was able to find that it was still available. One product that can be used as an eye shadow and blush. If you don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up it provides just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cosmetics ever invented. It had its own following back in the day, but the idea of bronzers was not so big then. I think it was ahead of it&#x27;s time and it&#x27;s even more appealing now than it was then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are put off by all of the old-timers who rave about this stuff, think again. This is a really nice overall bronzer that looks great when it&#x27;s used properly. The trick is to remember that a little goes a long way. Forget about using that puff that comes with it, use a nice fluffy brush, and get the excess off of the brush before you apply it to skin. It can be used for nice overall color and looks best when a little pressed powder is put over it to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about it is unlike many other blushes, etc., it actually looks better hours after you put it on, it does not fade out like chemical makeup, in fact it will work with the chemisty of your skin and look a little different on everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a &#x27;girly-girl&#x27; and just want something quick and basic to brighten up, this does the trick and looks natural. The flexability is what makes it so nice, you can be as formal and fussy with it as you need but can just dust it on and go for everyday too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, this is a classic that has survived the years for good reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal. Color is as light or as intense as you make it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE i WAS 15 YRS OLD NOW I AM 53 /ONE CAN USE IT AS EYESHADOW/LIPSTICK/FINGERNAIL POLISH ANYTHING AND IT STAYS ALL DAY. THE COLOR LOOKS NATURAL</li>
            <li> Just got this product and it is like my 80&#x27;s bronze but a little darker.  I enjoy wearing this instead of foundation in the summer and always get compliments.  I will empty the jar and put it in a different container without the cork.  .</li>
            <li> The power is very fine therefore is a little messy to use but I figured out a system that works for me. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have used it for years and there is nothing else like it.  I wish I could find it a store somewhere.  However, I will continue to use it either way.</li>
            <li> As it was and still is a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Use very, very, very little even if you have so called \\&quot;olive\\&quot; skin. It took me a little while to get use to this.. I don&#x27;t use it as a foundation because it is too dark for my skin but it works great a bronzer or blush. I apply a very small amount to the cotton applicator and use if for about 2 months. I bought the small size and I see that it will last forever!</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe my eyes when I came upon this product! Used it many many years ago!&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount and I mean small, once you get used to what miracles it can&lt;br /&gt;perform your flying, natural, warm color almost a lit from within! Very nice, I started with the 2 gr.&lt;br /&gt;as I wanted to test it out first to see if in fact it was the same a yester year! Enjoy</li>
