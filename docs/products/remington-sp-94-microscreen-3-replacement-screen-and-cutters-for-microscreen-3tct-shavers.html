    <ol>
            <li>So I replaced them with these SP-94 Microscreen and cutters, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to replace this razor as it&#x27;s one of the best he has ever owned.</li>
            <li>Admittedly this is not the best way to store it and is probably why the screen gets beat up and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>best shaver ever built.</li>

            <li>I chose this rating because years ago I purchased a MS3-2700 Remington shaver; this shaver is not made anymore and it is the best Remington produced that didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t cost an arm</li>
            <li>This fills the need perfectly.  </li>

            <li>I love a Remington shaver</li>
            <li>Glad to see I can order screen and blade replacements from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also, you will experience much better shaver head life if you use Shaver Saver spray every time.</li>
            <li>Its always great when you get what you expect and save money and its fast.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any better out there</li>
            <li>I also found the price is better.</li>
            <li>Might be better to stretch out the life of the blades and then replace the razor.</li>
            <li>Better price than I could find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>OK, it works and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>And for me it no razor burn:) :)</li>
            <li>Much better price than WalMart and so easier to deal with</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite electric razor for 15 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Remington razors for over 7 years and they just keep getting better.</li>
            <li>Most of the marts have gone out of business.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered these.</li>
            <li>I have owned an MS3 TCT for almost 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>4 more months of use, just like that.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will order more when the time comes.  </li>
            <li>I will definately be buying more when needed.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about buying this because I thouhgt it might not fit, but it fit perfectly and works great.  </li>
            <li>Most retailers including Walmart, Target, etc seem to be oblivious to the fact that they should be stocking the replacement parts.</li>
            <li>glad you still carry them .</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s the only kind of shaver to use...provides the most comfortable shave, the most even coverage, and the greatest ease of use.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this source.</li>
            <li>It fit in my razor perfectly and cut as close as the original when that was new.</li>
            <li>Excellent price and was able to replace old one quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>AS THE NEW BLADES WORK GREAT.</li>
            <li>Product received exactly as described, in good condition, and very quickly.</li>
            <li>free shipping..  can&#x27;t get much better than that..</li>
            <li>They were delivered two days early, was happy to get them.</li>
            <li>good product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping, easy to install, and works without any problems.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to install.  </li>
            <li>The Remington SP-94 Microscreen 3 Replacement Screen and Cutters for MicroScreen 3TCT Shavers are easy to change out.</li>
            <li>Really glad to find through Amazon as could not locate in any stores, they only carry the newer items and the shaver works great, just need replacement screen and cutters.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>The new screen is great, but the new cutters don&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the original ones.  </li>
            <li>Shaving every day will wear down the best of blades.  </li>
            <li>Package was a brand new replacement screen, and was in good shape and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>and they work just fine with some cost savings.  </li>
            <li>The replacement blades work fine</li>
            <li>and they work fine.</li>
            <li>, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The replacement screens are easy to install and are flexible and comfortable on the skin, even around the jawline.   </li>
            <li>The replacement parts work fine with my Remington.   </li>
            <li>I bought this product and it came on time and every thing worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get a replacement foil and try once more, but if that one goes quickly, the shaver will go in the trash.</li>
            <li>This replacement set comes easy to install and works as the original</li>
            <li>I buy these two at a time to get free shipping..  </li>
            <li>Genuine replacement parts.  </li>
            <li>I love my old Remington shaver and I´m glad I still can find this replacement and keep using mine for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>Remington makes quality and smooth shaving device.</li>
            <li>They fit.</li>
            <li>Easy to install the parts, Gave it A full charge and off it goes.</li>
            <li>Love the shaver, love the replacement kits and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying both if your in the market.   </li>
            <li>The Remington Microsreen was bent upon arrival, but replaced easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>These blades are good if you are willing to take the time to really work on your face.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Easy, quick fix.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the pack and a quick install then ready for a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li>The original screens lasted almost one year, and these replacements sometimes don&#x60;t</li>
            <li>Nothing remarkable, just gets the job done until this shaver finally wears out and I have to upgrade...  </li>
            <li>My original screen had gotten a hole in it.  </li>
            <li>Looks and functions as  the original.</li>
            <li>Original replacement.</li>
            <li>but it does take time to use and even longer to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clean shaven.</li>
            <li>For the blades use the brush to clean it while rinsing it with water and NEVER use the brush for the screens.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a reasonable and good product.</li>
            <li>The first shave confirmed that the product is as advertised and appears to be genuine Remington replacement parts.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a good selection of replacement parts to keep shavers to last years.   </li>
            <li>Overall, I think the Remington SP-94 replacement screens and cutters are a good product.</li>
            <li>Located these replacement blades at a MUCH more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>New blades are sent every 6 months with free shipping at a better price than WMart.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m a happy, well shaved camper.</li>
            <li>and I think the price is really great since other online stores have it over $20.  </li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that will allow your shaver to easily last for years and years if properly maintained.</li>
            <li>Received item quickly, it was correct item.  </li>
            <li>I was able to replace the screens and cutters and can continue to use this shaver for several more years.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and were exact as advertised so the fit and function are perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Order Was Very Much Wort It!</li>
            <li>Much better than having to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It is nice that Remington is still making these for a shaver that is getting pretty old at this point.</li>
            <li>The price is about $6 less than I used to pay at the retail store and the fact that they qualify for free super-saver shipping (I bought two sets to take advantage of that) makes this a really good deal.</li>
            <li>These screens are getting harder to come by, and we appreciate being able to order from Amazon and getting good service, saving us from buying new razors.</li>
            <li>Great shave every time with little hassle.</li>
            <li>They came in the factory packaging and fit the shaver very well.  </li>
            <li>Remington doesn&#x27;t sell these any more directly</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The item came promptly and was priced right.  </li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>I got the shaver screens and cutters right away.</li>
            <li>If I recall right, you are supposed to replace the foil every six months and the blades once a year.  </li>
            <li>CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE MADE RIGHT OR</li>
            <li>Easy to install and returned the shaver to like new.</li>
            <li>The screens and cutters are easy to clean with the little cleaning brush that comes with most Remington razors.   </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Remington customer for many years, but I will now look for a different brand.</li>
            <li>Pretty economical that way compared to blades.</li>
            <li>We were unable to find this replacement part where we ususally purchased it(Walmart) Was happy to be able to order it and found it worked well.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace old screens and blades.</li>
            <li>great replacements - original manufacturer - quick shipment - still using the same razor for the past 15 yrs. - just replace the blades and micro screen as needed.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for ms3 shavers.</li>
            <li>Shame on you, Remington, for making such cheap replacement blades and screens!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I believe this is the review for the second order for Four More.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement parts from Remington.</li>
            <li>In any case this razor is a work horse and has never failed me unless it needed a charge.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>The parts appear to be exactly like the originals from retail packaging and installed without difficulty.  </li>
            <li>I have paid more at local drug stores in the past, but was particularly pleased to find the Amazon pricing to be much more reasonable!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li>6 screens (SP93) look pretty good,although not from Remington.  </li>
            <li>This happens to everyone, but come on, that happened to me after A YEAR of using the shaver and this is the first time I bought replacements (shaving about 2 times a week).</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Remington, shaves great, the Screen &amp; Cutters don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed.  </li>
            <li>THEY WERE OK, BUT REMINGTON SHOULD CHECK ON THE CHINESE MAKING THE BLADES, TO HAVE THEM SHARPENED</li>
            <li>Finally was able to get the correct item I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Does exactly ehat I need...</li>
            <li>After I re placed the old batteries with new and larger capacity batteries I will use it many more years.</li>
            <li>Replacing the the cutters and screen on an electric shaver is not quite like getting a new shaver, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>Easy to exchange old parts for new.  </li>
            <li>Easy and price competitive to buy on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Assembly a bit difficult, but makes for a great shaver without having to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, M &amp; M</li>
            <li>arrived as promised and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The screens and blades fit into the shaver, but they don&#x27;t line up properly causing me to not get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Which is the whole point</li>
            <li>To my dismay you have to buy the whole set at that time I had to order  the set.</li>
            <li>A very competitve price for these parts and delivered promptly.  </li>
            <li>Please add explicit instructions, with thanks.</li>
            <li>Everything OK, as expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks I just do not need much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really stick to the recommended schedule for replacing the screen &amp; cutters.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me.</li>
            <li>The blades and screen are very easy to replace and they restore the shaver back to new condition, as far as the shave is concerned.  </li>
            <li>Replacement parts fit right up, but this replacement wants to pull a little and it can leave you pretty sore.</li>
            <li>The three sets I ordered came in early and were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find the replacement screens and cutters for my older Remington shaver in any store, so I am glad that Amazon has these available.  </li>
            <li>Razor works like new again!</li>
            <li>Change out replacements and razer is working like new!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a new razor, but it feels like a new razor!</li>
            <li>We were contemplating just buying a new shaver, but my husband really likes this one.</li>
            <li>Fits my older razor and works well.  </li>
            <li>I searched every store for these and when I found them the prices were high...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and the sellers.</li>
            <li>I think since I have very skin sensitive and use pre shave</li>
            <li>Great product,but too expensive</li>
            <li>I replace a foil screen about once every 3 months, what I would consider normal.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy these replacement parts anticipating normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any other shaver that works as smoothly and hope to continue using it for a few more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>The replacement automatically comes with a new blade.  </li>
            <li>I find every month a new hole appears in the foil</li>
            <li>Keeps my razor like new.</li>
            <li>i like them,but for the price, i should have bought a new razor</li>
            <li>Considering getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Since the store where I bought the shaver no longer carries the parts, my wife wanted me to just buy a new model.  </li>
            <li>THIS SAVES BUYING A NEW RAZOR</li>
            <li>WHY SPEND $89.00 WHEN YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THE BLADES AND ITS LIKE NEW.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to anyone needing new parts for their electric razor.</li>
            <li>The new 3TCT series shave closer than a blade.</li>
            <li>I keep thinking I should get a new razor</li>
            <li>It is like a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s shaver is like new now.</li>
            <li>The razor now shaves like a new one.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t want to buy a new shaver, the replacement will work and may wear in to the point it will stop pulling.</li>
            <li>It still scrapes a bit but no more cuts :)</li>
            <li>Since I first made this purchase back in 2009, the screen cutters are still as durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this in stores, and this is a good enough replacement for my shaver.</li>
            <li>Replacing the screen and cutters is a little non-intuitive, but if you follow the directions it goes together easily.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this whenever my old razor needs new blades and it always restore that old razor to like new.</li>
            <li>Makes my old Remington work like new.</li>
            <li>also buy two at a time (free shipping), so the price is less than what I buy at the store ($20 plus tax).</li>
            <li>With this repair readily available my razor should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Price jumps up and down by a few dollars, but still a good deal.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers who say the screens develop holes rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Wish it included a replacement trimmer blade to complete the set, which I can&#x27;t seem to find anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Remington Titanium MS3 2700 for about 5 years now with daily use, and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li>Screens and blades arrived promptly, but the gadget used to remove the old screens was not included.</li>
            <li>Old razor but still works.  </li>
            <li>word of advice for the frequent shaver.</li>
            <li>but the old one keeps going and with these replacement screens and blades</li>
            <li>I should have no trouble with them.  </li>
            <li>MORE.THE OLD</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to refresh my old Remmington</li>
            <li>This is third replacement in 10 years for mine so whole unit has no shame.</li>
            <li>I have a rough beard and sensitive skin and these replacements work to restore the shave back to the same as new, smooth and close.</li>
            <li>This shaver is not the best in the world, for sure, but if yours is getting a bit painful to shave with and you don&#x27;t want to spend $100 for a new one, order the kit and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li>Price is comparable to what I had to spend in stores and with Prime usually ships free for me.</li>
            <li>The shaver parts were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I notice that the Remington SP-94 doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or effective as in the past.  </li>
            <li>also had a hole in my screen and had to recently purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Remington is going more towards the rotary shavers that are harder to clean and don&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li>Many of you may have already figured this out cause it seems like common sense, but here is a trick to get double the life from your refills.    </li>
            <li>Am not sure it was original equipment.</li>
            <li>Tis razor has lasted for over 15 years and although you are supposed to change the blades and screens every year, I have usually had to change them every two years and still get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Having new cutters doesn&#x27;t seem to make the shave significantly faster or allow for a closer shave, but having a new screen is essential when the old one starts to fail, otherwise you will cut up your face wherever there is a large enough hole in the screen.</li>
            <li>I change the cutters once every 4-6 months on average to ensure they stay sharp, though I&#x27;m sure they would last longer.</li>
            <li>Your skin should barely move under the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s cutters don&#x27;t really need replacing since I&#x27;ve used old cutters for a long time, however, the screen wears down from friction during normal shaving.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for this program you instituted quite some time ago, I would have to purchase a new shaver as it gets harder to replace the parts that wear out in my old shaver.</li>
            <li>I did know how dull the original blades and screen had be come.</li>
            <li>The product is getting harder to find as the shaver is an older model.</li>
            <li>Normal shaving....does expected job.....and should be as expected...will order these again until my razor wares out.</li>
            <li>The screens are fine as long as you don&#x27;t use the cleaning brush on them-they are delicate.</li>
            <li>Aside from the screens getting holes in them due to normal wear and tear and cutting my face, I am very pleased with these</li>
            <li>This is a good product but the replacement parts need to be replaced to often and finding them is impossible.</li>
            <li>The foil cover is easy to be broken.</li>
            <li>last a month without holes developing, and the blades dull just as quickly.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> So I replaced them with these SP-94 Microscreen and cutters, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to replace this razor as it&#x27;s one of the best he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> Admittedly this is not the best way to store it and is probably why the screen gets beat up and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> best shaver ever built.</li>

            <li> It was the best deal anywhere!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because years ago I purchased a MS3-2700 Remington shaver; this shaver is not made anymore and it is the best Remington produced that didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t cost an arm</li>
            <li> This fills the need perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Very good and originals, I will buy again from this seller</li>

            <li> Perfect fit, and a brand new Remington.</li>
            <li> I love a Remington shaver</li>
            <li> Glad to see I can order screen and blade replacements from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also, you will experience much better shaver head life if you use Shaver Saver spray every time.</li>
            <li> Its always great when you get what you expect and save money and its fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any better out there</li>
            <li> I also found the price is better.</li>
            <li> Might be better to stretch out the life of the blades and then replace the razor.</li>
            <li> Better price than I could find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> OK, it works and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> And for me it no razor burn:) :)</li>
            <li> Much better price than WalMart and so easier to deal with</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite electric razor for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington razors for over 7 years and they just keep getting better.</li>
            <li> Most of the marts have gone out of business.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered these.</li>
            <li> I have owned an MS3 TCT for almost 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> 4 more months of use, just like that.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I will order more when the time comes.  </li>
            <li> I will definately be buying more when needed.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about buying this because I thouhgt it might not fit, but it fit perfectly and works great.  </li>
            <li> Most retailers including Walmart, Target, etc seem to be oblivious to the fact that they should be stocking the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> glad you still carry them .</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s the only kind of shaver to use...provides the most comfortable shave, the most even coverage, and the greatest ease of use.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this source.</li>
            <li> It fit in my razor perfectly and cut as close as the original when that was new.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and was able to replace old one quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> AS THE NEW BLADES WORK GREAT.</li>
            <li> Product received exactly as described, in good condition, and very quickly.</li>
            <li> free shipping..  can&#x27;t get much better than that..</li>
            <li> They were delivered two days early, was happy to get them.</li>
            <li> good product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping, easy to install, and works without any problems.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to install.  </li>
            <li> The Remington SP-94 Microscreen 3 Replacement Screen and Cutters for MicroScreen 3TCT Shavers are easy to change out.</li>
            <li> Really glad to find through Amazon as could not locate in any stores, they only carry the newer items and the shaver works great, just need replacement screen and cutters.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> The new screen is great, but the new cutters don&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the original ones.  </li>
            <li> Shaving every day will wear down the best of blades.  </li>
            <li> Package was a brand new replacement screen, and was in good shape and undamaged.  </li>
            <li> and they work just fine with some cost savings.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades work fine</li>
            <li> and they work fine.</li>
            <li> , it works just fine.</li>
            <li> The replacement screens are easy to install and are flexible and comfortable on the skin, even around the jawline.   </li>
            <li> The replacement parts work fine with my Remington.   </li>
            <li> I bought this product and it came on time and every thing worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get a replacement foil and try once more, but if that one goes quickly, the shaver will go in the trash.</li>
            <li> This replacement set comes easy to install and works as the original</li>
            <li> I buy these two at a time to get free shipping..  </li>
            <li> Genuine replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> I love my old Remington shaver and I´m glad I still can find this replacement and keep using mine for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Remington makes quality and smooth shaving device.</li>
            <li> They fit.</li>
            <li> Easy to install the parts, Gave it A full charge and off it goes.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver, love the replacement kits and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying both if your in the market.   </li>
            <li> The Remington Microsreen was bent upon arrival, but replaced easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> These blades are good if you are willing to take the time to really work on your face.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick fix.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the pack and a quick install then ready for a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li> The original screens lasted almost one year, and these replacements sometimes don&#x60;t</li>
            <li> Nothing remarkable, just gets the job done until this shaver finally wears out and I have to upgrade...  </li>
            <li> My original screen had gotten a hole in it.  </li>
            <li> Looks and functions as  the original.</li>
            <li> Original replacement.</li>
            <li> but it does take time to use and even longer to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clean shaven.</li>
            <li> For the blades use the brush to clean it while rinsing it with water and NEVER use the brush for the screens.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a reasonable and good product.</li>
            <li> The first shave confirmed that the product is as advertised and appears to be genuine Remington replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has a good selection of replacement parts to keep shavers to last years.   </li>
            <li> Overall, I think the Remington SP-94 replacement screens and cutters are a good product.</li>
            <li> Located these replacement blades at a MUCH more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> New blades are sent every 6 months with free shipping at a better price than WMart.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m a happy, well shaved camper.</li>
            <li> and I think the price is really great since other online stores have it over $20.  </li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that will allow your shaver to easily last for years and years if properly maintained.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly, it was correct item.  </li>
            <li> I was able to replace the screens and cutters and can continue to use this shaver for several more years.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and were exact as advertised so the fit and function are perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Order Was Very Much Wort It!</li>
            <li> Much better than having to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It is nice that Remington is still making these for a shaver that is getting pretty old at this point.</li>
            <li> The price is about $6 less than I used to pay at the retail store and the fact that they qualify for free super-saver shipping (I bought two sets to take advantage of that) makes this a really good deal.</li>
            <li> These screens are getting harder to come by, and we appreciate being able to order from Amazon and getting good service, saving us from buying new razors.</li>
            <li> Great shave every time with little hassle.</li>
            <li> They came in the factory packaging and fit the shaver very well.  </li>
            <li> Remington doesn&#x27;t sell these any more directly</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The item came promptly and was priced right.  </li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver screens and cutters right away.</li>
            <li> If I recall right, you are supposed to replace the foil every six months and the blades once a year.  </li>
            <li> CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE MADE RIGHT OR</li>
            <li> Easy to install and returned the shaver to like new.</li>
            <li> The screens and cutters are easy to clean with the little cleaning brush that comes with most Remington razors.   </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Remington customer for many years, but I will now look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> Pretty economical that way compared to blades.</li>
            <li> We were unable to find this replacement part where we ususally purchased it(Walmart) Was happy to be able to order it and found it worked well.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace old screens and blades.</li>
            <li> great replacements - original manufacturer - quick shipment - still using the same razor for the past 15 yrs. - just replace the blades and micro screen as needed.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for ms3 shavers.</li>
            <li> Shame on you, Remington, for making such cheap replacement blades and screens!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I believe this is the review for the second order for Four More.  </li>
            <li> Exact replacement parts from Remington.</li>
            <li> In any case this razor is a work horse and has never failed me unless it needed a charge.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> The parts appear to be exactly like the originals from retail packaging and installed without difficulty.  </li>
            <li> I have paid more at local drug stores in the past, but was particularly pleased to find the Amazon pricing to be much more reasonable!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li> 6 screens (SP93) look pretty good,although not from Remington.  </li>
            <li> This happens to everyone, but come on, that happened to me after A YEAR of using the shaver and this is the first time I bought replacements (shaving about 2 times a week).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Remington, shaves great, the Screen &amp; Cutters don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed.  </li>
            <li> THEY WERE OK, BUT REMINGTON SHOULD CHECK ON THE CHINESE MAKING THE BLADES, TO HAVE THEM SHARPENED</li>
            <li> Finally was able to get the correct item I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does exactly ehat I need...</li>
            <li> After I re placed the old batteries with new and larger capacity batteries I will use it many more years.</li>
            <li> Replacing the the cutters and screen on an electric shaver is not quite like getting a new shaver, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> Easy to exchange old parts for new.  </li>
            <li> Easy and price competitive to buy on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Assembly a bit difficult, but makes for a great shaver without having to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, M &amp; M</li>
            <li> arrived as promised and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The screens and blades fit into the shaver, but they don&#x27;t line up properly causing me to not get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Which is the whole point</li>
            <li> To my dismay you have to buy the whole set at that time I had to order  the set.</li>
            <li> A very competitve price for these parts and delivered promptly.  </li>
            <li> Please add explicit instructions, with thanks.</li>
            <li> Everything OK, as expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks I just do not need much.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really stick to the recommended schedule for replacing the screen &amp; cutters.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me.</li>
            <li> The blades and screen are very easy to replace and they restore the shaver back to new condition, as far as the shave is concerned.  </li>
            <li> Replacement parts fit right up, but this replacement wants to pull a little and it can leave you pretty sore.</li>
            <li> The three sets I ordered came in early and were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find the replacement screens and cutters for my older Remington shaver in any store, so I am glad that Amazon has these available.  </li>
            <li> Razor works like new again!</li>
            <li> Change out replacements and razer is working like new!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a new razor, but it feels like a new razor!</li>
            <li> We were contemplating just buying a new shaver, but my husband really likes this one.</li>
            <li> Fits my older razor and works well.  </li>
            <li> I searched every store for these and when I found them the prices were high...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and the sellers.</li>
            <li> I think since I have very skin sensitive and use pre shave</li>
            <li> Great product,but too expensive</li>
            <li> I replace a foil screen about once every 3 months, what I would consider normal.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy these replacement parts anticipating normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any other shaver that works as smoothly and hope to continue using it for a few more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The replacement automatically comes with a new blade.  </li>
            <li> I find every month a new hole appears in the foil</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor like new.</li>
            <li> i like them,but for the price, i should have bought a new razor</li>
            <li> Considering getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Since the store where I bought the shaver no longer carries the parts, my wife wanted me to just buy a new model.  </li>
            <li> THIS SAVES BUYING A NEW RAZOR</li>
            <li> WHY SPEND $89.00 WHEN YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THE BLADES AND ITS LIKE NEW.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to anyone needing new parts for their electric razor.</li>
            <li> The new 3TCT series shave closer than a blade.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I should get a new razor</li>
            <li> It is like a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver is like new now.</li>
            <li> The razor now shaves like a new one.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t want to buy a new shaver, the replacement will work and may wear in to the point it will stop pulling.</li>
            <li> It still scrapes a bit but no more cuts :)</li>
            <li> Since I first made this purchase back in 2009, the screen cutters are still as durable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this in stores, and this is a good enough replacement for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Replacing the screen and cutters is a little non-intuitive, but if you follow the directions it goes together easily.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this whenever my old razor needs new blades and it always restore that old razor to like new.</li>
            <li> Makes my old Remington work like new.</li>
            <li> also buy two at a time (free shipping), so the price is less than what I buy at the store ($20 plus tax).</li>
            <li> With this repair readily available my razor should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Price jumps up and down by a few dollars, but still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who say the screens develop holes rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Wish it included a replacement trimmer blade to complete the set, which I can&#x27;t seem to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Remington Titanium MS3 2700 for about 5 years now with daily use, and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li> Screens and blades arrived promptly, but the gadget used to remove the old screens was not included.</li>
            <li> Old razor but still works.  </li>
            <li> word of advice for the frequent shaver.</li>
            <li> but the old one keeps going and with these replacement screens and blades</li>
            <li> I should have no trouble with them.  </li>
            <li> MORE.THE OLD</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to refresh my old Remmington</li>
            <li> This is third replacement in 10 years for mine so whole unit has no shame.</li>
            <li> I have a rough beard and sensitive skin and these replacements work to restore the shave back to the same as new, smooth and close.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not the best in the world, for sure, but if yours is getting a bit painful to shave with and you don&#x27;t want to spend $100 for a new one, order the kit and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Price is comparable to what I had to spend in stores and with Prime usually ships free for me.</li>
            <li> The shaver parts were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I notice that the Remington SP-94 doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or effective as in the past.  </li>
            <li> also had a hole in my screen and had to recently purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Remington is going more towards the rotary shavers that are harder to clean and don&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> Many of you may have already figured this out cause it seems like common sense, but here is a trick to get double the life from your refills.    </li>
            <li> Am not sure it was original equipment.</li>
            <li> Tis razor has lasted for over 15 years and although you are supposed to change the blades and screens every year, I have usually had to change them every two years and still get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Having new cutters doesn&#x27;t seem to make the shave significantly faster or allow for a closer shave, but having a new screen is essential when the old one starts to fail, otherwise you will cut up your face wherever there is a large enough hole in the screen.</li>
            <li> I change the cutters once every 4-6 months on average to ensure they stay sharp, though I&#x27;m sure they would last longer.</li>
            <li> Your skin should barely move under the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s cutters don&#x27;t really need replacing since I&#x27;ve used old cutters for a long time, however, the screen wears down from friction during normal shaving.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this program you instituted quite some time ago, I would have to purchase a new shaver as it gets harder to replace the parts that wear out in my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I did know how dull the original blades and screen had be come.</li>
            <li> The product is getting harder to find as the shaver is an older model.</li>
            <li> Normal shaving....does expected job.....and should be as expected...will order these again until my razor wares out.</li>
            <li> The screens are fine as long as you don&#x27;t use the cleaning brush on them-they are delicate.</li>
            <li> Aside from the screens getting holes in them due to normal wear and tear and cutting my face, I am very pleased with these</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the replacement parts need to be replaced to often and finding them is impossible.</li>
            <li> The foil cover is easy to be broken.</li>
            <li> last a month without holes developing, and the blades dull just as quickly.</li>
            <li> Like two other reviewers my shaver developed a hole in the foil within a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> The ones from Walmart were more expensive &amp; didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> These replacements will extend the life of the shaver at a much less cost than a new shaver.    </li>
            <li> For a lot less than the price of a new shaver, it works like a charm</li>
            <li> They allowed me to throw away that first delivery - trying to save me the shipping cost, but I already sent it back (unopened) as proof of my complaint.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Replacement is straightforward, and if you haven&#x27;t replaced your blades and screens in awhile, the difference while shaving is dramatic.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these replacements because the screen developed a small hole and started to cut my face.  </li>
            <li> I only use it 2-3 times a week and then in the car where I store it in the center console.</li>
            <li> The sad part is, the replacement blades and screen are about 50% the cost of the original razor.  </li>
            <li> Instructions are on the back of the package insert; however, you must be careful not to cut apart the instructions when trying to get into the package!</li>
            <li> I also purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and after 3 mo&#x27;s the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face.  </li>
            <li> The next time the price went down to $ 23.99 .</li>
            <li> these seem to stay sharp for a long time, i&#x27;m still using them going on 3 years.</li>
            <li> Blades did not remain sharp for very long.</li>
            <li> Be careful to change them as soon as they rip or you&#x27;ll cut your face.</li>
            <li> Purchased these Remington blade and cover with delivery as expected.</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding locally so tried these</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, but this one is the only one I have found that gets each and every whisker.  </li>
            <li> The local retail stores in my area stopped carrying these replacement screens/cutters a few months ago</li>
            <li> This replacement screen and cutters worked as expected; I was looking for a replacement, but couldn&#x27;t find one in the department stores.  </li>
            <li> These parts are essential as the shaver screens, if not replaced, will wear and develope holes in anywhere between a few months to a year depending on usage.   </li>
            <li> The screens occasionally get little holes in them in the middle of a shave and the sharp edges around the holes in the screen have cut my face a few times.</li>
            <li> They last at least as long or longer than the ones from Remington.</li>
            <li> Keeps my 10 year old Remington Titanium MS3 2700 cutting like new.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the unbelievable low cost.  </li>
            <li> The product packaging is just a small white cardboard box without advertising.  </li>
            <li> My Remington Microscreen shaver has been a work horse of daily use for over the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> Ordered replacement part for razor since we were not able to find any locally.  </li>
            <li> Far easier and less expensive than buying off the shelf at the big box store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past with the SP93 foils scratching my face because they was too big tall and protruded out of the carrier framework, providing a sharp edge on both sides of the screen.  </li>
            <li> It is necessary to replace these items when they were out or the cutters get dull.</li>
            <li> also had a hard time finding the replacements locally, but I found it here in Amazon</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Shopped online and took a chance on the store that sold them for the least amount - and ordered only ONE, just in case.  </li>
            <li> You can help the pulling by slowing down in some areas and changing the angle of the head in others.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a little bit and we&#x27;ll see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Took a little longer to arrive than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The Remington SP-94 replacement cutters are extremely sharp and cut pretty close to the skin - not as close as a manual razor, but I&#x27;ll trade a close shave for a shave that doesn&#x27;t leave me with painful razor</li>
            <li> Just a helpful hint, don&#x27;t press hard on your skin, this will cause the screen to fail much sooner.  </li>
            <li> and shortly it developed the infamous hole and cut my face everytime</li>
            <li> Some of these heads wear out in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> These replacement screens did not fit the razor although that is what the instructions that came with razor said to order.  </li>
            <li> I got a few and now I think the shaver will break before I run out of screens.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the foil screens and cutting blades in my older Remington Shaver.</li>
            <li> Once because the foil failed the other  is while  cleaning the blades I drop the foil in the toilet  while it was flushing.  </li>
            <li> Pop out the titanium cutters that sit in their triagle looking case and flip them over, exposing a new cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> The blades usually need to be replaced before the screen... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It has become difficult to locate local retailers for replacement parts for shavers.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they are expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find replacement parts in the stores.</li>
            <li> &quot; is it that hard?</li>
            <li> Remington micro screen 3 razor parts are getting hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> these screens and cutters are getting hard to find .</li>
            <li> Hard to find item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Remington Microscreen TCT for at least 6-7 years</li>
            <li> and I even reverse and move the cutting heads around to make the product last longer.</li>
            <li> I managed to get the old ones out, but was disappointed it was not included.</li>
            <li> It is still a little expensive.</li>
            <li> The previos one purchased was wrong and did not fit my shaver</li>
            <li> I hate razors, and never really liked the double or triple-head style electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tough to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Was not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product gave it away .</li>
            <li> unfortunately the shaver died before I could use all 3 sets purchased.</li>
            <li> I also have been unable to find replqacement screens and cutters.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to replace the SP-93 screen and blades, but have been unable to find a store that carries them.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that since I installed them, my shaver has a tendency to pull on my hairs at times which can be painful and annoying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exact replacement for ms3 shavers. Easy to install and returned the shaver to like new. Wish it included a replacement trimmer blade to complete the set, which I can&#x27;t seem to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Price jumps up and down by a few dollars, but still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who say the screens develop holes rather quickly. The original screens lasted almost one year, and these replacements sometimes don&#x60;t last a month without holes developing, and the blades dull just as quickly. I think this is my last set of screens and the shaver is going into the trash. I love a Remington shaver but I cannot tolerate all these screen and blade replacements. Shame on you, Remington, for making such cheap replacement blades and screens! I have been a loyal Remington customer for many years, but I will now look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Remington Titanium MS3 2700 for about 5 years now with daily use, and it has held up very well. The screen and cutters lasted for about 4 years, which is actually longer than the recommended period for replacing them. The screen started to have holes several months ago. So I replaced them with these SP-94 Microscreen and cutters, and have been very happy with them. Good price, fast shipping, easy to install, and works without any problems.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement screen for my husband&#x27;s Remington Razor.  The replacement automatically comes with a new blade.  I ordered it from Amazon, and it was sent within a week.  I didn&#x27;t want to replace this razor as it&#x27;s one of the best he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> The Remington Microsreen was bent upon arrival, but replaced easily and quickly. They allowed me to throw away that first delivery - trying to save me the shipping cost, but I already sent it back (unopened) as proof of my complaint. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Tis razor has lasted for over 15 years and although you are supposed to change the blades and screens every year, I have usually had to change them every two years and still get a clean shave. Remington has always been a good razor for me. The one I had 20 years ago, in memory, seemed to give a closer smoother shave, but maybe my whiskers were softer.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find the replacement screens and cutters for my older Remington shaver in any store, so I am glad that Amazon has these available.  They came in the factory packaging and fit the shaver very well.  I am very satisfied with these and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I bought one of the microscreens and shortly it developed the infamous hole and cut my face everytime I used it.  Couldn&#x27;t find any replacement screens anywhere so I removed the blade from beneath the screen with the hole.  Have been using it like that for about a year now.  It still scrapes a bit but no more cuts :)</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews on screen tears.  I don&#x27;t have that problem.  Just a helpful hint, don&#x27;t press hard on your skin, this will cause the screen to fail much sooner.  Your skin should barely move under the shaver.  It&#x27;s not a razor blade and does not have to be pushed into the skin in order to cut the hair.  Mine usually last over a year.  The blades usually need to be replaced before the screen... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also buy two at a time (free shipping), so the price is less than what I buy at the store ($20 plus tax).</li>
            <li> Amazon price was the best I found on the internet and the product appears to be original Remington Shaver parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these several times and have never had any problems with the screen or the cutters.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> We were unable to find this replacement part where we ususally purchased it(Walmart) Was happy to be able to order it and found it worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my remington razor for over 10 years. It won&#x27;t die. Glad to see I can order screen and blade replacements from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We just couldn&#x27;t seem to find Microscreen 3 replacements.. even in stores that Sold the Shaver.  Shopped online and took a chance on the store that sold them for the least amount - and ordered only ONE, just in case.  Thank you for the unbelievable low cost.  The screens were shipped that DAY! and arrived in perfect condition, and EXACTLY what we wanted.  I believe this is the review for the second order for Four More.  Great Job Guys.</li>
            <li> If you use your Remington 3-foil shaver enough, you will eventually need to replace the head.  This is what you need.  Also, you will experience much better shaver head life if you use Shaver Saver spray every time.</li>
            <li> I searched every store for these and when I found them the prices were high...but the product is just what I wanted  I should have started with Amazon</li>
            <li> Tough to find in stores.  This is the cheapest and quickest way I could get these for my razor.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> Remington Replacement blades and screens. It has become difficult to locate local retailers for replacement parts for shavers. Amazon has a good selection of replacement parts to keep shavers to last years.   Need to replace screens about every three months since the screens wear out.  Easy to replace old screens and blades. Exact replacement parts from Remington.</li>
            <li> Its always great when you get what you expect and save money and its fast. This vendor performed well and believe me I am a very critical person and to get 5 stars is not an automatic feat!</li>
            <li> Screens and blades arrived promptly, but the gadget used to remove the old screens was not included. I managed to get the old ones out, but was disappointed it was not included. Blades did not remain sharp for very long. Am not sure it was original equipment. Was not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product gave it away .</li>
            <li> These blades are good if you are willing to take the time to really work on your face. Granted I haven&#x27;t found any better out there but it does take time to use and even longer to clean.  The screens are fine as long as you don&#x27;t use the cleaning brush on them-they are delicate. Be careful to change them as soon as they rip or you&#x27;ll cut your face. Remington doesn&#x27;t sell these any more directly I don&#x27;t believe, so Amazon is a good resource.</li>
            <li> Like two other reviewers my shaver developed a hole in the foil within a month or so of use. I&#x27;m going to get a replacement foil and try once more, but if that one goes quickly, the shaver will go in the trash.</li>
            <li> After several attempts to get these parts for my razor. This product was early on the delivery and was a perfect fit!! The price was cheaper then everywhere else and my razor was ready to go in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered as described and functions as if bought from your local store.</li>
            <li> Standard Remington screen replacement....no problems installing and they work just fine with some cost savings.  same as you get at the local store but cheaper</li>
            <li> It was perfect, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Outpost.com sells the SP-93 screens for 9.99. &lt;br /&gt;I also had a hole in my screen and had to recently purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> I love the shave but the infamous holes are ludicrous... I find every month a new hole appears in the foil, can never find a foil only replacement so get conned into buying cutters I don&#x27;t need. Budget $7 a month for foil replacement if you buy this shaver!</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement kit after whining to my wife about the way the shaver was \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; on my whiskers.  It was then that I realized I hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades in well over a year.  The blades and screen are very easy to replace and they restore the shaver back to new condition, as far as the shave is concerned.  This shaver is not the best in the world, for sure, but if yours is getting a bit painful to shave with and you don&#x27;t want to spend $100 for a new one, order the kit and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> We had the shipment on time as promised, and there was no damage.  These screens are getting harder to come by, and we appreciate being able to order from Amazon and getting good service, saving us from buying new razors.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in stores. Shopping at Amazon makes it so Easy! I also found the price is better.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my MS-3 1000 razor</li>
            <li> Package was a brand new replacement screen, and was in good shape and undamaged.  It fit in my razor perfectly and cut as close as the original when that was new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this in stores, and this is a good enough replacement for my shaver. Nothing remarkable, just gets the job done until this shaver finally wears out and I have to upgrade...  Price is comparable to what I had to spend in stores and with Prime usually ships free for me.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Remington Microscreen TCT for at least 6-7 years and it&#x27;s still running great. In that time I&#x27;ve replaced the screen and blades twice (including this set). I only use it 2-3 times a week and then in the car where I store it in the center console. Admittedly this is not the best way to store it and is probably why the screen gets beat up and needs to be replaced. In any case this razor is a work horse and has never failed me unless it needed a charge.  Love the shaver, love the replacement kits and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying both if your in the market.

            <li> Works nominally. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Shaving every day will wear down the best of blades.  The sad part is, the replacement blades and screen are about 50% the cost of the original razor.  Might be better to stretch out the life of the blades and then replace the razor.</li>
            <li> The order was filled and received promptly; the replacemet screen and cutters worked great.  I would use Amazon again.    Thanks, M &amp; M</li>
            <li> i like them,but for the price, i should have bought a new razor</li>
            <li> Great price with free shipping when you sign up for the 6 month subscription.  New blades are sent every 6 months with free shipping at a better price than WMart.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Fairly easy to install.  My one complaint is that since I installed them, my shaver has a tendency to pull on my hairs at times which can be painful and annoying.  Considering getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a rough beard and sensitive skin and these replacements work to restore the shave back to the same as new, smooth and close.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty finding this item at local retailers.  I purchased it from [...].  It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  The product packaging is just a small white cardboard box without advertising.  The parts appear to be exactly like the originals from retail packaging and installed without difficulty.  The first shave confirmed that the product is as advertised and appears to be genuine Remington replacement parts.  Good seller/product!</li>
            <li> best shaver ever built.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the foil screens and cutting blades in my older Remington Shaver. Very simple istallation and now the razor cuts like it did the day it was purchased.</li>
            <li> Some of these heads wear out in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The shaver parts were exactly what I expected.  They fit the shaver perfectly and it works great.  Also, order came on time with no problems.</li>
            <li> Been using them for quite awhile and like them</li>
            <li> unfortunately the shaver died before I could use all 3 sets purchased.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face as well. I also have been unable to find replqacement screens and cutters.  I e-mailed remmington and they told me to pack sand.  This is a good product but the replacement parts need to be replaced to often and finding them is impossible.</li>
            <li> ITems were received timely and as described and work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Product received exactly as described, in good condition, and very quickly. Better price than I could find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The item came promptly and was priced right.  Thank you.  I notice that the Remington SP-94 doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or effective as in the past.  Maybe its just me.  I have used this shaver for ever and I even reverse and move the cutting heads around to make the product last longer. OK, it works and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased these Remington blade and cover with delivery as expected. These replacements will extend the life of the shaver at a much less cost than a new shaver.    very pleased,</li>
            <li> When I travel the airlines always busts the screens on my shaver when they inspect my bags, even when I tape the guard in place.  Since the store where I bought the shaver no longer carries the parts, my wife wanted me to just buy a new model.  So this find is just like the parts I would get at the store and saved me good money.  The price was so good I bought 2 packages.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this whenever my old razor needs new blades and it always restore that old razor to like new.</li>
            <li> great for the price, fits my shaver</li>
            <li> arrived as promised and at a reasonable price. wil order again when needed.</li>
            <li> The screens and blades fit into the shaver, but they don&#x27;t line up properly causing me to not get a close shave.  Which is the whole point isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> The replacement blades work fine and I have no complaints about their quality or price. However, I don&#x27;t actually need them sent automatically every six months and am having a heck of a time stopping Amazon&#x27;s delivery service. Other than that, I&#x27;m a happy, well shaved camper.</li>
            <li> I buy these two at a time to get free shipping..  best price..  free shipping..  can&#x27;t get much better than that..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Microscreen 3 razors for over 10 years and they are the best around. Great shave every time with little hassle.</li>
            <li> THIS SAVES BUYING A NEW RAZOR AS THE NEW BLADES WORK GREAT. WHY SPEND $89.00 WHEN YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THE BLADES AND ITS LIKE NEW.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for over six years! I had to replace them two times. Once because the foil failed the other  is while  cleaning the blades I drop the foil in the toilet  while it was flushing.  To my dismay you have to buy the whole set at that time I had to order  the set. The next time the price went down to $ 23.99 . This will be my third set! I think since I have very skin sensitive and use pre shave it helps the blades and foil. And for me it no razor burn:) :)</li>
            <li> Old razor but still works.  Much better price than WalMart and so easier to deal with</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding locally so tried these and they work fine. Arrived in a timely manner and were exact as advertised so the fit and function are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone needing new parts for their electric razor.</li>
            <li> A very competitve price for these parts and delivered promptly.  Far easier and less expensive than buying off the shelf at the big box store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clean shaven. I don&#x27;t know why remington quit making this shaver. It has been my favorite electric razor for 15 years.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that will allow your shaver to easily last for years and years if properly maintained. I highly recommend the product and the sellers. Good price, product, and service. I have bought twice.</li>
            <li> The Remington SP-94 Microscreen 3 Replacement Screen and Cutters for MicroScreen 3TCT Shavers are easy to change out. I have paid more at local drug stores in the past, but was particularly pleased to find the Amazon pricing to be much more reasonable!</li>
            <li> These were factory originals in the original packing for a great price. Delivery was rapid. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, but this one is the only one I have found that gets each and every whisker.  Easy and price competitive to buy on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Assembly a bit difficult, but makes for a great shaver without having to buy a new one.  Please add explicit instructions, with thanks.</li>
            <li> These replacement screens did not fit the razor although that is what the instructions that came with razor said to order.  The parts were too big for the razor.</li>
            <li> Everything OK, as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington razors for over 7 years and they just keep getting better. The new 3TCT series shave closer than a blade. The replacement screens and cutters work extreemly well and are easly installed. &lt;br /&gt;A word of advice for the frequent shaver. To reduce the discomfort of ingrown hairs and razor burn, rinse the blades and screen in alcohol before each use.</li>
            <li> They were easy to install and greatly improved the performance of the razor.</li>
            <li> And the price was right. What else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I replace a foil screen about once every 3 months, what I would consider normal.  I always order an SP-94 (cutters &amp; foils) and an SP-93 (foils only) at the same time so that I can replace the cutters as I go through 6 foils.  I also ignore the instuctions to replace all the foils at the same time -I only replace one at a time.  Pretty economical that way compared to blades.</li>
            <li> The parts I ordered for the electric shaver were the correct ones. The shaver now works great. The seller shipped them promptly &amp; well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;My husband said the parts fit perfect &amp; the shaver works great.&lt;br /&gt;B. Porter</li>
            <li> Genuine replacement parts.  No complaints.  It is nice that Remington is still making these for a shaver that is getting pretty old at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the blades and screens for my Remington Shaver.  A great price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Replacement is straightforward, and if you haven&#x27;t replaced your blades and screens in awhile, the difference while shaving is dramatic. Once I win the lottery, I&#x27;m going to change my blades and screens every month.</li>
            <li> Since I first made this purchase back in 2009, the screen cutters are still as durable&lt;br /&gt;as ever and they give an excellent cut during your shaving period.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement blades!  Right out of the pack and a quick install then ready for a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Think I&#x27;ll buy another for back up.</li>
            <li> Keeps my 10 year old Remington Titanium MS3 2700 cutting like new. plus price was great.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I should get a new razor but the old one keeps going and with these replacement screens and blades, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have had a remington shaver since 2003. Since then I don&#x27;t know if I have had screens that have lasted longer than a month. I have had these for a little bit and we&#x27;ll see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> The Remington SP-94 replacement cutters are extremely sharp and cut pretty close to the skin - not as close as a manual razor, but I&#x27;ll trade a close shave for a shave that doesn&#x27;t leave me with painful razor burn like manual razors tend to. The cutters mount onto spring-loaded plastic holders and are very secure.   The replacement screens are easy to install and are flexible and comfortable on the skin, even around the jawline.   I change the cutters once every 4-6 months on average to ensure they stay sharp, though I&#x27;m sure they would last longer. The screens occasionally get little holes in them in the middle of a shave and the sharp edges around the holes in the screen have cut my face a few times. I always keep a couple extra sets of replacement screens/cutters on hand so I can replace them as necessary.  The screens and cutters are easy to clean with the little cleaning brush that comes with most Remington razors.   Overall, I think the Remington SP-94 replacement screens and cutters are a good product. Aside from the screens getting holes in them due to normal wear and tear and cutting my face, I am very pleased with these and I will continue to use them.   The local retail stores in my area stopped carrying these replacement screens/cutters a few months ago so I was extremely happy to find them on Amazon. The price is about $6 less than I used to pay at the retail store and the fact that they qualify for free super-saver shipping (I bought two sets to take advantage of that) makes this a really good deal.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly, it was correct item.  Really glad to find through Amazon as could not locate in any stores, they only carry the newer items and the shaver works great, just need replacement screen and cutters.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as represented.  Easy to exchange old parts for new.  Very pleased... I feel that I added years of life to my razor.</li>
            <li> Very good and originals, I will buy again from this seller</li>
            <li> Remington SP94 cutters and screens from Remington.  6 screens (SP93) look pretty good,although not from Remington.  I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past with the SP93 foils scratching my face because they was too big tall and protruded out of the carrier framework, providing a sharp edge on both sides of the screen.  However, the current non-Remington screens appear to be precision manufactured.  I should have no trouble with them.  If I do, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this program you instituted quite some time ago, I would have to purchase a new shaver as it gets harder to replace the parts that wear out in my old shaver. I haven&#x27;t seen any other shaver that works as smoothly and hope to continue using it for a few more shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Local shaver marts will not repair the shaver model I now have.  Most of the marts have gone out of business.  I was able to replace the screens and cutters and can continue to use this shaver for several more years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered these. We were contemplating just buying a new shaver, but my husband really likes this one. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have owned an MS3 TCT for almost 10 years and love it.  Many of you may have already figured this out cause it seems like common sense, but here is a trick to get double the life from your refills.    Pop out the titanium cutters that sit in their triagle looking case and flip them over, exposing a new cutting edge.  Bam!  4 more months of use, just like that.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to install. Forgot how nice the razor worked until screen was replaced</li>
            <li> getting tuff to find these anymore....happy to have found them...they worked perfect...</li>
            <li> Hard to find replacement parts in the stores. Considered buying another brand until we found this place to order the parts.</li>
            <li> Great kit for keeping your razor working at its best. Love it. Have the automatic delivery every 6 months so never forget to change it before the screen wears out</li>
            <li> It Has Been Vefy Good.  This Order Was Very Much Wort It!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, no complaints.</li>
            <li> The screens and cutters work on  the razors that they are designed for.  It is necessary to replace these items when they were out or the cutters get dull.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. I will order more when the time comes.  I hope the price does not go up.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; is at a fantastic price!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement kit for my Remington electric razor and received it in short order.  Everything was as promised.  Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Thanks I just do not need much. Yes I like my Remington parts</li>
            <li> everything on schedule</li>
            <li> as described and received on time</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these replacements because the screen developed a small hole and started to cut my face.  This happens to everyone, but come on, that happened to me after A YEAR of using the shaver and this is the first time I bought replacements (shaving about 2 times a week). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Always rinse your blades and screens with water after each shave and they will last longer.  For the blades use the brush to clean it while rinsing it with water and NEVER use the brush for the screens. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also had a hard time finding the replacements locally, but I found it here in Amazon and I think the price is really great since other online stores have it over $20.  Why are you complaining you can&#x27;t find the replacements? just click on \\&quot;Add to Cart\\&quot; is it that hard? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think spending around $17 a year for shaving is a GOOD DEAL.</li>
            <li> Very good quality item</li>
            <li> Great product,but too expensive</li>
            <li> The foil cover is easy to be broken. But the replacement is good. It is still a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Great price and free shipping.  I can&#x27;t beleive the difference.  It is like a brand new razor.  I will definately be buying more when needed.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver screens and cutters right away. It was the best deal anywhere! Thankx Amazon!</li>
            <li> Replacing the the cutters and screen on an electric shaver is not quite like getting a new shaver, but it&#x27;s not bad either. For a lot less than the price of a new shaver, it works like a charm and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to save the money.    Replacing the screen and cutters is a little non-intuitive, but if you follow the directions it goes together easily. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> These screens come a tiny package 3 at a time. They last at least as long or longer than the ones from Remington. I got a few and now I think the shaver will break before I run out of screens.</li>
            <li> good product and fine service, and quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
            <li> I love my old Remington shaver and I´m glad I still can find this replacement and keep using mine for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Remington micro screen 3 razor parts are getting hard to find in the store. These where actually cheaper they I used to buy them in the store for. Worked &amp; fit perfect.</li>
            <li> They were delivered two days early, was happy to get them.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find parts for old shavers. This replacement set comes easy to install and works as the original</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere.  If I need 14 more words, I&#x27;m sorry.  That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Fits and works just as it should.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, very sastified</li>
            <li> My original screen had gotten a hole in it.  It was eating up my face.  The new screen is great, but the new cutters don&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as the original ones.  I was concerned about buying this because I thouhgt it might not fit, but it fit perfectly and works great.  All in all a good product.  I would recommend it.  Much better than having to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Located these replacement blades at a MUCH more reasonable price.  Ordered two for a second razor.  Both arrived and work great.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because years ago I purchased a MS3-2700 Remington shaver; this shaver is not made anymore and it is the best Remington produced that didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and it is built to last and here is the only place  I can buy blades &amp; screens.</li>
            <li> No problems. My husband&#x27;s shaver is like new now.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and needed</li>
            <li> Fits my older razor and works well.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Makes my old Remington work like new.</li>
            <li> This replacement screen and cutters worked as expected; I was looking for a replacement, but couldn&#x27;t find one in the department stores.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> good product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere! Loved the razor so I looked on amazon and found them! Razor works like new again! Good quality at a fair price!</li>
            <li> I purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and after 3 mo&#x27;s the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face.  I have been trying to replace the SP-93 screen and blades, but have been unable to find a store that carries them.  I e-mailed remington twice and explained my problem but did not even receive a courtest reply. Most retailers including Walmart, Target, etc seem to be oblivious to the fact that they should be stocking the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> If you wait a year, you might get a hole in the foil.  I&#x27;ve used this shaver for years and haven&#x27;t had any problems with holes.  If I recall right, you are supposed to replace the foil every six months and the blades once a year.  That would work if you could buy them separately, or pack two sets of foil with one set of blades.</li>
            <li> This was a really great buy. I have used this shaver since 2000 and the new screen and cutters were ideal. Much cheaper than buying a new razor, but it feels like a new razor!</li>
            <li> The Remington MicroScreen 3, is the inkjet printer of the shaver world; and the Screen &amp; Cutters, are the ink. &lt;br /&gt;The Remington, shaves great, the Screen &amp; Cutters don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement parts for my Remington MS3-2700 cordless shaver.   These parts are essential as the shaver screens, if not replaced, will wear and develope holes in anywhere between a few months to a year depending on usage.   The replacement parts work fine with my Remington.   Only complaint is they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble! Instructions are on the back of the package insert; however, you must be careful not to cut apart the instructions when trying to get into the package!</li>
            <li> these screens and cutters are getting hard to find . glad you still carry them . i might have to invest in a newer&lt;br /&gt; style of shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington micro-screen style shavers for probably about 20 or 25 years. For me, it&#x27;s the only kind of shaver to use...provides the most comfortable shave, the most even coverage, and the greatest ease of use. I hate razors, and never really liked the double or triple-head style electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really stick to the recommended schedule for replacing the screen &amp; cutters. I only change them out when the screen develops a tear or hole in it. Having new cutters doesn&#x27;t seem to make the shave significantly faster or allow for a closer shave, but having a new screen is essential when the old one starts to fail, otherwise you will cut up your face wherever there is a large enough hole in the screen. The quality of the components in this set of screen and cutters is good. They perform well, and I&#x27;d say they usually last me anywhere from 12 to 18 months.</li>
            <li> Normal shaving....does expected job.....and should be as expected...will order these again until my razor wares out. Thanks for a reasonable and good product.</li>
            <li> Looks and functions as  the original.</li>
            <li> My Remington Microscreen shaver has been a work horse of daily use for over the past 7 years. Unfortunately, Remington is going more towards the rotary shavers that are harder to clean and don&#x27;t shave as close. So when I found a supplier that combined shaver screens and cutters I had to buy these replacement parts anticipating normal wear and tear. Remington&#x27;s cutters don&#x27;t really need replacing since I&#x27;ve used old cutters for a long time, however, the screen wears down from friction during normal shaving. Price was great and I got what I needed / wanted.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and arrived in a timely manner.  The product is getting harder to find as the shaver is an older model. Thanks for helping me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed.  Hard to find in local stores.  My husband uses this razor every day.  I was glad to find this source.</li>
            <li> These work great for my husbands razor. Can not find them in local stores.</li>
            <li> Everything was great received shipment on time.</li>
            <li> Should have gone here instead of Walmart for years. The ones from Walmart were more expensive &amp; didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick fix.  The razor now shaves like a new one. With this repair readily available my razor should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is not electronics but &amp;#34;plug and play&amp;#34;.. Now I have a some spares to prolong the life of my razor...</li>
            <li> Product arrived  on time; price was fair; product works well - have used these for many years.</li>
            <li> THEY WERE OK, BUT REMINGTON SHOULD CHECK ON THE CHINESE MAKING THE BLADES, TO HAVE THEM SHARPENED MORE.THE OLD SAYING YOU CAN&#x27;T WIN THEM ALL.I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THEY HAVE A  PERSON  CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE MADE RIGHT OR NOT.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it came on time and every thing worked just fine.  I gave it 4 stars because I think there is always room for improvement even if I don&#x27;t know what that improvement should be.</li>
            <li> Item was wel packaged and as described</li>
            <li> Hard to find item.  Rec&#x27;d  r  would have had  to junk razor</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, and a brand new Remington. Easy to install the parts, Gave it A full charge and off it goes.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I did know how dull the original blades and screen had be come. Change out replacements and razer is working like new!</li>
            <li> This was the absolute best price anywhere, perfect for my razor. The three sets I ordered came in early and were exactly as advertised. I shouldn&#x27;t need any blades or screens for quite a while, if I do I will only buy them here.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Shave my head with his razor.  Been using for over 12 years.  Great.</li>
            <li> great replacements - original manufacturer - quick shipment - still using the same razor for the past 15 yrs. - just replace the blades and micro screen as needed.</li>
            <li> My son began shaving recently.  My husband purchased the Remington Razor some time back but needed replacement screens.  So, happy to find them on Amazon.  This is a great razor for a beginner.  He uses it often because he doesn&#x27;t like a beard..lol</li>
            <li> This fills the need perfectly.  Remington makes quality and smooth shaving device. After I re placed the old batteries with new and larger capacity batteries I will use it many more years.</li>
            <li> They fit. They work. So that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Ordered replacement part for razor since we were not able to find any locally.  Excellent price and was able to replace old one quickly and easily.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Makes my razor like new - Very Happy - Great price too.</li>
            <li> fits my shaver, good price...if you need these buy this</li>
            <li> these seem to stay sharp for a long time, i&#x27;m still using them going on 3 years.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and more reasonable</li>
            <li> Great price. Took a little longer to arrive than I thought it would. Original replacement.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to refresh my old Remmington</li>
            <li> This is third replacement in 10 years for mine so whole unit has no shame. Replacement parts fit right up, but this replacement wants to pull a little and it can leave you pretty sore. You can help the pulling by slowing down in some areas and changing the angle of the head in others. So if you don&#x27;t want to buy a new shaver, the replacement will work and may wear in to the point it will stop pulling.</li>
            <li> Finally was able to get the correct item I was looking for. The previos one purchased was wrong and did not fit my shaver</li>
            <li> Does exactly ehat I need...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and worked great!</li>
