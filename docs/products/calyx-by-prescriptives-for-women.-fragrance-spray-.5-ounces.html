            <li>- There, now I feel all better.</li>
            <li>you may still be able to pick up a ghost of the original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fruity, sweet, citrus fragrance, really refreshing not overbearing</li>
            <li>It is a very fresh and clean scent!</li>
            <li>I liked this so much on someone else that I just had to get some too.  </li>
            <li>- I ordered Clinique Calyx just now from where free shipping, free returns are offered, just in case.</li>
            <li>It is a very unique and not-too-strong fragrance which is fun to wear for an evening out.  </li>
            <li>was the right product for sure</li>
            <li>In fact it smelled entirely different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Other reviews said great things, so I went for it.</li>
            <li>It is ok, a little strong smelling, but a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>clean and fresh....</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, clean, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, crisp, and fresh.</li>
            <li>The real Calyx was  light and airy.  </li>
            <li>I would call it fresh and floral.</li>
            <li>You need fresh air to carry the scent, pleasingly.  </li>
            <li>This is an old favorite of mine from when Prescriptives was still sold in department stores.  </li>
            <li>A long time favorite with a clean, crisp, fresh scent that lasts.</li>
            <li>If you can get through a good half hour till the underlying scents emerge....</li>
            <li>this clean classic fragrance, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Just skip it, or buy it in person so you can check the smell first.</li>
            <li>Funny thing though</li>
            <li>Bottle was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I should have paid more attention.</li>
            <li>It really smells like pineapple that&#x27;s gone off...</li>
            <li>Very disappoined.</li>
            <li>Very practical to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>Have to make sure I am not in too closed quarters when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I have just learned that real Calyx is now made by Clinique.  </li>
            <li>but not until it goes back to the original.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume.</li>

            <li> have some trouble finding the body lotion, but lord and taylor carries the perfume so far.....</li>
            <li> so this bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for this scent for a long time and was advised by a department store that Prescriptives no longer makes Calylx.  </li>
            <li> I love it and wish it was a bit less expensive!</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and was concerned because of previous comments about the horrid smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells green and fruity, but not overly so.  </li>
            <li> I use to like this, but now it&#x27;s too musky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> popped up saying Calyx is not available on Presciptives but is on Clinique.  </li>
            <li> I order a small amount I needed to verify it</li>
            <li> What has arrived in this small bottle smells like Essence of Grapefruit.</li>
            <li> A subtle blend of citrus and floral.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing subtle about it.</li>
            <li> I had Calyx fragrance years ago but have been unable to find it for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong w/</li>
            <li> Guess that explains why, unless you got it from Clinque, you received a fake.  </li>
            <li> Yuck - I just read that fake fragrances can contain some substances</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again. :(</li>
            <li> This is disgusting, and I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> and I was terribly upset when it disappeared from the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This perfume is the worst smelling fragrance i have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Ir is disgusting.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m disgusted I got ripped off but hope this helps others  </li>

            <li> I have been using Calyx for many, many years, and use to be able to purchase all sizes in department stores.  I was very pleased to find the perfume on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for many, many years.  I was happy to find the purse size.  Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 20 years and was so depressed when Calyx pulled out the retail market. However, they offer online purchasing now!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fruity, sweet, citrus fragrance, really refreshing not overbearing</li>
            <li> I use to love this perfume.....then some brain decided everyone would like to smell like rotten grapefruit and changed the formula.  If you can get through a good half hour till the underlying scents emerge....you may still be able to pick up a ghost of the original fragrance.  Go back to the beginning and I&#x27;ll buy it again.......but not until it goes back to the original.</li>
            <li> This is disgusting, and I can&#x27;t even return it. What a disappointment. Before she left, I finally asked a previous coworker about her amazing sent and was grateful to find it on Amazon. I read some of the reviews and was concerned because of previous comments about the horrid smell. Other reviews said great things, so I went for it. It&#x27;s horrid. HORRID. Just skip it, or buy it in person so you can check the smell first. It really smells like pineapple that&#x27;s gone off...weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Very disappoined. This perfume did not have the same fragrance that I remembered.  In fact it smelled entirely different and not in a good way. Will not purchase again. :(</li>
            <li> I had Calyx fragrance years ago but have been unable to find it for quite awhile. I was very glad to see I could get it through Amazon because I get compliments on it when I wear it. It is a very unique and not-too-strong fragrance which is fun to wear for an evening out.  I would call it fresh and floral. I was happy to be able to buy a purse size spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this fragrance. It is no longer sold in department stores. I was pleased to be able to purchase through Amazon</li>
            <li> A great scent.  Fresh and clean.  Good for winter as well as summer.  I just love it, what more can I say???</li>
            <li> The perfume met my expectations and beyond. It is  a fruity youthful fragrance. Very practical to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite with a clean, crisp, fresh scent that lasts. I always get compliments when I wear my Calyx.</li>
            <li> I waited years and years for this product to comeback I order a small amount I needed to verify it was the right product for sure now I will order more.</li>
            <li> i have used this perfume for decades!!! love the scent..clean and fresh....have some trouble finding the body lotion, but lord and taylor carries the perfume so far.....Please don&#x27;t discontinue!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and wish it was a bit less expensive!</li>
            <li> The real Calyx was  light and airy.  A subtle blend of citrus and floral.  I wore it for years and I was terribly upset when it disappeared from the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement - although it&#x27;s called Calyx - is not the same.  What has arrived in this small bottle smells like Essence of Grapefruit. There are no floral notes. There is nothing subtle about it. It&#x27;s appalling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pitched it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It actually would have been cheaper just to buy a grapefruit.</li>
            <li> One of the best scents ever.  And an ok price.  I guess Prescriptives isn&#x27;t going to discount their colognes anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for years.  I always get compliments and this bottle size is great for travel.  You don&#x27;t need more than a couple of sprays so this bottle lasts a long time.  It is a very fresh and clean scent!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this scent for a long time and was advised by a department store that Prescriptives no longer makes Calylx.  I was pleased to find an ample supply on Amazon.  I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite scent!  It&#x27;s smells green and fruity, but not overly so.  I like to think it smells like cut grass with guava thrown in.  Funny thing though, it makes me sneeze one time, every time I put it on.  LOL</li>
            <li> speedy delivery totally satisfied</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong w/this clean classic fragrance, and at a very reasonable price. I like having this size to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is well suited for a woman of any age.  I bought this fragrance for my aunt and she loves it.  The smell is clean, refresh and energetic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love, Love, Love, Calyx!!! I always have.  The scent is fresh, clean, and oh so yummy! OMG!!</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance in my 20&#x27;s an I saw it online I thought I would give it a try again. It is ok, a little strong smelling, but a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  The only problem is the last two orders I&#x27;ve made -- I got Clinique Calyx NOT Calyx Prescriptives.</li>
            <li> I use to like this, but now it&#x27;s too musky and heavy.  Have to make sure I am not in too closed quarters when I wear it.  You need fresh air to carry the scent, pleasingly.  Maybe we could have a Calyx Lite.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the worst smelling fragrance i have ever smelled. I gave it two chances and also had others from eork try it. Ir is disgusting. Since i cannot return perfume, it went in the trash</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance!  It is especially nice for summertime!!&lt;br /&gt;John 3:16</li>
            <li> Bottle was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I should have paid more attention. Having said that, this scent is amazing and I think can be worn by young and older. It&#x27;s clean, crisp, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much on someone else that I just had to get some too.  I love the fragrance as it sprays out, but for some reason, can&#x27;t smell it on myself and wonder if it&#x27;s good on me or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now a few hours after my original review (and I undid all the stars I could). I have just learned that real Calyx is now made by Clinique.  I went to Prescriptives.com and searched for Calyx - Screen popped up saying Calyx is not available on Presciptives but is on Clinique.  Guess that explains why, unless you got it from Clinque, you received a fake.  Yuck - I just read that fake fragrances can contain some substances - I won&#x27;t name them - can&#x27;t vouch for the truth but it was enough for me - you would never choose to apply to yourself anywhere.  So I&#x27;m disgusted I got ripped off but hope this helps others  - I ordered Clinique Calyx just now from where free shipping, free returns are offered, just in case. - There, now I feel all better.</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine from when Prescriptives was still sold in department stores.  It has a very clean, light scent and is great for summer.</li>
