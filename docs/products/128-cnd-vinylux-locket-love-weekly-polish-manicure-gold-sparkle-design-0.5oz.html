            <li>I have use CND shellacs for years and they are the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in a gold phase and this is a great gold polish for the summer!</li>

            <li>in all, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>I was trying a substitute for gel polish and these are nice, the consistency and color are great,</li>
            <li>Loved color.</li>
            <li>It was received in the time frame as promised and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and the color is great.</li>
            <li>These vinylux metalics really are the best metallics for stamping that I have found.</li>
            <li>But still, one of my favorite colors I own.</li>
            <li>The more coats you put on the more gold is appears.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than anything else</li>
            <li>the shine from the top coat is just like gel polish.</li>
            <li>A very beautiful blonde gold.</li>
            <li>I thought it as going to be more of a champagne/pale gold glittery color.</li>
            <li>I love the vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li>:) I got it for my toes.</li>
            <li>Be sure to go outside in the sun as it drys to get best results.</li>
            <li>It might look better on someone with a darker skin tone, but it is not the right shade for someone fair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other metalic gold polishes, but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>For a pedicure, I&#x27;ve been wearing the same coat for two months and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This color is nice but it doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a professional manicure, so I am fairly knowledgeable about brands of nail polishes and this one did as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Their site also has more accurate photos of the color, as long as your screen has good color.</li>
            <li>I first used this brand/type (but not color) in a nail salon and fell in love with how well it stayed on.  </li>
            <li>I love this color and Vinylux performs really well.</li>
            <li>the shine becomes lackluster quickly.</li>
            <li>More daylight during the week, (while you shop or take kids to the park, etc) or an extra coat of top coat and daylight on day 3 or 4, will help improve your results.</li>
            <li>The polish does stay on for about a week, this color is definitely gold, a little too bright for my fingernails, but I wear it proudly on my toenails..  </li>
            <li>This color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>It stayed fresh for the seven days as promised.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I had success in stamping wih another CND VINYLUX metalic polish when using it for stamping.</li>
            <li>Received my item quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have it on my fingers right now</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and the polish itself lasts longer than regular polish and they cost the same price so its worth getting the CND versus spending $8 plus dollars at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Do not use any other top coat!</li>
            <li>3) Be sure to apply the Vinylux brand of top coat, it works in combination with the polish to cure hard.</li>
            <li>It is very metallic and sparkly, which is fine, but can create streaks if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>This color stayed on very well for 7 days.</li>
            <li>I am ready to change the color</li>
            <li>The pictures don&#x27;t show this very well.</li>
            <li>My skin is fair and a little on the yellow side; I like this color</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more greenish gold than picture but still lasted longer than normal nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Kind of thick too.  </li>
            <li>It holds it&#x27;s color, doesn&#x27;t look yellow and really shines like real gold.</li>
            <li>This stull really lasts on me and I have purchased it in several colors.  </li>
            <li>Must have been old.</li>
            <li>They last much longer than the regular polish and are much easier to take off.</li>
            <li>A few important things to know about this brand: 1) after washing and drying your hands, use rubbing alcohol on your nails to &amp;#34;dehydrate&amp;#34; them.  </li>
            <li>This polish &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; in natural daylight, which has UV rays, it just needs a lower amount of UV than Shellac.</li>
            <li>This product  work as advertise by lasting at least a week or more.</li>
            <li>Seems to be to thick and doesn&#x27;t last for a week even with the top coat.  </li>

            <li> Sometimes the polish will wear at the tips and very rarely have a small chip at the tips but usually by that time</li>
            <li> It has lasted a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected, essentially.</li>
            <li> I can wear it with lots of colors which is helpful since it stays on so long.</li>
            <li> and it is just barely rubbing off in a few places</li>
            <li> While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does.</li>
            <li> Lasts only a few days before chipping.  </li>
            <li> Typically I can get almost 2 weeks out of a Vinylux manicure.</li>

            <li> The color is designed to adhere to bare nails, and any base coat will ruin it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not perfect with my complexion</li>
            <li> VERY difficult to remove.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have use CND shellacs for years and they are the best product on the market. However, Vinilux series are not at all living up to the same standards in it&#x27;s class. While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does. Frankly, I think it is even inferior to a regular OPI  nail polish. Dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This stull really lasts on me and I have purchased it in several colors.  For a pedicure, I&#x27;ve been wearing the same coat for two months and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a gold phase and this is a great gold polish for the summer!</li>
            <li> I love this color! The more coats you put on the more gold is appears. Received my item quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am a nail pro for years now.  I have never had a professional manicure, so I am fairly knowledgeable about brands of nail polishes and this one did as advertised.  It stayed fresh for the seven days as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this color and Vinylux performs really well. It lasts for a week vs. 2-3 days out of regular polish.</li>
            <li> Seems to be to thick and doesn&#x27;t last for a week even with the top coat.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be the same as the one purchased in England.</li>
            <li> This product  work as advertise by lasting at least a week or more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled- I thought that this color had actual sparkle in it but it does not.  It is simply a metallic gold color but I still like it.  I first used this brand/type (but not color) in a nail salon and fell in love with how well it stayed on.  I have it on my fingers right now and it is just barely rubbing off in a few places but it has been on for over a week.  MUCH better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried that chips and peals off within days.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color of this polish. It might look better on someone with a darker skin tone, but it is not the right shade for someone fair.  It is very metallic and sparkly, which is fine, but can create streaks if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I was trying a substitute for gel polish and these are nice, the consistency and color are great, the shine from the top coat is just like gel polish. Only thing is it wears like regular polish, chipped by the next day and the shine becomes lackluster quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more greenish gold than picture but still lasted longer than normal nail polish.  Would use &amp; purchase again.</li>
            <li> Too thick.Must have been old.Loved color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other metalic gold polishes, but this one is the best.  It holds it&#x27;s color, doesn&#x27;t look yellow and really shines like real gold. It has lasted a long time, too.  On my toes, it has lasted 3+ weeks!</li>
            <li> VERY difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Lasts only a few days before chipping.  I have to admit though, I did wash dishes a few times so I knew it would chip eventually.</li>
            <li> The polish stays on for over a week. and the color is very beautiful! It is truly girly girl. It does make a statement.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It is an opaque shimmer polish. It is so sparkly!! A very beautiful blonde gold. It lasted about 4 days before chipping. Typically I can get almost 2 weeks out of a Vinylux manicure. So, I&#x27;d say it does not wear as well. But still, one of my favorite colors I own.</li>
            <li> I used this product 2 weeks ago and it is still on my nails even though some of it did chip off the tips. It is easy to apply and the color is great. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The polish does stay on for about a week, this color is definitely gold, a little too bright for my fingernails, but I wear it proudly on my toenails..  It was received in the time frame as promised and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty. It is like a foil-like gold versus the glitter-like gold I thought it would be. I thought it as going to be more of a champagne/pale gold glittery color. I am still very happy with it. I love the vinylux polishes. They last much longer than the regular polish and are much easier to take off. This color stayed on very well for 7 days. Sometimes the polish will wear at the tips and very rarely have a small chip at the tips but usually by that time I am ready to change the color anyway.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very happy with purchase. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had success in stamping wih another CND VINYLUX metalic polish when using it for stamping. These vinylux metalics really are the best metallics for stamping that I have found.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous and the polish itself lasts longer than regular polish and they cost the same price so its worth getting the CND versus spending $8 plus dollars at the drugstore.  It didnt last a week on me but then again I type for a living HOWEVER considering all the typing I do, it stayed on way longer than reg. polish and didnt chip like the reg. polish would.</li>
            <li> I like this color. It&#x27;s what I expected, essentially. It&#x27;s a little lighter and shinier than I hoped, but it&#x27;s gold and shiny. :) I got it for my toes. But it&#x27;s not perfect with my complexion and I think I&#x27;ll reserve it for accents on the kids&#x27; fingers/toes.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair and a little on the yellow side; I like this color, it acts like a neutral. I can wear it with lots of colors which is helpful since it stays on so long. A few important things to know about this brand: 1) after washing and drying your hands, use rubbing alcohol on your nails to &amp;#34;dehydrate&amp;#34; them.  2) Do NOT use a base coat, not even a CND brand. The color is designed to adhere to bare nails, and any base coat will ruin it. 3) Be sure to apply the Vinylux brand of top coat, it works in combination with the polish to cure hard. Do not use any other top coat! 4) This polish &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; in natural daylight, which has UV rays, it just needs a lower amount of UV than Shellac. Be sure to go outside in the sun as it drys to get best results. 5) More daylight during the week, (while you shop or take kids to the park, etc) or an extra coat of top coat and daylight on day 3 or 4, will help improve your results. 6) Vinylux  polish comes in creams, sparkles, shimmers, sheers, etc. Don&#x27;t look just at the color, go to the CND website to find out what you are getting. The pictures don&#x27;t show this very well. Their site also has more accurate photos of the color, as long as your screen has good color.</li>
            <li> This color is nice but it doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  Kind of thick too.  I am not sure what to thin it down with.........</li>
