    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Too wonderful to describe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of in-shower oils and lotions, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Try a heavier oil (Oils of Aloha has a wonderful kukui oil that saves my hands when they crack) or perhaps a body butter.</li>
            <li>Tree Hut makes wonderful butters and lotions with shea, and without parabens or DM DM hydantoin!      </li>
            <li>in fact, just perfect.</li>
            <li>This product smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had a Tree Hut KuKui nut scented body butter given to me as a gift one year, it smelled so wonderful, I&#x27;d kept the lid from the container for years</li>
            <li>Awesome product!  </li>
            <li>Its wonderful on damp skin immediately after bath or shower to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin glowy and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also great.</li>
            <li>Works great ...</li>
            <li>so I gave it a whirl, &amp; I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li>Great skin food, and makes a good massage oil as well.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasant, very light scent.     </li>
            <li>The best way to use it is to rub it into your skin right after a shower, when your skin is still damp.  </li>
            <li>Great product,I have been using it for years and very happy that Amazon offers a two pack option for this.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Lightweight, great moisturizing, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Nice nutty smell, absorbs the skin well without oily residue.</li>
            <li>Has a wonderful fragrance, its light and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>One of the best oils for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is light, has a wonderful gentle warm fragrance, and it gives me the moisture that my skin needs.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what my title says: a wonderful light body oil.</li>
            <li>This product is sold at a good price and delivered quickly by CleanBoutique.com.  </li>
            <li>I got this stuff, and I got some Oils of Aloha Kukui Oil for more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, the quality of the oil, the price.</li>
            <li>What a fabulous moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>the info that they need was on the order slip but they want more info like the bar code&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The best part of this product is that it smells different then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered, reordered and ordered some more.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and really WORKS (better than the Neutrogena \\&quot;Sailor&#x27;s\\&quot; super strong hand cream) - remember to rub it into your skin while your hands are still damp.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light, spreads nice and evenly, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>This is awesome skincare, and it baffles me that stores carry every other item from Alba, but not this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still stable, non-rancid, stored in closet, but prolly more potent if used fresh.</li>
            <li>This oil is smooth on the skin and non-staining on clothing.  </li>
            <li>light scent</li>
            <li>I use this on my face before lathering up with shave cream, and the blade glides so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin from drying out, keeps it looking healthy and even, and gives me a pretty, natural-looking sheen.</li>
            <li>I always want to smell unique &amp; this is exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>I use it on my hands before retiring at night, and whipped some into shea butter for a DIY rich butter for summer heat fried skin.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy!</li>
            <li>I also use the alba facial night cream that is as good or better than something you would get in a high end department store</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive brands, but have found Alba to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I would say this is for those people who have already gotten our skin to a better state and use this to maintain it staying soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent, although there&#x27;s not too many other fragrances that I can think of that you can compare it to.</li>
            <li>First bought at harvest foods based on yummy smell in health section, lasted 4 ever.</li>
            <li>Alba is great stuff, and two bottles of it is going to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to try these myself, but they&#x27;re very likely just as wonderful as all their other products, several of which I use on a daily basis and LOVE.</li>
            <li>For years I tried so many creams, oils etc to combat my dry skin on my arms</li>
            <li>Bought &amp; forgot to use for massages, but now astounded that over a year after ditching lotions w/additives and switching to pure coconut oil, plus pure vitamin e &amp; sunflower oil for face &amp; diet supplements</li>
            <li>If your skin is chapped or cracked, you&#x27;ll need something much heavier than this.</li>
            <li>Although, I tend to use a lot of it, so I guess it depends on how much you plan to use.</li>
            <li>any other nutty fragrance, so you won&#x27;t smell like coconut, or hazelnut, but you&#x27;ll smell very tropical &amp; intoxicating &amp; you won&#x27;t smell like anyone else you work with :)</li>
            <li>But I do have very dry skin myself, and I find it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>That requires me to shake it up every time I use it, but a little Eucerin makes it more creamy...</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>(My old neighborhood was a bit far for me to travel to buy it).  </li>
            <li>With this, I hop in the shower scrub, rinse, douse myself in this, rinse, pat dry, &amp; I&#x27;m ready for my day.</li>
            <li>It does indeed leave your shower floor very slippery, so be careful when applying.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a little on the dry side, and is very sensitive to changes in weather and such, yet this oil works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Rinses ok, doesn&#x27;t make the shower (or my hair where it touches my shoulders) greasy, but the consistency is thin; if your skin is very dry you may want to supplement with lotion.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> (I mean, we&#x27;re all watching Dr. Oz, &amp; all these health food &amp; health gurus now-a-days, right?)</li>
            <li> This is not a deeply moisturizing oil for those who&#x27;s skin is in an extremely dry state.  </li>
            <li> Kukui Nut oil keeps my skin moist in the Southern California dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I just moved to a different neighborhood, and I had to buy it here, because every single drug store I went to (large or small) had every other Alba product but this.  ????  </li>
            <li> I like to be completely covered with it, so that the smell is all over me, &amp; will cover me so well &amp; stick to me so that I don&#x27;t have to use lotion, because I&#x27;m a little lazy &amp; impatient when it comes to having to wait for lotion to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my skin got so soft&lt;br /&gt;and appeared so soft also.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes if I need some extra hand care, I&#x27;ll use a little of the oil in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this is NOT for extremely dry or damaged skin.     </li>
            <li> Shea butter works wonders for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just put on immediately after showering and towel dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have severe dry skin, you might want to try this!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it is slightly on the oily side, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> well if you have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply the kukui lotion later to dryer patches for added moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Alba Botanica also has a few \\&quot;body creams\\&quot; that may work as well.</li>
            <li> I started using it because creams - no matter how dense were simply not helping my skin - my hands would be dry in minutes, and the cream didn&#x27;t penetrate and heal other areas that began to be painful from dryness.  </li>
            <li> Was too lazy to get up &amp; fetch my coconut oil</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user and bought this to replace nitrogen sesame oil that has parabens and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> when I complained they said, sorry ,its company policy</li>
            <li> Number one, it&#x27;s organic, can&#x27;t go wrong there</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil is smooth on the skin and non-staining on clothing.  It keeps my skin soft. The smell is also great.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff, and I got some Oils of Aloha Kukui Oil for more than twice the price. The Aloha stuff stops my legs itching and is relatively non-greasy. This stuff  makes my legs greasy, but doesn&#x27;t help the itch.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Love the smell, the quality of the oil, the price. I have been a long time user and bought this to replace nitrogen sesame oil that has parabens and have not been disappointed. I also use the alba facial night cream that is as good or better than something you would get in a high end department store and I think it costs 11.00. I will post a review on that as well.</li>
            <li> been using this product for years. Too wonderful to describe.  Works great ...</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is to die for.  Leaves skin glowy and beautiful.  I usually apply the kukui lotion later to dryer patches for added moisturizing.  This is not a deeply moisturizing oil for those who&#x27;s skin is in an extremely dry state.  I would say this is for those people who have already gotten our skin to a better state and use this to maintain it staying soft and supple.  Great product,I have been using it for years and very happy that Amazon offers a two pack option for this.</li>
            <li> One of the best oils for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is awesome skincare, and it baffles me that stores carry every other item from Alba, but not this.  I just moved to a different neighborhood, and I had to buy it here, because every single drug store I went to (large or small) had every other Alba product but this.  ????  (My old neighborhood was a bit far for me to travel to buy it).  The oil is light, has a wonderful gentle warm fragrance, and it gives me the moisture that my skin needs.  The best way to use it is to rub it into your skin right after a shower, when your skin is still damp.  What that does is trap the moisture and penetrates the way a cream would never do.  Once you try oil, you&#x27;ll never use cream again!  I started using it because creams - no matter how dense were simply not helping my skin - my hands would be dry in minutes, and the cream didn&#x27;t penetrate and heal other areas that began to be painful from dryness.  As soon as I began using this, those problems were cured. Sometimes if I need some extra hand care, I&#x27;ll use a little of the oil in the middle of the day.  It smells wonderful and really WORKS (better than the Neutrogena \\&quot;Sailor&#x27;s\\&quot; super strong hand cream) - remember to rub it into your skin while your hands are still damp.  I recommend this as the De Facto skin moisture care product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of in-shower oils and lotions, but this one is the best. Rinses ok, doesn&#x27;t make the shower (or my hair where it touches my shoulders) greasy, but the consistency is thin; if your skin is very dry you may want to supplement with lotion.</li>
            <li> What a fabulous moisturizer!  Penetrates into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily trace.</li>
            <li> First bought at harvest foods based on yummy smell in health section, lasted 4 ever. Reordered a 2pack on here. Bought &amp; forgot to use for massages, but now astounded that over a year after ditching lotions w/additives and switching to pure coconut oil, plus pure vitamin e &amp; sunflower oil for face &amp; diet supplements this stuff has them all languishing on my shelf. Plus flaxseed oil. Was too lazy to get up &amp; fetch my coconut oil so read my massage oil ingredients, doh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still stable, non-rancid, stored in closet, but prolly more potent if used fresh.</li>
            <li> this is not what I ordered and they know it. they purposely sent me something else&lt;br /&gt;all the info that they need was on the order slip but they want more info like the bar code&lt;br /&gt;and something else. when I complained they said, sorry ,its company policy</li>
            <li> If you have severe dry skin, you might want to try this!  For years I tried so many creams, oils etc to combat my dry skin on my arms&lt;br /&gt;elbows, legs.  Then found this alba nut oil.  Keep on in your shower, and before drying off, rub oil all over.  Keep another on your&lt;br /&gt;nightstand and before retiring, rub some on arms and hands.  You will be amazed!  After a few weeks, my skin got so soft&lt;br /&gt;and appeared so soft also.  Think it&#x27;s the oil must protect and soften.  Anyway, I order about 4 at a time and keep this&lt;br /&gt;routine up!  Different things work well for different people, this one did for me.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my title says: a wonderful light body oil. It goes on light, spreads nice and evenly, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or oily. It also has a very pleasant, very light scent.     My skin tends to be a little on the dry side, and is very sensitive to changes in weather and such, yet this oil works very well for me. It keeps my skin from drying out, keeps it looking healthy and even, and gives me a pretty, natural-looking sheen. HOWEVER, this is NOT for extremely dry or damaged skin.     If your skin is chapped or cracked, you&#x27;ll need something much heavier than this. Try a heavier oil (Oils of Aloha has a wonderful kukui oil that saves my hands when they crack) or perhaps a body butter. Shea butter works wonders for really dry skin. Tree Hut makes wonderful butters and lotions with shea, and without parabens or DM DM hydantoin!      Alba Botanica also has a few \\&quot;body creams\\&quot; that may work as well. I have yet to try these myself, but they&#x27;re very likely just as wonderful as all their other products, several of which I use on a daily basis and LOVE.</li>
            <li> This product is sold at a good price and delivered quickly by CleanBoutique.com.  This is the third time I have ordered Alba Kukui Nut Body Oil, so I&#x27;m sold.  Alba is great stuff, and two bottles of it is going to last a very long time.  Some say it doesn&#x27;t work that well if you have very dry skin.  But I do have very dry skin myself, and I find it works just fine.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it is slightly on the oily side, in my opinion.  Well, after all, it IS body oil.  So what I do is mix it about 4 or 5 to 1 with Eucerin.  That requires me to shake it up every time I use it, but a little Eucerin makes it more creamy... in fact, just perfect.</li>
            <li> This product smells absolutely wonderful. It&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent, although there&#x27;s not too many other fragrances that I can think of that you can compare it to. I&#x27;d had a Tree Hut KuKui nut scented body butter given to me as a gift one year, it smelled so wonderful, I&#x27;d kept the lid from the container for years incase I ever came across it in a store. One day I was online &amp; came across this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Number one, it&#x27;s organic, can&#x27;t go wrong there (I mean, we&#x27;re all watching Dr. Oz, &amp; all these health food &amp; health gurus now-a-days, right?) so I gave it a whirl, &amp; I&#x27;m happy I did. It does indeed leave your shower floor very slippery, so be careful when applying. Although, I tend to use a lot of it, so I guess it depends on how much you plan to use. I like to be completely covered with it, so that the smell is all over me, &amp; will cover me so well &amp; stick to me so that I don&#x27;t have to use lotion, because I&#x27;m a little lazy &amp; impatient when it comes to having to wait for lotion to be absorbed. With this, I hop in the shower scrub, rinse, douse myself in this, rinse, pat dry, &amp; I&#x27;m ready for my day. The best part of this product is that it smells different then any other nutty fragrance, so you won&#x27;t smell like coconut, or hazelnut, but you&#x27;ll smell very tropical &amp; intoxicating &amp; you won&#x27;t smell like anyone else you work with :) I always want to smell unique &amp; this is exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> Lightweight, great moisturizing, easy to use.  Just put on immediately after showering and towel dry.  Fast and easy!</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and I use this in my practice. light scent</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Not too thick/thin. Nice nutty smell, absorbs the skin well without oily residue.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face before lathering up with shave cream, and the blade glides so smoothly.  Great skin food, and makes a good massage oil as well.  One star knocked off for pricing, as it&#x27;s spendy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered, reordered and ordered some more. Its wonderful on damp skin immediately after bath or shower to seal in moisture. I use it on my hands before retiring at night, and whipped some into shea butter for a DIY rich butter for summer heat fried skin. Has a wonderful fragrance, its light and absorbs into skin quickly. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Kukui Nut oil keeps my skin moist in the Southern California dry climate.  I have used more expensive brands, but have found Alba to work perfectly.</li>
