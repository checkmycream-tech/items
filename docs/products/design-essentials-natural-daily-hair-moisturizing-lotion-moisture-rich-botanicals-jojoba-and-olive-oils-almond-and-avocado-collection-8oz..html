            <li>Smells great, but the texture and consistency of this product is a turn off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also great for removing braids, it makes the hair moist so that the residue created by braids is combed out without losing a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This product is the best daily moisterizing product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products before stumbling onto Design Essentials.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 months and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I thought it was okay, but for that price, I feel like it needs to be more than that.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>It is very slimy and has great slip</li>
            <li>so I thought I would love it, but after putting it on I noticed at my hair did not feel mousiest all and</li>
            <li>, I know that ,any people love this product, it just did nothing for my 3c or my daughters 4a curls.</li>
            <li>I bought this to moisturize my daughter&#x27;s hair, but tried it one day for my wash and go and love it.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful hair grooming product for moisturizing long or short hair -- especially good</li>
            <li>It would be a great product, but the smell is much too strong.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>This product works best for both looks and does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>I hope my review helps and good luck to all my natural sisters.</li>
            <li>Stumbled on this product and WOW!!!!!!.</li>
            <li>figure it out YET), the texture is rich and silky and the way your hair will feel after an application...</li>
            <li>and my next step is to buy the shampoo and conditioner because if it works that well on its own using it as a system should yield even better results.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product because honestly it is the only one that works for me.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped to keep my hair hydrated and healthy looking without the tackiness that some glycerin based products have a tendency to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now she absolutely loves this product and asked me to buy her more of it.</li>
            <li>For 4A/4B/4C  people out there you really do deserve better.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for all curlies/naturals!!!</li>
            <li>It is pricey but very much worth it</li>
            <li>love this product leave hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am a huge product junkie and I and my daughter both have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>My advise find a product that moistures your hair the first time.</li>
            <li>Who wants that on their hair?</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural on the weekends and am having fun with wigs during the work week.  </li>
            <li>I used it once, and thought my hair shrunk too much, so I gave to my mom.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very sticky</li>
            <li>I also use a light essential oil to seal in this moisturizer after applying it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to people with curly to kinky locks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it does not seem to work, try using a little more and really work it through your entire head from your scalp to the tip of your hair strands.  </li>
            <li>a try, you will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Know that there are other companies out there that make even better products but don&#x27;t have the big marketing budgets to solicit their products at salons.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair in a small fro most of the time and a two strand twist natural styling sometimes.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and leaves my natural hair soft, which allows my natural curls to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my natural curls snap and glow.</li>
            <li>I did not know it was for natural hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for three days and my hair has NEVER been so soft since going natural in August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every day on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>if you keep your hair hair natural.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>Went natural three years ago.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>(The first time I used it was on dry hair.)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair color look rich and my hair is shiny without being heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>It is a decent moisturizer for natural hair, but it can be a bit heavy/greasy, so if you have fine or thin hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Frizz was a major consideration.</li>
            <li>I tried several other products but this really moisturizes, defines and elongates my curls used alone.  </li>
            <li>Having sensitive dry skin, this product keeps my scalp and hair moisterized without causing my hair and face to become greasy.  </li>
            <li>It has grown in fast and thick and is soft again!  </li>

            <li> My 4 c hair is soft and manageable now and it doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down in the process.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair a little moisturized then dry&#x27;s up a couple hours later.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair dry.</li>
            <li> Reading previous reviews reminds me that hair product is not the same for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Only takes a little.  </li>
            <li> Doe not really moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and literally wasted 100s of dollars on products trying to find one that I can put on daily that keeps my hair moisturized throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works for my thick, coarse, colored hair (teenie weenie afro)!  </li>
            <li> (major breakage and thinning when my hair has always been thick).  </li>
            <li> Extremely sticky and gooey.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it because I spent so much money on it, but unfortunately that was not the case.</li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of the curl activator I grew up with when I whore a Jerry Curl back in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to wet my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I like this product even less than before.</li>
            <li> I suggets if you get this product and use just a little</li>
            <li> And my hair still hasn&#x27;t dried the morning after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my everyday use.</li>
            <li> and you do not have to use them everyday to see the results.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and my biggest problem has been extreme dryness, this product solved my problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I spent so much money on this.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday keeps my hair moisturized always!</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m afraid of is how I&#x27;m  going to care for my hair when it grows to a preferred length by summer&#x27;s end.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, but that works for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My son has a very difficult hair to manage and keep mosturized,he has used several products with no results.</li>
            <li> not happy with this product - would not recommend to friends or relatives - leaves hair sticky and gooey feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because this product is rather expensive.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for delivery so I purchased a bottle at a beauty supply. I am so glad I did. It makes my natural curls snap and glow. My afro looks and feels great. I am ready to face winter when my hair tends to look dry and dusty like a Brillo pad no matter how much moisturizer I would use. My hair seems to absorb this product. It makes my hair color look rich and my hair is shiny without being heavy and greasy. I saw it demonstrated on YouTube and knew I had to have it. I am so glad I did. I highly recommend this product to people with curly to kinky locks. I am very pleased. I think I  stick with it for now.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This product is the best daily moisterizing product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Having sensitive dry skin, this product keeps my scalp and hair moisterized without causing my hair and face to become greasy.  I have used many products before stumbling onto Design Essentials.  I have to say I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> i like this moisturizer</li>
            <li> I heard great thing about this product and decided to give it a try.  Smells great, but the texture and consistency of this product is a turn off.  Left my hands sticky and gooey feeling.  Who wants that on their hair?</li>
            <li> I did not know it was for natural hair. I thought it was a moisturizer.  Doe not really moisturize.  Leaves hair dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 months and love it. Reading previous reviews reminds me that hair product is not the same for all hair types. I have been searching for years for ANYTHING that gives my hair moisture and this one does the trick. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out after years of relaxing, coloring and flat ironing it every day (major breakage and thinning when my hair has always been thick).  It has grown in fast and thick and is soft again!  I wear my hair natural on the weekends and am having fun with wigs during the work week.  The only thing I&#x27;m afraid of is how I&#x27;m  going to care for my hair when it grows to a preferred length by summer&#x27;s end.  Good luck to everyone!</li>

Design Essentials is a must, I love it!</li>
            <li> Extremely sticky and gooey. And doesn&#x27;t seem to actually hydrate my hair. It just traps any moisture that might exist in it through its layers of buildup. Smells good, but otherwise not at all impressed.</li>
            <li> i used this product on my hair and it did not take a lot to moisturize my hair.  I love the way this product made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have ordered this product.  It has really helped to keep my hair hydrated and healthy looking without the tackiness that some glycerin based products have a tendency to do.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for removing braids, it makes the hair moist so that the residue created by braids is combed out without losing a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Softens my hair without making it feel too greasy. Only takes a little.  I have a perm and use it close to re-perm time because I needed something to soften my edges.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay, but for that price, I feel like it needs to be more than that. I used it once, and thought my hair shrunk too much, so I gave to my mom. Now she absolutely loves this product and asked me to buy her more of it. I won&#x27;t be buying it for myself, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re both naturals with type 4 hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I used this product a second time after washing my hair. (The first time I used it was on dry hair.) I like this product even less than before. It is sticky and filmy. I can feel it on my hair. And my hair still hasn&#x27;t dried the morning after I&#x27;ve used it. I think this is because there is coco butter in it. I definitely will not try it for the third time. I&#x27;m disappointed because this product is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a decent moisturizer for natural hair, but it can be a bit heavy/greasy, so if you have fine or thin hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> love this product leave hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my 4c hair. Does not require to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my everyday use. Using this allows me to redo my twistouts and braidouts every night. With this product I can keep my style all week.</li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of the curl activator I grew up with when I whore a Jerry Curl back in the late 80&#x27;s. It leaves your hair moistured but the next day your hair is a brillo pad. My advise find a product that moistures your hair the first time. For 4A/4B/4C  people out there you really do deserve better. Know that there are products out there that leave your hair truly moisturized and you do not have to use them everyday to see the results. Design Essentials does a great job in pushing their  products on to stylist so that they recommend them to you. Know that there are other companies out there that make even better products but don&#x27;t have the big marketing budgets to solicit their products at salons.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I have thick curly hair and my biggest problem has been extreme dryness, this product solved my problem.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday keeps my hair moisturized always!</li>
            <li> I am a huge product junkie and I and my daughter both have naturally curly hair. It is very slimy and has great slip so I thought I would love it, but after putting it on I noticed at my hair did not feel mousiest all and neither did my daughters, I know that ,any people love this product, it just did nothing for my 3c or my daughters 4a curls.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product - RUN, DO NOT WALK - to you nearest salon and purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for three days and my hair has NEVER been so soft since going natural in August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful (I just put some in my hair and I was trying to figure out what the smell reminded me of...can&#x27;t figure it out YET), the texture is rich and silky and the way your hair will feel after an application...you will not believe the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for all curlies/naturals!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it because I spent so much money on it, but unfortunately that was not the case. This left my hair a little moisturized then dry&#x27;s up a couple hours later. I already have an amazing leave in but I wanted something lighter and I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews about this leave in. Also it does not add slip, it&#x27;s very sticky if anything. I do enjoy the smell. I&#x27;m disappointed because I spent so much money on this.</li>
            <li> not happy with this product - would not recommend to friends or relatives - leaves hair sticky and gooey feeling</li>
            <li> Does a great job moisturizing my locks without making them sticky.</li>
            <li> was introducded to this at a salon. but they were out and told me it was cheaper online so I orederd it and LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to moisturize my daughter&#x27;s hair, but tried it one day for my wash and go and love it.  I use it every day on my natural hair.  It moisturizes and leaves my natural hair soft, which allows my natural curls to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for what I intended, but I&#x27;ve found another use for it which is great.</li>
            <li> A wonderful hair grooming product for moisturizing long or short hair -- especially good if you keep your hair hair natural.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I have used this product for a couple of years. Used to get it from my hairdresser but she no longer has it and it is not a Sally&#x27;s.. I am just glad I can get it online! i use it everyday. It moisturizes hair, no flakes, no hold, no crunchiness - just perfect!</li>
            <li> Tried this for my granddaughters hair she loves it..</li>
            <li> Great product for my daughter&#x27;s hair!  Looked for it everywhere and was happy to find it.</li>
            <li> My son has a very difficult hair to manage and keep mosturized,he has used several products with no results.By luck I found this product  that was recommended by his stylist and it is the best. It gave instant results leaving the hair mosturized requiring only twice a week applications. We have been using it for about 8 months.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is thick, but that works for my hair.  I love the fact that it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Went natural three years ago. A lot of curly hair which challenged me. Frizz was a major consideration. Stumbled on this product and WOW!!!!!!. Don&#x27;t have to wet my hair everyday. Hair is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It would be a great product, but the smell is much too strong.  I will not buy again until they come out with an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product because honestly it is the only one that works for me.  I have tried everything and literally wasted 100s of dollars on products trying to find one that I can put on daily that keeps my hair moisturized throughout the day.  THIS WORKS.  My curls have never been so hydrated and looked so good.  I wear my hair in a small fro most of the time and a two strand twist natural styling sometimes.  This product works best for both looks and does not weigh my hair down and it smells wonderful.  I suggets if you get this product and use just a little and it does not seem to work, try using a little more and really work it through your entire head from your scalp to the tip of your hair strands.  I also use a light essential oil to seal in this moisturizer after applying it.  I hope my review helps and good luck to all my natural sisters.</li>
