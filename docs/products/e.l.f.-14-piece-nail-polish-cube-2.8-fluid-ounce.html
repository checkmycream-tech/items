            <li>The colors are great, and the cube is so cute!</li>
            <li>Loved by all that received the set.  </li>

            <li>I just wanted a good variety.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>They are really nice.</li>
            <li>The formula is nice.</li>
            <li>All worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>I am super happy with all of these polishes.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors</li>
            <li>but there are so many colors.</li>
            <li>No crazy color which is good for me.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and what an awesome price for such a wide selection.  </li>
            <li>The colors apply even and thick, they are amazing and I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>The colors are great and the quality is as good if not better than OPI and Essie and lasts for days without a touchup.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I used nail remover to make it smooth</li>
            <li>Better off sticking to a higher quality polish like essi.</li>
            <li>The polish does seem to last fairly well.</li>
            <li>I finally found the brand I like, which surprisingly is AVON.</li>
            <li>There were several colors that I liked</li>
            <li>The colors are unique and the bottles are just the right size, not actually full size bottles but a good amount.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not in love with every single color in the set, I really like most of them.  </li>
            <li>very nice colors in small bottles</li>
            <li>I will try a different brand next time, but the colors are very nice.</li>
            <li>Like we all really use up all the nail polish in a bottle!</li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife and she liked them, however the polish is not very durable.</li>
            <li>The colors did not come out quite as pretty as I thought they would</li>
            <li>I love all of the different nail polishes in here.</li>
            <li>Colors were pretty but some of them looked like used ones.</li>
            <li>These colors are great, even though the the bottles are a little smaller.</li>
            <li>Product came in as promised and was all intact with no broken bottles.</li>
            <li>much resistent</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t decide which set to get because one is too bright while the other is too dark.</li>
            <li>It comes off a little to easy.</li>
            <li>I like smaller nail polish bottles because I never manage to use a whole regular-sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It was a lot of nice different colors, mostly common colors you can use to work to to go out.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than normal size</li>
            <li>The bottles are not full-size but are large enough for several uses.</li>
            <li>They are dry and very sticky.</li>
            <li>We all like the colors, and that is safe for even the littlest piggies , but the bottles are very easily broken, several have broke from just putting the lid back on and twisting it.  </li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide which set to get because one is too bright while the other is too dark. I chose the dark set because of the purple. The colors come out way darker than they look in the bottle. The bottles are so tiny that they are hard to handle once you get one hand done. The polish only lasts about a day before it starts chipping everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a great value! The bottles are not full-size but are large enough for several uses. The colors are great and the quality is as good if not better than OPI and Essie and lasts for days without a touchup.</li>

            <li> beautiful colors.. very nice packaging and bottling.  would recommend and re-purchase</li>

            <li> There were several colors that I liked but I didn&#x27;t know the bottles were so small.  I should have read the small print.  Good quality nail polish but I will not be ordering this size anymore.</li>

            <li> I just wanted a good variety. The colors are great. Size is small but sufficient. The dry time is average. Lovvvvve the sparkly ones. Very happy.</li>

            <li> very nice colors in small bottles&lt;br /&gt;not much resistent though, after two days you have to remove them and put on again</li>
            <li> These colors are great, even though the the bottles are a little smaller. These are an excellent collection for the price.</li>
            <li> I love all of the different nail polishes in here. They look great on my nails. All worth the money!!!😃</li>
            <li> Small bottles but for a $1 each it&#x27;s really good. The formula is nice. e.l.f. is a great affordable brand for all things beauty</li>
            <li> I got it a week after the promised date. Colors were pretty but some of them looked like used ones. They are dry and very sticky. I used nail remover to make it smooth but it didn&#x27;t work. I will still use them cuz my hubby bought for me.</li>
