            <li>so if your looking for an upgrade with out spending alot of money this is a good product.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE I HAD</li>
            <li>Vivace flatiron in 2012 and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVED the H2pro</li>
            <li>It provides the perfect amount of heat and curls after the first touch!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight, has an on-off button, a two-prong plug (instead of a box-type plastic plug that can easily break if dropped) and does an excellent job of safely straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am just in love with it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to replace this unit after its falling off the counter one too many times!  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars it would have been nice if it came with a storage protected bag</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>great temperature gauge heats up quickly did I say I love it</li>
            <li>I spend hours at beauty supply stores looking for the right tools and hair products so you can imagine how it feels to finally be so happy with one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it</li>
            <li>I use these irons comfortably at 450 degrees and my hair looks so healthy!</li>
            <li>Love it it heats up fast does a great job</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and feel like it does not do the best</li>
            <li>Love them...</li>
            <li>I bought it because I had used my cousin&#x27;s and fell in love.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this one, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>but I LOVE this straightener.</li>

            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It made my hair extremely smooth and shiney!</li>
            <li>Comparable or better than my nano CHI which the ceramic plates have started peeling off after almost 5 years of use.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair silky and smooth without any frizz!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used and will not switch to a different brand again!</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN STORE BOUGHT</li>

            <li>This is a great flat iron and a nice upgrade for me it has a dial to control the temperature which I love.</li>
            <li>Our hair was smooth, shiny, light and did I mention shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair looked incredible when I left the salon, but the cost was too hefty to keep going every week.  </li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s thicker and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have use much product to get a nice sheen.  </li>

            <li>I received it quickly and there were no issues with it.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, has a dial that allows me to set the temperature, is non-stick and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and has rounded edges so that I can also use it to curl.</li>

            <li>I good cowash, air/blow dry, and</li>
            <li>First time using this brand, it exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>Before purchasing this iron,  I visited a prominent hair salon that specializes in natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Try it, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If you want a flat iron that will not only keep your hair healthy while making it look good</li>
            <li>this flat iron is amazing..</li>
            <li>usually I don&#x27;t flat iron my own hair every Friday for 22 years</li>
            <li>I own a H2pro 1/2 inch and promised self once my hair grew out I would purchase a wider H2pro flat iron.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I have been looking for the right hair tools for years.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t NEED it right away</li>
            <li>Bought this flat iron early in December, and immediately within my first use I notice a great difference.</li>
            <li>It straightens our hair very quickly and leaves it very shiny and feeling very silky.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron can be relied upon to do the job well, quickly, and safely.</li>
            <li>I have had many different types of flat irons (Conair, CHI, the unnamed kind from the mall kiosks, etc)</li>
            <li>I could not be happier, leaves my hair super straight, shiny, and NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li>Curls straightens love it gotta get a back up worth every penny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the 1-inch H2Pro Vivace for a little over a week, and so far I am very happy with the flat iron, especially with my gorgeous hair after using it.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all.</li>
            <li>My old flat iron never gave any type of smell and it cant be good for your health to inhale that.  </li>
            <li>Also, being a professional hairstylist, I value a warranty as highly important.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that it does not pull or snag my hair and love the temperature controls.</li>
            <li>First off it was made in Korea...</li>
            <li>Gold n Hot (gold n not), etc.</li>
            <li>When using this flatiron, there was a funny smell coming from the iron.  </li>
            <li>My  hair doesnt frizz after 2 days in the hot humidity in Louisiana, so its like a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li>: I bought my first H2Pro</li>
            <li>I REALLY DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE REVIEWS!</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair better than any flat iron I ever used, on the first swipe.  </li>
            <li>I love the  h2pro flat iron.</li>
            <li>Many flat irons can&#x27;t do the job.  </li>

            <li>I was pleased with this flat iron.  </li>

            <li>My favorite flat irons!</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and it stays hot.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to curl or flat iron.</li>
            <li>This product straightened my hair very well...</li>
            <li>I waited until tonight to open it and it looked so cheap.</li>
            <li>The floating plates did not float how a real H2Pro of FHI would</li>
            <li>,I really hope that won&#x27;t happen to mine,</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is now day 4 and my hair is still straight.</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair shiny and as straight as these.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair &amp; this iron</li>
            <li>got my hair bone straight with lot&#x27;s of shine.</li>
            <li>My whole house smelled like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the h2 pro</li>
            <li>It even rolled with me when I was not so gentle with it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight for days without needing to retouch pieces.</li>
            <li>Since I lead a VERY busy life, I certainly wish I&#x27;d had this one sooner!</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons for flat ironing African American permed hair.</li>
            <li>Compared to my older Ceramic Ion model, the Vivace gets hotter, has a longer 9-foot swivel cord, and I really like the variable temperature dial</li>
            <li>it works exactly like my old one, I will always be a H2PRO customer.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast; it arrived from New York to Michigan within three business days.</li>
            <li>less heat is always better</li>
            <li>However, the product I received from the 3rd party Amazon seller, Quick E Stop, was a counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always gets my hair bone straight with no excessive heat or damage.</li>
            <li>It felt significantly lighter in my hand and the power cord was not the same quality as the one I bought nearly 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>this H2PRO FLAT irone heats  up quickly within seconds</li>
            <li>The plastic made a hollow sound when you tapped on it #3.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and very kinky.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair professionally straight and soft.  </li>
            <li>But save yourself the hassle and be careful when purchasing this online, you may not get the genuine article.</li>
            <li>These flat irons were worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and very thick and it works great with it, i would just maybe like to get the bigger one</li>
            <li>Yes, its costs a bit more than the $25 flat irons I usually buy, but its worth every dime</li>
            <li>I received my package today and was so excited because I got it a day early 12/22 (expected delivery was 12/23)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this flat iron much.</li>
            <li>Versus higher heat setting and 2-3 passes with the same results.</li>
            <li>Visit their facebook page for more helpful tips if you&#x27;re not sure about purchasing one or not:</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>first clue was that not only did the product not match what was pictured on the Amazon website, but it did not match the picture on the box when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron does EXACTLY</li>
            <li>(Note: the red light blinks when the flat iron reaches the chosen temperature, apparently).</li>
            <li>my hair texture is soft &amp; because of the highlights</li>
            <li>It gets the hair straight and silky in a very short time frame.</li>
            <li>I have natural African-American hair</li>
            <li>the only thing I was concern about was the light blinking but a friend of mine have the same irons and told me that hers do the same thing.</li>
            <li>None of them worked nearly as well as the H2Pro.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;If wanting a professional look</li>
            <li>I have purchased these twice so far and will buy again.</li>
            <li>My hair was consistently soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and it makes my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>The seller, who had more than one site name, was accused on multiple occasions of selling irons that would stop working within a few months.  </li>
            <li>I love the red and black look of this straightener too, reminds me of red-bottoms!</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many flat irons from cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li>After using this flat iron, my hair was so straight and silky.</li>
            <li>im a hairdresser and this flat iron works really well</li>
            <li>I owned 2  cortex platinum flat irons prior to buying this one and they left my hair silky and full of life.</li>
            <li>But then I took my 14 year old daughter to get her natural hair flat ironed for her 8th grade luncheon in May</li>
            <li>The plates close completely flat, which make my hair straight with only one pass through.  </li>
            <li>It barely heated up, even when set to 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li>I love this iron, however, I did not want the one sold on here because of the poor reviews on the seller and the fact that the warranty was voided if purchased on the internet.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, we couldn&#x27;t wait till it came so we could use it and make sure the beautician didn&#x27;t have some secret product she used</li>
            <li>I like a little bit of curl at my ends &amp; that temperature is just right</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair and it takes a lot to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I  have been transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural for the last 8 months and finally trimmed the last relaxed ends.  </li>
            <li>It straightens my hair so much faster than any other straightener!</li>
            <li>I blow dry then straighten, it also lleaves a sheen naturally on your hair.  </li>
            <li>After using this flat iron for about 4 months I went to tj maxx and bought another cortex flat iron and gave this one to my 12 year old cousin.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed with the results and prices of other flat irons currently available in my local stores, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find this H2Pro in the $60 price range on Amazon.</li>

            <li> It always leaves my hair silky and smooth without any frizz!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used and will not switch to a different brand again!</li>

            <li> First time using this brand, it exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li> Before purchasing this iron,  I visited a prominent hair salon that specializes in natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Try it, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you want a flat iron that will not only keep your hair healthy while making it look good</li>
            <li> this flat iron is amazing..</li>
            <li> usually I don&#x27;t flat iron my own hair every Friday for 22 years</li>
            <li> I own a H2pro 1/2 inch and promised self once my hair grew out I would purchase a wider H2pro flat iron.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I have been looking for the right hair tools for years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t NEED it right away</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron early in December, and immediately within my first use I notice a great difference.</li>
            <li> It straightens our hair very quickly and leaves it very shiny and feeling very silky.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron can be relied upon to do the job well, quickly, and safely.</li>
            <li> I have had many different types of flat irons (Conair, CHI, the unnamed kind from the mall kiosks, etc)</li>
            <li> I could not be happier, leaves my hair super straight, shiny, and NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> Curls straightens love it gotta get a back up worth every penny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 1-inch H2Pro Vivace for a little over a week, and so far I am very happy with the flat iron, especially with my gorgeous hair after using it.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron never gave any type of smell and it cant be good for your health to inhale that.  </li>
            <li> Also, being a professional hairstylist, I value a warranty as highly important.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that it does not pull or snag my hair and love the temperature controls.</li>
            <li> First off it was made in Korea...</li>
            <li> Gold n Hot (gold n not), etc.</li>
            <li> When using this flatiron, there was a funny smell coming from the iron.  </li>
            <li> My  hair doesnt frizz after 2 days in the hot humidity in Louisiana, so its like a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> : I bought my first H2Pro</li>
            <li> I REALLY DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE REVIEWS!</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair better than any flat iron I ever used, on the first swipe.  </li>
            <li> I love the  h2pro flat iron.</li>
            <li> Many flat irons can&#x27;t do the job.  </li>

            <li> I was pleased with this flat iron.  </li>

            <li> My favorite flat irons!</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and it stays hot.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair easy to curl or flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product straightened my hair very well...</li>
            <li> I waited until tonight to open it and it looked so cheap.</li>
            <li> The floating plates did not float how a real H2Pro of FHI would</li>
            <li> ,I really hope that won&#x27;t happen to mine,</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is now day 4 and my hair is still straight.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair shiny and as straight as these.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair &amp; this iron</li>
            <li> got my hair bone straight with lot&#x27;s of shine.</li>
            <li> My whole house smelled like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the h2 pro</li>
            <li> It even rolled with me when I was not so gentle with it.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair straight for days without needing to retouch pieces.</li>
            <li> Since I lead a VERY busy life, I certainly wish I&#x27;d had this one sooner!</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons for flat ironing African American permed hair.</li>
            <li> Compared to my older Ceramic Ion model, the Vivace gets hotter, has a longer 9-foot swivel cord, and I really like the variable temperature dial</li>
            <li> it works exactly like my old one, I will always be a H2PRO customer.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast; it arrived from New York to Michigan within three business days.</li>
            <li> less heat is always better</li>
            <li> However, the product I received from the 3rd party Amazon seller, Quick E Stop, was a counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always gets my hair bone straight with no excessive heat or damage.</li>
            <li> It felt significantly lighter in my hand and the power cord was not the same quality as the one I bought nearly 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> this H2PRO FLAT irone heats  up quickly within seconds</li>
            <li> The plastic made a hollow sound when you tapped on it #3.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and very kinky.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair professionally straight and soft.  </li>
            <li> But save yourself the hassle and be careful when purchasing this online, you may not get the genuine article.</li>
            <li> These flat irons were worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and very thick and it works great with it, i would just maybe like to get the bigger one</li>
            <li> Yes, its costs a bit more than the $25 flat irons I usually buy, but its worth every dime</li>
            <li> I received my package today and was so excited because I got it a day early 12/22 (expected delivery was 12/23)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this flat iron much.</li>
            <li> Versus higher heat setting and 2-3 passes with the same results.</li>
            <li> Visit their facebook page for more helpful tips if you&#x27;re not sure about purchasing one or not:</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> first clue was that not only did the product not match what was pictured on the Amazon website, but it did not match the picture on the box when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron does EXACTLY</li>
            <li> (Note: the red light blinks when the flat iron reaches the chosen temperature, apparently).</li>
            <li> my hair texture is soft &amp; because of the highlights</li>
            <li> It gets the hair straight and silky in a very short time frame.</li>
            <li> I have natural African-American hair</li>
            <li> the only thing I was concern about was the light blinking but a friend of mine have the same irons and told me that hers do the same thing.</li>
            <li> None of them worked nearly as well as the H2Pro.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;If wanting a professional look</li>
            <li> I have purchased these twice so far and will buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair was consistently soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and it makes my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> The seller, who had more than one site name, was accused on multiple occasions of selling irons that would stop working within a few months.  </li>
            <li> I love the red and black look of this straightener too, reminds me of red-bottoms!</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many flat irons from cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> After using this flat iron, my hair was so straight and silky.</li>
            <li> im a hairdresser and this flat iron works really well</li>
            <li> I owned 2  cortex platinum flat irons prior to buying this one and they left my hair silky and full of life.</li>
            <li> But then I took my 14 year old daughter to get her natural hair flat ironed for her 8th grade luncheon in May</li>
            <li> The plates close completely flat, which make my hair straight with only one pass through.  </li>
            <li> It barely heated up, even when set to 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I love this iron, however, I did not want the one sold on here because of the poor reviews on the seller and the fact that the warranty was voided if purchased on the internet.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, we couldn&#x27;t wait till it came so we could use it and make sure the beautician didn&#x27;t have some secret product she used</li>
            <li> I like a little bit of curl at my ends &amp; that temperature is just right</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair and it takes a lot to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I  have been transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural for the last 8 months and finally trimmed the last relaxed ends.  </li>
            <li> It straightens my hair so much faster than any other straightener!</li>
            <li> I blow dry then straighten, it also lleaves a sheen naturally on your hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this flat iron for about 4 months I went to tj maxx and bought another cortex flat iron and gave this one to my 12 year old cousin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the results and prices of other flat irons currently available in my local stores, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find this H2Pro in the $60 price range on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have owned several flat irons over the years, by various vendors, but NONE have worked like this one.  </li>
            <li> the next day I used my H2PRO FLAT IRON &amp; OF COURSE</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my second H2Pro flat iron, and I prefer this brand over others.</li>
            <li> , I have tried varies flat irons threw out the years</li>
            <li> A friend of mine owned a H2PRO FLAT IRON LIFE</li>
            <li> I like her H2PRO FLAT IRON.....</li>
            <li> I saw the flat iron the hair dresser was using and decided to order it.</li>
            <li> I cracked the plate on both of my cortex flat irons</li>
            <li> The difference I like with this flat iron, I can use lower heat setting and pass through my hair once.</li>
            <li> I was looking and looking for an upgrade to my flat iron and even asked girls on FB about what they use and advise.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works wonders!</li>
            <li> But this flat iron is everything I&#x27;ve wanted in a hair tool!</li>
            <li> and they fixed it and returned it to me in less than a week for 15.00.</li>
            <li> I am black with natural textured kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li> now I just set it to 370°, it leaves my hair silly smooth and so shiny.</li>
            <li> I will keep the other one for when I have occasional family guest over and want to borrow my flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial and have long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> cord is plenty long enough...unless you plan to have coffee at your neighbor&#x27;s house while the unit is plugged in at your house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually buy a new one every 1 1/2 to 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Compared to my other flat iron that I had for years, this flat iron gives my hair a silkier texture and gets my hair straighter.</li>
            <li> so much I unplugged the other after comparing the two small sections and continued w the H2pro.  </li>
            <li> promised I wash &amp; dry my hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron the other day</li>
            <li> However, numerous drops have finally caused the plates to loosen a tad along with excessive smoking.</li>
            <li> I even tried one of my other flat irons on one side that the H2pro on the other</li>
            <li> Not as durable as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have several flat irons (at least 4) and when I got my H2pro today I could not wait to wash my hair and try it out.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone to get this product from anywhere other than an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> I did my dc and roller set as usual, and then finally came the moment I had been waiting for.  </li>
            <li> My hair was poofy again before I could finish the other side.</li>
            <li> and well sadly it was time for a new flat iron</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extra delicate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how out of all these hair tools that are made to do the same thing can have such different results.</li>
            <li> less than 3 min</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a year and a half ago-the cord short-circuited, so I&#x27;m hesitant about repurchasing</li>
            <li> the larger of the two blew out on a recent trip to Europe (Germany) unfortunately on the day id arrived.</li>
            <li> but none the less</li>
            <li> but unfortunately she moved away a hour drive each way from where I live</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because it was cheaper than when I bought it from a hair show.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot extremely curly hair and this iron straightens my hair in a little less time than my previous iron (which wasn&#x27;t bad) and gets my hair much straighter and shinier.</li>
            <li> I barrow hers a few time to curl my hair</li>
            <li> I did read looks of reviews of not working after a few months tho</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> My older one from 2012 mentioned in my earlier review is STILL working... and the seller had the audacity to be appalled at my feedback.</li>
            <li> ( you know what mean, secret shampoo and conditioners in different bottles).</li>
            <li> I put my heat setting on 140 to 200 no more than that</li>
            <li> Be careful because if a flat iron that retails for $100 is sold for $50 it just might be a FAKE!</li>
            <li> and her hair came out so unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put a heat protectant on and it didn&#x27;t smell like burning hair; it was a very heavy metal smell.  </li>
            <li> The construction of the base of the iron is not the current, or even previous, design for H2Pro irons (pictures attached).  </li>
            <li> I can hardly put it in words!</li>
            <li> However, I do not have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> unhealthy looking hair</li>
            <li> I seriously would reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> THE WORST FLAT IRON EVER!!!</li>
            <li> it would not stay in an upright position, but rolled over on its side, which can be dangerous in a tool that heats to 450 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it it heats up fast does a great job</li>
            <li> I had my original H2PRO for over 9yrs and well sadly it was time for a new flat iron, it was not working like before, but I got alot of use out of it, I have tried varies flat irons threw out the years and no others could compare to H2PRO, so I thought I would give this one a try wanting to stay with the same company. I could not be happier, leaves my hair super straight, shiny, and NO FRIZZ. it works exactly like my old one, I will always be a H2PRO customer.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best flat iron I have ever had! It provides the perfect amount of heat and curls after the first touch! It doesn&#x27;t require you to constantly curl or iron in the same spot. I have had many different types of flat irons (Conair, CHI, the unnamed kind from the mall kiosks, etc) but none of them are as proficient as this one! I would definitely recommend this to whoever will listen!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I good cowash, air/blow dry, and the H2Pro does the rest! Salon results at home!! Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it. I received it quickly and there were no issues with it. I have coarse hair and feel like it does not do the best but that could also be my doing.</li>
            <li> Am a interracial Jamaican lady with a in between texture hair....  A friend of mine owned a H2PRO FLAT IRON LIFE VIVACE I barrow hers a few time to curl my hair usually I don&#x27;t flat iron my own hair every Friday for 22 years I use to go to my hairdresser for a wash &amp; curl but unfortunately she moved away a hour drive each way from where I live so it not convenient for me to go every week to get my hair done.....to my surprise I like her H2PRO FLAT IRON.....so of course I turned to amazon. Com to search for one &amp; I found it I read all the reviews so I ordered mine I got it on the date promised I wash &amp; dry my hair the next day I used my H2PRO FLAT IRON &amp; OF COURSE IT DELIVERED BEAUTIFUL SLEEK SHINY LOOKING HAIR have beautiful soft highlights throughout my hair my hair texture is soft &amp; because of the highlights it&#x27;s extra delicate I put my heat setting on 140 to 200 no more than that I like a little bit of curl at my ends &amp; that temperature is just right It goes up to 450 temperature but I grantee I will never use 450 temperature on my hair...this H2PRO FLAT irone heats  up quickly within seconds I will cherish it plus am saving  $55 a week plus  $20 tips from going to the hair dresser weekly ....the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars it would have been nice if it came with a storage protected bag......side note  if any of my sister&#x27;s looking to buy this H2PRO flat iron I would encourage you to get it the start to having a healthy looking head of hair is good diet drink lots of water to hydrate your scalp &amp; to prevent dryness....invest in high quality  tools invest in a good shampoo &amp; condishner if tools &amp; products are cheap you will get  unhealthy looking hair less heat is always better</li>
            <li> Love these! Always gets my hair bone straight with no excessive heat or damage.</li>
            <li> did straighten my hair well, but got use to it</li>
            <li> I love the  h2pro flat iron. It gets the hair straight and silky in a very short time frame. I have natural African-American hair and I don&#x27;t have use much product to get a nice sheen.  Also, it does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> Love them...the only thing I was concern about was the light blinking but a friend of mine have the same irons and told me that hers do the same thing. But no compliants here!</li>
            <li> I love this iron, however, I did not want the one sold on here because of the poor reviews on the seller and the fact that the warranty was voided if purchased on the internet.  The seller, who had more than one site name, was accused on multiple occasions of selling irons that would stop working within a few months.  Also, being a professional hairstylist, I value a warranty as highly important.  I went and purchased the iron, after having returned it to Amazon, from an authorized dealer, and am very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> This straightner is great! I bought it because I had used my cousin&#x27;s and fell in love. I have a lot extremely curly hair and this iron straightens my hair in a little less time than my previous iron (which wasn&#x27;t bad) and gets my hair much straighter and shinier. Like the product says, doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair at all which is great. I would recommend this for anyone any day.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  I had a corioliss for several years that died.  My stylist recommended this one, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.  I&#x27;m biracial and have long curly hair.  Many flat irons can&#x27;t do the job.  This flat iron works wonders!</li>
            <li> This product replaced a flat iron that I&#x27;d had for six years or more. Since I lead a VERY busy life, I certainly wish I&#x27;d had this one sooner! It&#x27;s a great time saver: one pass and you&#x27;re done. And I so appreciate the fast-heat feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be well constructed with various heat settings that allow you to select the best/safest temperature for your hair, thus eliminating the risk of hair damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight, has an on-off button, a two-prong plug (instead of a box-type plastic plug that can easily break if dropped) and does an excellent job of safely straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is plenty long enough...unless you plan to have coffee at your neighbor&#x27;s house while the unit is plugged in at your house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: As with all items of this nature, you&#x27;d be wise to use a hair product that protects from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: This flat iron can be relied upon to do the job well, quickly, and safely.</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron early in December, and immediately within my first use I notice a great difference. Compared to my other flat iron that I had for years, this flat iron gives my hair a silkier texture and gets my hair straighter. Love it! Bought my mom one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron and a nice upgrade for me it has a dial to control the temperature which I love. Its sgreat size for me its especially good for flt ironing small sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> This item do work perfect, start working with my hair and less than 3 min, i can see a big changes on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have non chemically processed African American kinky hair. This product straightened my hair very well...one to two passes after blow drying it out. However, I do not have very thick hair. I especially like that it does not pull or snag my hair and love the temperature controls.</li>
            <li> Seller did a great job. I bought this product about a year and a half ago-the cord short-circuited, so I&#x27;m hesitant about repurchasing but I LOVE this straightener. The fact that I&#x27;m repurchasing says A LOT.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone to get this product from anywhere other than an authorized seller. I received my package today and was so excited because I got it a day early 12/22 (expected delivery was 12/23) my birthday is 12/24. I waited until tonight to open it and it looked so cheap. First off it was made in Korea...red flag #1. There was a nick in one of the plates which exposed metal that shouldn&#x27;t be there if it were ceramic... red flag #2. The plastic made a hollow sound when you tapped on it #3. The floating plates did not float how a real H2Pro of FHI would #4. #5 the &amp;#34;ceramic plates&amp;#34; were not a shiny red like they should be. The kicker was in the paperwork you receive saying the warranty is not valid for H2Pro flatirons purchased on ebay or any unauthorized seller. The box paperwork looked authentic. I was fooled. Be careful because if a flat iron that retails for $100 is sold for $50 it just might be a FAKE! I have wrapped it back up to return the same day I received it. I will be dropping it off at UPS tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Buy this if you want a great flatiron that heats up fast and gives a long-lasting, smooth finish!</li>
            <li> These flat irons were worth the purchase. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4a hair. I have purchased so many flat irons from cheap to expensive. At one point I had about 7 flat irons in my bathroom cabinet from a Sedu that I thought was go to be the best because of the reviews,  a CHI (eh...), an Instyler (whatever), Gold n Hot (gold n not), etc. But then I took my 14 year old daughter to get her natural hair flat ironed for her 8th grade luncheon in May and her hair came out so unbelievable.  I saw the flat iron the hair dresser was using and decided to order it. BTW, my daughter has double the hair I have and it&#x27;s thicker and my hair is fine. Anyway, we couldn&#x27;t wait till it came so we could use it and make sure the beautician didn&#x27;t have some secret product she used ( you know what mean, secret shampoo and conditioners in different bottles). But this flat iron is everything I&#x27;ve wanted in a hair tool! Our hair was smooth, shiny, light and did I mention shiny! It&#x27;s crazy how out of all these hair tools that are made to do the same thing can have such different results. The H2Pro is now the staple in my home. I feel as if I have been looking for the right hair tools for years. I spend hours at beauty supply stores looking for the right tools and hair products so you can imagine how it feels to finally be so happy with one. Coupled with some awesome hair products I stumbled upon via YouTube and ordered here on amazon as well, I think I have found my dream team of hair products and tools. I am actually thinking of buying another one because sometimes I take it to work with me and my daughter goes nuts.</li>
            <li> this flat iron is amazing..I don&#x27;t have to set it to 450° like my last one  now I just set it to 370°, it leaves my hair silly smooth and so shiny. I did read looks of reviews of not working after a few months tho,I really hope that won&#x27;t happen to mine, if it does I will try to rate it tho a1 star.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this flat iron much. I am African American with natural hair. I owned 2  cortex platinum flat irons prior to buying this one and they left my hair silky and full of life. I cracked the plate on both of my cortex flat irons so i decided to try this brand. After using this flat iron for about 4 months I went to tj maxx and bought another cortex flat iron and gave this one to my 12 year old cousin.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, has a dial that allows me to set the temperature, is non-stick and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and has rounded edges so that I can also use it to curl.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is AMAZING! It straightened my hair in such a short time frame! It made my hair extremely smooth and shiney! I am just in love with it! It heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all. I&#x27;m so satifisfied with this straightener I can hardly put it in words! It straightens my hair so much faster than any other straightener! I&#x27;ve tried Conairs(ew), Babyliss, and Remington. None of them worked nearly as well as the H2Pro. I seriously would reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> The difference I like with this flat iron, I can use lower heat setting and pass through my hair once. Versus higher heat setting and 2-3 passes with the same results. It would have gotten 5 stars if the side emblem wouldn&#x27;t have came off when I opened the package exposing the screws. Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this iron on both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s.  It straightens our hair very quickly and leaves it very shiny and feeling very silky.  This is a great flat iron and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Before purchasing this iron,  I visited a prominent hair salon that specializes in natural hair.  My hair looked incredible when I left the salon, but the cost was too hefty to keep going every week.  So I thought that I would purchase the tools they use and do it myself.  This is the iron they used, and believe me, no one can tell that I have not been to the salon.</li>
            <li> I was looking and looking for an upgrade to my flat iron and even asked girls on FB about what they use and advise. No one mentioned this one but I went out on a limb to get it. I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and leg for one but I also didn&#x27;t want the cheapest either. I have had it for a few weeks now and I really like it. I heating dial is easy to read and use and dont adjust it&#x27;s self while your doing your hair. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so if your looking for an upgrade with out spending alot of money this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;* Shipping- well that is a different story. I didn&#x27;t NEED it right away but it was about 4 days before they even shipped it out so it took about 1.5 weeks to be delivered</li>
            <li> Not as durable as I expected.  Dropped it on the sink and now the plates do not line up correctly.</li>
            <li> This is a great Flat Iron, I also have the bigger one, love them both! the larger of the two blew out on a recent trip to Europe (Germany) unfortunately on the day id arrived. once I returned home, I called the warranty # and they fixed it and returned it to me in less than a week for 15.00. you wont find a better flat iron or better customer service.</li>
            <li> Buy from manufacturer or authorized seller</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price! Does not snag hair. Straightens in one pass. Comparable or better than my nano CHI which the ceramic plates have started peeling off after almost 5 years of use. I love the red and black look of this straightener too, reminds me of red-bottoms!</li>
            <li> Curls straightens love it gotta get a back up worth every penny great temperature gauge heats up quickly did I say I love it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! It always leaves my hair silky and smooth without any frizz! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used and will not switch to a different brand again! I have found my iron! Visit their facebook page for more helpful tips if you&#x27;re not sure about purchasing one or not: [...]</li>
            <li> TWO WORDS.....LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> LOVE the temperature control, love the red plates, heats up very very very fast, and straightens much better than my Chi. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons for flat ironing African American permed hair. I&#x27;m on my 2nd one. I usually buy a new one every 1 1/2 to 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> This iron actually stopped working some 9 months after I purchased it. I now wonder about its authenticity and if I can get a refund or store credit.</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE I HAD LIKE IT BEFORE&lt;br /&gt;BUT BETTER THAN STORE BOUGHT&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this flat iron.  I was a little nervous because it was cheaper than when I bought it from a hair show.  I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and very kinky. After using this flat iron, my hair was so straight and silky. It is now day 4 and my hair is still straight. It looks like I just stepped out of a salon. I had the GVP from Sally. I took it back. It did not make my hair shiny and as straight as these. I use these irons comfortably at 450 degrees and my hair looks so healthy! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair &amp; this iron got my hair bone straight with lot&#x27;s of shine. I would definitely recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> Everything is in mint condition, works like a charm,&lt;br /&gt;My package came on time, definitely recommend this&lt;br /&gt;If wanting a professional look</li>
            <li> My favorite flat irons! I have purchased these twice so far and will buy again.</li>
            <li> The baby liss is better....I got this one as a second option but no one compares the baby liss, is faster than this one</li>
            <li> Im loving it so far. Works great. I have a lot of hair and very thick and it works great with it, i would just maybe like to get the bigger one so i can finish even faster with my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron the other day and I was super excited to use it.  I&#x27;ve heard good reviews on this flat iron, but I also heard not to purchase from amazon/ebay but none the less I did anyway.  When using this flatiron, there was a funny smell coming from the iron.  I didn&#x27;t put a heat protectant on and it didn&#x27;t smell like burning hair; it was a very heavy metal smell.  My whole house smelled like it.  I might return it back to the seller.  My old flat iron never gave any type of smell and it cant be good for your health to inhale that.  It worked great...I have very thick curly hair and I think it came out alright, but I cant take the smell.</li>
            <li> LOve this product. Gets my hair really bone straight, and easily slides hair through, and nice grip. Will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does EXACTLY what is says it would do.  I have owned several flat irons over the years, by various vendors, but NONE have worked like this one.  It leaves my hair professionally straight and soft.  It heats up really fast and it stays hot.  The plates close completely flat, which make my hair straight with only one pass through.  I look forward to using this flat iron for many years to come.  I  have been transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural for the last 8 months and finally trimmed the last relaxed ends.  This makes my hair straight and healthy.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am happy that I bought it. I get a lot of compliments from my coworkers.</li>
            <li> this is my second time buying it and i love it even more..the heat setting is wonderful..im a hairdresser and this flat iron works really well</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair and it takes a lot to straighten my hair.  This product did not do it.  It barely heated up, even when set to 450 degrees.  Sorry, but I had to return it today.</li>
            <li> I love my h2pro. It has lived up to its standard. It gives a Great press and a great curl</li>
            <li> Even after a light workout my hair still stays straight! Yes, its costs a bit more than the $25 flat irons I usually buy, but its worth every dime</li>
            <li> I really like the h2 pro, I bought it about a month ago.  It straightens my hair better than any flat iron I ever used, on the first swipe.  I truly reccomend this to anyone.  I am black with natural textured kinky curly hair.  I blow dry then straighten, it also lleaves a sheen naturally on your hair.  My husband was amazed with the results.  My  hair doesnt frizz after 2 days in the hot humidity in Louisiana, so its like a miracle worker.  I use the red plated vivace.  Try it, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: This iron stopped heating after only 7 weeks.  My older one from 2012 mentioned in my earlier review is STILL working... and the seller had the audacity to be appalled at my feedback. Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: I bought my first H2Pro Vivace flatiron in 2012 and LOVED it.  My hair was consistently soft and silky.  It even rolled with me when I was not so gentle with it.  I was hoping to replace this unit after its falling off the counter one too many times!  However, the product I received from the 3rd party Amazon seller, Quick E Stop, was a counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first clue was that not only did the product not match what was pictured on the Amazon website, but it did not match the picture on the box when it arrived.  ALL H2Pro irons have a separate temperature control and on/off switch; the one I received had the temp control and power all in one.  The construction of the base of the iron is not the current, or even previous, design for H2Pro irons (pictures attached).  It felt significantly lighter in my hand and the power cord was not the same quality as the one I bought nearly 4 years ago.  The kicker for me was when I sat it on the counter it would not stay in an upright position, but rolled over on its side, which can be dangerous in a tool that heats to 450 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was great about it, though.  But save yourself the hassle and be careful when purchasing this online, you may not get the genuine article.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. I&#x27;m natural and it makes my hair soft and shiney. If you want a flat iron that will not only keep your hair healthy while making it look good this is a good flat iron for the job.</li>
            <li> H2pro is a favorite of mine. I own a H2pro 1/2 inch and promised self once my hair grew out I would purchase a wider H2pro flat iron. A stylist recommended this name brand to me. It makes my hair easy to curl or flat iron.</li>
            <li> Saves me trips to the salon</li>
            <li> First time using this brand, it exceeded my expectations!  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on my the last time I got it cut and I absolutely love it. It keeps my hair straight for days without needing to retouch pieces.</li>
            <li> I have several flat irons (at least 4) and when I got my H2pro today I could not wait to wash my hair and try it out.  I did my dc and roller set as usual, and then finally came the moment I had been waiting for.  I even tried one of my other flat irons on one side that the H2pro on the other and I LOVED the H2pro so much I unplugged the other after comparing the two small sections and continued w the H2pro.  My hair is beautiful I&#x27;m so happy with the results.  I will keep the other one for when I have occasional family guest over and want to borrow my flat iron lol aint no one using my H2pro.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 1-inch H2Pro Vivace for a little over a week, and so far I am very happy with the flat iron, especially with my gorgeous hair after using it. Shipping was fast; it arrived from New York to Michigan within three business days. And I like the packaging, which is great for storing the product when traveling or not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second H2Pro flat iron, and I prefer this brand over others. Eight years ago, I purchased the 1.25-inch H2Pro Ceramic Ion Styling Iron on sale for $55 from my local beauty supply store, and it still works. However, numerous drops have finally caused the plates to loosen a tad along with excessive smoking. I was disappointed with the results and prices of other flat irons currently available in my local stores, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find this H2Pro in the $60 price range on Amazon. Compared to my older Ceramic Ion model, the Vivace gets hotter, has a longer 9-foot swivel cord, and I really like the variable temperature dial (Note: the red light blinks when the flat iron reaches the chosen temperature, apparently). Also, the 1-inch plate size seems ideal for my desired hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the non-warranty situation, although at this price, not having a one year warranty isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY...I REALLY DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE REVIEWS! I OPEN THE PACKAGE WEEKS LATER AFTER IT&#x27;S ARRIVAL AND THE H2PRO SIGN FELL OFF ON THE SIDE AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN DROPPED...PLUS IT DID MY HAIR NO JUSTICE. THE WORST FLAT IRON EVER!!!</li>
            <li> The product does straighten my hair. My hair was poofy again before I could finish the other side. Will keep trying.</li>
