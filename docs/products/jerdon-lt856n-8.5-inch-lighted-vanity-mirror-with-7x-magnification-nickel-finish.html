            <li>It fits on the vanity nicely and gives a great view for the wife to put on her makeup.</li>
            <li>There was a Jerdon lighted vanity mirror in my hotel room in Japan in May 2013; it was a perfect fit for my needs and use.  </li>
            <li>I have a fairly dim-lit room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great vanity top mirror.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We both LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Nicely made, good quality and attractive but doesn&#x27;t produce much light.</li>
            <li>I liked the mirrow, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The finish and quality are nice.</li>
            <li>I own one and bought one for a friend.  </li>
            <li>The light on it wasn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS JUST FINE!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it and wished I had purchased it sooner.  </li>
            <li>This is almost perfect, the only think that would improve it</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>(lol it will show you what your skin really looks like).</li>
            <li>I was initially pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>She likes the magnification on this one more than others.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is very nice looking, but I find the light to not be bright enough.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be helped, so I thought if the mirror had more magnification and had light I would be kinder to my face.</li>
            <li>The mirror works better without the light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already pretty bright, but it doesn&#x27;t cast a lot of light on my face, which I needed-</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good seller.</li>
            <li>Both mirrors provide excellent images and it is easy to switch from one to the other.  </li>
            <li>I gave four because the light is not quite bright, but there are all the features of the high quality mirror.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use my reading glasses to get those fine eyebrow airs.  </li>
            <li>I think it will work fine for me anyway.</li>
            <li>I will say, the return process was smooth and quick, no questions and free return shipping!</li>
            <li>Checked the light bulb by screwing in another lamp and it worked fine</li>
            <li>MY LIGHT SWITCH DID NOT WORK</li>
            <li>is if the light strength was adjustable to stronger setting.  </li>
            <li>all three had defective light switches.</li>
            <li>The light switch everyone comments on is user error.</li>
            <li>The mirror lights up, but you&#x27;re going to need background light as well.</li>
            <li>Just wish the light was brighter and even adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I still have to turn on my overhead light to use it.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I originally brought it for myself</li>
            <li>This was such a good buy.</li>
            <li>Okay.... next time I will pay more attention to the customer reviews.</li>
            <li>in the computer and getting it taken care of quickly.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully in helping me clean-up a few wayward hairs that grow on my face, nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>get kind of a light headache when I stay too long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bright as I was hoping for, but after doing some research, it seems people have that complaint about most vanity mirrors on the market.</li>
            <li>Other than having to exchange the first one ordered as non-working, this has been a good mirror for the wife.  </li>
            <li>Despite the mirror looking pleasant and everything working as it should, I felt the light was a little too dim and the magnifying mirror was not 7x as claimed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The quality is a lot better than products we found locally.</li>
            <li>The magnified side will startle you the first time, but I have come to rely on it.  </li>
            <li>While Amazon did not carry the exact model, the one that I did purchase is a pretty close match with the one in Japan.  </li>
            <li>neither the magnification nor lighting are strong enough for finding hairs to remove, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a year and everything&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li>THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE LIGHT SWITCH .</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>One thing to note, if you&#x27;re not into a yellow cast from the light, then this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about it</li>
            <li>Well made and like the fact the provide extra light bulb.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>Some had too much magnification.  </li>
            <li>I really like this vanity mirror.</li>
            <li>It seemed nice enough and was plenty big in size, but did not meet my needs.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it better than the other brand she had that I knocked over and broke.</li>
            <li>HOPE THIS HELPS OTHER REVIEWERS.... :)</li>
            <li>SO THEY SENT ME OUT A NEW ONE AND BEHOLD!</li>
            <li>This mirror is just like the kind that you would use at a 4 star hotel, the halo light is subtle but enough to see what your doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a mirror like this during a stay at a high class hotel and mentioned it to my daughter-in-law.  </li>
            <li>It could use a little more lighting/brightness, but what it does have will do.</li>
            <li>The lighted feature really makes the visibility clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mirror everyday for almost two years and still love it.</li>
            <li>but I think its normal.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be bothered to return it because I can see a little better due to the added light, however I would not recommend it to the aging eye at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it right away, until I read a review that said it was only 5x.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like white light since I find it hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not a small light-weight unit.  </li>
            <li>Clear, with no distortion.</li>
            <li>I receoived it in a timely marrer and had not trouble returning it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a nice product, a little larger than I needed.</li>
            <li>seeing everything so big loool ur eyes need to adjust just like when u get new view</li>
            <li>Magnification is fine but hard to see my face unless I turn on lots of additional room lighting.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I felt like my 5x magnifying mirror did not allow me to &#x27;pick&#x27; at my face without causing major damage and scarring.</li>
            <li>I got it because I really can&#x27;t see close up in the full mirror behind my dresser.  </li>
            <li>Light is not bright enough; very dim.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> seeing everything so big loool ur eyes need to adjust just like when u get new view</li>
            <li> Magnification is fine but hard to see my face unless I turn on lots of additional room lighting.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I felt like my 5x magnifying mirror did not allow me to &#x27;pick&#x27; at my face without causing major damage and scarring.</li>
            <li> I got it because I really can&#x27;t see close up in the full mirror behind my dresser.  </li>
            <li> Light is not bright enough; very dim.</li>
            <li> Just a little too dim.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the light didn&#x27;t function and the mirror had to be returned.</li>
            <li> My guess is the shading used on the rim of the light is the wrong color.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had the slightest problem with is that I expected the lighting to be brighter.</li>
            <li> After her rave reviews on how well it illumiates your face without blinding you with white spots I ordered one for my other daughter-in-law.  </li>
            <li> The brushed finish matches the other metals in my bedroom.  </li>
            <li> SO I DID A LITTLE DAMAGE CONTROL AND REALIZED TAKE THE METAL TURN KNOB OFF AND USE THE WHITE PLASTIC SWITCH AND WALLAH!</li>
            <li> Only thing that kept me from a  5 star was it is a little tall.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying an extra bulb when you purchase the mirror as I have found hard to find a replacement that has the same brightness.</li>
            <li> The lighted mirror lamp is very solid and downright heavy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely the switch that just spins until it intermittently clicks but still no light.</li>
            <li> it would be nice if mirrow swiveled on base</li>
            <li> Has held up extremely well..</li>
            <li> BUT LIKE OTHER REVIEWERS</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I left for vacation and came back to return this</li>
            <li> Only thing on the negative side is the actual mirror is a little small.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time.  </li>
            <li> product is dull and does not magnify as well as expected.</li>
            <li> And now that my eyesight isn&#x27;t what it used to be I ordered one for myself and now see what I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m past the 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for my wife for Christmas because of all the favorable reviews, but was very disappointed to find that the light switch was defective.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself has a wide view and the magnification side can be scary</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> For $70, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> (Terrible habit of mine I know!)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nicely made, good quality and attractive but doesn&#x27;t produce much light. Magnification is fine but hard to see my face unless I turn on lots of additional room lighting.  Sort of defeats the purpose of a lighted mirror.  Wish it were brighter!</li>
            <li> I used a mirror like this during a stay at a high class hotel and mentioned it to my daughter-in-law.  She said she had used one like it before and loved it.  So for her birthday I ordered this one for her.  After her rave reviews on how well it illumiates your face without blinding you with white spots I ordered one for my other daughter-in-law.  And now that my eyesight isn&#x27;t what it used to be I ordered one for myself and now see what I&#x27;ve been missing.  Yikes!</li>
            <li> The bulb burnt out the second I switched on the lamp. I replaced the bulb and then discovered that the on/off switch does not work. I will probably repair it myself to avoid the hassel of shipping it back. For $70, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it better than the other brand she had that I knocked over and broke.</li>
            <li> The lighted mirror lamp is very solid and downright heavy.  This is a plus if you are worried about knocking it over but it does takes some strength to move it from place to place.  Both mirrors provide excellent images and it is easy to switch from one to the other.  Unfortunately, the light didn&#x27;t function and the mirror had to be returned.</li>
            <li> product is dull and does not magnify as well as expected. it would be nice if mirrow swiveled on base</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I felt like my 5x magnifying mirror did not allow me to &#x27;pick&#x27; at my face without causing major damage and scarring. (Terrible habit of mine I know!) but I can&#x27;t be helped, so I thought if the mirror had more magnification and had light I would be kinder to my face. Despite the mirror looking pleasant and everything working as it should, I felt the light was a little too dim and the magnifying mirror was not 7x as claimed. I compared it to my 5x one and the magnification was identical. I can&#x27;t be bothered to return it because I can see a little better due to the added light, however I would not recommend it to the aging eye at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved this mirror.</li>
            <li> Vanity mirror is very attractive and is a wonderful vanity mirror.  I have enjoyed using it and wished I had purchased it sooner.  The lighted feature is excellent and it works well without the lights and the magnification is ideal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I&#x27;ve used this mirror everyday for almost two years and still love it. I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing my makeup without it. Has held up extremely well.. No complaints!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect size and quality.  Great vanity mirror. I originally brought it for myself but my daughter took it from me so I&#x27;m going to order another one.</li>
            <li> Okay.... next time I will pay more attention to the customer reviews. Checked the light bulb by screwing in another lamp and it worked fine so it&#x27;s definitely the switch that just spins until it intermittently clicks but still no light. Refund please.</li>
            <li> I liked the mirrow, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I receoived it in a timely marrer and had not trouble returning it.</li>
            <li> LIKE THE MIRROR BUT LIKE OTHER REVIEWERS MY LIGHT SWITCH DID NOT WORK SO THEY SENT ME OUT A NEW ONE AND BEHOLD! THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE LIGHT SWITCH . SO I DID A LITTLE DAMAGE CONTROL AND REALIZED TAKE THE METAL TURN KNOB OFF AND USE THE WHITE PLASTIC SWITCH AND WALLAH! IT WORKS JUST FINE! JERDON NEEDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM SO THEY WOULD GET A FIVE STAR RATING ON THIS ITEM. HOPE THIS HELPS OTHER REVIEWERS.... :)</li>
            <li> This is almost perfect, the only think that would improve it is if the light strength was adjustable to stronger setting.  Fast shipping, good seller. Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a gift and my sister loves it!</li>
            <li> This was such a good buy. Great product for the money. The quality is a lot better than products we found locally.</li>
            <li> Does the work&lt;br /&gt;Good light&lt;br /&gt;My make looks perfect after using it&lt;br /&gt;I get kind of a light headache when I stay too long but I think its normal. seeing everything so big loool ur eyes need to adjust just like when u get new view glasses.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;no regret i love it</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. The lights and magnification are both sufficient. The finish and quality are nice.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed. On and off switch did not work!  Sending it back!!</li>
            <li> The lighted feature really makes the visibility clear. Only thing that kept me from a  5 star was it is a little tall.</li>
            <li> Mirror is very nice looking, but I find the light to not be bright enough.  Just a little too dim.</li>
            <li> Mirror was not 7x magnified! I didn&#x27;t realize it right away, until I read a review that said it was only 5x. Then I said, oh that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t see as well with it. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice product, a little larger than I needed. I will say, the return process was smooth and quick, no questions and free return shipping! I like the process of getting a phone call immediately after entering the return info. in the computer and getting it taken care of quickly.</li>
            <li> The light on it wasn&#x27;t good for me. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Not a small light-weight unit.  It is good for makeup but neither the magnification nor lighting are strong enough for finding hairs to remove, etc.  I purchased it strictly as a makeup mirror and it meets my needs.</li>
            <li> The mirror works better without the light.  Overpriced.  My guess is the shading used on the rim of the light is the wrong color. Turning the light on makes the reflection worse.  I called the distributor and was told I would have to pay return shiping, but they would wave the restocking fee.  Not worth my time.  Will not do business again.</li>
            <li> Just what I expeceted</li>
            <li> This mirror is also priced at $49.99 at Ulta. I went there today and got it with my 20% off coupon ... so ladies, you can find this mirror for only $40 at Ulta!&lt;br /&gt;Very nice mirror, by the way! Love it!</li>
            <li> There was not enough magnification for my preference.  It seemed nice enough and was plenty big in size, but did not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for my wife for Christmas because of all the favorable reviews, but was very disappointed to find that the light switch was defective. In total, I had Amazon shipped me three of these mirrors and all three had defective light switches.</li>
            <li> The light switch everyone comments on is user error. Don&#x27;t push and turn.  You must pull on it and then turn clockwise. The key is not to push or rotate counterclockwise. The mirror itself has a wide view and the magnification side can be scary (lol it will show you what your skin really looks like). One thing to note, if you&#x27;re not into a yellow cast from the light, then this is not for you. I personally don&#x27;t like white light since I find it hurts my eyes. Some people may have issues the yellow that it projects, and it may take some getting used to since your makeup may look different to you under another lighting. It&#x27;s a great vanity top mirror. The mirror lights up, but you&#x27;re going to need background light as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it but wife loves it.  Well made and like the fact the provide extra light bulb.</li>
            <li> I own one and bought one for a friend.  We both LOVE it!  GREAT value for the price!</li>
            <li> I was initially pleased with this.  It seemed to be constructed well.  About a week later the switch stopped working. To make matters worse, I left for vacation and came back to return this and now I&#x27;m past the 30 days.  I guess that I have a pricey and defective mirror.  Very dissapointed.  I cannot even plead a case for a replacement because amazon&#x27;s site states they have had reports of problems and they are not offering this product at this time.  EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave four because the light is not quite bright, but there are all the features of the high quality mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just like the kind that you would use at a 4 star hotel, the halo light is subtle but enough to see what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;The nickel finish is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror before and when I broke it bought another. Has great lighting. I would suggest buying an extra bulb when you purchase the mirror as I have found hard to find a replacement that has the same brightness.</li>
            <li> Other than having to exchange the first one ordered as non-working, this has been a good mirror for the wife.  She likes the magnification on this one more than others.  Some had too much magnification.  It fits on the vanity nicely and gives a great view for the wife to put on her makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror.  I got it because I really can&#x27;t see close up in the full mirror behind my dresser.  I use it to apply makeup and check my skin for....you know.  The magnified side will startle you the first time, but I have come to rely on it.  don&#x27;t need to use my reading glasses to get those fine eyebrow airs.  The brushed finish matches the other metals in my bedroom.  Just wish the light was brighter and even adjustable.  I still have to turn on my overhead light to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bright as I was hoping for, but after doing some research, it seems people have that complaint about most vanity mirrors on the market. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a year and everything&#x27;s still working fine. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Clear, with no distortion. Only thing on the negative side is the actual mirror is a little small. I think it will work fine for me anyway.</li>
            <li> There was a Jerdon lighted vanity mirror in my hotel room in Japan in May 2013; it was a perfect fit for my needs and use.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back home in the States to purchase one.  While Amazon did not carry the exact model, the one that I did purchase is a pretty close match with the one in Japan.  It works beautifully in helping me clean-up a few wayward hairs that grow on my face, nose and ears.  It could use a little more lighting/brightness, but what it does have will do.</li>
            <li> Light is not bright enough; very dim.</li>
            <li> I really like this vanity mirror. The only thing I had the slightest problem with is that I expected the lighting to be brighter. It&#x27;s already pretty bright, but it doesn&#x27;t cast a lot of light on my face, which I needed- I have a fairly dim-lit room. Other than that, I like it.</li>
