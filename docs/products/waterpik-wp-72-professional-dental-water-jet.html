    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>According to my dentist, at my age of 60, my teeth and gums are in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>But let me tell you, I now understand why they all made those comments and can say with conviction, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT.I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ONE FOR SIX MONTHS</li>
            <li>but I find this product the best of the ones I tried.</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>Excellent job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Also excellent for strengthening your gums.</li>
            <li>Very happy with product.</li>
            <li>This is very good for getting stuff out between your teeth.</li>
            <li>They are a great product and do an excellent job,- when they work.</li>
            <li>I also experienced water leakage and no water pumping through.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The WaterPik is a great item</li>
            <li>Work(s/ed) great until it</li>
            <li>(Great service from Amaaon).</li>
            <li>does a great job for that</li>
            <li>But for me, this is as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Everyone in the house will know you are practicing good hygiene.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>, does a good job in cleaning out the mouth</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>You cannot really clean below the gum line without an oral irrigator and this model is superb at doing it.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered it and am very pleased with the unit</li>
            <li>It has proven ideal for keeping her teeth and braces free of food</li>
            <li>I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition!</li>
            <li>while not a substitute for flossing, the waterpik has its own benefits in cleaning around the gumlines.</li>
            <li>The waterpik arrived early and has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>My first dental water irrigator was a WaterPik and the operation was great.</li>
            <li>its easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT IT HAS BETTER CONNECTIONS ON THE HOSE.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The latest one leaks water</li>
            <li>Most unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further update, January 2014 -- Most of the time, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; refuses to emit any water for a minute or so after it&#x27;s switched on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Further update, January 2014 -- Most of the time, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; refuses to emit any water for a minute or so after it&#x27;s switched on.  </li>
            <li>The tub (water container) sits nicely on top of the unit.  </li>
            <li>one out of many, etc.</li>
            <li>Over all I am pleased with the water jet.</li>
            <li>With the waterpik and brushing my teeth are in better condition than in 1990.</li>
            <li>Used daily since May 2006 (now Nov 2010) and it has worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Ok, but all the appliances are not needed.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper model is better.</li>
            <li>See the tub up on top where the water goes?</li>
            <li>And my kids love it.</li>
            <li>or I put 1 cap full of my favorite mouth wash and fill it up  the rest of the way with warm water.</li>
            <li>If you are finicky you might want to look at the handheld model for use in the shower--but you might want not to have to go to shower just to clean your teeth either!</li>
            <li>Make sure it is on a secure part of your counter, not the edge.  </li>
            <li>I find that using this every day is very helpful for keeping my mouth in good health.</li>
            <li>The water pulses feel wonderful when the gums hurt from fitting and tightenings, and the water can get those little places that a tooth brush (electric or not) cannot reach.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s on full blast all the time! &lt;</li>
            <li>It is easy to use , just fill it up with water</li>
            <li>The hand device has switchs, etc., that make it easy to not spray the mirror (or the ceiling).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been 4 &amp; 1/2 and still going strong.</li>
            <li>It was working fine</li>
            <li>You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>But the device works just fine without that rubber insert.  </li>
            <li>But the device works just fine without that rubber insert.  </li>
            <li>I think it works fine and is relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job of doing that, and I stopped using it regularly.</li>
            <li>Bottom line--if you like the idea of being able to flush your gums, and you&#x27;re not too fussy, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It does however sound like a MAC Truck running in your bathroom - my wife thought something was flying apart.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For cleaning between the teeth it works as good as the old model.</li>
            <li>The pick is good  as far as power goes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>So over all, I love my new Waterpik :)</li>
            <li>The price was better than retail, unit works really well and is easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>I have decreased my dental visits because of good dental hygiene, and these units  contribute greatly.</li>
            <li>Despite the \\&quot;advice\\&quot; of the dental hygenist mentioned below, please do not use a diluted bleach solution to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have yet to figure out how to use it without having to clean the mirror and mop up the floor afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a clean feeling in your mouth that you have never felt before, use this product and mix the water 50-50 with mouth wash.      </li>
            <li>Your teeth AND your bathroom will stay clean this way.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never been as clean as they are now.  </li>
            <li>It helps clean up any residue food particles that my have escaped your brush and dental floss.</li>
            <li>I floss and jet clean my teeth every day.</li>
            <li>so I got this to keep em clean.</li>
            <li>On this new model, the jet head swaps out easily and is definitely much more user friendly.</li>
            <li>It cleans the teeth better than flossing but much quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li>Putting on the tips are easier and the clear water reservoir looks really nice.  </li>
            <li>There is also a pressure adjustment switch and you can build up to full power if you wish.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update, May 26, 2006 -- The WaterPik still works more or less, but it often refuses to emit any water at all and at its best produces a stream at only one or two of the pressure settings.</li>
            <li>The two well system, is very convient and the self storage of all the extra components is great.</li>
            <li>This new one worked okay for about six weeks before refusing to turn on.  </li>
            <li>However, like many others, since WaterPik pretty much has the market cornered, I ordered the WP-72.</li>
            <li>So far, it works fine, although  I might note that the original WaterPik was more compact and easier to manipulate than the new design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not tried the smaller enclosed reservior yet but it will be nice for using Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>water resevoir is sized nicely, so that I have just enough water to finish a session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue cleaning device works quite well.  </li>
            <li>(I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I&#x27;ll also have a towell ready in case</li>
            <li>Overall great price and value for a dental system that works better than expected</li>
            <li>Like many other reviews I have owned an older model for years and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance, but then the hose sprung a leak</li>
            <li>If you smile like the Joker and dont lean over the sink, your teeth will still be clean but you will be cleaning your mirror and counter top for the next 5 minutes.    </li>
            <li>older model, works fine, no problems.</li>
            <li>It cleans the gum OK, but perhaps a better constructed one can be found from some other company.</li>
            <li>Me and My husband have a bridge that needs to clean all the time certainly help us .</li>
            <li>This piece of junk of a water pic never worked right.</li>
            <li>I sent Amazon an email, they sent me the replacement right away.</li>
            <li>The main idea is to get pulsing jet of water to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because the water jet is not as strong as my old one.  </li>
            <li>a few days after I had my braces put on, and it is quite possibly the best dental contraption</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I suppose if one used a higher setting the water would run out and have to be refilled.</li>
            <li>If the motor goes out then that is a different issue, but I believe for the most part it is lack of priming the unit.  </li>
            <li>I consider myself to be very meticulous when it comes to dental hygiene, but even still, when I use the waterpik after I brush and floss, food and gunk comes out!  </li>
            <li>The first two were Conairs.</li>
            <li>If that is the case, be careful never to put even modestly warm water in the pick.</li>
            <li>I was mortified after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The first was purchased/delivered on Feb. 20/22.</li>
            <li>Flawed, yes, but still the best one out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine.</li>
            <li>The first unit lasted about six months.  </li>
            <li>also pretty noisy &lt;br</li>
            <li>But after the first use, I can deal with it.</li>
            <li>We chose this model version over the others as it comes with 2 reservoirs and many different pressure settings.</li>
            <li>It works well, better than my 10 year old model when it was new.</li>
            <li>The personal one is good enough and saves you money.</li>
            <li>The WaterPik was the key to finally receiving good reviews from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>The pulsating water does seem to do a decent job of cleaning if you can get good enough to apply it properly.  </li>
            <li>I must use the pik quickly after filling with water and pressing the connection or the water wants to come out too early, thus leaking.  </li>
            <li>Works very well to wash out around teeth.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t bother with a replacement, because I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>You are given several different heads, so the whole family can use the unit, and have their own waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The jet can be adjusted depending on how much pressure you desire.</li>
            <li>a real adventure try to go to their web site and get a real body...</li>
            <li>I really, really like the gum line pick, works very well.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>and i guess i really dont have anything to complain about</li>
            <li>The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and \\&quot;Piks\\&quot; up where brushing and flossing leave off.</li>
            <li>No one else wants to make them.</li>
            <li>I could tell my teeth were really much cleaner then with brushing, flossing and using mouth wash alone.</li>
            <li>this was very nice of them, but i was a little bit put out that the pump didnt have enough torque.</li>
            <li>Such a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Not very reliable if you can&#x27;t get more than six months out of a new product.</li>
            <li>The WaterPik name and reputation and past experience led me to an enthusiastic purchase of this item.</li>
            <li>It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor.</li>
            <li>So far it works just fine and has the advantage of being considerably smaller than the WP-60.  </li>
            <li>So far it works just fine and has the advantage of being considerably smaller than the WP-60.  </li>
            <li>The latest one was purchased earlier this week and after only 2 days of use, the motor has frozen up.</li>
            <li>I highly recomended this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for keeping the dentures at bay.</li>
            <li>but the high setting can make your gums bleed....</li>
            <li>I had an older waterpik that lasted for about 10 years but had to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a new one when I couldn&#x27;t get the old-style jet tips anymore</li>
            <li>The new unit does not feel as sturdy as the older model.</li>
            <li>Has made a real difference in my gums, and the sinus attachment has helped clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended using a Waterpik with a very dilute bleach solution to clear up some periodontal problems.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the unit when I got it, but the motor failed after about 6 months.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time while getting ready for bed, I had already brushed my teeth and rinsed with Listerine.  </li>
            <li>but it just does not work long enough to make the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works as a useful tool for flushing out food particles and fighting gum disease.</li>
            <li>I mean it r-e-a-l-l-y was effective.</li>
            <li>I havent experienced any of the problems some reviewers seem to have, I think its only a matter of using the product as specified by placing on a flat surface, priming the attachment before every use and ensuring that the reservoir is firmly in place.</li>
            <li>But occasionally, it gets right to work.  </li>
            <li>But occasionally, it gets right to work.  </li>
            <li>and I could not fix it, so I researched the new models for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>THIS NEW ONE, WP-72,</li>
            <li>-- I now have a new Waterpik, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet.\\</li>
            <li>-- I now have a new Waterpik, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet.\\</li>
            <li>i contacted the company &amp; they sent me a new unit.</li>
            <li>and they gave me a new one.  </li>
            <li>It can be messy and noisy to be sure, but so far it seems to work well.</li>
            <li>But very loud.</li>
            <li>A significant loss in sales is likely the only way the company will get motivated to improve their quality.</li>
            <li>I only had &#x27;leaks&#x27; the first couple days.</li>
            <li>I only concede on the fact that it is pretty loud, with the exception of that one factor its a 5-star product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two of them die in exactly the same way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it&#x27;s so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Grossan tip fit on my previous model Waterpik, but not this one.</li>
            <li>motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter.</li>
            <li>The very first time I turned it on, there was a low hum and not enough water pressure to overcome gravity.</li>
            <li>A replacement unit was sent and received within ten days, but there was a large piece of plastic rattling inside the unit.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a lid for the large container which is actually a cover in itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing particles from among your teeth and has pressure settings that provide gentle to painful pulsations.</li>
            <li>Together with brushing, this makes a complete dental cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old one that lasted 10+ year, this one work smoother, quieter, and pulse faster.  </li>
            <li>In the old one, the motor is still running, but the water cord leaks.</li>
            <li>bought this model, and the jury is still out as far as reliability.</li>
            <li>I have to agree that it is amazingly loud, even with a towel underneath.</li>
            <li>Think of how much you paid (or are currently paying off) for those braces!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The unit is about 1 1/2 years old, still under warranty</li>
            <li>Suddenly the motor really started chattering and unit was operational.  </li>
            <li>WORKS JUST LIKE THE OLD ONE</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprise at how much stuff is left in between our teeth after brushing, flossing and rinsing.</li>
            <li>contraption is so loud that it sounds like a jack hammer.</li>
            <li>The tube that goes from the irrigator to the tip breaks or cracks and cannot be fixed or replaced.</li>
            <li>loud (like digging up the street loud). 2)</li>
            <li>This model is like night and day compared to the old one.  </li>
            <li>machine is way to noisy compared to my old machine</li>
            <li>One thing Water Pic does not tell you is that like on my older model, sometimes after you take the water container off and then put it back</li>
            <li>The handle is way to small to fit in an adult&#x27;s hand.  </li>
            <li>This is a great investment for couples since the Professional model comes with two jetstream heads (pink and blue) and a few other attachments.  </li>
            <li>But if you follow the directions enclosed in the package, you won&#x27;t make such a huge mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Splits keep occuring - ok if you want a shower - poor hose material makes an otherwise good product very frustrating to use.</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested that I get one a month or so ago as a major part of the effort to \\&quot;keep the teeth you</li>
            <li>This is simply done by placing your mouth around the end of the nossel with an air tight fit, turn on the unit, suck air from the nossel for 1-2 second and then \\&quot;Wolla\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Water Piks for some years, the old models where the wand and the pressure control was outside of the water tank when you close it up.  </li>
            <li>They have gotten cheaper and cheaper in their construction, apparently.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the pump does not have a back-flow preventor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further update, early in 2013 -- The pressure from the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; had become too low.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Further update, early in 2013 -- The pressure from the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; had become too low.  </li>
            <li>Standard item was sent promptly to replace old one on which the tubing gave out.  </li>
            <li>I have used a water jet for over 10 years and when the switch on my old model wore out I order this current model.</li>
            <li>When my old work horse WaterPik finally died after a decade of service, I got this as replacement.</li>
            <li>Messy or not, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The entire unit is very loud especially when you try to pause it.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, your gums may bleed a little.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this, my gums bled a little bit.</li>
            <li>The hose could be a bit longer; the small water holder could be a little bigger; the large tank should have a way to be closed without having to take the tip off; but, I had another brand that had those features and the Water Pik is better.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt believe that there was that much left behind after I THOUGHT my mouth was clean!    </li>
            <li>I was unsuccessfully trying to open up the unit when I decided to execute a tried and true troubleshooting technique: I gave the bottom of the unit a couple hard raps with the heal of my hand.</li>
            <li>Sure, my Waterpic leaks a little, noisy and, rattles and shakes however, when I figure how much money this machine has saved me in dental bills over the past 20 years, I could care less about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it makes a little bit of noise, (not digging up the street loud though) and is a little messy.</li>

            <li> According to my dentist, at my age of 60, my teeth and gums are in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> But let me tell you, I now understand why they all made those comments and can say with conviction, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ONE FOR SIX MONTHS</li>
            <li> but I find this product the best of the ones I tried.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product!  </li>
            <li> Excellent job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Also excellent for strengthening your gums.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> This is very good for getting stuff out between your teeth.</li>
            <li> They are a great product and do an excellent job,- when they work.</li>
            <li> I also experienced water leakage and no water pumping through.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik is a great item</li>
            <li> Work(s/ed) great until it</li>
            <li> (Great service from Amaaon).</li>
            <li> does a great job for that</li>
            <li> But for me, this is as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Everyone in the house will know you are practicing good hygiene.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> , does a good job in cleaning out the mouth</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> You cannot really clean below the gum line without an oral irrigator and this model is superb at doing it.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered it and am very pleased with the unit</li>
            <li> It has proven ideal for keeping her teeth and braces free of food</li>
            <li> I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition!</li>
            <li> while not a substitute for flossing, the waterpik has its own benefits in cleaning around the gumlines.</li>
            <li> The waterpik arrived early and has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> My first dental water irrigator was a WaterPik and the operation was great.</li>
            <li> its easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT IT HAS BETTER CONNECTIONS ON THE HOSE.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The latest one leaks water</li>
            <li> Most unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further update, January 2014 -- Most of the time, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; refuses to emit any water for a minute or so after it&#x27;s switched on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further update, January 2014 -- Most of the time, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; refuses to emit any water for a minute or so after it&#x27;s switched on.  </li>
            <li> The tub (water container) sits nicely on top of the unit.  </li>
            <li> one out of many, etc.</li>
            <li> Over all I am pleased with the water jet.</li>
            <li> With the waterpik and brushing my teeth are in better condition than in 1990.</li>
            <li> Used daily since May 2006 (now Nov 2010) and it has worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Ok, but all the appliances are not needed.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper model is better.</li>
            <li> See the tub up on top where the water goes?</li>
            <li> And my kids love it.</li>
            <li> or I put 1 cap full of my favorite mouth wash and fill it up  the rest of the way with warm water.</li>
            <li> If you are finicky you might want to look at the handheld model for use in the shower--but you might want not to have to go to shower just to clean your teeth either!</li>
            <li> Make sure it is on a secure part of your counter, not the edge.  </li>
            <li> I find that using this every day is very helpful for keeping my mouth in good health.</li>
            <li> The water pulses feel wonderful when the gums hurt from fitting and tightenings, and the water can get those little places that a tooth brush (electric or not) cannot reach.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s on full blast all the time! &lt;</li>
            <li> It is easy to use , just fill it up with water</li>
            <li> The hand device has switchs, etc., that make it easy to not spray the mirror (or the ceiling).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been 4 &amp; 1/2 and still going strong.</li>
            <li> It was working fine</li>
            <li> You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> But the device works just fine without that rubber insert.  </li>
            <li> But the device works just fine without that rubber insert.  </li>
            <li> I think it works fine and is relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job of doing that, and I stopped using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Bottom line--if you like the idea of being able to flush your gums, and you&#x27;re not too fussy, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It does however sound like a MAC Truck running in your bathroom - my wife thought something was flying apart.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For cleaning between the teeth it works as good as the old model.</li>
            <li> The pick is good  as far as power goes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> So over all, I love my new Waterpik :)</li>
            <li> The price was better than retail, unit works really well and is easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> I have decreased my dental visits because of good dental hygiene, and these units  contribute greatly.</li>
            <li> Despite the \\&quot;advice\\&quot; of the dental hygenist mentioned below, please do not use a diluted bleach solution to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out how to use it without having to clean the mirror and mop up the floor afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a clean feeling in your mouth that you have never felt before, use this product and mix the water 50-50 with mouth wash.      </li>
            <li> Your teeth AND your bathroom will stay clean this way.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never been as clean as they are now.  </li>
            <li> It helps clean up any residue food particles that my have escaped your brush and dental floss.</li>
            <li> I floss and jet clean my teeth every day.</li>
            <li> so I got this to keep em clean.</li>
            <li> On this new model, the jet head swaps out easily and is definitely much more user friendly.</li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth better than flossing but much quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li> Putting on the tips are easier and the clear water reservoir looks really nice.  </li>
            <li> There is also a pressure adjustment switch and you can build up to full power if you wish.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update, May 26, 2006 -- The WaterPik still works more or less, but it often refuses to emit any water at all and at its best produces a stream at only one or two of the pressure settings.</li>
            <li> The two well system, is very convient and the self storage of all the extra components is great.</li>
            <li> This new one worked okay for about six weeks before refusing to turn on.  </li>
            <li> However, like many others, since WaterPik pretty much has the market cornered, I ordered the WP-72.</li>
            <li> So far, it works fine, although  I might note that the original WaterPik was more compact and easier to manipulate than the new design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not tried the smaller enclosed reservior yet but it will be nice for using Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> water resevoir is sized nicely, so that I have just enough water to finish a session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue cleaning device works quite well.  </li>
            <li> (I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I&#x27;ll also have a towell ready in case</li>
            <li> Overall great price and value for a dental system that works better than expected</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews I have owned an older model for years and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance, but then the hose sprung a leak</li>
            <li> If you smile like the Joker and dont lean over the sink, your teeth will still be clean but you will be cleaning your mirror and counter top for the next 5 minutes.    </li>
            <li> older model, works fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> It cleans the gum OK, but perhaps a better constructed one can be found from some other company.</li>
            <li> Me and My husband have a bridge that needs to clean all the time certainly help us .</li>
            <li> This piece of junk of a water pic never worked right.</li>
            <li> I sent Amazon an email, they sent me the replacement right away.</li>
            <li> The main idea is to get pulsing jet of water to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m giving it four stars because the water jet is not as strong as my old one.  </li>
            <li> a few days after I had my braces put on, and it is quite possibly the best dental contraption</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> I suppose if one used a higher setting the water would run out and have to be refilled.</li>
            <li> If the motor goes out then that is a different issue, but I believe for the most part it is lack of priming the unit.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself to be very meticulous when it comes to dental hygiene, but even still, when I use the waterpik after I brush and floss, food and gunk comes out!  </li>
            <li> The first two were Conairs.</li>
            <li> If that is the case, be careful never to put even modestly warm water in the pick.</li>
            <li> I was mortified after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The first was purchased/delivered on Feb. 20/22.</li>
            <li> Flawed, yes, but still the best one out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine.</li>
            <li> The first unit lasted about six months.  </li>
            <li> also pretty noisy &lt;br</li>
            <li> But after the first use, I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> We chose this model version over the others as it comes with 2 reservoirs and many different pressure settings.</li>
            <li> It works well, better than my 10 year old model when it was new.</li>
            <li> The personal one is good enough and saves you money.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik was the key to finally receiving good reviews from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> The pulsating water does seem to do a decent job of cleaning if you can get good enough to apply it properly.  </li>
            <li> I must use the pik quickly after filling with water and pressing the connection or the water wants to come out too early, thus leaking.  </li>
            <li> Works very well to wash out around teeth.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bother with a replacement, because I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li> You are given several different heads, so the whole family can use the unit, and have their own waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The jet can be adjusted depending on how much pressure you desire.</li>
            <li> a real adventure try to go to their web site and get a real body...</li>
            <li> I really, really like the gum line pick, works very well.</li>
            <li> It really does the job.</li>
            <li> and i guess i really dont have anything to complain about</li>
            <li> The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and \\&quot;Piks\\&quot; up where brushing and flossing leave off.</li>
            <li> No one else wants to make them.</li>
            <li> I could tell my teeth were really much cleaner then with brushing, flossing and using mouth wash alone.</li>
            <li> this was very nice of them, but i was a little bit put out that the pump didnt have enough torque.</li>
            <li> Such a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Not very reliable if you can&#x27;t get more than six months out of a new product.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik name and reputation and past experience led me to an enthusiastic purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor.</li>
            <li> So far it works just fine and has the advantage of being considerably smaller than the WP-60.  </li>
            <li> So far it works just fine and has the advantage of being considerably smaller than the WP-60.  </li>
            <li> The latest one was purchased earlier this week and after only 2 days of use, the motor has frozen up.</li>
            <li> I highly recomended this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for keeping the dentures at bay.</li>
            <li> but the high setting can make your gums bleed....</li>
            <li> I had an older waterpik that lasted for about 10 years but had to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a new one when I couldn&#x27;t get the old-style jet tips anymore</li>
            <li> The new unit does not feel as sturdy as the older model.</li>
            <li> Has made a real difference in my gums, and the sinus attachment has helped clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended using a Waterpik with a very dilute bleach solution to clear up some periodontal problems.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the unit when I got it, but the motor failed after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time while getting ready for bed, I had already brushed my teeth and rinsed with Listerine.  </li>
            <li> but it just does not work long enough to make the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works as a useful tool for flushing out food particles and fighting gum disease.</li>
            <li> I mean it r-e-a-l-l-y was effective.</li>
            <li> I havent experienced any of the problems some reviewers seem to have, I think its only a matter of using the product as specified by placing on a flat surface, priming the attachment before every use and ensuring that the reservoir is firmly in place.</li>
            <li> But occasionally, it gets right to work.  </li>
            <li> But occasionally, it gets right to work.  </li>
            <li> and I could not fix it, so I researched the new models for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> THIS NEW ONE, WP-72,</li>
            <li> -- I now have a new Waterpik, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet.\\</li>
            <li> -- I now have a new Waterpik, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet.\\</li>
            <li> i contacted the company &amp; they sent me a new unit.</li>
            <li> and they gave me a new one.  </li>
            <li> It can be messy and noisy to be sure, but so far it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> But very loud.</li>
            <li> A significant loss in sales is likely the only way the company will get motivated to improve their quality.</li>
            <li> I only had &#x27;leaks&#x27; the first couple days.</li>
            <li> I only concede on the fact that it is pretty loud, with the exception of that one factor its a 5-star product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of them die in exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it&#x27;s so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Grossan tip fit on my previous model Waterpik, but not this one.</li>
            <li> motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter.</li>
            <li> The very first time I turned it on, there was a low hum and not enough water pressure to overcome gravity.</li>
            <li> A replacement unit was sent and received within ten days, but there was a large piece of plastic rattling inside the unit.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a lid for the large container which is actually a cover in itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for removing particles from among your teeth and has pressure settings that provide gentle to painful pulsations.</li>
            <li> Together with brushing, this makes a complete dental cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old one that lasted 10+ year, this one work smoother, quieter, and pulse faster.  </li>
            <li> In the old one, the motor is still running, but the water cord leaks.</li>
            <li> bought this model, and the jury is still out as far as reliability.</li>
            <li> I have to agree that it is amazingly loud, even with a towel underneath.</li>
            <li> Think of how much you paid (or are currently paying off) for those braces!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The unit is about 1 1/2 years old, still under warranty</li>
            <li> Suddenly the motor really started chattering and unit was operational.  </li>
            <li> WORKS JUST LIKE THE OLD ONE</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprise at how much stuff is left in between our teeth after brushing, flossing and rinsing.</li>
            <li> contraption is so loud that it sounds like a jack hammer.</li>
            <li> The tube that goes from the irrigator to the tip breaks or cracks and cannot be fixed or replaced.</li>
            <li> loud (like digging up the street loud). 2)</li>
            <li> This model is like night and day compared to the old one.  </li>
            <li> machine is way to noisy compared to my old machine</li>
            <li> One thing Water Pic does not tell you is that like on my older model, sometimes after you take the water container off and then put it back</li>
            <li> The handle is way to small to fit in an adult&#x27;s hand.  </li>
            <li> This is a great investment for couples since the Professional model comes with two jetstream heads (pink and blue) and a few other attachments.  </li>
            <li> But if you follow the directions enclosed in the package, you won&#x27;t make such a huge mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Splits keep occuring - ok if you want a shower - poor hose material makes an otherwise good product very frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I get one a month or so ago as a major part of the effort to \\&quot;keep the teeth you</li>
            <li> This is simply done by placing your mouth around the end of the nossel with an air tight fit, turn on the unit, suck air from the nossel for 1-2 second and then \\&quot;Wolla\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Water Piks for some years, the old models where the wand and the pressure control was outside of the water tank when you close it up.  </li>
            <li> They have gotten cheaper and cheaper in their construction, apparently.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the pump does not have a back-flow preventor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further update, early in 2013 -- The pressure from the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; had become too low.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further update, early in 2013 -- The pressure from the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; had become too low.  </li>
            <li> Standard item was sent promptly to replace old one on which the tubing gave out.  </li>
            <li> I have used a water jet for over 10 years and when the switch on my old model wore out I order this current model.</li>
            <li> When my old work horse WaterPik finally died after a decade of service, I got this as replacement.</li>
            <li> Messy or not, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The entire unit is very loud especially when you try to pause it.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, your gums may bleed a little.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this, my gums bled a little bit.</li>
            <li> The hose could be a bit longer; the small water holder could be a little bigger; the large tank should have a way to be closed without having to take the tip off; but, I had another brand that had those features and the Water Pik is better.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt believe that there was that much left behind after I THOUGHT my mouth was clean!    </li>
            <li> I was unsuccessfully trying to open up the unit when I decided to execute a tried and true troubleshooting technique: I gave the bottom of the unit a couple hard raps with the heal of my hand.</li>
            <li> Sure, my Waterpic leaks a little, noisy and, rattles and shakes however, when I figure how much money this machine has saved me in dental bills over the past 20 years, I could care less about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it makes a little bit of noise, (not digging up the street loud though) and is a little messy.</li>
            <li> you are not familiar with this kind of cleaner, you will experience things other reviewers mentioned: the cord pull back, the hard water stop button, etc.  </li>
            <li> other day when the pump in the 40-year-old WaterPik gave up, I rushed out and bought another WaterPik (the manufacturer no longer makes pumps for the old model).  </li>
            <li> I also figure that eventually I&#x27;ll have to open the sucker up and see if there is anything I can do lubricate it or something to get it to work consistently.</li>
            <li> Simply keep your mouth partially closed, open just enough for the water to flow out, and lean over the sink in the same manner you would when spitting toothpaste out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is slightly noisy (bear that in mind if you are using it early in the AM while your spouse and kids are sleeping!), and is quite compact.  </li>
            <li> Mine worked the first time, at least.</li>
            <li> The tongue scraper attachment seems worthlessly small; buy a stainless steel one instead for $3.</li>
            <li> Also, you can&#x27;t leave any water in it and place the mouth piece in its holder or set it on your counter for a moment, as it begins to slowly drain water if it&#x27;s not held higher than the level of the water--a syphoning effect occours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the new one worked for a few months before it gradually took longer and longer to develop a useable pressure.</li>
            <li> The repair facility listed in the WaterPik web site says it does no repairs but merely sends items under warranty to the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original WaterPik design was simple, functional, and reliable.  </li>
            <li> Between the two basins provided, there is enough water to get through a single cleaning either fast or slow.</li>
            <li> I rinse with Listerine, I brush for 4 minutes on my Sonicare toothbrush (twice as long as the recommended time since I have braces), I floss, and</li>
            <li> You are squirting water onto your teeth, if you stare into the mirror and have your mouth wide open, water is going to go everywhere.  </li>
            <li> We bought this WaterPik less than 6 months ago and is hasn&#x27;t worked properly since the second week.  </li>
            <li> Recently I started up again, and after a brief period of use the unit basically failed: it works at the lowest two water pressure settings only--moving the slider to a higher setting results in just a trickle.</li>
            <li> I have just returned it after a single use.</li>
            <li> Becoming frustrated, I tried several other irrigators but none of them has the performance of the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;The unit is a little noisy, but again, not enough to complain about, unless someone is trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> and I have the machine setting on the sink which makes the water hose just a little bit short.  </li>
            <li> I took the rubber tip off and jammed it onto the Waterpik attachment instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To prevent the water leaking, PROPERLY and FIRMLY place the reservior onto the unit.</li>
            <li> It only adds a few seconds to your routine, but nothing to be complaining to the company about.</li>
            <li> Look at the photo carefully.</li>
            <li> Make sure it is seated properly on the base, doesnt take any effort, just look at it.  </li>
            <li> To keep your sink relatively dry, you need to keep your head down low--which some people may not like--but that seems like an inherent problem with a countertop irrigator.</li>
            <li> The older model though claiming to be family size, the jet head was difficult to swap out and thus can realistically only serve one person per unit.</li>
            <li> The Pik-pocket attachments are like gum stimulators and are less messy than the regular jets.</li>
            <li> I like the features, but will return and consider other models.  </li>
            <li> Use diluted Listerine or other antibacterial mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of products that compete with the water pik</li>
            <li> In other words, if you were to remove or bump the tub while it has water in it, it will spill over everything.</li>
            <li> if there was an other 12 inches of hose I think it would help a lot.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m an idiot.  </li>
            <li> Like so many others, I&#x27;ve found this worthless piece of junk has about a 3-month lifespan before it stops working.</li>
            <li> The hose is too stiff and tries to stay coiled.  </li>
            <li> One complaint that I have is the hose - which curls tightly and sometimes caused the cleaner to twist in my hands - but this is not a big deal&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previous waterpik lasted 5+ years.</li>
            <li> I press the top container firmly into the base</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, over the years, I have had the same problem with several machines.</li>
            <li> The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews that clearly indicated that there were at least some models of the WaterPik that had serious quality issues.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little shortcumings.</li>
            <li> My son wears brace and uses this everyday.</li>
            <li> I also disliked how the hose vibrates, those vibrations carry up and my hand shakes while operating.</li>
            <li> It was avocado green.  </li>
            <li> But the current models are larger, the pressure control has been removed from the base unit to the \\&quot;wand,\\&quot; where it is nigh impossible to set one-handed during use, although the setting is easily changed inadvertently during use.  </li>
            <li> I thought the first one being bad was just a fluke...</li>
            <li> The handle leaks water and it has gotten so bad that it drains the reservoir, even the large one, in one use.  </li>
            <li> I notice very little leaking.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the cord is too short and the unit is difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> You can shake the item or click the switch on and off and this will usually get it running again.</li>
            <li> I received this today, read the instructions, primed it and set the small tank up for mouthwash before bed.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for performance.</li>
            <li> The reservoir cannot be placed down over the base unit without removing the tip from the wand, whereas in the original design, the wand stood outside the base unit so that this could be done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lets have some common sense.  </li>
            <li> Here comes the common sense again...  </li>
            <li> If third time is the charm, I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be taking that chance...</li>
            <li> The pause button is difficult to hold down.  </li>
            <li> The new model is easier to change tips, although occansionally the tip will unlock from the base unit while using.</li>
            <li> Since it seems impossible to disassemble the thing enough to check what&#x27;s going on inside, I&#x27;ve replaced it with a \\&quot;Waterpik Water Flosser.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> (it was very annoying that the jet tips would wear out so fast; I was replacing them every few months.</li>
            <li> why would company want to acquire a bad reputation by selling such a poorly engineered product.</li>
            <li> Since it seems impossible to disassemble the thing enough to check what&#x27;s going on inside, I&#x27;ve replaced it with a \\&quot;Waterpik Water Flosser.\\&quot;ood outside the base unit so that this could be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the noise level is irritating.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik (actually a model WP-60) produces no pulsations, and the water in the reservoir runs out the bottom of the base unit all over the counter.  </li>
            <li> I use this thing daily and have never had a leak or accidentally knocked it off its base.    </li>
            <li> Sorry to say there are are people who have never tried this and complain that the unit is somehow defective.</li>
            <li> I received my Waterpik, and within two weeks, the pump failed.</li>
            <li> This item has a lousy hose...</li>
            <li> What went wrong?  </li>
            <li> It is awkward to control the water pressure and the direction of the stream.  </li>
            <li> over time becomes brittle and almost impossible to fix.</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly bad.</li>
            <li> your money, don&#x27;t support this badly designed and overpriced peice of junk</li>
            <li> The amount of food that fell out from between my teeth when I used this really shocked me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product about six months ago. The hand contol will not let the water pressure out of the unit. It was working fine then it just started intermiting, letting water out sometimes, then stopped letting any water out at all. The pump is working but the water stays in the tank. Not very reliable if you can&#x27;t get more than six months out of a new product.</li>
            <li> Sure, my Waterpic leaks a little, noisy and, rattles and shakes however, when I figure how much money this machine has saved me in dental bills over the past 20 years, I could care less about it&#x27;s little shortcumings. According to my dentist, at my age of 60, my teeth and gums are in excellent condition. Brush your teeth and then, use the Waterpic. You will be amazed at how much gunk was left behind by just using the toothbrush and, this is the gunk that causes much of the tooth decay.</li>
            <li> Water Pik seems to work well except that water leaks out of the pressure control switch (on the handle).  Perhaps this is meant to be.  I use the second lowest setting, per my dental hygienist&#x27;s direction, so there is enough water in the tank to do all my teeth.  I suppose if one used a higher setting the water would run out and have to be refilled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carl Kwan</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews I have owned an older model for years and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance, but then the hose sprung a leak and I could not fix it, so I researched the new models for a replacement.  I read a bunch of reviews for the WP-72 and was concerned that some people gave it low marks for reason it somehow gave out after a short period of time.  I went ahead and ordered it and am very pleased with the unit and it&#x27;s performance. One thing Water Pic does not tell you is that like on my older model, sometimes after you take the water container off and then put it back you need to prime the unit to get the water flowing again.  This is simply done by placing your mouth around the end of the nossel with an air tight fit, turn on the unit, suck air from the nossel for 1-2 second and then \\&quot;Wolla\\&quot; it works again. Sorry to say there are are people who have never tried this and complain that the unit is somehow defective. If the motor goes out then that is a different issue, but I believe for the most part it is lack of priming the unit.  Also ordering this unit from Amazon cost me $37.00 compared to a similar model from Wal Mart for $95.00 + tax.</li>
            <li> Started leaking at the handle after 1 day of use.  I like the features, but will return and consider other models.  Previous waterpik lasted 5+ years.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sinuses, to use with a Grossan nasal tip. The Grossan tip fit on my previous model Waterpik, but not this one. I took the rubber tip off and jammed it onto the Waterpik attachment instead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is noisy, but all Waterpiks are noisy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The unit I bought does not come with an outer cover for the larger, 1,00 cc reservoir. The travel reservoir that comes with the unit does, however, have a cover. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had wp-72 for a month now.  Works very well to wash out around teeth.  Such a clean feeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I press the top container firmly into the base I notice very little leaking.  I must use the pik quickly after filling with water and pressing the connection or the water wants to come out too early, thus leaking.  No problem once I realized this.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d bought one earlier.</li>
            <li> The waterpik arrived early and has worked perfectly. Has made a real difference in my gums, and the sinus attachment has helped clear my sinuses. I can breath again....</li>
            <li> I received my Waterpik, and within two weeks, the pump failed. A replacement unit was sent and received within ten days, but there was a large piece of plastic rattling inside the unit. I am hoping the third one is a charm. They are a great product and do an excellent job,- when they work. I have decreased my dental visits because of good dental hygiene, and these units  contribute greatly.</li>
            <li> As a 10+ year user of Waterpik, I&#x27;d say this one works as it promised.  It cleans the teeth better than flossing but much quicker and easier.  Together with brushing, this makes a complete dental cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old one that lasted 10+ year, this one work smoother, quieter, and pulse faster.  Putting on the tips are easier and the clear water reservoir looks really nice.  I have not tried the smaller enclosed reservior yet but it will be nice for using Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not familiar with this kind of cleaner, you will experience things other reviewers mentioned: the cord pull back, the hard water stop button, etc.  But for me, this is as good as it gets.  The main idea is to get pulsing jet of water to clean your teeth.  So you can&#x27;t get away with cord, water splatting, etc.  But the concept works.&lt;br /&gt;Last, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because the water jet is not as strong as my old one.  But from my experience, it will get stronger with age.  So over all, I love my new Waterpik :)&lt;br /&gt;PS: In the old one, the motor is still running, but the water cord leaks.</li>
            <li> Foolish me read these reviews and still decided to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;It worked for 4 days before the hose detatched from the handle. 4 days. &lt;br /&gt;Shame on Waterpik.  &lt;br /&gt;Shame on me.</li>
            <li> Despite the \\&quot;advice\\&quot; of the dental hygenist mentioned below, please do not use a diluted bleach solution to clean your teeth. Bleach is toxic. Use diluted Listerine or other antibacterial mouthwash. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this model, and the jury is still out as far as reliability. Mine worked the first time, at least. I have to agree that it is amazingly loud, even with a towel underneath. And yes, I fear my neighbors will think I&#x27;m running a lawnmower in the bathroom. The tongue scraper attachment seems worthlessly small; buy a stainless steel one instead for $3. Yes, the cord is too short and the unit is difficult to maneuver. But if you follow the directions enclosed in the package, you won&#x27;t make such a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this waterpik a few days after I had my braces put on, and it is quite possibly the best dental contraption I&#x27;ve ever used.  I will continue using this even after my braces are taken off.  Yes, it is noisy and it shakes, but who cares?  I consider myself to be very meticulous when it comes to dental hygiene, but even still, when I use the waterpik after I brush and floss, food and gunk comes out!  I rinse with Listerine, I brush for 4 minutes on my Sonicare toothbrush (twice as long as the recommended time since I have braces), I floss, and then I Waterpik, and even then, debris comes out.  This is a great investment for couples since the Professional model comes with two jetstream heads (pink and blue) and a few other attachments.  And now whenever I eat, I&#x27;m always itching to rinse my mouth out with the waterpik afterwards.  It&#x27;s a world of difference!</li>
            <li> It works well, better than my 10 year old model when it was new. Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  The two well system, is very convient and the self storage of all the extra components is great. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product DOES do the job and do the job well! However, water goes EVERYWHERE! I have yet to figure out how to use it without having to clean the mirror and mop up the floor afterward.&lt;br /&gt;However, if the user has braces, THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU! Messy or not, it is worth it. Think of how much you paid (or are currently paying off) for those braces!&lt;br /&gt;I waited to post this review for six months. That is when my son got his braces and the dentist recommended this product to me. The water pulses feel wonderful when the gums hurt from fitting and tightenings, and the water can get those little places that a tooth brush (electric or not) cannot reach. &lt;br /&gt;If only there was a way to keep the water from bouncing off the teeth and/or braces and splattering everywhere!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended using a Waterpik with a very dilute bleach solution to clear up some periodontal problems. It did a great job of doing that, and I stopped using it regularly. Recently I started up again, and after a brief period of use the unit basically failed: it works at the lowest two water pressure settings only--moving the slider to a higher setting results in just a trickle. The unit is about 1 1/2 years old, still under warranty so I may see if I can get it serviced, but what a nuisance. The 2-star rating reflects 4 for performance, 0 for longevity.</li>
            <li> This unit is noisy, vibrates way too much and is extremely messy.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that clearly indicated that there were at least some models of the WaterPik that had serious quality issues. However, like many others, since WaterPik pretty much has the market cornered, I ordered the WP-72. The very first time I turned it on, there was a low hum and not enough water pressure to overcome gravity. I was unsuccessfully trying to open up the unit when I decided to execute a tried and true troubleshooting technique: I gave the bottom of the unit a couple hard raps with the heal of my hand. Suddenly the motor really started chattering and unit was operational.  The next morning I went to use it for the second time, but once again the motor just gave a low hum. Again I hit it, again it started working (but I didn&#x27;t have the reservoir on yet), so I turned it off, put the reservior on, switched it back on, and...%$*! again! So I leave it on, hit it until it starts, leave it on, put on the reservoir, and use it. I won&#x27;t bother with a replacement, because I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t help much.  I also figure that eventually I&#x27;ll have to open the sucker up and see if there is anything I can do lubricate it or something to get it to work consistently. Please don&#x27;t buy a WaterPik. A significant loss in sales is likely the only way the company will get motivated to improve their quality.</li>
            <li> I hesitated before purchasing this, just because of the unsatisfied comments others have made. But let me tell you, I now understand why they all made those comments and can say with conviction, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT! I also experienced water leakage and no water pumping through. Both are simple fixes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To prevent the water leaking, PROPERLY and FIRMLY place the reservior onto the unit. Doing so creates a seal and it wont leak. If it does, it wasnt placed on properly. Try it again, you will eventually get the hang of it. I only had &#x27;leaks&#x27; the first couple days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for it not pumping any water when it is turned on, you just need to read the instructions. It says you need to PRIME it by removing the pic, placing the hose lower than the reservior, setting it to maximum, and turning it on until water runs through. This isnt a one time thing. You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine. If you dont, then water wont pump through until you PRIME it again. It only adds a few seconds to your routine, but nothing to be complaining to the company about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The unit is a little noisy, but again, not enough to complain about, unless someone is trying to sleep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works great. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I have bought water piks at local department stores . None can compare with this one. My teeth feel like I have just had them cleaned at the Dentist office every time I use it. It is easy to use , just fill it up with water or I put 1 cap full of my favorite mouth wash and fill it up  the rest of the way with warm water. It will do my teeth plus my Husbands teeth with 1 fill . I like the way it gets food from under bridge work and between teeth . I highly recomended this product.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED WATERPIK FOR THIRTY YEARS. THIS NEW ONE, WP-72, WORKS JUST LIKE THE OLD ONE EXCEPT IT HAS BETTER CONNECTIONS ON THE HOSE. YOU JUST GET IT PRIMED AND GO. EXCELLENT PRODUCT.I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ONE FOR SIX MONTHS ANDF EXPECT NO PROBLEMS.</li>
            <li> The handle is way to small to fit in an adult&#x27;s hand.  The hose is too stiff and tries to stay coiled.  The pause button is difficult to hold down.  The entire unit is very loud especially when you try to pause it. I bought mine tonight, but it will be returned tomorrow.  The pulsating water does seem to do a decent job of cleaning if you can get good enough to apply it properly.  I do not recommend purchasing this unit!!!!</li>
            <li> I was happy with the unit when I got it, but the motor failed after about 6 months. I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Me and My husband have a bridge that needs to clean all the time certainly help us . its easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> while not a substitute for flossing, the waterpik has its own benefits in cleaning around the gumlines. I highly recommend this product for keeping the dentures at bay.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I think it works fine and is relatively cheap.  You&#x27;ll be surprise at how much stuff is left in between our teeth after brushing, flossing and rinsing.</li>
            <li> We purchased one of these when my wife got braces on her teeth.  It has proven ideal for keeping her teeth and braces free of food particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly noisy (bear that in mind if you are using it early in the AM while your spouse and kids are sleeping!), and is quite compact.  One complaint that I have is the hose - which curls tightly and sometimes caused the cleaner to twist in my hands - but this is not a big deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water resevoir is sized nicely, so that I have just enough water to finish a session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue cleaning device works quite well.  You are given several different heads, so the whole family can use the unit, and have their own waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this model and another inexpensive personal model as well. The personal one is good enough and saves you money. My son wears brace and uses this everyday. It helps a lot.</li>
            <li> This piece of junk of a water pic never worked right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The adjustment on the stength of the water pressure never worked. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s on full blast all the time! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The contraption is so loud that it sounds like a jack hammer. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of products that compete with the water pik but I find this product the best of the ones I tried.</li>
            <li> This is my third water pick. The first two were Conairs. The WP-72 has 3x the spray force of the Conair. It also sounds like it has 3x the force. Everyone in the house will know you are practicing good hygiene. This sounds like it is piston driven like the Conairs. If that is the case, be careful never to put even modestly warm water in the pick. This caused the piston to seize in my last Conair.</li>
            <li> We bought this WaterPik less than 6 months ago and is hasn&#x27;t worked properly since the second week.  The handle leaks water and it has gotten so bad that it drains the reservoir, even the large one, in one use.  I&#x27;ve used Water Piks for some years, the old models where the wand and the pressure control was outside of the water tank when you close it up.  Seemed to work fine.  They have gotten cheaper and cheaper in their construction, apparently.  They probably went out of the USA.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> This item works well when it is working. The jet can be adjusted depending on how much pressure you desire. Problem is that the mechanism that pumps the water tends to stick. You can shake the item or click the switch on and off and this will usually get it running again. However, after 4 months mine gave out. I had to take it apart and manually turn the gear and oil the mechanism. It is once again working, but what a pain.</li>
            <li> after 3 months stopped working. why would company want to acquire a bad reputation by selling such a poorly engineered product.</li>
            <li> This item has a lousy hose... over time becomes brittle and almost impossible to fix. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Splits keep occuring - ok if you want a shower - poor hose material makes an otherwise good product very frustrating to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a real adventure try to go to their web site and get a real body...</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m an idiot.  My 3rd (or 4th?) Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months.  The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle.  The latest one leaks water and so it&#x27;s obviously an electrical hazard.</li>
            <li> My first dental water irrigator was a WaterPik and the operation was great. Unfortunately, over the years, I have had the same problem with several machines. The tube that goes from the irrigator to the tip breaks or cracks and cannot be fixed or replaced. Becoming frustrated, I tried several other irrigators but none of them has the performance of the WaterPik. -- So I&#x27;m back to WaterPik and hoping the problem has been resolved!</li>
            <li> This is the 4th waterpik I&#x27;ve purchased in the last year. The latest one was purchased earlier this week and after only 2 days of use, the motor has frozen up. What a pile of JUNK!!!!!! The one before that lasted 3 months until all the water leaked out of the handle. Whose building these things?????...........</li>
            <li> We used another brand (which is no longer manufactured) for about 20 years and it died. I received this today, read the instructions, primed it and set the small tank up for mouthwash before bed. To my dismay the solution flowed all over the bathroom counter. Apparently the pump does not have a back-flow preventor. I also disliked how the hose vibrates, those vibrations carry up and my hand shakes while operating. And the noise level is irritating. Most unsatisfactory. I am returning.</li>
            <li> May 2003 -- I bought a WaterPik irrigator the day Lee Harvey Oswald was murdered (November 1963) and used it for 40 years. It&#x27;s great for removing particles from among your teeth and has pressure settings that provide gentle to painful pulsations. The problem of splatter is avoided by closing the lips somewhat during use and leaning over the sink so the water can flow out of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day when the pump in the 40-year-old WaterPik gave up, I rushed out and bought another WaterPik (the manufacturer no longer makes pumps for the old model).  This new one worked okay for about six weeks before refusing to turn on.  The store swapped it for another one four days ago. So far, it works fine, although  I might note that the original WaterPik was more compact and easier to manipulate than the new design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, May 26, 2006 -- The WaterPik still works more or less, but it often refuses to emit any water at all and at its best produces a stream at only one or two of the pressure settings. This gadget is obviously not built to the standards of the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update, July 13, 2006 -- The WaterPik (actually a model WP-60) produces no pulsations, and the water in the reservoir runs out the bottom of the base unit all over the counter.  I assume the pump and/or the connection between the reservoir and the pump is leaking.  The repair facility listed in the WaterPik web site says it does no repairs but merely sends items under warranty to the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original WaterPik design was simple, functional, and reliable.  There was no need to change it at all.  But the current models are larger, the pressure control has been removed from the base unit to the \\&quot;wand,\\&quot; where it is nigh impossible to set one-handed during use, although the setting is easily changed inadvertently during use.  The reservoir cannot be placed down over the base unit without removing the tip from the wand, whereas in the original design, the wand stood outside the base unit so that this could be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update, July 27, 2006 -- I now have a new Waterpik, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet.\\&quot; The device has no model number, only this name.  So far it works just fine and has the advantage of being considerably smaller than the WP-60.  Cost about $60, though, at Target.  The Teledyne name no longer appears on the product or literature, so maybe the Waterpik company has re-formed itself for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update, early in 2013 -- The pressure from the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; had become too low.  The rubber insert in the reservoir that mates the reservoir to the pump unit was allowing air into the system.  Replacing the insert brought no improvement.  But the device works just fine without that rubber insert.  Just block the opening in the bottom of the reservoir with your fingertip while you fill the reservoir and set it in the pump unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update, January 2014 -- Most of the time, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; refuses to emit any water for a minute or so after it&#x27;s switched on.  But occasionally, it gets right to work.  Since it seems impossible to disassemble the thing enough to check what&#x27;s going on inside, I&#x27;ve replaced it with a \\&quot;Waterpik Water Flosser.\\&quot;ood outside the base unit so that this could be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update, July 27, 2006 -- I now have a new Waterpik, the \\&quot;Ultra Dental Water Jet.\\&quot; The device has no model number, only this name.

            <li> I had an older waterpik that lasted for about 10 years but had to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a new one when I couldn&#x27;t get the old-style jet tips anymore (it was very annoying that the jet tips would wear out so fast; I was replacing them every few months. Smells like \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; to generate tip sales). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So the new one worked for a few months before it gradually took longer and longer to develop a useable pressure. The pump motor eventually seized and so into the garbage it went. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After reading here about how others have run into the same problem it&#x27;s obvious the product is APOC so I Will Never Buy Another WaterPik Product Again!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  I was mortified after the first time I used it.  Let me start by saying I have an electic toothbrush and use mouthwash. I used it for the first time while getting ready for bed, I had already brushed my teeth and rinsed with Listerine.  The amount of food that fell out from between my teeth when I used this really shocked me. I couldnt believe that there was that much left behind after I THOUGHT my mouth was clean!    If you want a clean feeling in your mouth that you have never felt before, use this product and mix the water 50-50 with mouth wash.      Now to the use...  Lets have some common sense.  You are squirting water onto your teeth, if you stare into the mirror and have your mouth wide open, water is going to go everywhere.  Simply keep your mouth partially closed, open just enough for the water to flow out, and lean over the sink in the same manner you would when spitting toothpaste out.  Your teeth AND your bathroom will stay clean this way.  If you smile like the Joker and dont lean over the sink, your teeth will still be clean but you will be cleaning your mirror and counter top for the next 5 minutes.    The tub (water container) sits nicely on top of the unit.  It is held in place by a rubber gromet which keeps the water from leaking out.  I have never had a problem with it falling off or leaking.  Here comes the common sense again...  Make sure it is on a secure part of your counter, not the edge.  Make sure it is seated properly on the base, doesnt take any effort, just look at it.  I use this thing daily and have never had a leak or accidentally knocked it off its base.    When you first use it, your gums may bleed a little.  My dentist said its no big deal, it just shows that you are cleaning deeper than your gums are used to.  Your gums will adjust within 2-3 uses.  There is also a pressure adjustment switch and you can build up to full power if you wish.    My teeth have never been as clean as they are now.  My breath isfresher.  My mouth feels cleaner that it has ever felt.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I like it very much but it is noisy. Finally getting the hang of using it without getting water all over the place. I do wish it had a lid for the large container which is actually a cover in itself. I really, really like the gum line pick, works very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like to use food grade hydrogen peroxide with distilled water but it messes up the plastic container well.</li>
            <li> This is the second WaterPik Water Jet that I have purchased, and I will purchase another when I need one.</li>
            <li> Standard item was sent promptly to replace old one on which the tubing gave out.  I wish the tubing were made tougher.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik is a great item but it just does not work long enough to make the purchase worthwhile. What they need is some competition then maybe their quality would improve. Oh well!!</li>
            <li> It can be messy and noisy to be sure, but so far it seems to work well. Between the two basins provided, there is enough water to get through a single cleaning either fast or slow. The Pik-pocket attachments are like gum stimulators and are less messy than the regular jets. Overall, it works as a useful tool for flushing out food particles and fighting gum disease. To keep your sink relatively dry, you need to keep your head down low--which some people may not like--but that seems like an inherent problem with a countertop irrigator. If you are finicky you might want to look at the handheld model for use in the shower--but you might want not to have to go to shower just to clean your teeth either! Bottom line--if you like the idea of being able to flush your gums, and you&#x27;re not too fussy, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik was the key to finally receiving good reviews from my dentist.  If you are flossing challenged, this is the answer.  It really does the job.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik name and reputation and past experience led me to an enthusiastic purchase of this item. Work(s/ed) great until it die(s/d)a sudden unforseen death.  I thought the first one being bad was just a fluke...one out of many, etc. So, I returned it for replacement. I mean it r-e-a-l-l-y was effective. But the product life...isn&#x27;t!! The first was purchased/delivered on Feb. 20/22. The second arrived on March 1st. Today is March 7th. Today the second one died. If third time is the charm, I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be taking that chance...I want a refund!</li>
            <li> But very loud. Any adults/ teens with braces should definately get this product. It helps clean up any residue food particles that my have escaped your brush and dental floss. I havent experienced any of the problems some reviewers seem to have, I think its only a matter of using the product as specified by placing on a flat surface, priming the attachment before every use and ensuring that the reservoir is firmly in place. I only concede on the fact that it is pretty loud, with the exception of that one factor its a 5-star product!</li>
            <li> I loved it. It&#x27;s very powerful. It cleaned every thing from in-between teeth. I used it twice a day. But after only 10 days, the pump stopped working. I sent Amazon an email, they sent me the replacement right away. (Great service from Amaaon). I hope the second will last.</li>
            <li> There are some flaws with the design.  The hose could be a bit longer; the small water holder could be a little bigger; the large tank should have a way to be closed without having to take the tip off; but, I had another brand that had those features and the Water Pik is better.  Why? Pressure.  If you want something that does the job, buy the Water Pik.  Flawed, yes, but still the best one out there.</li>
            <li> Over all I am pleased with the water jet. I have used a water jet for over 10 years and when the switch on my old model wore out I order this current model. The new model is easier to change tips, although occansionally the tip will unlock from the base unit while using. A simple move and it is back in the proper position. &lt;br /&gt;For cleaning between the teeth it works as good as the old model. I would not be without it. Back in the 1990 the dentist warned me that I would probably lose my teeth in ten-15 years.With the waterpik and brushing my teeth are in better condition than in 1990. I repreat I would not do without it.</li>
            <li> Works terrific. Has plenty of power.  Only con is noise. You definately know when this unit is on. Small price to pay for performance. Good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I floss and jet clean my teeth every day. When my old work horse WaterPik finally died after a decade of service, I got this as replacement. The older model though claiming to be family size, the jet head was difficult to swap out and thus can realistically only serve one person per unit. On this new model, the jet head swaps out easily and is definitely much more user friendly. The new unit does not feel as sturdy as the older model. But after trying another brand for a short time, I&#x27;m convinced that WaterPik is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> older model, works fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> Used daily since May 2006 (now Nov 2010) and it has worked flawlessly.  A couple of the attachments broke (ones I don&#x27;t use) as a result of moving.  Excellent product!  i thought it might last 1 year.  it&#x27;s been 4 &amp; 1/2 and still going strong.</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly bad. I have just returned it after a single use. Complaints: 1) loud (like digging up the street loud). 2) leaks water (underneath, where the power cord is). It cleans the gum OK, but perhaps a better constructed one can be found from some other company.</li>
            <li> Excellent job of cleaning.  It does however sound like a MAC Truck running in your bathroom - my wife thought something was flying apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I&#x27;ve found this worthless piece of junk has about a 3-month lifespan before it stops working. I&#x27;ve had two of them die in exactly the same way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your money, don&#x27;t support this badly designed and overpriced peice of junk</li>
            <li> Ok, but all the appliances are not needed.  The cheaper model is better.</li>
            <li> after 3 days the pump would freeze up. i contacted the company &amp; they sent me a new unit. this was very nice of them, but i was a little bit put out that the pump didnt have enough torque. however since i took it apart and ran oil on the plunger it started working and i guess i really dont have anything to complain about</li>
            <li> Look at the photo carefully. See the tub up on top where the water goes? It&#x27;s not attached permanently. It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor. In other words, if you were to remove or bump the tub while it has water in it, it will spill over everything. Also, you can&#x27;t leave any water in it and place the mouth piece in its holder or set it on your counter for a moment, as it begins to slowly drain water if it&#x27;s not held higher than the level of the water--a syphoning effect occours.&lt;br /&gt;The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it&#x27;s so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter. (I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I&#x27;ll also have a towell ready in case I bump into the tub.)&lt;br /&gt;Why then do I use it? Well, because it actually works! Once I mastered the art of using this half-baked contraption, I found my mouth, teeth, and gums are cleaner than ever. The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and \\&quot;Piks\\&quot; up where brushing and flossing leave off. I&#x27;d gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine. I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition! No one else wants to make them.</li>
            <li> Well my second one just quit.  The first unit lasted about six months.  I sent it back to waterpik and they gave me a new one.  I have owned water piks that have lasted ten years.  What went wrong?  this is just junk.</li>
            <li> I have braces so I got this to keep em clean. does a great job for that but the high setting can make your gums bleed....also pretty noisy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;overall, does a good job in cleaning out the mouth</li>
            <li> You cannot really clean below the gum line without an oral irrigator and this model is superb at doing it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it makes a little bit of noise, (not digging up the street loud though) and is a little messy. But after the first use, I can deal with it. I could tell my teeth were really much cleaner then with brushing, flossing and using mouth wash alone. And my kids love it. The oldest got braces and just loves to use it. Says it helps with the pain of the braces and gets all the food out. We chose this model version over the others as it comes with 2 reservoirs and many different pressure settings. You can also get 3 different tips to use on it. Also, the feedback I read also helped me to decide to go with this model over the others along with all the features. With regular use, this will also save you money on cleaning bills to the dentists.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a WaterPik 30 years ago.  It was avocado green.  It functioned a lot like a version of water laser surgery on my gums and sprayed the entire bathroom.  My dentist suggested that I get one a month or so ago as a major part of the effort to \\&quot;keep the teeth you got\\&quot;.  I did.  This model is like night and day compared to the old one.  The hand device has switchs, etc., that make it easy to not spray the mirror (or the ceiling).  As someone else said in their review, you will be amazed even after brushing and flossing the amount of junk this thing flushes out.</li>
            <li> The pick is good  as far as power goes.  It leaves a lot to be desired regarding use. It is awkward to control the water pressure and the direction of the stream.  I am 6&#x27;1\\&quot; tall and I have the machine setting on the sink which makes the water hose just a little bit short.  Its usuable but if there was an other 12 inches of hose I think it would help a lot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The machine is way to noisy compared to my old machine</li>
            <li> Good product.  A bit noisy.   Easy to clean.  Basically indestructable.  Would recommend, espoecially if you are having gum problems.</li>
            <li> This is very good for getting stuff out between your teeth. Also excellent for strengthening your gums. When I first started using this, my gums bled a little bit. Now they don&#x27;t. I find that using this every day is very helpful for keeping my mouth in good health.</li>
            <li> The price was better than retail, unit works really well and is easy to maintain.  Overall great price and value for a dental system that works better than expected</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
