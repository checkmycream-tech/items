            <li>My lips looked so gorgeous when I used it for the Marc Anthony&#x27;s concert.</li>

            <li>Amazing lipstick.</li>
            <li>Fits my brown skin, colour is really nice</li>
            <li>nice matte but not too drying</li>
            <li>But since I am unwilling to spend more than $8 for lipstick, I came across this perfect dupe for my favorite shade of (brownish) red, which is perfect for the old Hollywood glam look.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would have more of a purple tone.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect red lipstick would go well with any complexion.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a bit more darker when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>I love the color and the silky finish.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I paid about $5, Fantastic!</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, and has such a nice color pay off, I&#x27;m so happy that I got two of these.</li>
            <li>A lighter red than I expected,but still a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>received this in a few days and received a lot of compliments, since it&#x27;s the perfect holiday lip color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I enjoy this color .</li>
            <li>It glides on so smoothly and its not drying at all.</li>
            <li>however, when I returned to buy it again the store did not carry it but fortunately for me Amazon does and for a fraction of the cost; with shipping included</li>
            <li>And since it&#x27;s matte, it doesn&#x27;t feather on my lips, so it always looks fresh!</li>
            <li>I originally brought this color at a drugstore over a year ago for about $9.</li>
            <li>I was looking for this discontinued product for so long and was so pleased to learn you had more than one!</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful color, not too bright, not too dark.</li>
            <li>I ordered it (with free shipping!), and it arrived promptly, in excellent condition, and even earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>The perfect red lipstick for me (brown-skinned Asian) is Viva Glam I by Mac.</li>
            <li>But re-applying isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, so I still love it!</li>
            <li>The matte is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>my favorite color, gorgeous red, love the matte finish, stays in place, I wear it all year round.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute new favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>I always have trouble looking for a matte red lipstick and this.one is perfect</li>
            <li>Stays on pretty well for a cheaper product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I love lip stick especially revlon</li>
            <li>Not nearly as dark as the picture implies, but it is matte and looks fantastic</li>
            <li>;I&#x27;m very dissapointed , the color is nothing like the picture, its more like a terra-cota redish, not a wine red....</li>
            <li>would certainly order again and again.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really matte but stil</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe they cancelled this at Walmart but thanks</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and I liked the little box they came in!</li>
            <li>this is a bright red lipstick and I&#x27;m a dark colored person, so this makes me look like a damn clown.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a classic rich red</li>
            <li>Wanted a true red matte lipstick.  </li>
            <li>in particular the In the Red shade, because that&#x27;s my all-time favorite red.</li>
            <li>I love the color, it&#x27;s a little lighter in person</li>
            <li>Oh well, you live you learn.</li>
            <li>I wonder what new number or color name they replaced it with.</li>
            <li>It is very classy.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever purchased a red lipstick</li>
            <li>The color is not bright red and has a hint of dark to it which makes it perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and dark and isn&#x27;t shimmery at all.</li>
            <li>It took me years to find the exact shade of red for me and when I saw that it was discontinued by Revlon</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a true, deep red, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave ur lips dry like other lipsticks its creamy and stays on for along time :))</li>
            <li>Needless to say I was surprised and happy to find it at Beauty Central.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty and the color lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>(quick fix with a dark lip liner),</li>
            <li>I truly like the color since itâ€™s a classic sexy red (not bright)</li>
            <li>The only thing I disliked was that the color wasn&#x27;t true to the picture.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a several hours, does not feel heavy, dry or sticky, and it goes on smoothly.</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like it to!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry them out either.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a slight orang-ish tone.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday and it makes my lips feel moist even when it comes off.  </li>
            <li> Its a shame is not readily available at the store.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a shade that I can wear all year round.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday .</li>
            <li> Sad that Revlon stopped making the In The Red color!</li>
            <li> :/ unfortunately I can return it because I used it!</li>
            <li> Without another color, this lipstick was bland and boring.</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed Revlon discontinued this matte lipstick line, and</li>
            <li> sad .. must buy all before they are gone!!</li>

            <li> Not nearly as dark as the picture implies, but it is matte and looks fantastic</li>
            <li> The picture of the lipstick looked to be darker than it turned out to be.  It&#x27;s too bright for me and you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; lipstick.  Oh well, you live you learn.</li>
            <li> Love it. Stays on pretty well for a cheaper product. I was hoping it would have more of a purple tone. Seems to have a slight orang-ish tone.</li>

            <li> Love this lipstick! I always have trouble looking for a matte red lipstick and this.one is perfect I loooove it! Doesn&#x27;t leave ur lips dry like other lipsticks its creamy and stays on for along time :))</li>
            <li> Without another color, this lipstick was bland and boring. I really didn&#x27;t like it too much. I thought it would be a classic rich red but it was so washed out and faded, it sort of looked brown. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  It&#x27;s really pretty and the color lasts a long time.  I wear this everyday and it makes my lips feel moist even when it comes off.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Revlon matte 007 is the best color.&lt;br /&gt;I received this in a few days and received a lot of compliments, since it&#x27;s the perfect holiday lip color.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly order again and again.</li>
            <li> I love it I love the color it&#x27;s really matte but stil moisturizing color is just amazing gonna purchase this again!</li>
            <li> this is a bright red lipstick and I&#x27;m a dark colored person, so this makes me look like a damn clown. I am never purchasing from this seller again. SO DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a true, deep red, look somewhere else. I realize it&#x27;s always a risk to buy lipstick on line, but this was WAY off.</li>
            <li> Wanted a true red matte lipstick.  Not drying and color lasts a long time.  Not glossy so do not have to reapply throughout the day.  So glad to find it on Amazon.  This is not found in stores.  Price was the BEST!  Will buy this product again and again</li>
            <li> ;I&#x27;m very dissapointed , the color is nothing like the picture, its more like a terra-cota redish, not a wine red....:/ unfortunately I can return it because I used it! to try it! Ugh</li>
            <li> I loved this lipstick! It stays on for a several hours, does not feel heavy, dry or sticky, and it goes on smoothly. This is the first time I have ever purchased a red lipstick and I love it! The color is not bright red and has a hint of dark to it which makes it perfect! I am very happy with this purchase! and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I really love the creamy feeling it leaves on your lips! It doesn&#x27;t dry them out either. The only thing I disliked was that the color wasn&#x27;t true to the picture.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this discontinued product for so long and was so pleased to learn you had more than one!</li>
            <li> A lighter red than I expected,but still a beautiful color. It is very classy.</li>
            <li> my favorite color, gorgeous red, love the matte finish, stays in place, I wear it all year round.  highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love it.  My lips looked so gorgeous when I used it for the Marc Anthony&#x27;s concert.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this color . I wonder what new number or color name they replaced it with. Its a shame is not readily available at the store.</li>
            <li> Sad that Revlon stopped making the In The Red color! It is such a beautiful color, not too bright, not too dark. It is also matte without being too drying. Gorgeous! Delivery was fast and I liked the little box they came in!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it! Amazing lipstick. It glides on so smoothly and its not drying at all. Perfect red lipstick would go well with any complexion.</li>
            <li> Only lipstick i will wear forever and ever</li>
            <li> The lipstick doesn&#x27;t last very long and it&#x27;s very smudgy/bleedy and over all messy. The color fades too.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute new favorite lipstick. I wish it were a bit more darker when it&#x27;s on (quick fix with a dark lip liner), but I think it&#x27;s a shade that I can wear all year round. It goes on so smoothly, and has such a nice color pay off, I&#x27;m so happy that I got two of these. And since it&#x27;s matte, it doesn&#x27;t feather on my lips, so it always looks fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite!!! I wear this everyday . I love lip stick especially revlon can&#x27;t believe they cancelled this at Walmart but thanks</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the color and texture. It&#x27;s smooth and dark and isn&#x27;t shimmery at all. Perfect! I just wish I could find it in stores, it would save me a lot in shipping cost.</li>
            <li> It took me years to find the exact shade of red for me and when I saw that it was discontinued by Revlon I was heartbroken.  I love the color and the silky finish.  The matte is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> No the color in the picture</li>
            <li> Fits my brown skin, colour is really nice i love it but the only thing is that it doesnt last very long</li>
            <li> I love the color! Great seller!</li>
            <li> I love the color, it&#x27;s a little lighter in person but it&#x27;s still gorgeous...but it doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like it to! I had it on for maybe three hours and it was already rubbing off. But re-applying isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, so I still love it!</li>
            <li> The perfect red lipstick for me (brown-skinned Asian) is Viva Glam I by Mac. But since I am unwilling to spend more than $8 for lipstick, I came across this perfect dupe for my favorite shade of (brownish) red, which is perfect for the old Hollywood glam look.</li>
            <li> Simple suttle red I like it nice matte but not too drying</li>
            <li> Sad this is my favorite red lipstick shade ..no longer in stores ..sad .. must buy all before they are gone!!</li>
            <li> I originally brought this color at a drugstore over a year ago for about $9. I truly like the color since itâ€™s a classic sexy red (not bright) however, when I returned to buy it again the store did not carry it but fortunately for me Amazon does and for a fraction of the cost; with shipping included I paid about $5, Fantastic!</li>
