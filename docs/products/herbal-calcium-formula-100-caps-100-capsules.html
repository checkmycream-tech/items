            <li>And best of all I don&#x27;t have to look at the ingredients to see if there are harmful additives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>It is always best to use a food source or herbal source to meet calcium needs.</li>
            <li>This is also a great way to get your calcium without the issues of constipation that calcium supplements can cause.</li>
            <li>and I knew I liked it</li>
            <li>Nice to find a plant source of calcium</li>
            <li>This company I believe in for healthy products, and the prices&lt;br /&gt;are wonderful for those who want good natural vitamins!</li>
            <li>It is best to take calcium in a natural form.  </li>
            <li>Great &amp; fast customer service!</li>
            <li>Love this calcium.</li>
            <li>I can tell that my body absorbs this better and it has no side effects.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the herbal calcium.  </li>
            <li>I love dr christophers products .</li>
            <li>I love all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s herbal complexes.</li>
            <li>I need to get more of this.</li>
            <li>I love all of them.  </li>
            <li>It is better for absorption.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday, my chiropractor took lots of x-rays of my spine and hip, and said my bones look strong and healthy...</li>
            <li>I use this while pregnant and nursing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m linking my review for Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal *extract* which is kind of the same thing as these Capsules but in a liquid</li>
            <li>It is a great way to get your calcium through plants, rather than other forms that the body can&#x27;t readily absorb.  </li>
            <li>So, even though I stopped the bone broth several months ago, and switched to a vegan diet, (no dairy, all vegetables and lots of fruit), my bones are still strong, so I will continue to buy Dr. C&#x27;s herbal calcium and the tissue and bone products!</li>
            <li>so far, i have no more tooth pain! :D</li>
            <li>Most of my supplements are being switched to his products I recommend to all to get back to what God gave us to use.</li>
            <li>I read that herbal calcium was supposed to help with that as the pains are actually from calcium being striped from existing bone to grow more.  </li>
            <li>(Stopped all dairy, since it is very acidic, and for several months consumed lots of homemade bone broth to make sure I was getting plenty of collagen.)  </li>
            <li>both of which run in my family on both sides and I had many nights of frequent waking with my first because I wasn&#x27;t getting enough calcium</li>
            <li>how much calcium is in each capsule?</li>
            <li>Very absorbable calcium supplement.  </li>
            <li>I have a fast growing 10 year old.  </li>
            <li>This product restored levels to normal with no side effects.</li>
            <li>Herbal calcium is natural.</li>
            <li>It really helps me to function daily.</li>
            <li>It justs helps me keep on an even keel at 68 yrs old.</li>
            <li>Low Calcium appears to be a growing issue throughout the U.S. Blood tests had revealed this unusual problem for me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doc grateful for this formula.</li>
            <li> Love this calcium. This is the only calcium that helps my hips to stop hurting. I can tell that my body absorbs this better and it has no side effects.</li>
            <li> how much calcium is in each capsule?</li>
            <li> I like the product however I ordered 425 mg and got 400 mg</li>
            <li> This product I have found helps reduce inflammation in the bladder.  I have tried to stop using it, but every time I go off of it I notice pain levels from IC increase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the herbal calcium.  It is a great way to get your calcium through plants, rather than other forms that the body can&#x27;t readily absorb.  This is also a great way to get your calcium without the issues of constipation that calcium supplements can cause.</li>
            <li> Yes happy with purchase! Trying reminerlize  my teeth so I&#x27;m hoping  this works! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have seen absolutely no benefit to using this product.  Will try something else next time as a&lt;br /&gt;food based calcium product.</li>
            <li> I love dr christophers products . I am a student of his online program. Most of my supplements are being switched to his products I recommend to all to get back to what God gave us to use. And best of all I don&#x27;t have to look at the ingredients to see if there are harmful additives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these supplements for months trying to avoid taking the other calcium supplements, carbonate and citrate. I&#x27;m linking my review for Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal *extract* which is kind of the same thing as these Capsules but in a liquid and my review covers both imo I added a link from Harvard on  calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review on Herbal Calcium extract&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IE05BQENZRHC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harvard Health Pub.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Very absorbable calcium supplement.  I&#x27;m trying to reverse Osteopenia.  I take four of these per day with a couple of magnesium chloride tabs.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> If take as directed, may be only about 2 week supply.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and I knew I liked it but once again Amazon always delivers</li>
            <li> Great &amp; fast customer service!</li>
            <li> I love all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s herbal complexes. I need to get more of this.</li>
            <li> I use this while pregnant and nursing and if I take it regularly I don&#x27;t experience charlie horses or varicose veins (both of which run in my family on both sides and I had many nights of frequent waking with my first because I wasn&#x27;t getting enough calcium and my legs hurt!).</li>
            <li> I have cavities and am hoping this will rebuild  my teeth. so far, i have no more tooth pain! :D</li>
            <li> I have confidence in Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products. I love all of them.  Herbal calcium is natural. It is not synthetic.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a plant source of calcium</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with osteoporosis 2 years ago.  Blood testing by my naturopathic doctor showed that my vit. D was very low, and a urine test showed that my body was not absorbing calcium.  I should mention that I changed my diet drastically, too.  (Stopped all dairy, since it is very acidic, and for several months consumed lots of homemade bone broth to make sure I was getting plenty of collagen.)  I also began to take this herbal calcium, plus Dr. C&#x27;s tissue and bone product, and began taking D3.  Yesterday, my chiropractor took lots of x-rays of my spine and hip, and said my bones look strong and healthy...no sign of bone loss at all!  So, even though I stopped the bone broth several months ago, and switched to a vegan diet, (no dairy, all vegetables and lots of fruit), my bones are still strong, so I will continue to buy Dr. C&#x27;s herbal calcium and the tissue and bone products!</li>
            <li> This is one of the Dr Christoper&#x27;s Formulas that I take daily.  It really helps me to function daily. I have tried to omit it but my back gets pretty painful when I do. It justs helps me keep on an even keel at 68 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I have researched calcium to some degree.  It is best to take calcium in a natural form.  It is better for absorption.  The calcium in other forms seems to line the arteries and causes calcification not absorption.  It is always best to use a food source or herbal source to meet calcium needs.</li>
            <li> Low Calcium appears to be a growing issue throughout the U.S. Blood tests had revealed this unusual problem for me. This product restored levels to normal with no side effects.</li>
            <li> This company I believe in for healthy products, and the prices&lt;br /&gt;are wonderful for those who want good natural vitamins!</li>
            <li> I have a fast growing 10 year old.  He has grown 4.5 inches in the last year! He was having bad \\&quot;growing pains\\&quot; in his feet and legs.  I read that herbal calcium was supposed to help with that as the pains are actually from calcium being striped from existing bone to grow more.  He started this product in mid-December, 3 times a day for a couple of weeks and then went to once.  He has no more growing pains, even though in those 3 months he has grow 2 inches and another shoe size!!!  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
