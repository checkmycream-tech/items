            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried every brand of gel pads, these are awesome.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>The girls say these pads work the best.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE these!!!!!</li>
            <li>Some of the best eyepads I have found.  </li>
            <li>My any client love this!!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and my clients are happy.</li>
            <li>They are so comfortable!!!</li>
            <li>Good product very comfortable for clients, don&#x27;t give any discomfort and very easy to work with good quality very happy</li>
            <li>and I love the price!</li>
            <li>These gel pads are by far the BEST...</li>
            <li>They would&#x27;ve been ok if I didn&#x27;t have to heat them to get them off the backing.</li>
            <li>It moves way to much and just not that great.</li>
            <li>I Love these gel pads</li>
            <li>The ones I ordered earlier this year were great!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain easily either.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really fit the eye</li>
            <li>I bought these because the brand I originally had been getting was backordered and I needed them somewhat soon.</li>
            <li>They are perfect in terms of being comfortable and staying in place, but I have to cut a more dramatic curve in each one in order to fit any of my lash clients.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of under eye pads in my lash career and these are by far my favorite because they&#x27;re very flexible and tacky</li>
            <li>I want my money back or the under eye stickers I originally bought!</li>
            <li>The curve is too straight.</li>
            <li>I know its not supposed to be like tape, but it should stay in one place throughout the whole process.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t stay on skin very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these for professional eyelash extension applications.</li>
            <li>They are narrow in the inner corner and HUGE on the outside corner.</li>
            <li>These pads did not fit most faces and slide down.  </li>

            <li> These pads did not fit most faces and slide down.  </li>
            <li> The iner corner does not stay down and if a eyelashe with any glue that&#x27;s not dry touches the pad the pad ends up being stuck in the eyelash unil</li>
            <li> so they actually hold down the bottom lashes and stay in place.</li>
            <li> The adhesive on the gel side is not very sticky at all.</li>
            <li> We have tried a few brands now, but these are definitely the staff&#x27;s favorites.</li>
            <li> Other pads i&#x27;ve tried are too thick, not sticky enough etc.</li>
            <li> I need to hunt down the phone number now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lash artist for a few years now</li>
            <li> Not to mention I waited 3 weeks for the wrong ones to finally show up.</li>
            <li> Fabric part isn&#x27;t hard either.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item before, for some reason I didn&#x27;t receive the same quality item as before,  this last shipment was terrible, the pads are so cheep on quality,  don&#x27;t stay put, they are hard, not good to work with.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with them, will not use them or order this brand again.</li>
            <li> I hate the ones they sent me!</li>
            <li> I hate Them!</li>

            <li> Product is great! The gel part isn&#x27;t gooey, which I like a lot. Fabric part isn&#x27;t hard either.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> They are perfect in terms of being comfortable and staying in place, but I have to cut a more dramatic curve in each one in order to fit any of my lash clients. The curve is too straight.</li>
            <li> I ordered iBeautiful brand but received a totally different brand. They would&#x27;ve been ok if I didn&#x27;t have to heat them to get them off the backing.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the brand I originally had been getting was backordered and I needed them somewhat soon. The adhesive on the gel side is not very sticky at all. I know its not supposed to be like tape, but it should stay in one place throughout the whole process. It moves way to much and just not that great.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t really fit the eye</li>

            <li> I Love these gel pads and I love the price! I&#x27;m happy and my clients are happy. Will definitely buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> These gel pads are by far the BEST... I&#x27;ve been a lash artist for a few years now and I&#x27;ve tried every brand of gel pads, these are awesome.  I order these once a month and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> My any client love this!!! They are so comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay on skin very well. It keeps on sliding to different places. Most of my client keeps complaining how uncomfortable it was.</li>
            <li> I always order these for my employees at my Day Spa. The girls say these pads work the best. We have tried a few brands now, but these are definitely the staff&#x27;s favorites.</li>
            <li> The gel pad I received looked nothing like the ones pictured. They are narrow in the inner corner and HUGE on the outside corner. The iner corner does not stay down and if a eyelashe with any glue that&#x27;s not dry touches the pad the pad ends up being stuck in the eyelash unil it washes off.</li>
            <li> I was sent different eye patches than what was being advertised! Not happy at all. Not to mention I waited 3 weeks for the wrong ones to finally show up. Can&#x27;t complain easily either. I need to hunt down the phone number now.</li>
            <li> I hate the ones they sent me! The ones I ordered earlier this year were great! I reordered and they look different and they make my clients eyes water! I hate Them! I want my money back or the under eye stickers I originally bought! these don&#x27;t work they make my clients eyes water!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lash extension pads. And I LOVE these!!!!! I will return</li>
            <li> Some of the best eyepads I have found.  Have ordered several times and will continue from iBeautiful.</li>
            <li> Good product very comfortable for clients, don&#x27;t give any discomfort and very easy to work with good quality very happy</li>
