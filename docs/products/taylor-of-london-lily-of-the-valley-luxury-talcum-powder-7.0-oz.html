            <li>(LOL) rather than make my own powder, I purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forty-nine years ago, I gave my wife Crabtree and Evelyn Lily of the Valley Dusting Powder, and she has loved it every year since.</li>
            <li>Good old-fashioned item at a good old-fashioned price.  </li>
            <li>We have always loved the Lily powder from Crabtree and Evelyn</li>
            <li>Anyway we&#x27;re trying to find a good substitute...</li>
            <li>and my mother loved it.</li>
            <li>Oh My Gosh it smells wonderful and it feels light.</li>
            <li>I heard this brand was a good brand and the lily of the valley powder</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I give another star for Amazon good customer service.</li>
            <li>but still I love the beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is elegant and come in a beautiful tin.</li>
            <li>This is the most beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>Very nice scent, very fine powder.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>We both love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I needed to try more than one, as this is a discontinued fragrance from Crabtree and Evelyn and this aroma is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Nice and silky feel to it.</li>
            <li>I should know a bit about fragrance, as I actually own Tijon Fragrance Laboratory in La Jolla, Calfornia.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Said she had forgotten how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li>have always liked this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Lavender and rose would be nice.was looking for yardley</li>
            <li>It has a very nice clean and floral scent.  </li>
            <li>talc is very fine.</li>
            <li>It is a very smooth talcum.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to be able to order it.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, and it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance in silky talcum.  </li>
            <li>Well, my wife will be getting this in two days, and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li>I also purchased another brand with dusting pad just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I love sprinkling floral bath powders onto the mattress cover when I change the bed linens.</li>
            <li>I hope Taylor of London continues to make it for those of us who still love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more than one</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I will order it again from Amazon when I need more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of lily of the valley, and have been using this powder for years</li>
            <li>I will order this many times again.</li>
            <li>but this is lovely</li>
            <li>LIghtly scented, nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This is lovely talcum powder.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so lovely and is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I love both the fragrance and feel of this product on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of this.</li>
            <li>The powder is a good price and definitely worth every cent you pay for it.</li>
            <li>A very fine, smooth powder with a refreshing, not overbearing aroma.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was appropriately packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taylor of London offers a beautifully scented &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley&amp;#34; scented powder.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I loved this powder when I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I found that mixing it with baby powder gives me the smooth consistency I love and the lighter scent I like.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>loved it so much i bought it again for myself.</li>
            <li>smelled nice and I heard right.</li>
            <li>, it is easy to use and fits in my bath routine well</li>
            <li>came in the mail very quickly</li>
            <li>Love this stuff really smells nice</li>
            <li>Strong, strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pretty container which looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and pretty tin, but tin came dinted.</li>
            <li>But for a fine talc, this should please her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A fine talc that is smooth and long-lasting on the skin, too.  </li>
            <li>Mom is \\&quot;gone\\&quot; now, but I still have a little of the powder ... which I use sparingly in my lingere drawer...and have  wonderful memories of my Mom.</li>
            <li>Received the item with a huge dent to the metal can.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Great for daily use.</li>
            <li>My 98 year old mother loved this.</li>
            <li>It is soft and feels so good with its light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is heavenly and smells exactly like the flowers!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I was able to find her such a flower-fragrant lily of the valley talcum.</li>
            <li>Beautiful light scent, just what I expected.</li>
            <li>Smells just like fresh flowers!</li>
            <li>Clean</li>
            <li>Used sparingly, it&#x27;s a pleasant after-shower product for occasional use for me.</li>
            <li>The talc comes in a very pretty tin and has a nice twist open top.  </li>
            <li>But, it passed the teen-age daughter test--the first time I wore it, she noticed and spontaneously declared, &amp;#34;you smell really good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a true Lily-of-the-Valley scented talcum powder.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling cool and fresh</li>
            <li>This is as close to the real thing as can be!!</li>
            <li>Would look pretty just sitting on the shelf!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong, not subtle, so if you like lily of the valley, you will probably like this powder.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you or those who come in contact with you.</li>
            <li>This talcum powder is just divine; it&#x27;s so fragrant and fresh.</li>
            <li>and you get that clean, dry, fresh feeling like you do after taking a bath, and that&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
            <li>Not so strong people know you&#x27;re coming near before you get to them.  </li>
            <li>I like this talcum powder very much and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I use more intense fragrances during the day when I am out and about, and soft fragrances such as this from Taylor of London at night when I want a cooled-down feeling without an overwhelming perfumed smell.</li>
            <li>Lily of the Valley is hard to find here so this powder makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>My first was a gift</li>
            <li>Longer lasting fragrance than most talcs.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>sure enough I found out that Taylor of London&#x27;s \\&quot;Lily of the Valley has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good Lilly of the Valley talc, and have tried a few.</li>
            <li>you enjoy the delicate scent of Lily of the Valley you will absolutely LOVE this body powder!</li>
            <li>Finding a good bath powder is not easy.</li>
            <li>This is a soft fragrant powder with a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like this powder, but do find it quite strong and not as smooth as other powders.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I think this smells exactly like the real flowers that grown in my yard in the spring.</li>
            <li>Returned the item and got my refund pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is one you can really smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.  </li>
            <li>Was really surprised to find this product from a reputable company at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Smell is unusual, not Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return</li>
            <li>I found the powder to have a very faithful fragrance</li>
            <li>Very fragrant, high quality powder.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s always been particular about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you like to wear powder, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used to wear Muguet de Bois in High School.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like little old lady scents, but I love Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has the same scent (very strong), but perhaps a little too much for me today for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and hard to find in town.</li>
            <li>Oh, smells so much like actual lily of the valley flowers.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>was getting a bit fed up with my old brand because the quality seemed to go downhill</li>
            <li>Taylor of London talcs seem to be lighter in general, and this Lily of the Valley is soft, feminine, and not overly flowery.</li>
            <li>The scent seems to be pure and not mixed in some spicy potpourri which often spoils the essential scent that I bought the product for.  </li>
            <li>It is a light delicate scent capturing the fragrance of the lillies of the valley.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is like smelling the actual flowers, soft and pleasing.  </li>
            <li>This talcum powder is intoxicatingly fragrant and brings back old memories.</li>
            <li>and I have not found another brand that comes close to the true small of the flowers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to keep a present a secret from her in 52 years.</li>
            <li>I have a big issue with perfume sprays, but I like powders; my problem is I cannot find a scent I like to often and when I do find a scent the products are discontinued not long after I start using them and</li>
            <li>The scent is a little stronger than some other brands, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Taylor of London offers a beautifully scented &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley&amp;#34; scented powder.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

            <li> The scent is heavenly and smells exactly like the flowers!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I was able to find her such a flower-fragrant lily of the valley talcum.</li>
            <li> Beautiful light scent, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells just like fresh flowers!</li>
            <li> Clean</li>
            <li> Used sparingly, it&#x27;s a pleasant after-shower product for occasional use for me.</li>
            <li> The talc comes in a very pretty tin and has a nice twist open top.  </li>
            <li> But, it passed the teen-age daughter test--the first time I wore it, she noticed and spontaneously declared, &amp;#34;you smell really good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a true Lily-of-the-Valley scented talcum powder.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling cool and fresh</li>
            <li> This is as close to the real thing as can be!!</li>
            <li> Would look pretty just sitting on the shelf!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong, not subtle, so if you like lily of the valley, you will probably like this powder.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you or those who come in contact with you.</li>
            <li> This talcum powder is just divine; it&#x27;s so fragrant and fresh.</li>
            <li> and you get that clean, dry, fresh feeling like you do after taking a bath, and that&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
            <li> Not so strong people know you&#x27;re coming near before you get to them.  </li>
            <li> I like this talcum powder very much and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I use more intense fragrances during the day when I am out and about, and soft fragrances such as this from Taylor of London at night when I want a cooled-down feeling without an overwhelming perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> Lily of the Valley is hard to find here so this powder makes me happy.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> My first was a gift</li>
            <li> Longer lasting fragrance than most talcs.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> sure enough I found out that Taylor of London&#x27;s \\&quot;Lily of the Valley has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good Lilly of the Valley talc, and have tried a few.</li>
            <li> you enjoy the delicate scent of Lily of the Valley you will absolutely LOVE this body powder!</li>
            <li> Finding a good bath powder is not easy.</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrant powder with a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I really like this powder, but do find it quite strong and not as smooth as other powders.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I think this smells exactly like the real flowers that grown in my yard in the spring.</li>
            <li> Returned the item and got my refund pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is one you can really smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.  </li>
            <li> Was really surprised to find this product from a reputable company at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Smell is unusual, not Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li> Too much hassle to return</li>
            <li> I found the powder to have a very faithful fragrance</li>
            <li> Very fragrant, high quality powder.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s always been particular about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you like to wear powder, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Muguet de Bois in High School.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like little old lady scents, but I love Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has the same scent (very strong), but perhaps a little too much for me today for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and hard to find in town.</li>
            <li> Oh, smells so much like actual lily of the valley flowers.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> was getting a bit fed up with my old brand because the quality seemed to go downhill</li>
            <li> Taylor of London talcs seem to be lighter in general, and this Lily of the Valley is soft, feminine, and not overly flowery.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to be pure and not mixed in some spicy potpourri which often spoils the essential scent that I bought the product for.  </li>
            <li> It is a light delicate scent capturing the fragrance of the lillies of the valley.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is like smelling the actual flowers, soft and pleasing.  </li>
            <li> This talcum powder is intoxicatingly fragrant and brings back old memories.</li>
            <li> and I have not found another brand that comes close to the true small of the flowers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to keep a present a secret from her in 52 years.</li>
            <li> I have a big issue with perfume sprays, but I like powders; my problem is I cannot find a scent I like to often and when I do find a scent the products are discontinued not long after I start using them and</li>
            <li> The scent is a little stronger than some other brands, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is a little stronger than Crabtree and Evelyn, but I&#x27;m hoping after a bath, that will dissipate ever so slightly, and this will become her new standard, perhaps for another 49 years.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase other scents.</li>
            <li> Talc, however, tends not to hold scent very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever I get busy or lazy</li>
            <li> I was curious about this one as a memory of long-ago.  </li>
            <li> I said the scent is a little stronger than some other powders but that could actually be a pro versus a con for some people.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for many years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this along with several other talcoms as I couldn&#x27;t find ANY in the stores I usually shop.  </li>
            <li> Wish they made other fragrant powders.</li>
            <li> Will reorder when this is half empty</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t buy powder but since did since this scent has been discontinued</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that the tin was dented</li>
            <li> My regular supplier was unable to ship this to me after a few weeks of waiting</li>
            <li> Looks like not original and the seal was broken</li>
            <li> (Probably too late to apply to the CIA for a job as well.)</li>
            <li> : She never reads my reviews, so I seriously doubt she&#x27;ll see this.</li>
            <li> However the metal container was badly dented whether due to packaging or sent that way.</li>
            <li> Personally, it smells like some insect repellent you put inside your closet.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find and usually very, very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for some nostalgic talcum powder like my grandmother used to use but didn&#x27;t want to over spend from an exclusive shop.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I lost my sense of smell in an accident some years ago, so I use this for others&#x27; benefit.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li> but they changed their formula..which is terrible!!</li>

            <li> Oh, smells so much like actual lily of the valley flowers.  It&#x27;s a gentle scent.  Not so strong people know you&#x27;re coming near before you get to them.  Have had plenty of compliments of the scent also. Nice and silky feel to it. Will reorder when this is half empty so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> I should know a bit about fragrance, as I actually own Tijon Fragrance Laboratory in La Jolla, Calfornia.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I get busy or lazy (LOL) rather than make my own powder, I purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of London offers a beautifully scented &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley&amp;#34; scented powder.&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy the delicate scent of Lily of the Valley you will absolutely LOVE this body powder!</li>
            <li> I loved this powder when I first purchased it.  But I could not find it again.  I was so pleased to be able to order it.  It came quickly and was appropriately packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought the Taylor of London Lily of the Valley Talc for my mom. She loves it. Very pleasant fragrance. Finding a good bath powder is not easy. We will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good Lilly of the Valley talc, and have tried a few. I ordered this for Christmas for my sister, and got one for myself. We both love it! she said when she smelled it, it made her want to plant lilly of the valley plants in her yard, which she is doing this spring. Said she had forgotten how nice it smelled. The scent is one you can really smell. Not like some that you use, and 5 minutes later can&#x27;t even smell it. I just love it, and it has become my favorite. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Not overpowering.  Clean</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft. Nice fragrance that is not overwhelming. Especially nice for summer.</li>
            <li> Smells just like fresh flowers!</li>
            <li> Lily of the Valley is hard to find here so this powder makes me happy.  Lovely fragrance in silky talcum.  I wear it often.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of talcum powders, as my husband tends to have sneezing fits when I use colognes. I use more intense fragrances during the day when I am out and about, and soft fragrances such as this from Taylor of London at night when I want a cooled-down feeling without an overwhelming perfumed smell. Taylor of London talcs seem to be lighter in general, and this Lily of the Valley is soft, feminine, and not overly flowery. I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for many years and have never been disappointed.  My regular supplier was unable to ship this to me after a few weeks of waiting so I started looking elsewhere. Thank you Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife will be getting this in two days, and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s going to love it. Forty-nine years ago, I gave my wife Crabtree and Evelyn Lily of the Valley Dusting Powder, and she has loved it every year since. This year, we simply could not find it. This was close, as close as I could come without the dusting pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talc is very fine. The scent is a little stronger than Crabtree and Evelyn, but I&#x27;m hoping after a bath, that will dissipate ever so slightly, and this will become her new standard, perhaps for another 49 years. By then, we&#x27;ll both be in our hundreds, and will have lost out sense of smell anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I also purchased another brand with dusting pad just to be on the safe side. But for a fine talc, this should please her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPSS: She never reads my reviews, so I seriously doubt she&#x27;ll see this. If she does, it&#x27;s no big deal. I&#x27;ve never been able to keep a present a secret from her in 52 years. (Probably too late to apply to the CIA for a job as well.)</li>
            <li> I love sprinkling floral bath powders onto the mattress cover when I change the bed linens. Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find. I hope Taylor of London continues to make it for those of us who still love it.</li>
            <li> My 98 year old mother loved this. She had lily of the valley for her wedding bouquet and she&#x27;s always been particular about the fragrance. I&#x27;m very glad I was able to find her such a flower-fragrant lily of the valley talcum.</li>
            <li> Love this. Beautiful scent and talc. Bought it for a gift. loved it so much i bought it again for myself.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.  It smells identical to lily of the valley flower. I have purchased more than one</li>
            <li> Received damaged item. Looks like not original and the seal was broken</li>
            <li> have always liked this fragrance.</li>
            <li> love it!Beautiful scent!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, very fine powder. Wish it came in a container with a puff though.</li>
            <li> Great talc! Beautiful light scent, just what I expected. It also has a pretty container which looks nice on the counter. I was a little bummed that the tin was dented but still I love the beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wow!! This is as close to the real thing as can be!! The scent is heavenly and smells exactly like the flowers!! I found a tin of this at Marshalls and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. I will order it again from Amazon when I need more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for...thanks so much! Will shop with seller again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lily of the valley, and have been using this powder for years</li>
            <li> Good old-fashioned item at a good old-fashioned price.  Was looking for some nostalgic talcum powder like my grandmother used to use but didn&#x27;t want to over spend from an exclusive shop.  Was really surprised to find this product from a reputable company at such a reasonable price.  The talc comes in a very pretty tin and has a nice twist open top.  Would look pretty just sitting on the shelf!</li>
            <li> Nice scent and pretty tin, but tin came dinted.</li>
            <li> A beautiful scent.  I will order this many times again.</li>
            <li> I like this talcum powder very much and will buy it again.  The fragrance is strong, not subtle, so if you like lily of the valley, you will probably like this powder.  The makers did not skimp on ingredients.  It is a very smooth talcum.  I don&#x27;t feel any graininess, as I do with some products.  The scent seems to be pure and not mixed in some spicy potpourri which often spoils the essential scent that I bought the product for.  I would recommend this talcum.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent! However the metal container was badly dented whether due to packaging or sent that way.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Smell is unusual, not Lily of the Valley.  Too much hassle to return, so I&#x27;ll cut my losses and keep looking.</li>
            <li> Great powder with a wonderful scent. It is a light delicate scent capturing the fragrance of the lillies of the valley.  My first was a gift and I just reordered my third.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with several other talcoms as I couldn&#x27;t find ANY in the stores I usually shop.  I was curious about this one as a memory of long-ago.  It definitely has the same scent (very strong), but perhaps a little too much for me today for some reason.  Used sparingly, it&#x27;s a pleasant after-shower product for occasional use for me.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice clean and floral scent.  Talc, however, tends not to hold scent very long.</li>
            <li> Was looking for Crabtree and Evelyn lilly of valley and could not find it. Came across this and it is excellent. Very fragrant, high quality powder.</li>
            <li> I needed to try more than one, as this is a discontinued fragrance from Crabtree and Evelyn and this aroma is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great product.Will buy again.Wish they made other fragrant powders.Lavender and rose would be nice.was looking for yardley but this is lovely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff really smells nice</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and excellent service from the seller.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful light scent!  I like the package, it is easy to use and fits in my bath routine well</li>
            <li> LIghtly scented, nice smell.  Great for daily use. Great to wear to work without being overpowering.  Feels great! If you like to wear powder, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and hard to find in town. I heart amazon!  Great for the summer months.  Leaves you feeling cool and fresh</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrant powder with a clean scent.  Longer lasting fragrance than most talcs.  Great for after shower or before bed.</li>
            <li> A very fine, smooth powder with a refreshing, not overbearing aroma. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the lily of the valley scent. A quality product, will order again.</li>
            <li> My Mom was always asking me for an old-fashion scent she once used.  This is the best essence of Lily of the Valley I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  Mom is \\&quot;gone\\&quot; now, but I still have a little of the powder ... which I use sparingly in my lingere drawer...and have  wonderful memories of my Mom.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you or those who come in contact with you.</li>
            <li> This product has nailed the lily-of-the-valley scent. It&#x27;s as fragrant as the actual flower. A fine talc that is smooth and long-lasting on the skin, too.  I love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This is lovely talcum powder.  The fragrance is like smelling the actual flowers, soft and pleasing.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a true Lily-of-the-Valley scented talcum powder.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see Lily of the valley talc.  Ordered it, and was sent the freesia scent.  Extremely disappointed!!!  Still trying to figure out who to complain to and how to get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Muguet de Bois in High School. This talcum powder is intoxicatingly fragrant and brings back old memories.</li>
            <li> We have always loved the Lily powder from Crabtree and Evelyn but they changed their formula..which is terrible!! Anyway we&#x27;re trying to find a good substitute...this didn&#x27;t quite make it.</li>
            <li> The scent is so lovely and is long-lasting. I will definitely purchase other scents. Such a treat!</li>
            <li> I think this smells exactly like the real flowers that grown in my yard in the spring. I really like it!</li>
            <li> This smells just like the wonderful spring flower. It is soft and feels so good with its light fragrance. Would definitely buy again and give as a gift. It is elegant and come in a beautiful tin.</li>
            <li> I love both the fragrance and feel of this product on my skin.  It is a great value, as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother. We grow lily of the valley in our garden and she loves the scent of the flowers. I found the powder to have a very faithful fragrance and my mother loved it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this. I typically don&#x27;t buy powder but since did since this scent has been discontinued and I have not found another brand that comes close to the true small of the flowers. I wish Taylor of London would bring back this scent!!!</li>
            <li> Replaces my used-up Crabtree and Evelyn tin.  I don&#x27;t like little old lady scents, but I love Lily of the Valley.  Sadly, I lost my sense of smell in an accident some years ago, so I use this for others&#x27; benefit.  But, it passed the teen-age daughter test--the first time I wore it, she noticed and spontaneously declared, &amp;#34;you smell really good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like this powder, but do find it quite strong and not as smooth as other powders.  I found that mixing it with baby powder gives me the smooth consistency I love and the lighter scent I like.  I mix it about 1 part LLV talc with 3 parts Johnson&#x27;s baby powder and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This talcum powder is just divine; it&#x27;s so fragrant and fresh. The scent is a little stronger than some other brands, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting a bit fed up with my old brand because the quality seemed to go downhill and they began to sell smaller packets while charging you the same price (Happens a lot these days), so I had a look at this one and I&#x27;m very pleased I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said the scent is a little stronger than some other powders but that could actually be a pro versus a con for some people. As a talcum powder it works well and you get that clean, dry, fresh feeling like you do after taking a bath, and that&#x27;s just lovely. The powder is a good price and definitely worth every cent you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail and Oh My Gosh it smells wonderful and it feels light. I heard this brand was a good brand and the lily of the valley powder smelled nice and I heard right. I have a big issue with perfume sprays, but I like powders; my problem is I cannot find a scent I like to often and when I do find a scent the products are discontinued not long after I start using them and sure enough I found out that Taylor of London&#x27;s \\&quot;Lily of the Valley has been discontinued. What will I do!:(</li>
            <li> Strong, strongly scented.  I wanted something to wear during spring and summer that was beautifully scented.  This is not it.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful...these items were for wife...</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Received the item with a huge dent to the metal can. Most importantly, I don&#x27;t like the smell. Personally, it smells like some insect repellent you put inside your closet. Returned the item and got my refund pretty fast. That&#x27;s why I give another star for Amazon good customer service.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful.  came in the mail very quickly</li>
            <li> This is the most beautiful scent.  It is hard to find and usually very, very expensive.  This is a great buy.</li>
    </ol>
