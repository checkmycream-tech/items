            <li> Feels a bit greasy in your hand but then dries on the face quickly. I have combination skin, oily nose and chin the rest can be painfully dry. This seems to do a good job of not making my face breakout but gives it some much needed moisture.</li>
            <li> THE BEST moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found. Goes on so smoothly, soaks right in, gives a matte finish, &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out. Not incredibly moisturizing in the winter (found I have to re-apply several times) &amp; the amount is so small, especially for the price. Paula, any chance you could put this in a larger container that lasts longer?</li>
            <li> I like this gel a lot, it is not greasy at all and is perfect for the summer humidity. My only problem is with the packaging. The twist off cap comes off really easily. I like to keep this in my bag but I have found it opened with the gel all over the inside contents of my bag before.</li>
            <li> Perfect weight moisturizer. Very pleased. My teenagers and myself all use this product and love it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it .....great stuff....</li>
            <li> It does moisturize my skin, but I have been using it for about two weeks now and it has started to make my skin greasy after about one week of use. I have combination skin ,and use it all over my face. My forehead is always shiny now a few hours after I put this moisturizer on. I do not think I will be reordering it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily and soaks into the skin well. It&#x27;s also moisturizing as well, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry during the day. Really good product.</li>
            <li> Product clumps into balls on my skin. Also caused me to break out in huge pimples after only two applications. The Skin Balancing serum is great but this is no bueno.</li>
            <li> Good product but little bit small for that price :)</li>
            <li> Super product for Oily/Combination skin! Love it as a summer moisturizer. If you order directly from the site, the following code will give you $10 off.&lt;br /&gt;https://goo.gl/Vc9LLi</li>
            <li> This made me break out to the point I had to start take antibiotics in order to make it all go away.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It is very light, non-greasy, and refreshing to put on. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Using this underneath a sunscreen and your good to go for the day.</li>
            <li> Paulas choice is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter to use in conjunction with Paula&#x27;s Choice clear extra strength acne kit. The kit causes her face to become a bit tight and dry and this has been the perfect solution. This product is a gel not a cream, and it is oh so silky. Once you apply it to your face it absorbs and leaves your faces feeling like silk. It is really quite amazing. It is not oily in any way. It has been the perfect moisturizer for my daughter who typically has oily skin and was reluctant to use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the perfect combination of silky and matte&lt;br /&gt; It goes on like buttah and dries to a smooth, matte finish. I love this moisturizer! For reference, I am in my mid-30s with combined to oily skin and have been dealing with acne since I was 11.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to apply to my face before I put on my foundation. I have very oily skin and needed something to help tame the shine. This has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Very light cream, my favorite night cream now. I wake up with my skin well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have used!  Been looking for one like this for 60 years! ( Completely oil-free ) but is extremely gentle on the face. I would rate it a 5 Star!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually relied on my sunblock as a moisturizer but recently learned that&#x27;s not the best thing for your skin. My skin is oily and I was reluctant to use a moisturizer as I thought it would make my makeup slide off. I got a sample of this from another online beauty product web site and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy AT ALL, absorbs quickly, and seems to help to reduce my oiliness and keep my makeup fresh.  Great stuff, I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good moisturizer to use under makeup. This fits the bill! It soaks right in and goes well under makeup. For reference I have combo/oily skin and I usually mix this with 2-3 drops of paulas choice Vit C liquid to help with my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Paula&#x27;s Choice product. I wish there was one for the day, exactly like this one with sunscreen. It is very light yet moisturizes very well and does not leave the face oily and dries fast (which is the main reason I LOVE it). Also love their referral program, buy directly from the Paula&#x27;s Choice store through this link and GET $10 OFF :) http://goo.gl/J5uNbc</li>
            <li> MY THIRD TIME PURCHASHING THIS PRODUCT  BEST TOTALLY NON GREASY NON-OILY MOISTERIZER EVER DRIES TO A SMOOTH MATTE FINISH YET MY FACE IS NOT DRIED OUT I CALL THAT AMAZING</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but the price is steep!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way that this balances out my skin. I wear under my makeup during the day. great product and fast delivery.</li>
