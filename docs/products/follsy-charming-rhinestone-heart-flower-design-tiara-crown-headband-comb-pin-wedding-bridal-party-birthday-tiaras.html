            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bend too much to fit your head.</li>

            <li>Slightly light weight</li>
            <li>Fit for the princesses I bought it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too small and the combs fit perfect in my hair!!</li>
            <li>We bought this for our granddaughter and the top rhinestone Tiara piece broke away from the headband within the first week.</li>
            <li>Much more than I expected , pefect , cute and stylish</li>
            <li>Not like the cheap plastic ones, but still inexpensive for a child to wear for fun</li>
            <li>This tiara is made of metal and it has a good weight (heavier on the end with all the rhinestones, obviously).</li>
            <li>Luckily it fits me.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>price was great for this tiara/crown and we got it in a few days.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable, absolutely beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I bought this crown to be used for Prom Queen and it was even larger than expected (which was perfect).</li>
            <li>Heavy very well made beautiful tiara.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The look tiara was pretty</li>
            <li>This is actually really pretty.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is as lovely as the picture.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size... not too small, though not too big, either.  </li>
            <li>Great tiara, very heavy in weight!</li>
            <li>Quincera or adult use, would be special.</li>
            <li>you get what you paid for, pretty much</li>
            <li>It looks far more expensive than it is and would be perfect as the prize for a local pageant or prom queen, but since it is so inexpensive would also work well for a &amp;#34;queen for a day&amp;#34; scenario like a (grown-up) birthday party.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does run large.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>It was well made and we presented the tiara&#x27;s onstage, they really stood out in pictures and could be seen over the winner&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I will say that the product is very sturdy and I don&#x27;t see it breaking anytime</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely manner as well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really sparkly just the way I wanted it.....</li>
            <li>Was more then I expected.</li>
            <li>but my expectations were really blown out of the water.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is large and noticeable on an adult, and would be too large and heavy for a child for the most part.</li>
            <li>perfect look but little small for adult.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a strong enough metal to last a long time and you can gently bend it to fit your head.</li>
            <li>Was the right size and was shipped fast and properly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A little heavy but beautiful</li>
            <li>This is not a toy, adult size and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in place on your head.</li>
            <li>Not cheap looking....very elegant for the price.</li>
            <li>Normally it wouldn&#x27;t fit on her head but an adults&#x27;, but if you squeeze it for a bit, it will stay to that size for a few minutes and it&#x27;ll go back to its original size</li>
            <li>Just live it.  </li>
            <li>I would say that the part of the crown that fits around your head is an adult medium to large and the part where are all the rhinestones is probably about the same.</li>
            <li>The tiara was a little big for my daughter, but it is a lovely piece, and there are ways to fix that.  </li>
            <li>This is a well constructed piece of costume jewelry in an adult size.</li>
            <li>It is delicate like most jewelry in that the metal has soldering points in it</li>
            <li>I wish I knew that it was adult sized.</li>
            <li>Definitely an adult sized tiara.</li>
            <li>Better quality than expected, as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>It does sit high enough on the head to been seen well, even in blond</li>
            <li>Very pretty but does not fit on 4 year olds head without falling off.</li>
            <li>the little 5 year old girl who is a princess is really a princess now!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter and it is so big that she couldn&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>The tiara was much prettier than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I noticed is that these could be a little big around the head for some of the girls, but nothing a few bobby-pins won&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li>However very delicate, bends easily where rhinestones are attached if pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>Little large for my 3-year-old grand-daughter.</li>
            <li>But it is way too large and heavy for preschool princess granddaughters.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It was surprisingly comfortable and not super stiff like I have seen others to be.</li>

            <li> This is not a toy, adult size and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in place on your head.</li>
            <li> Not cheap looking....very elegant for the price.</li>
            <li> Normally it wouldn&#x27;t fit on her head but an adults&#x27;, but if you squeeze it for a bit, it will stay to that size for a few minutes and it&#x27;ll go back to its original size</li>
            <li> Just live it.  </li>
            <li> I would say that the part of the crown that fits around your head is an adult medium to large and the part where are all the rhinestones is probably about the same.</li>
            <li> The tiara was a little big for my daughter, but it is a lovely piece, and there are ways to fix that.  </li>
            <li> This is a well constructed piece of costume jewelry in an adult size.</li>
            <li> It is delicate like most jewelry in that the metal has soldering points in it</li>
            <li> I wish I knew that it was adult sized.</li>
            <li> Definitely an adult sized tiara.</li>
            <li> Better quality than expected, as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> It does sit high enough on the head to been seen well, even in blond</li>
            <li> Very pretty but does not fit on 4 year olds head without falling off.</li>
            <li> the little 5 year old girl who is a princess is really a princess now!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter and it is so big that she couldn&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> The tiara was much prettier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I noticed is that these could be a little big around the head for some of the girls, but nothing a few bobby-pins won&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> However very delicate, bends easily where rhinestones are attached if pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Little large for my 3-year-old grand-daughter.</li>
            <li> But it is way too large and heavy for preschool princess granddaughters.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly comfortable and not super stiff like I have seen others to be.</li>
            <li> A little big for 8 year old.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 16th birthday, she wore it all day long.</li>
            <li> Personally wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything other than costume wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expected when buying a product like this.</li>
            <li> then I had expected.</li>
            <li> This tiara was every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> but it will due.</li>
            <li> Well crafted and heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> HEAVY</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable for kids.</li>
            <li> Poked their heads &amp; couldn&#x27;t get them to wear them even to take a picture :(</li>
            <li> but my daughter was very disappointed that she could not wear it to her party.</li>

            <li> I ordered this for my Granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, quality tiara. It&#x27;s tall and sparkly! It doesn&#x27;t bend too much to fit your head. Luckily it fits me.</li>
            <li> Love it. Made well and really stands out nicely.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, absolutely beautiful.  Well crafted and heavy duty.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tiara! Ordered as a costume piece for my dance class. The girls are going to LOVE these. Feels very sturdy and the rhinestones are gorgeous. They will look great on stage. Only thing I noticed is that these could be a little big around the head for some of the girls, but nothing a few bobby-pins won&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> Heavy very well made beautiful tiara.</li>
            <li> the Tiara was wonderful; I won a contest as best dressed Queen with this Tiara being praised by all who saw it many wanted to know where I got it from; it was the most original looking Tiara among all those who wore Tiaras in the Royalty Contest.....Loved it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality! Affordable luxury!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expected when buying a product like this.</li>
            <li> Was more more beautiful in person!</li>
            <li> Good looking tiara I like it so much</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous crown. I&#x27;m wearing it for my wedding. The size is perfect. It&#x27;s not too small and the combs fit perfect in my hair!! Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> This tiara is perfect. I bought it for a birthday gift. I haven&#x27;t given it yet, but I think she is going to love it.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful! shortened the headband by snipping off at the comb on the metal band. Better fit for anyone without the comb. However very delicate, bends easily where rhinestones are attached if pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this tiara! It arrived on time and is just beautiful! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a gorgeous and inexpensive tiara!</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed piece of costume jewelry in an adult size. It is large and noticeable on an adult, and would be too large and heavy for a child for the most part. It looks far more expensive than it is and would be perfect as the prize for a local pageant or prom queen, but since it is so inexpensive would also work well for a &amp;#34;queen for a day&amp;#34; scenario like a (grown-up) birthday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by no means constructed to hold up to the abuse a youngster would dish out on it. It is delicate like most jewelry in that the metal has soldering points in it so you do have to treat this type of thing with respect and not throw it around, and is not meant for daily wear... but it would still fare well through an occasional whoopsie-it-fell-off.</li>
            <li> the little 5 year old girl who is a princess is really a princess now!</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my mom to wear on her 90th Birthday party......She was the Queen of the ball</li>
            <li> Much more than I expected , pefect , cute and stylish</li>
            <li> This is not a toy, adult size and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in place on your head.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but beautiful</li>
            <li> Bought this tiara because I wanted rhinestones and this one is definitely a charmer!  The quality and appearance are superior and, in our woman&#x27;s group, we enjoy presenting awards while wearing this tiara.  It does run large.</li>
            <li> Looks better in person! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this tiara. The detail was so great for the price! It was well made and we presented the tiara&#x27;s onstage, they really stood out in pictures and could be seen over the winner&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Great tiara, very heavy in weight!</li>
            <li> perfect look but little small for adult. very nice tiara for any princess. HEAVY</li>
            <li> Got this for my Auntie to wear at the renaissance festival she looked great in it and it stood up to her knocking it off, sitting on it and a day at the fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a strong enough metal to last a long time and you can gently bend it to fit your head. It does sit high enough on the head to been seen well, even in blond hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great for this tiara/crown and we got it in a few days. If you are looking for one get this one.</li>
            <li> The size is temporarily adjustable. I know they probably wouldn&#x27;t state that in its description since you can probably break it. I will say that the product is very sturdy and I don&#x27;t see it breaking anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my toddler&#x27;s photoshoot and it turned out great. Normally it wouldn&#x27;t fit on her head but an adults&#x27;, but if you squeeze it for a bit, it will stay to that size for a few minutes and it&#x27;ll go back to its original size later.&lt;br /&gt;In the picture, the Tiara looks so gorgeous. No need to buy diamonds for something like this. It did a great job at making her feel like a princess for the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEEEE MY TIARA!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Good quality piece.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but does not fit on 4 year olds head without falling off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, my 7 year old daughter loves it and I was very impressed with how carefully it was packed to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> It was bigger and a lot heavier then I had expected.It is very beautiful though and sparkles a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter and it is so big that she couldn&#x27;t wear it. I tried bending it but it just ended up cracking. I wish I knew that it was adult sized. The look tiara was pretty but my daughter was very disappointed that she could not wear it to her party.</li>
            <li> I love it I love it! BIG and Fabulous!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome. And such great quality for the price! Definitely an adult sized tiara.</li>
            <li> This tiara was every thing I expected. It is beautiful. I purchased it for my grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Great Quality :)  A little big for 8 year old.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Miss Teen</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece especially for the price. But it is way too large and heavy for preschool princess granddaughters.&lt;br /&gt;For Quincera or adult use, would be special.</li>
            <li> Give me my crown B*t!h!!! Hahahahahha. Sooo cute. Slightly light weight but it will due. I&#x27;m pleased♡</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 16th birthday, she wore it all day long. It&#x27;s got nice sparkle to it and it made well!</li>
            <li> Better quality than expected, as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Excellently packed and arrived perfectly!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Even cuter in person.</li>
            <li> Not cheap looking....very elegant for the price.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our granddaughter and the top rhinestone Tiara piece broke away from the headband within the first week.</li>
            <li> This is actually really pretty. Personally wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything other than costume wear. It was surprisingly comfortable and not super stiff like I have seen others to be.</li>
            <li> beautiful crown for a beautiful princess</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for, pretty much</li>
            <li> photo does not do it justice..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. You get what you see, a great looking and sparkling tiara.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable for kids. Poked their heads &amp; couldn&#x27;t get them to wear them even to take a picture :(</li>
            <li> The top part almost broke of. It was bent when i received it.the diameter was too big.</li>
            <li> It really looks great will serve it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my grandmother&#x27;s 80th Birthday. It was perfect and beautiful! I got a lot of people who asked me where I got it and then after the party I got even more people who asked me if they could borrow it!</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  Very nicely done and it is good quality for the price. Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  Arrived in a very timely manner as well.  Great service!  I will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful my daughter will be wearing it for her Princess Ball on next Saturday.....it&#x27;s really sparkly just the way I wanted it.....</li>
            <li> Was more then I expected. Was the right size and was shipped fast and properly.</li>
            <li> The tiara was much prettier than I expected.  The quality of the product also exceeded my expectations considering the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. It is BEAUTIFUL!  I can&#x27;t wait to watch her face as she opens it Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> This was for a Halloween costume and it was great.  Not like the cheap plastic ones, but still inexpensive for a child to wear for fun</li>
            <li> Great value and very pretty!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and a great price!!</li>
            <li> Got my package on time and very safely. Tiara was well padded with bubble wrap and wrapped in a bag. It was MUCH better quality than I thought it would be because it was so inexpensive but my expectations were really blown out of the water. I would say that the part of the crown that fits around your head is an adult medium to large and the part where are all the rhinestones is probably about the same. This tiara is made of metal and it has a good weight (heavier on the end with all the rhinestones, obviously). The rhinestones sparkle beautifully.This was the best deal I&#x27;ve found on amazon on rhinestone tiaras and was definitely worth my money. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The tiara was a little big for my daughter, but it is a lovely piece, and there are ways to fix that.  Overall, it is as lovely as the picture.  We are very happy with the quality for the price.  This was prepared very nicely for shipping and arrived in perfect condition.  Would buy another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this crown to be used for Prom Queen and it was even larger than expected (which was perfect).</li>
            <li> Very good value for the price. Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this tiara for my niece&#x27;s Sweet 16 Birthday Party and it was even more beautiful in person!  Perfect size... not too small, though not too big, either.  Fast shipping and it was packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Just what I hoped it would be. Just live it.  Quality made and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> We were very happy it looked beautiful on my granddaughter in the parade</li>
            <li> a bit chintzy but I knew that going into it</li>
            <li> Product -Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt; delivery - on time</li>
            <li> Loved it fit great very pretty</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Well packaged.  Very beautiful.  Little large for my 3-year-old grand-daughter.</li>
            <li> Fit for the princesses I bought it for.</li>
