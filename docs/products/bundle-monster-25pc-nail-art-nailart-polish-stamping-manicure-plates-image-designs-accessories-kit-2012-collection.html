            <li>pe one paisely and not all of them, which doesn&#x27;t look that nice.</li>
            <li>I feel like I got a good deal, too, because the konad plates cost more</li>
            <li>This would have been another nice thing just to include in the side notes.</li>

            <li>This is by far the best set of disks</li>
            <li>I find that so far the MASH brand plates to be of the best quality.  </li>

            <li>I was very excited to get this set, the designs are amazing, but once I tried them, they don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>they have such beautiful designs....</li>
            <li>Great quality, packaged well, fast shipping, love the images (especially the holiday ones) press on nicely.</li>
            <li>A lot of the images are too fine for the polish to pick up, but not these.</li>
            <li>There are so many cute and pretty designs, cant wait to try them.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to arrive to see if that will make a difference in the finely etched plates.</li>
            <li>They all work fine.</li>
            <li>I received a damaged plate, but it was replaced quickly with no hassle!</li>
            <li>Super creative.</li>
            <li>Came quickly in the mail!</li>
            <li>They do have super cute designs, however, just not my thing.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>good range of new designs, overall I am happy with the plates, I have had no problems with the ones I have tried as yet</li>
            <li>The plates are wonderful with so many designs its hard to choose where to start.</li>
            <li>Well etched, transfer precisely, every intricate detail shows up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the konad double sided stamper and it works great.</li>
            <li>Free shipping also bonus.</li>
            <li>amazing details!very fast</li>
            <li>Great purchase for a nail polish junkie such as myself.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>LIke most sets sold, not every plate is stampable but enough of them are so that it is still good for the price.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>At first I was looking at buying the new Mash plates, but then I saw these and just loved so many of the images</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rocket science, ladies, but you have to make sure you&#x27;re doing it right.</li>
            <li>And their designs are really fun!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this because I had been wanting to do nail stamping for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I was so excited I just finish stamping each and every design onto a sheet of paper just to see the designs come out.</li>
            <li>, I was excited to get my kit, congratulations</li>
            <li>If you have any problems, you can contact them and I&#x27;m pretty sure they will solve it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>but I love some of the designs so much!</li>
            <li>The new holiday ones are nice.</li>
            <li>but I think I liked the 2nd set better.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my new stamping set in the mail, having already owned and LOVED the first Bundle Monster set.</li>
            <li>Overall - buy right away, great product.</li>
            <li>I eventually figured out that if I scraped the plate VERY lightly, my stamper would pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li>However I have used many of the images and they stamp very well.</li>
            <li>these are average size with paper for backing and the images transfer beautifully</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;tip\\&quot; images very often, but the one&#x27;s that I have, are mostly from this set.  </li>
            <li>Love them really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these plates as much as I&#x27;d like to because they are more time consuming than I thought they would be</li>
            <li>some worked full image.</li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast.</li>
            <li>I have 2 other sets of Bundle Monster discs and this one is another great set.</li>
            <li>I hope came more new plates on the future!&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li>I recently got back into stamping &amp; these work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I do hope they get more creative on the next.</li>
            <li>Only 1 defect, but customer service was great and they promise to replace my plate very</li>
            <li>They quickly responded and will send replacements for the plates that are not working.</li>
            <li>A quick youtube video search showed me all the plates.</li>
            <li>I did have a problem wth three plates, but Bundle Monster quickly replaced the damaged plates.  </li>
            <li>Once I figured it out, I quickly got the hang of it</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Customer Service acted on it quick.</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service, they responded quickly.</li>
            <li>If you love nail art, than I highly recommend these</li>
            <li>But these make a really fantastic, crisp image.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that they actually listen and appreciate their customers.</li>
            <li>It is nice not to have just the same old designs recycled again and again - that being said if the quality of the plates improved these would be amazing.</li>
            <li>This has made me consider buying more plates when they release new sets.</li>
            <li>I love the new images.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try that out first.  </li>
            <li>I just cannot say enough about how much I love these!</li>
            <li>Raves for bundle monster on being the first to design the plate binder too!</li>
            <li>They ship free and arrive super fast.</li>
            <li>It certainly did not affect my ability to use the plates or the appearance of the images, and I still say this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li>and there are several nice designs to pick from&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a pueen set, but really am not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>This really is a nice set, but the issue with the larger designs made me rate it 4 stars</li>
            <li>But well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the only ones I own.</li>
            <li>not six days!&lt;br /&gt;Plates are really nice, designs look bigger than BM2</li>
            <li>This is good for me since I have wide nails.  </li>
            <li>Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li>So far I love them.</li>
            <li>this set is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great way to get a variety of design to keep nails different and just plain nice.</li>
            <li>The quality of the plates feel amazing, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some other brands I have.</li>
            <li>There are some image repeats from other manufacturers but all images tested well with good detail.</li>
            <li>Daughter loved these along with other tools I purchased for her nails.  </li>
            <li>not as good as some other plates i have</li>
            <li>I recomend using the special polishes for stamping for most images, some will work with regular polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve start stamping right away.</li>
            <li>They responded right away and replaced the defected plate.</li>
            <li>I like how large the full plates are.</li>
            <li>Shipping lasted 1 month, but it was worth it ;)</li>
            <li>these are fun and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I did have to get a few plates replaced because they weren&#x27;t deep enough and wouldn&#x27;t transfer; but customer service was absolutely wonderful and made this process very easy.</li>
            <li>I really like these plates, each image that I&#x27;ve used has been clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>I have all 3 of the BM sets now, and you do have to learn the right way of using the plates, some images are very detailed and you may need to use a different stamper than just the Konad type.</li>
            <li>The images are cute and they transfer very well, unlike the old sets.</li>
            <li>Floral, amazing hearts, geometric, seasonal/holiday, tip, and misc single images.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend them to any nail art enthusiast !</li>
            <li>It has been a learning experience and very much trial and error.</li>
            <li>The images are better etched, larger and stamp easily and clear.</li>
            <li>and I loved them so much that I ordered the other 2 sets that bundle monster sells as well.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful that you thoroughly clean the more intricate designs thoroughly as it will affect your stamping.</li>
            <li>This is my first BM set and now I will be ordering set one since I hear they have been upgraded and I like the designs.</li>
            <li>I proceeded to test my favorite images the same evening.  </li>
            <li>At first, parts of it weren&#x27;t picking up</li>
            <li>Would most definitely order from Bundle Monster again.</li>
            <li>First experiance with them</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t get over how fast I recieved them!</li>
            <li>These were my first stamp plates</li>
            <li>Love the prints but a bit short for my nail plate</li>
            <li>way better than last years</li>
            <li>collection and images are bigger so it covers more of your lovely nails instead of having to double stamp and chance ruining your mani!!</li>
            <li>Very recommended item!</li>
            <li>but my friend has these exact ones</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to everyone love</li>
            <li>I love a lot of the images, I&#x27;m still experimenting with all the different designs.</li>
            <li>what I was doing (first time stamper).</li>
            <li>Pretty fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I love the different images that are in all the collection.</li>
            <li>and I like this one better because the images are larger.  </li>
            <li>This is my first set of stamping plates.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>There are just so many different styles.. and even ones that work together, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>The images are so pretty</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s difficult to get the perfect stamp.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of Nail Art Stamping plates.  </li>
            <li>I like the designs but unfortunately not all work.</li>
            <li>when you first get them, I know it sounds like a lot of work</li>
            <li>Stamp very well!</li>
            <li>I had purchased the 2012 Bundle Monster 25 piece nail art stamping image plates for a few designs that I had loved.</li>
            <li>These plates are large, clear, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was a little unsure about this set because of some of the reviews and reports of plates that didn&#x27;t work and needed to be replaced, but I loved the designs so much I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>They really should be engraved deeper so the designs are sure to be solid.</li>
            <li>The most frustrating nail plates we own.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 1 plate so far, but the images were nicely etched.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice balance between small and  large images, tips  and full nail designs.</li>
            <li>These plates had such an amazing variety, covered my ENTIRE nail plus some, and transferred in tact on the first try!</li>
            <li>This new set of nail stamping plates has been a lot of fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Protective film came off easy enough.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set to anyone who is an avid nail art stamper, or new to stamping!</li>
            <li>the same time did just fine.</li>
            <li>some of the big images with fine lines doesn&#x27;t transfer really well</li>
            <li>I have a few of the different collections, and they are all have a great selection of images within each set.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>and I can not believe how fast these shipped from Hawaii to the South East US.</li>
            <li>monster.con Mundle use economic enamels, Cutex, avon and china glaze, but with the monster Mundle</li>
            <li>I got such fantastic customer support from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>once in a while one or two impressions out of the whole bundle do not work....</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to do.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to.</li>
            <li>So much for your money.</li>
            <li>Wish I had gotten this much sooner.</li>
            <li>The plates stamp very well.</li>
            <li>Price is excellent compared to Konad brand plates, but I feel the quality suffers because of this.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of tutorials on youtube that are very helpful.</li>
            <li>So overall I enjoy this product and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and she is really into making nail designsl  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The quality of the plates are much improved.</li>
            <li>I really like Konad plates</li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll still replace them after you&#x27;ve had them for a few months, so just make sure to test them right away.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when it showed up 2 days earlier than said.</li>
            <li>Other images are cute &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li>I was at first shocked, and then impressed when my package came all the way from Hawaii...</li>
            <li>The main reason why I chose these plates is because the pattern designs cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li>I tested all of my plates with several different nail polishes and all the images came out great except the beautiful owls on plate 309 :(</li>
            <li>Crisp clear images.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I have to buy from Spain is very complicated, but everything was amazing with Bundle Monster!!!</li>
            <li>Full image covers the entire nail.</li>
            <li>A little flap which sticks out would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures come off quite ok.</li>
            <li>I also have the previous 25pc set of plates and this one is much better.</li>
            <li>I originally only got 24 of the 25 plates, but i messaged the seller &amp; they quickly sent the remaining plate.</li>
            <li>I have several sets from various companies, and I find myself using my Bundle Monster set most often.  </li>
            <li>The blue protective film seems a bit more tacky then necessary</li>
            <li>well i also use different nail polishes other than the konad special polish they work fine.</li>
            <li>item arrived right before I expected, was well worth it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just has described, I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>khbk high bi but bib</li>
            <li>So I guess that if you decide to give this a shot (I might sound repetitive, I know), the designs are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Most stamped satisfactorily, but had particular trouble with the &amp;#34;big toe&amp;#34; designs.</li>
            <li>I have read some reviews stating that you need special nail polish, but I have found that as long as the polish is not translucent, it works well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was free and they even came 2 days sooner than the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this set, I didn&#x27;t even realize it didn&#x27;t come with a stamper until I read a few more reviews in detail.</li>
            <li>Bm 303 305 and 308 doesn&#x27;t work well, the rest is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I recommend this stamping plates since the rest are sharp and fine.</li>
            <li>, i can live with it.</li>
            <li>I had one bent plate &amp; Bundle Monster sent me a new one within days, after I emailed them.</li>
            <li>New at this nail stamping.</li>
            <li>Just an FYI to anyone new to stamping....</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m still new to nail stamping</li>
            <li>so far I can&#x27;t get a decent transfer off one.  </li>
            <li>I owned two sets of BM&#x27;s stamping plates and based on the high ratings I decided to complete my collection with 2013 and 2014 series.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, only 5 days!  </li>
            <li>It is practically the first place I go in my storage drawer when trying to find inspiration for my next mani.</li>
            <li>This is a VAST improvement from their first set of plates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: BM stamping plates are much better quality than other Konad generic brand that I have.</li>
            <li>I tried the other plates and most of them are not etched deep enough and I shouldn&#x27;t have to struggle on getting the image to come out in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new stamper, so this is the only set I own, other than several Konad plates.</li>
            <li>Little plastic box was cracked, but plates were fine.</li>
            <li>So bear in mind that even if you have bad luck and get a defective set, you can get them replaced, their customer service is very good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so disappointing because the designs are great.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t got to try all the plates yet, but the few I have tried have worked great, it definitely takes practice so don&#x27;t get discouraged if your having trouble</li>
            <li>The images are clear, none in all 25 plates was defective.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money purchasing these.</li>
            <li>I did take the blue tape off, I tried using a credit card instead of the scraper, I filed my Konad Stamper, and I tried using different angles of scraping and different polishes but for some reason, no matter how lightly I scrape, I can not get the images to stamp, let alone get onto my nail.</li>
            <li>The quality of these plates is better than expected: all of them have backing, and the borders are not too sharp.</li>
            <li>Designs seem larger than the ones from earlier sets, and the designs are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li>All of the large designs printed very well, just maybe 1 or 2 of the little designs, didn&#x27;t do too well, but it could of been due to polish or I just got tired, lol.  </li>
            <li>Full nail designs work well with my nails beds with a little patience (I have wider nail beds).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the plates and will definitely order from Bundle Monster again.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to stamping and so far have tried Red Angel, Konad, Mash, and now Bundle Monster plates.</li>
            <li>Each design is large enough (pattern designs) to completely cover any nail, so there is no worry about needing to do a second that needs to be lined up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are not deep enough or what, but there are designs and entire plates that I absolutely cannot pick up any color!!</li>
            <li>They are a little bigger than other brands designs and give good coverage of the entire nail.  </li>
            <li>I have small hands, but I find the designs fit quite well.</li>
            <li>and had new plates out the next day.</li>
            <li>, I tried with different types of nail polishes, and the image doesn&#x27;t come up completely!</li>
            <li>The plates are not sharp at the edges.</li>
            <li>Three other friends of mine all ordered them after playing with mine to see if they could really stamp without issues, and they did!</li>
            <li>Even conad much inferior to them, many small figures conad still misfire and not fully translated.</li>
            <li>I finally got them today and immediately tested the images that I intended to use frequently.</li>
            <li>Kind of sad,</li>
            <li>There is something for everyone in this set, Holidays, year-round designs, flowers, full-nail images, geometric, and just plain fun smiley faces and paisleys.  </li>
            <li>The first few uses I had no idea</li>
            <li>The bad thing about a few of the plates, the \\&quot;love\\&quot; plates,  was that they did not transfer well to the stamper with any kind of special polish or polish.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The designs in this set are amazing.</li>
            <li> We are experienced stampers and while these images look fantastic they do not stamp well at all.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE AN AMAZING WAY to make your nails fancy without spending $60 at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own a Konad plate and it was $6 just for one plate</li>
            <li> Nice designs</li>
            <li> I really like most of the images!!!!</li>
            <li> They have great customer service, more than I can say for another company that sells plate bundles &amp; claims they have 100% customers satisfied.</li>
            <li> pe one paisely and not all of them, which doesn&#x27;t look that nice.</li>
            <li> I feel like I got a good deal, too, because the konad plates cost more</li>
            <li> This would have been another nice thing just to include in the side notes.</li>
            <li> so that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Really nice bundle for the price</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are pretty good, this set has a great range of designs.</li>
            <li> The plates are great quality and have a ton of really cool designs.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best set of disks</li>
            <li> I find that so far the MASH brand plates to be of the best quality.  </li>

            <li> I was glad to have so many, but they just do not come out as nice as the konad plates.  </li>

            <li> Great purchase for a nail polish junkie such as myself.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> LIke most sets sold, not every plate is stampable but enough of them are so that it is still good for the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> At first I was looking at buying the new Mash plates, but then I saw these and just loved so many of the images</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rocket science, ladies, but you have to make sure you&#x27;re doing it right.</li>
            <li> And their designs are really fun!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this because I had been wanting to do nail stamping for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited I just finish stamping each and every design onto a sheet of paper just to see the designs come out.</li>
            <li> , I was excited to get my kit, congratulations</li>
            <li> If you have any problems, you can contact them and I&#x27;m pretty sure they will solve it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> but I love some of the designs so much!</li>
            <li> The new holiday ones are nice.</li>
            <li> but I think I liked the 2nd set better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new stamping set in the mail, having already owned and LOVED the first Bundle Monster set.</li>
            <li> Overall - buy right away, great product.</li>
            <li> I eventually figured out that if I scraped the plate VERY lightly, my stamper would pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li> However I have used many of the images and they stamp very well.</li>
            <li> these are average size with paper for backing and the images transfer beautifully</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;tip\\&quot; images very often, but the one&#x27;s that I have, are mostly from this set.  </li>
            <li> Love them really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these plates as much as I&#x27;d like to because they are more time consuming than I thought they would be</li>
            <li> some worked full image.</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other sets of Bundle Monster discs and this one is another great set.</li>
            <li> I hope came more new plates on the future!&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> I recently got back into stamping &amp; these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I do hope they get more creative on the next.</li>
            <li> Only 1 defect, but customer service was great and they promise to replace my plate very</li>
            <li> They quickly responded and will send replacements for the plates that are not working.</li>
            <li> A quick youtube video search showed me all the plates.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem wth three plates, but Bundle Monster quickly replaced the damaged plates.  </li>
            <li> Once I figured it out, I quickly got the hang of it</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Customer Service acted on it quick.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service, they responded quickly.</li>
            <li> If you love nail art, than I highly recommend these</li>
            <li> But these make a really fantastic, crisp image.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that they actually listen and appreciate their customers.</li>
            <li> It is nice not to have just the same old designs recycled again and again - that being said if the quality of the plates improved these would be amazing.</li>
            <li> This has made me consider buying more plates when they release new sets.</li>
            <li> I love the new images.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to try that out first.  </li>
            <li> I just cannot say enough about how much I love these!</li>
            <li> Raves for bundle monster on being the first to design the plate binder too!</li>
            <li> They ship free and arrive super fast.</li>
            <li> It certainly did not affect my ability to use the plates or the appearance of the images, and I still say this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> and there are several nice designs to pick from&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pueen set, but really am not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> This really is a nice set, but the issue with the larger designs made me rate it 4 stars</li>
            <li> But well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the only ones I own.</li>
            <li> not six days!&lt;br /&gt;Plates are really nice, designs look bigger than BM2</li>
            <li> This is good for me since I have wide nails.  </li>
            <li> Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> So far I love them.</li>
            <li> this set is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great way to get a variety of design to keep nails different and just plain nice.</li>
            <li> The quality of the plates feel amazing, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some other brands I have.</li>
            <li> There are some image repeats from other manufacturers but all images tested well with good detail.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved these along with other tools I purchased for her nails.  </li>
            <li> not as good as some other plates i have</li>
            <li> I recomend using the special polishes for stamping for most images, some will work with regular polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve start stamping right away.</li>
            <li> They responded right away and replaced the defected plate.</li>
            <li> I like how large the full plates are.</li>
            <li> Shipping lasted 1 month, but it was worth it ;)</li>
            <li> these are fun and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I did have to get a few plates replaced because they weren&#x27;t deep enough and wouldn&#x27;t transfer; but customer service was absolutely wonderful and made this process very easy.</li>
            <li> I really like these plates, each image that I&#x27;ve used has been clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> I have all 3 of the BM sets now, and you do have to learn the right way of using the plates, some images are very detailed and you may need to use a different stamper than just the Konad type.</li>
            <li> The images are cute and they transfer very well, unlike the old sets.</li>
            <li> Floral, amazing hearts, geometric, seasonal/holiday, tip, and misc single images.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend them to any nail art enthusiast !</li>
            <li> It has been a learning experience and very much trial and error.</li>
            <li> The images are better etched, larger and stamp easily and clear.</li>
            <li> and I loved them so much that I ordered the other 2 sets that bundle monster sells as well.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful that you thoroughly clean the more intricate designs thoroughly as it will affect your stamping.</li>
            <li> This is my first BM set and now I will be ordering set one since I hear they have been upgraded and I like the designs.</li>
            <li> I proceeded to test my favorite images the same evening.  </li>
            <li> At first, parts of it weren&#x27;t picking up</li>
            <li> Would most definitely order from Bundle Monster again.</li>
            <li> First experiance with them</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t get over how fast I recieved them!</li>
            <li> These were my first stamp plates</li>
            <li> Love the prints but a bit short for my nail plate</li>
            <li> way better than last years</li>
            <li> collection and images are bigger so it covers more of your lovely nails instead of having to double stamp and chance ruining your mani!!</li>
            <li> Very recommended item!</li>
            <li> but my friend has these exact ones</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone love</li>
            <li> I love a lot of the images, I&#x27;m still experimenting with all the different designs.</li>
            <li> what I was doing (first time stamper).</li>
            <li> Pretty fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I love the different images that are in all the collection.</li>
            <li> and I like this one better because the images are larger.  </li>
            <li> This is my first set of stamping plates.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> There are just so many different styles.. and even ones that work together, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> The images are so pretty</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to get the perfect stamp.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of Nail Art Stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> I like the designs but unfortunately not all work.</li>
            <li> when you first get them, I know it sounds like a lot of work</li>
            <li> Stamp very well!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the 2012 Bundle Monster 25 piece nail art stamping image plates for a few designs that I had loved.</li>
            <li> These plates are large, clear, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about this set because of some of the reviews and reports of plates that didn&#x27;t work and needed to be replaced, but I loved the designs so much I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> They really should be engraved deeper so the designs are sure to be solid.</li>
            <li> The most frustrating nail plates we own.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 1 plate so far, but the images were nicely etched.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice balance between small and  large images, tips  and full nail designs.</li>
            <li> These plates had such an amazing variety, covered my ENTIRE nail plus some, and transferred in tact on the first try!</li>
            <li> This new set of nail stamping plates has been a lot of fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Protective film came off easy enough.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set to anyone who is an avid nail art stamper, or new to stamping!</li>
            <li> the same time did just fine.</li>
            <li> some of the big images with fine lines doesn&#x27;t transfer really well</li>
            <li> I have a few of the different collections, and they are all have a great selection of images within each set.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> and I can not believe how fast these shipped from Hawaii to the South East US.</li>
            <li> monster.con Mundle use economic enamels, Cutex, avon and china glaze, but with the monster Mundle</li>
            <li> I got such fantastic customer support from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> once in a while one or two impressions out of the whole bundle do not work....</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to do.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to.</li>
            <li> So much for your money.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten this much sooner.</li>
            <li> The plates stamp very well.</li>
            <li> Price is excellent compared to Konad brand plates, but I feel the quality suffers because of this.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of tutorials on youtube that are very helpful.</li>
            <li> So overall I enjoy this product and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and she is really into making nail designsl  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The quality of the plates are much improved.</li>
            <li> I really like Konad plates</li>
            <li> Arrived fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll still replace them after you&#x27;ve had them for a few months, so just make sure to test them right away.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when it showed up 2 days earlier than said.</li>
            <li> Other images are cute &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I was at first shocked, and then impressed when my package came all the way from Hawaii...</li>
            <li> The main reason why I chose these plates is because the pattern designs cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li> I tested all of my plates with several different nail polishes and all the images came out great except the beautiful owls on plate 309 :(</li>
            <li> Crisp clear images.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I have to buy from Spain is very complicated, but everything was amazing with Bundle Monster!!!</li>
            <li> Full image covers the entire nail.</li>
            <li> A little flap which sticks out would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures come off quite ok.</li>
            <li> I also have the previous 25pc set of plates and this one is much better.</li>
            <li> I originally only got 24 of the 25 plates, but i messaged the seller &amp; they quickly sent the remaining plate.</li>
            <li> I have several sets from various companies, and I find myself using my Bundle Monster set most often.  </li>
            <li> The blue protective film seems a bit more tacky then necessary</li>
            <li> well i also use different nail polishes other than the konad special polish they work fine.</li>
            <li> item arrived right before I expected, was well worth it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just has described, I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> khbk high bi but bib</li>
            <li> So I guess that if you decide to give this a shot (I might sound repetitive, I know), the designs are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Most stamped satisfactorily, but had particular trouble with the &amp;#34;big toe&amp;#34; designs.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews stating that you need special nail polish, but I have found that as long as the polish is not translucent, it works well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was free and they even came 2 days sooner than the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this set, I didn&#x27;t even realize it didn&#x27;t come with a stamper until I read a few more reviews in detail.</li>
            <li> Bm 303 305 and 308 doesn&#x27;t work well, the rest is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I recommend this stamping plates since the rest are sharp and fine.</li>
            <li> , i can live with it.</li>
            <li> I had one bent plate &amp; Bundle Monster sent me a new one within days, after I emailed them.</li>
            <li> New at this nail stamping.</li>
            <li> Just an FYI to anyone new to stamping....</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m still new to nail stamping</li>
            <li> so far I can&#x27;t get a decent transfer off one.  </li>
            <li> I owned two sets of BM&#x27;s stamping plates and based on the high ratings I decided to complete my collection with 2013 and 2014 series.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, only 5 days!  </li>
            <li> It is practically the first place I go in my storage drawer when trying to find inspiration for my next mani.</li>
            <li> This is a VAST improvement from their first set of plates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: BM stamping plates are much better quality than other Konad generic brand that I have.</li>
            <li> I tried the other plates and most of them are not etched deep enough and I shouldn&#x27;t have to struggle on getting the image to come out in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new stamper, so this is the only set I own, other than several Konad plates.</li>
            <li> Little plastic box was cracked, but plates were fine.</li>
            <li> So bear in mind that even if you have bad luck and get a defective set, you can get them replaced, their customer service is very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so disappointing because the designs are great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got to try all the plates yet, but the few I have tried have worked great, it definitely takes practice so don&#x27;t get discouraged if your having trouble</li>
            <li> The images are clear, none in all 25 plates was defective.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money purchasing these.</li>
            <li> I did take the blue tape off, I tried using a credit card instead of the scraper, I filed my Konad Stamper, and I tried using different angles of scraping and different polishes but for some reason, no matter how lightly I scrape, I can not get the images to stamp, let alone get onto my nail.</li>
            <li> The quality of these plates is better than expected: all of them have backing, and the borders are not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Designs seem larger than the ones from earlier sets, and the designs are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> All of the large designs printed very well, just maybe 1 or 2 of the little designs, didn&#x27;t do too well, but it could of been due to polish or I just got tired, lol.  </li>
            <li> Full nail designs work well with my nails beds with a little patience (I have wider nail beds).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the plates and will definitely order from Bundle Monster again.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to stamping and so far have tried Red Angel, Konad, Mash, and now Bundle Monster plates.</li>
            <li> Each design is large enough (pattern designs) to completely cover any nail, so there is no worry about needing to do a second that needs to be lined up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are not deep enough or what, but there are designs and entire plates that I absolutely cannot pick up any color!!</li>
            <li> They are a little bigger than other brands designs and give good coverage of the entire nail.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands, but I find the designs fit quite well.</li>
            <li> and had new plates out the next day.</li>
            <li> , I tried with different types of nail polishes, and the image doesn&#x27;t come up completely!</li>
            <li> The plates are not sharp at the edges.</li>
            <li> Three other friends of mine all ordered them after playing with mine to see if they could really stamp without issues, and they did!</li>
            <li> Even conad much inferior to them, many small figures conad still misfire and not fully translated.</li>
            <li> I finally got them today and immediately tested the images that I intended to use frequently.</li>
            <li> Kind of sad,</li>
            <li> There is something for everyone in this set, Holidays, year-round designs, flowers, full-nail images, geometric, and just plain fun smiley faces and paisleys.  </li>
            <li> The first few uses I had no idea</li>
            <li> The bad thing about a few of the plates, the \\&quot;love\\&quot; plates,  was that they did not transfer well to the stamper with any kind of special polish or polish.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that some of the plates can be used to make designs similar to gradient, water marble and crackle nail art without all the hassle and mess.</li>
            <li> The images come out clear and the tip designs are large enough to fit on artificial nails too!  </li>
            <li> only complaint (not enough of a complaint to take the rating down to 4 stars) is that some of the more detailed images were actually very difficult to clean the polish out of after I was finished.</li>
            <li> First of all I got these plates late</li>
            <li> A lot of those type of manicures are very messy to create, and since I have been stamping for over a year, they are much easier for me to create with a stamp.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with transfering images and the image not being large enough for my nail or only transfering half an image.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t comment often, but I always read reviews before purchasing so when I find something that is exceptionally good or bad I like to comment for other buyers.</li>
            <li> I love owls, so this was really disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I needed several tries to get some of the images stamped correctly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*As some other reviewers have mentioned, you have to remove the blue plastic coating for the plates to work</li>
            <li> I have not tried every single plate</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these plates but was severely disappointed when over 3/4 of the designs do not work!  </li>
            <li> The wrapping is a little tough to deal with but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I can only get e little part of the design on my nails.</li>
            <li> They come packed in a little box, with a blue plastic cover protecting each one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They really stand behind these plates.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than i expected.</li>
            <li> but it takes 4o tries just to get an acceptable image stamped, these are one shot images.</li>
            <li> I have wide nails</li>
            <li> Has a wide variety of images to choose from.</li>
            <li> This was not a huge problem, as it just cost me an extra minute or two wiping the plates down with polish remover when I was done, but it stood out to me because it was not a problem that I had run into with any other brands like MASH or Konad.</li>
            <li> I have konad plates and chekeey and any q what happened to me with the other boards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of luck with other plates but the two Bundle Monster sets I purchased gave me nothing but duds.  </li>
            <li> and/or the other sets bundle monster sells.</li>
            <li> I have the other 2 sets</li>
            <li> And other brands of dancing plates.</li>
            <li> I have the other sets</li>
            <li> so I have to stamp twice when using my other plates.</li>
            <li> The blue film wasn&#x27;t hard at all to take off.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, they are not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I am still learning how to use them especially the images with thick lines and shapes.</li>
            <li> Plastic a little harder to peel off on this set than the previous two though, but no biggie!</li>
            <li> but I have tried about half and</li>
            <li> but for less than a dollar a plate as oppossed to eight dollars a plate for konad</li>
            <li> I had read previous reviews</li>
            <li> Also less \\&quot;filler\\&quot; designs in this set.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to stamp than the previous version.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in one week even though it was ordered on black Friday.</li>
            <li> It takes a few attempts to get the technique down..</li>
            <li> I had a plate that was giving me trouble</li>
            <li> I keep my collection of round image plates in a small spice tin.</li>
            <li> So far I was correct, I&#x27;ve used approximately 75% of them and only about 2 came out bad</li>
            <li> This is why I am not sure if I am ever going to order BM plates again...</li>
            <li> I wound up looking online to find instructions from a random blog on how to go about performing the actual stamping process.</li>
            <li> The images were to small for me...</li>
            <li> They work really well and for the price you can&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is hard to decide on a star rating ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to decide which one to use...</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t test every image, I tested at least one on almost every plate.</li>
            <li> There is not one disk that I can&#x27;t think of a use for at least a couple of the images.</li>
            <li> Now that I bought them, I think the negative reviews probably just didn&#x27;t know how to use the plates.</li>
            <li> but they are at the least $5 per plate.</li>
            <li> Always go with a thick, opaque one.</li>
            <li> and I thought maybe it was too shallow for all of the image to stick to the stamper, but</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are too shallow to pick up.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the salon express stamper and plates and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> But for some reason, I can not get any of the images to stamp, the plates are too shallow and the nail polish comes off when I scrape off the excess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in depth of the etchings or anything, so maybe low ratings got a bad batch</li>
            <li> Some of the plates are not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously ordered the [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]] and was disappointed by the small size of the designs and shallow etching of the designs.</li>
            <li> I only had 3 out of 6 designs on a plate work :(</li>
            <li> and I had to try different ways to scrape and still it doesn&#x27;t come out well :(</li>
            <li> BM-309 replaced since I was having a very hard time picking up either image.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same stupid mistake I made.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> If the stamp is too thin then the nail polish gets stuck in the stamp.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy these because I always read the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to take off the protecting foil.</li>
            <li> I was initially wary of ordering this set.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong ordering these.</li>
            <li> it came out looking so faint</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone who loves doing nails, even if you think youre not good at it TO BUY THESE plates!!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and I will be contacting Bundle Monster, but I have heard from other customers that they are difficult to speak with and they will not help with exchanges.</li>
            <li> a must have for my fellow nail obsessed gals/guys!</li>
            <li> so it made stamping very difficult (and the plates were scratched up as well).</li>
            <li> but some of the designs are impossible to use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about BM.</li>
            <li> Guess I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> SMH, its too bad....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found one design yet that allowed for a bad stamp.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that some of the plates that didn&#x27;t work well were the ones that  had caught my eye and made me purchase this set.</li>
            <li> youre addicted!!!</li>
            <li> 3.... 4.... two of my plates were unusable which is annoying</li>
            <li> the truth is that I had a very bad experience with these placas.no reach 10 q realmenten motifs to stamp out the nail, and that I use china glaze enamels.</li>
            <li> or I had a very bad nail polish or something because no color was picking up, so I went and tried on Konad and Mash plates</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed in the quality of these plates.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is comparable to Konad. I own a Konad plate and it was $6 just for one plate so when I found these I was sceptical. But these make a really fantastic, crisp image. And their designs are really fun!</li>
            <li> Efficacy of stamp patterns is inconsistent and most do not pick up regardless of the stamper or polish used, which the Konad I also ordered @ the same time did just fine. $ and time thrown away? This seller doesn&#x27;t offer the option of contacting them either. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I just got my plates in the mail yesterday and was sooo excited to try them! The shipping was free and they even came 2 days sooner than the expected delivery date.  There are so many great images in this set! I tested all of them and they all stamp perfectly and the images are very crisp and clean. I have so many mani ideas I may just change them everyday.lol</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome. I cant wait to use them all! There a great addition to the ones I already have. Thanks so much. Cant wait for the nest set!</li>
            <li> Got my plates Monday and already tried out the way too cute owl designs. It worked like a charm. This is my first BM set and now I will be ordering set one since I hear they have been upgraded and I like the designs. Set 2 does not appeal to me so will be skipping that one. Great job BM and I can not believe how fast these shipped from Hawaii to the South East US. You all rock!!</li>
            <li> Majority are not etched property for image transfer.</li>
            <li> Love the selection of images contained within this bundle!</li>
            <li> Another Bundle Monster set has not disappointed!  I owned two sets of BM&#x27;s stamping plates and based on the high ratings I decided to complete my collection with 2013 and 2014 series.  The shipping was very fast, only 5 days!  I proceeded to test my favorite images the same evening.  The reviews are very accurate!  These plates are fantastic!  Well etched, transfer precisely, every intricate detail shows up. I very highly recommend them to any nail art enthusiast !</li>
            <li> I really like these plates, each image that I&#x27;ve used has been clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> I placed my order on the 29th, and received my plates on the 23rd! I am very excited to have this newest set to add to my growing collection. These plates stamp very well, have a great variety of designs... Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> the truth is that I had a very bad experience with these placas.no reach 10 q realmenten motifs to stamp out the nail, and that I use china glaze enamels. I have konad plates and chekeey and any q what happened to me with the other boards monster.con Mundle use economic enamels, Cutex, avon and china glaze, but with the monster Mundle I can not lift any injured diseño.una porq have beautiful drawings and I see many videos of girls q and use it come out perfect, maybe I get my defective.</li>
            <li> Loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use with great design!&lt;br /&gt;You will have fun while you doing nail stamping artwork!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping with good value product! Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about this set because of some of the reviews and reports of plates that didn&#x27;t work and needed to be replaced, but I loved the designs so much I decided to go for it. I finally got them today and immediately tested the images that I intended to use frequently. I am happy to say that not only did they all stamp perfectly but they are even more lovely than the sample image provided here makes them appear. They are very detailed and I&#x27;m very excited about the designs. Though I didn&#x27;t test every image, I tested at least one on almost every plate. The only problem I had was with the diagonal border pattern on the left side of plate 323. At first, parts of it weren&#x27;t picking up and I thought maybe it was too shallow for all of the image to stick to the stamper, but I eventually figured out that if I scraped the plate VERY lightly, my stamper would pick up the whole image. With that, I had no problem picking up images from any of the plates I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (not enough of a complaint to take the rating down to 4 stars) is that some of the more detailed images were actually very difficult to clean the polish out of after I was finished. This was not a huge problem, as it just cost me an extra minute or two wiping the plates down with polish remover when I was done, but it stood out to me because it was not a problem that I had run into with any other brands like MASH or Konad. It certainly did not affect my ability to use the plates or the appearance of the images, and I still say this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
            <li> These images plates are great! I wish I had ordered a better stamper, i have reordered a better stamper since and it will be here soon. The designs on these plates are a good option when I just do not have time to hand paint art onto my nails ....which I love to do...but I have a feeling I am going to paint and use these images together. Great service too! Arrived in record time!</li>
            <li> These plates work great. I received a damaged plate, but it was replaced quickly with no hassle! I love Bundle Monsters quality. I think they make the best plates!</li>
            <li> Everything was sooooo perfect!!! Sometimes when I have to buy from Spain is very complicated, but everything was amazing with Bundle Monster!!!</li>
            <li> When I look at these plates, my heart skips a beat. I remember that day when I got that long-awaited parcel and ran home. I&#x27;m so glad that I have these plates - it&#x27;s the best thing I could try. Even conad much inferior to them, many small figures conad still misfire and not fully translated. The Bundle Monster I am delighted, all her friends and to you the reader hyped too unequivocally advise to get his pet Monster ^ _ ^</li>
            <li> Ordered on Friday, arrived Monday. Little plastic box was cracked, but plates were fine. Tested all images and needed 9 plates replaced. Customer service was the best. Answered my email in under 12 hrs. and had new plates out the next day. They arrived in 3 days and were perfect. I have a lot of plates, and I realize that within each brand, now and then, you get a dud plate or two. I got such fantastic customer support from Bundle Monster. They really stand behind these plates. Cute designs, larger full nail images, nice backing, plastic comes off easy, great customer support if you have any problems. This is my third set, and I will purchase the next set if they develope one. Great Value.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about BM. These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast. Always packed well, and always awesome images.&lt;br /&gt;Two more sets to go and I will have them all.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BM</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and free to boot A+++!!!! Love all the images! Haven&#x27;t tried to see how they all trasfer yet so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars. So far so good. Would most definitely order from Bundle Monster again. First experiance with them and it was a good one!!! I still can&#x27;t get over how fast I recieved them!</li>
            <li> I could never get these to work. 2 friends of mine tried neither of them were able to get these to work either.</li>
            <li> This set is excellent. The designs all stamp well and there are several nice designs to pick from&lt;br /&gt;and you can not beat the price for how many plates are included.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got to try all the plates yet, but the few I have tried have worked great, it definitely takes practice so don&#x27;t get discouraged if your having trouble just keep trying. I&#x27;m using the konad double sided stamper and it works great. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of luck with other plates but the two Bundle Monster sets I purchased gave me nothing but duds.  I have not tried every single plate but I have tried about half and so far I can&#x27;t get a decent transfer off one.  It&#x27;s so disappointing because the designs are great.</li>
            <li> Super creative. Love it. Wish it came with a case tho.</li>
            <li> These plates are great! I recently got back into stamping &amp; these work perfectly. I have a pueen set, but really am not crazy about it. A lot of the images are too fine for the polish to pick up, but not these. I originally only got 24 of the 25 plates, but i messaged the seller &amp; they quickly sent the remaining plate. Great service &amp; quality. I just wish they came in a holder, like the pueen set, instead of a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Great designs, loved the variety of designs in the plates, very fun to use with friends and family!, me and my little sister love using these designs :D!</li>
            <li> Lots of images to choose from. The wrapping is a little tough to deal with but worth the effort. Not all images are my style but that&#x27;s the breaks when you buy a set like this. I enjoy most of them. Good investment.</li>
            <li> for the price, excellent value. once in a while one or two impressions out of the whole bundle do not work....but for less than a dollar a plate as oppossed to eight dollars a plate for konad, i can live with it. I have 75 Bundle Monster plates.</li>
            <li> I love all the designs that I can do on my nails. It makes it so much easier to do.</li>
            <li> Ive started using stamping plates in the salon more.  I was glad to have so many, but they just do not come out as nice as the konad plates.  They really should be engraved deeper so the designs are sure to be solid.</li>
            <li> Grate plates, beautiful designs, work nice, this set made me soooooo happy, it have a lot of designs to try and experiment</li>
            <li> These were my first stamp plates so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to. However I have used many of the images and they stamp very well. Crisp clear images. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently received a nail stamper for Christmas and ordered these plates. Received them today... I love the designs and the stamps look great on my nails!</li>
            <li> Great quality and image selection</li>
            <li> These designs were quirky and holiday themed. Most stamped satisfactorily, but had particular trouble with the &amp;#34;big toe&amp;#34; designs. There was often excess polish on the plate after scraping, and as a result the designs were often blurred. Hopefully they have resolved this with subsequent releases. This really is a nice set, but the issue with the larger designs made me rate it 4 stars</li>
            <li> Love the prints but a bit short for my nail plate So need to be creative</li>
            <li> Quality is great! So much for your money. I use them all the time and there is a design for every holiday!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best set of disks I have-to date. It seems there is an image for every occasion....OK.....almost all of them.....I didn&#x27;t get a pot of gold  :)  There is not one disk that I can&#x27;t think of a use for at least a couple of the images. It&#x27;s a nice balance between small and  large images, tips  and full nail designs. Wish I had gotten this much sooner.</li>
            <li> Love the Plates, looking for more in 2014! Nice designs</li>
            <li> Love this set. It is practically the first place I go in my storage drawer when trying to find inspiration for my next mani.</li>
            <li> Designs are great for your nails.</li>
            <li> I love it!  The images come out clear and the tip designs are large enough to fit on artificial nails too!  Came quickly in the mail!</li>
            <li> The designs are have a good range. The plates are etched well as always they are paper backed and come with a plastic film to keep them from getting damaged in transit. The plates stamp very well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this because I had been wanting to do nail stamping for quite some time. I had read previous reviews so I knew there was the possibility that all the plates may not work. I was disappointed to find out that some of the plates that didn&#x27;t work well were the ones that  had caught my eye and made me purchase this set. Price is excellent compared to Konad brand plates, but I feel the quality suffers because of this. I would purchase from Bundle Monster again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year ole daughter.  She absolutely loved it.  It is easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Bm 303 305 and 308 doesn&#x27;t work well, the rest is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I recommend this stamping plates since the rest are sharp and fine.</li>
            <li> I really like most of the images!!!! some of the big images with fine lines doesn&#x27;t transfer really well, I tried with different types of nail polishes, and the image doesn&#x27;t come up completely!</li>
            <li> Horrible. Others have been pleased. Guess I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I just received this set, it was purchased for me as a gift, by my daughter &amp; son-in-law through amazon.  I was so excited I just finish stamping each and every design onto a sheet of paper just to see the designs come out. I am very happy with this set.  All of the large designs printed very well, just maybe 1 or 2 of the little designs, didn&#x27;t do too well, but it could of been due to polish or I just got tired, lol.  Just has described, I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> LIke most sets sold, not every plate is stampable but enough of them are so that it is still good for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these recently and I loved them so much that I ordered the other 2 sets that bundle monster sells as well. The plates are great quality and have a ton of really cool designs. They are really easy to use once you get the hang of it. There are a lot of tutorials on youtube that are very helpful. These are really great and I get so many compliments on my nail designs. If you love nail art, than I highly recommend these and/or the other sets bundle monster sells. They are all awesome. They ship free and arrive super fast. Very happy! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As some other reviewers have mentioned, you have to remove the blue plastic coating for the plates to work*</li>
            <li> loved, arrived super quick, recommend... item arrived right before I expected, was well worth it, I was excited to get my kit, congratulations</li>
            <li> BM obviously listens and takes to heart what their customers want. This is a VAST improvement from their first set of plates. The designs in this set are amazing. Definitely better quality in designs themselves, as well as the plates. In my last set, some of the plates were warped/damaged. Also less \\&quot;filler\\&quot; designs in this set. A must-have for any nail art enthusiast. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Free shipping also bonus. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This new Bundle Monster is gorgeous!! I love it!! way better than last years collection and images are bigger so it covers more of your lovely nails instead of having to double stamp and chance ruining your mani!!</li>
            <li> Great plates! Very recommended item! amazing details!very fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;this is the second bundle I ordered. I hope came more new plates on the future!&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> I have all 3 of the BM sets now, and you do have to learn the right way of using the plates, some images are very detailed and you may need to use a different stamper than just the Konad type. I recomend using the special polishes for stamping for most images, some will work with regular polishes. I had one bent plate &amp; Bundle Monster sent me a new one within days, after I emailed them. They have great customer service, more than I can say for another company that sells plate bundles &amp; claims they have 100% customers satisfied.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time. Image designs looked awesome! I had purchased the 2012 Bundle Monster 25 piece nail art stamping image plates for a few designs that I had loved. Another reason I had liked the plates was for the reason that the nail art looked great on \\&quot;Pinterest, but I did not quite get that effect. The bad thing about a few of the plates, the \\&quot;love\\&quot; plates,  was that they did not transfer well to the stamper with any kind of special polish or polish. I only had 3 out of 6 designs on a plate work :(</li>
            <li> I love stamping my nails.  I have the other 2 sets so I had to get the 3rd.  I like how large the full plates are. I do hope they get more creative on the next. The new holiday ones are nice. Glad I got it but I think I liked the 2nd set better. Happy Stamping to all.</li>
            <li> The most frustrating nail plates we own.  We are experienced stampers and while these images look fantastic they do not stamp well at all.  I wish I had returned them!  Do not buy, they are not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> However, not all of the stamps work. If the stamp is too thin then the nail polish gets stuck in the stamp. Kind of sad, but my friend has these exact ones and I knew what to expect. So overall I enjoy this product and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these plates but was severely disappointed when over 3/4 of the designs do not work!  I find that so far the MASH brand plates to be of the best quality.  Do not waste your money purchasing these.</li>
            <li> These plates are a good addition for any Nail Art Lover out there.  There are some image repeats from other manufacturers but all images tested well with good detail.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone love their plates images pick up great love this product got here in time</li>
            <li> The plates are wonderful with so many designs its hard to choose where to start. Shipping to canada was fantastic and they have wonderful customer support.  Will be placing another order in 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality. The plates are not sharp at the edges. A bit difficult to take off the protecting foil. A little flap which sticks out would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures come off quite ok. However, the designs are too big for my nails. This is not about the length of the nails, but about the width. I can only get e little part of the design on my nails. pe one paisely and not all of them, which doesn&#x27;t look that nice. I won&#x27;t be able to use about 1/3 of the plates, becaues of this. This includes all the plates for tips and some others which have designs which are way too big. This was quite disapointing. This is why I am not sure if I am ever going to order BM plates again...</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster provided great customer service and a professional attitude.They offer great products and I will shop with them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve start stamping right away. Great product! Full image covers the entire nail. Only 1 defect, but customer service was great and they promise to replace my plate very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I received the replacement 2 days later, everything is fine, truly great service!</li>
            <li> H khb khb bkj hbjh bh bkj bib k khb khb khb khbk high bi but bib khb khbk jh khb</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this set, the designs are amazing, but once I tried them, they don&#x27;t work very well. I don&#x27;t know if they are not deep enough or what, but there are designs and entire plates that I absolutely cannot pick up any color!! I was beginning to think I had ruined my stamper or I had a very bad nail polish or something because no color was picking up, so I went and tried on Konad and Mash plates and I got things perfectly. So, not all the designs work, I recommend you try Shany or Mash if you&#x27;re looking for cheaper alternatives to Konad. They are all sold here in Amazon too. Anyway, the designs are so gorgeous that I decided to contact Bundlemonster and let them know my problem with 10 plates. They quickly responded and will send replacements for the plates that are not working. So I guess that if you decide to give this a shot (I might sound repetitive, I know), the designs are very pretty. So bear in mind that even if you have bad luck and get a defective set, you can get them replaced, their customer service is very good. This has made me consider buying more plates when they release new sets.</li>
            <li> I was initially wary of ordering this set. I&#x27;d previously ordered the [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]] and was disappointed by the small size of the designs and shallow etching of the designs. I&#x27;m happy to report that is not the case here! I&#x27;ve had virtually no problems using this set at all. I particularly like the fact that some of the plates can be used to make designs similar to gradient, water marble and crackle nail art without all the hassle and mess. This set belongs in everyone&#x27;s nail stamping arsenal.</li>
            <li> I love bundle monster! Everything I&#x27;ve ever gotten from them is the best! These plates are awesome and are just as good as the konad but half the price! I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different Bundle Monster plates. And other brands of dancing plates. these are average size with paper for backing and the images transfer beautifully</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy these because I always read the negative reviews. Now that I bought them, I think the negative reviews probably just didn&#x27;t know how to use the plates. It&#x27;s not rocket science, ladies, but you have to make sure you&#x27;re doing it right. A quick youtube video search showed me all the plates. I feel like I got a good deal, too, because the konad plates cost more but THEY ARE THE SAME. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in depth of the etchings or anything, so maybe low ratings got a bad batch but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love a lot of the images, I&#x27;m still experimenting with all the different designs. and I love the price! $21 dollars for 25 image plates is a real good deal. The blue film wasn&#x27;t hard at all to take off.</li>
            <li> I use nail image plates every week. I have several sets from various companies, and I find myself using my Bundle Monster set most often.  The images stamp clear and crisp and the designs are great! There is something for everyone in this set, Holidays, year-round designs, flowers, full-nail images, geometric, and just plain fun smiley faces and paisleys.  I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;tip\\&quot; images very often, but the one&#x27;s that I have, are mostly from this set.  I would recommend this set to anyone who is an avid nail art stamper, or new to stamping!</li>
            <li> but some of the designs are impossible to use</li>
            <li> So many great designs.</li>
            <li> These nail plates are fantastic!  I did have a problem wth three plates, but Bundle Monster quickly replaced the damaged plates.  I a am delighted!</li>
            <li> These are great designs however some don&#x27;t always work which is a bummer... im still trying them all out and I hope the majority of them work well...</li>
            <li> so  i love the images they work well i also use different nail polishes other than the konad special polish they work fine.</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t stop using it</li>
            <li> Last year I purchased bundle monster and was very happy so this year I knew I had to order it. The designs are great and the image plates themselves are awesome. Most of my plates were working but I had problems with some so I contacted Bundle Monster and they shipped out more plates. I was very pleased that they actually listen and appreciate their customers. The quality of the plates feel amazing, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some other brands I have. They work really well and for the price you can&#x27;t be disappointed. If you have any problems, you can contact them and I&#x27;m pretty sure they will solve it.</li>
            <li> good range of new designs, overall I am happy with the plates, I have had no problems with the ones I have tried as yet so fingers crossed the rest will be as good.</li>
            <li> Is great lots of stamps good quality came on time</li>
            <li> I have bought different stamping plates from different companies and I have found that with Bundle Monster not everyone works.</li>
            <li> New at this nail stamping. But plates look awesome and work great so far.</li>
            <li> Again, it was a Xmas gift for my grandaughter and she is really into making nail designsl  She loves it.,</li>
            <li> I have 2 other sets of Bundle Monster discs and this one is another great set. The quality of the dscs are great and Bundle Monster&#x27;s service is outstanding. Very pleased with every order I&#x27;ve placed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been very happy with the plates I received. I did not give this product 5 stars because I wish it came with instructions. The first few uses I had no idea what I was doing (first time stamper). When I purchased this set, I didn&#x27;t even realize it didn&#x27;t come with a stamper until I read a few more reviews in detail. This would have been another nice thing just to include in the side notes. I wound up looking online to find instructions from a random blog on how to go about performing the actual stamping process. Once I figured it out, I quickly got the hang of it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over than that, I have been very happy with this product. It came very quickly and was in excellent condition as well. It is definitely something that takes practice and patience. But well worth it in the end. I have read some reviews stating that you need special nail polish, but I have found that as long as the polish is not translucent, it works well.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter will love this set. she is forever doing nails. her enjoyment will be totally fullfilling&lt;br /&gt;i will be buying more</li>
            <li> Bundle monster did way better with their packaging since their first set of plates but as always their plates were just amazing. Many many cute designs I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!! Pretty fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when it showed up 2 days earlier than said. I&#x27;ve only used 1 plate so far, but the images were nicely etched. Other images are cute &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about my nails. Women I do not even know want to pay me to do their nails : )</li>
            <li> its just perfect....just love it......I have plenty of different images that I can use for different nail design.....perfect condition....highly recommended it.......</li>
            <li> I use the Shany stamping plates and these ones do the job just as well. I would recommend to anyone who loves stamping.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a while back. I really enjoy these plates! Bundle Monster has great images and are very well etched. These aren&#x27;t the only ones I own. I think I have all of their plates! I love love love them!! :D</li>
            <li> Awesome unique manicures without the cost. Match outfit or mood at any moment.  So many complements. With practice and patience you become a pro!</li>
            <li> Ended up selling these.  The images were to small for me...but all in all its a good product.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Daughter loved these along with other tools I purchased for her nails.  I also found a pouch that would hold these plus many more.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Great Selection of images. I have a few of the different collections, and they are all have a great selection of images within each set.</li>
            <li> Love them really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to receive these in six days! I ordered from the UK on a Sunday and was expecting them to arrive in three weeks not six days!&lt;br /&gt;Plates are really nice, designs look bigger than BM2 so that was a nice surprise. The blue protective film seems a bit more tacky then necessary but maybe it&#x27;s like that so you appreciate each plate more!</li>
            <li> It is hard to decide on a star rating ... 3.... 4.... two of my plates were unusable which is annoying but I love some of the designs so much! It is nice not to have just the same old designs recycled again and again - that being said if the quality of the plates improved these would be amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my set for a week and I love it! I&#x27;m a new stamper, so this is the only set I own, other than several Konad plates. At first I was looking at buying the new Mash plates, but then I saw these and just loved so many of the images, I bought this set instead. Shipping was quick. My set got shipped out on Tuesday from Hawaii and I received them in Northern VA last Friday.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the image quality and also with Bundle Monster. I tested all of my plates with several different nail polishes and all the images came out great except the beautiful owls on plate 309 :( I love owls, so this was really disappointing for me. I had read that Bundle Monster&#x27;s customer service was excellent, so I wrote them asking if their was anyway I could have plate BM-309 replaced since I was having a very hard time picking up either image. I received a response several hours later from Bundle Monster apologizing for the defective plate and thanked me for giving them the opportunity to fix the problem. They are sending me another plate and said I should receive it in 4 to 7 days yay! Now that&#x27;s great customer service!!!! If you are debating ordering this set, I say go for it! These plates are really great for the price and they stamp great. The hardest choice for me was picking which image to use first lol. I highly recommend the plates and will definitely order from Bundle Monster again.</li>
            <li> I love it....... I&#x27;m waiting to try them. Thanks. I love the different images that are in all the collection. Hope tomorrow can try them.</li>
            <li> These plates are very nice.  I have the other sets and I like this one better because the images are larger.  This is good for me since I have wide nails.  There are so many cute and pretty designs, cant wait to try them.  I received them in 5 days of ordering.  This price is great compared to Konad.  You can&#x27;t go wrong ordering these.</li>
            <li> This new set of nail stamping plates has been a lot of fun to play with. Designs seem larger than the ones from earlier sets, and the designs are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> Ok, these didn&#x27;t work for me as we&#x27;ll as it did for others so I gave them away to my BFF. The designs on this set are sweeeeeeet!!!!!!! I tried to make them work but found stamping with RA, Cheeky, and of curse Konad was much better. I may buy them again though and see if I can make them work for me. I love their designs!!</li>
            <li> Some of the plates are not good. The images wont go onto the stamper, most of the images that work are not my style. So I end up giving it away to someone...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them all yet, but cute designs, great variety! I have small hands, but I find the designs fit quite well.</li>
            <li> Pros: Product arrived in 3 business days. Ordered on Friday, arrived on Tuesday. The quality of the plates are much improved. The design are really cute and suitable for lots of occassion. I find it easier to stamp than the previous version. I owned the 2011 BM plates.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I did find 6 plates that needed replacment. Some of the designs are too shallow to pick up. Customer Service acted on it quick. Except they only sent 5 out of the 6 plates I requested...I figure there is no point calling again...&lt;br /&gt;Overall: BM stamping plates are much better quality than other Konad generic brand that I have. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster has great products and great customer service!!!! They stand by their products 100%. These plates have great varity and work great! I had a plate that was giving me trouble and I contacted Bundle Monster. They responded right away and replaced the defected plate. I have purchased from them and will continue to buy from them!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of stamping plates. With that in mind, I needed several tries to get some of the images stamped correctly. I am still learning how to use them especially the images with thick lines and shapes. But overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the salon express stamper and plates and was not impressed. Most of the images wouldn&#x27;t transfer. I thought I would try Bundle Monster out for better results. I am in love. There are so many designs to choose from and all the ones I have tried so far transfer perfectly. Of course it all depends on what polish you use to stamp with. Always go with a thick, opaque one. I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I am really pleasantly suprised with this BM set. I also have the previous 25pc set of plates and this one is much better. The images are cute and they transfer very well, unlike the old sets. I also think they are a tad bigger. Overall - buy right away, great product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite set of stamping plates.  If you follow up on all the differnt styles of manicures (eg: saran wrap manicure, crackle manicure, water marble manicure, newspaper manicure, gradient manicure), there is a stamp in this set for each one of those. A lot of those type of manicures are very messy to create, and since I have been stamping for over a year, they are much easier for me to create with a stamp.  I have also gotten a lot of use out of the awareness ribbons, especially since I work in a doctor&#x27;s office.  This is definately a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; set.</li>
            <li> The plates in this set are great. There&#x27;s a lot of variety here. Just an FYI to anyone new to stamping.... the blue part comes off. Don&#x27;t make the same stupid mistake I made. It peels off!</li>
            <li> I love these nail design plates. There are just so many different styles.. and even ones that work together, if that makes sense. With practice I am getting better and better at using them all the time. I hope to be able to add to my collection.  I was at first shocked, and then impressed when my package came all the way from Hawaii... lol Cool!  They packaged them up securely and all were in perfect shape, the order took no time at all to be processed and was on the way.</li>
            <li> I love these plates. i recently bought the 2011 collection and i loved those so much i was so happy to hear that 2012 was coming out so soon.&lt;br /&gt;All of my plates worked just perfect and it is a GREAT buy. Shipping was faster than i expected. Ordered it at midnight when they came out and it was in my mailbox by 3 days. i would reccomend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new stamping set in the mail, having already owned and LOVED the first Bundle Monster set. The designs were beautiful and unique. But for some reason, I can not get any of the images to stamp, the plates are too shallow and the nail polish comes off when I scrape off the excess. I did take the blue tape off, I tried using a credit card instead of the scraper, I filed my Konad Stamper, and I tried using different angles of scraping and different polishes but for some reason, no matter how lightly I scrape, I can not get the images to stamp, let alone get onto my nail. I am very disappointed and I will be contacting Bundle Monster, but I have heard from other customers that they are difficult to speak with and they will not help with exchanges. I hope for the best.</li>
            <li> This set contains a great selection of full-sized images. Great quality, I had no issues transferring the images onto the stamper.</li>
            <li> These plates are BM best plates yet! The images are better etched, larger and stamp easily and clear. I love full image designs and this set is full of them!!! Three other friends of mine all ordered them after playing with mine to see if they could really stamp without issues, and they did! I ordered this one and the 2012 Mash set and both sets are fabulous!</li>
            <li> So I made another review on another set I bought from Bundle Monster and if you&#x27;re considering in buying these then I hope you get a better set. First of all I got these plates late and when I finally got it the plates came in a plastic ziplock type bag instead of a box that is pictured above. This set I got was not etched well so it made stamping very difficult (and the plates were scratched up as well). The images are so pretty and I especially loved plate BM311 so I was excited to try that out first.  Buuuuut.....it came out looking so faint and I had to try different ways to scrape and still it doesn&#x27;t come out well :( I tried the other plates and most of them are not etched deep enough and I shouldn&#x27;t have to struggle on getting the image to come out in the first place. SMH, its too bad.... Im very disappointed in the quality of these plates.</li>
            <li> I very happy with my product and happy with everything that I brought thru them. I look forward to do bussiness again with them.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone who loves doing nails, even if you think youre not good at it TO BUY THESE plates!!  It takes a few attempts to get the technique down.. but once you do.. youre addicted!!! THEY ARE AN AMAZING WAY to make your nails fancy without spending $60 at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am eager for the next set of designs!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great sturdy plates. Protective film came off easy enough. Designs are adorable. Haven&#x27;t found one design yet that allowed for a bad stamp. Full nail designs work well with my nails beds with a little patience (I have wider nail beds). Love this set and recommend.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in one week even though it was ordered on black Friday. Plates were beautiful, with no scratches. Further&lt;br /&gt;investigation is required as a couple seem to not be etched as deep as the others.  Currently waiting for my konad polish&lt;br /&gt;to arrive to see if that will make a difference in the finely etched plates.</li>
            <li> I´m very happy, all the plates are in perfect condition and the designs are beautiful. Excellent Bundle Monster. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Beyond my expectations! These plates are large, clear, and easy to use.  Each design is large enough (pattern designs) to completely cover any nail, so there is no worry about needing to do a second that needs to be lined up.  A+, great product.  I&#x27;m never doing decals again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> I love the 2012 Bundle Monster stamping plate set!  The designs are awesome.  They are a little bigger than other brands designs and give good coverage of the entire nail.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what Bundle Monster comes up with for 2013!</li>
            <li> Wowee, they&#x27;re really cute and the ideas for nail art designs are just pouring in.  Really nice bundle for the price</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to stamping and so far have tried Red Angel, Konad, Mash, and now Bundle Monster plates. It has been a learning experience and very much trial and error. I have had trouble with transfering images and the image not being large enough for my nail or only transfering half an image. These plates are AMAZING!!!!!! The price can&#x27;t be beat! I really like Konad plates but they are at the least $5 per plate. These plates had such an amazing variety, covered my ENTIRE nail plus some, and transferred in tact on the first try! The images are detailed and unlike some(red angel) that are more detailed but it takes 4o tries just to get an acceptable image stamped, these are one shot images. I just cannot say enough about how much I love these! You get a variety of images. Floral, amazing hearts, geometric, seasonal/holiday, tip, and misc single images. I don&#x27;t comment often, but I always read reviews before purchasing so when I find something that is exceptionally good or bad I like to comment for other buyers. The seller was great and the plates arrived in two days!! Def a must have for my fellow nail obsessed gals/guys!</li>
            <li> I love these plates, fortunatly no scratches or damages. Shipping lasted 1 month, but it was worth it ;)&lt;br /&gt;Already made a lot of designs.. love them all, they are soooooo gorgeus!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast but i&#x27;m still new to nail stamping so the designs are cute i tried the breast cancer ribbon one but somehow when i scraped the polish which i used the Konad one its just all gone i guess the engraving not deep enough or something&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway will try more practicing and hopefully all the plates will work beautifully</li>
            <li> The quality of these plates is better than expected: all of them have backing, and the borders are not too sharp. The images are clear, none in all 25 plates was defective. They come packed in a little box, with a blue plastic cover protecting each one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought all 3 sets (2010, 1011 &amp; 2012), and I&#x27;m not regretting it!</li>
            <li> Product was great &amp; fast delivery! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these plates as much as I&#x27;d like to because they are more time consuming than I thought they would be and it&#x27;s difficult to get the perfect stamp. They do have super cute designs, however, just not my thing. They also have a tendency to get polish all over.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOve my plates...they have such beautiful designs....It&#x27;s hard to decide which one to use...they are gorgeous....and the price was just so great....I am HAPPPPY</li>
            <li> Great way to get a variety of design to keep nails different and just plain nice.</li>
            <li> Plates came quickly and they work great! NIce selection of designs and all of the designs I have tried so far stamped perfectly!</li>
            <li> The main reason why I chose these plates is because the pattern designs cover my whole nail. I have wide nails so I have to stamp twice when using my other plates. I received all of the plates in good condition with fast shipping. There were 3 plates that did not go onto the stamper, but I emailed the seller and received the replacement plates in a week. Now all of my plates stamp well and I&#x27;m very pleased with the customer service.</li>
            <li> i love this set! its awesome the designs are amazing, only 1 plate came out that didnt work but its ok</li>
            <li> OMG it so cute and worked great well almost all only some show haft of the image thought and some worked full image.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster. I have bought both their nail plate collections. I cant wait for their 2013 to be released!</li>
            <li> I purchased this bundle because it had a great price and after doing A LOT of research I concluded that this was the best one right after Konad. So far I was correct, I&#x27;ve used approximately 75% of them and only about 2 came out bad but I don&#x27;t mind since those designs aren&#x27;t my favorite. But so far I&#x27;m happy for my purchase and now I can&#x27;t stop using them, I change nail designs every week!  I can&#x27;t wait for their newest bundle!!</li>
            <li> I love the images on these plates.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the images not stamping but I&#x27;ve not tried then all yet. So far I love them.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of Nail Art Stamping plates.  I used it with the Konad stamp.  The designs are super cute, and the images transfer nicely.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for a nail polish junkie such as myself. I did have to get a few plates replaced because they weren&#x27;t deep enough and wouldn&#x27;t transfer; but customer service was absolutely wonderful and made this process very easy.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  You have to be careful that you thoroughly clean the more intricate designs thoroughly as it will affect your stamping.</li>
            <li> Well designed set. Has a wide variety of images to choose from. The plates I have used to date have stamped perfectly.A very good product. Raves for bundle monster on being the first to design the plate binder too!</li>
            <li> I like them, but most of the stamps didn&#x27;t work. I called the company they replaced the ones I was having problems with, but the same stamps had the same problems. So, I gave them to my nieces, they are just happy, so all work out.</li>
            <li> My friends all think a a wizard nail artist!! Set has lots to choose from and it&#x27;s  easy to use</li>
            <li> I like the variety of images.  I do have some difficulty at times with the image coming out properly when I stamp it.</li>
            <li> Consistently happy with my bundle monster purchases! Great quality plates. Plastic a little harder to peel off on this set than the previous two though, but no biggie!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, the images are pretty and they are working nicely &#x3D;D I would recommend this images plates &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I love the new images.  I&#x27;ve bought Bundle Monster plates before and they&#x27;re great.  Way more affordable than Konad.  Yea!  They arrived in great shape.  I keep my collection of round image plates in a small spice tin.</li>
            <li> I purchased and received my set of nail plates, most of the images didn&#x27;t work. I contacted customer service, they responded quickly. I received a replacement set within a couple of days. They all work fine. Love the images</li>
            <li> For the price, you get a lot of nail art designs.  They work just as good as the Konad.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> plaques bundle monster.&lt;br /&gt;De quoi faire de superbes manucures. La livraison a été beaucoup plus rapide que prévue. La qualité est vraiment bonne.</li>
            <li> Great quality, packaged well, fast shipping, love the images (especially the holiday ones) press on nicely. Note: it takes some practice before you can get a perfect stamped image on the stamper (even with the Konad Stamper) so dont give up too soon.</li>
            <li> La calidad en inferior al segundo paquete del cual estoy encantada, a favor dir&amp;eacute; que los dise&amp;ntilde;os son preciosos y las estoy utilizando un monton.</li>
            <li> I like the designs but unfortunately not all work. Compared to the sets of Konad image plates this set is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are pretty good, this set has a great range of designs. I had issues with a couple of the plates not transferring, but Bundle Monster replaced the immediately. So I&#x27;d say test ALL the plates out when you first get them, I know it sounds like a lot of work but it&#x27;s good to make sure right away so you can let the company know. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll still replace them after you&#x27;ve had them for a few months, so just make sure to test them right away. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m taking one star off.</li>
            <li> these are fun and they work pretty well. not as good as some other plates i have but i still like them. for the price don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal!! Stamp very well! I had one plate that did not stamp well and I emailed them about it. They sent out a replacement plate immediately. Great business and great product! Would defiantly recommend to anyone and buy from again!</li>
