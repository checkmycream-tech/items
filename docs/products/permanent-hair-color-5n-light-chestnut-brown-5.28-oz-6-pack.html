            <li>works great, thanks for a natural effective product</li>
            <li>Great color and grey coverage, love the multi-pack.  </li>
            <li>super deal for these prise!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous</li>
            <li>Now, a word of warning--I use 5N, which is supposed to be \\&quot;Light Chestnut</li>
            <li>I sent the company an e-mail, which they replied to with the speed of light.</li>
            <li>Such a great product .</li>
            <li>Leaves hair lustrous and as a importantly</li>
            <li>The 5N Light Chestnut color works well.</li>
            <li>This gives a good coverage with a natural color look.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and my hair seems healthier and shinier than with other hair coloring products I have used.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheaper from whole food ,where you can fine one for $18, so happy that i found it here for that prise.</li>
            <li>Strong consistent color - much darker color than expected but beautiful rich color!</li>
            <li>and I use Naturetint to color my hairline in-between full color jobs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new formula is even better.</li>
            <li>No terrible smell, and my hair is soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>Love this natural color!</li>
            <li>Shipping was as expected with good packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my hair and scalp and I am able to use it on my new growth every month with no issues.</li>
            <li>After changing tones every 6 months, I now feel that I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use with no mess.</li>
            <li>- the beauty of this hair color is that there is no harsh chemical odor or burning which is important to me - because I also had a hair transplant in 2012...</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I pay more than double for this at health food stores.  </li>
            <li>We all love the results and the relative safety of the product, compared to mainstream hair colors.</li>
            <li>We like Naturtint 5N better than its competitor, Herbatint 5N because it is not as dark as Herbatint and looks more natural.</li>
            <li>too dark for my dark brown hair but excellent product</li>
            <li>wish the color would last a bit longer, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good and lasts long enough too.</li>
            <li>only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that I would lose more hair than normal after I was Naturtint off during after-application wash.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a cheap haircolor mixing bowl at a beauty supply, and it REALLY improves the consistency and the color application.</li>
            <li>Not the real one I have been using for quite a while.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of hair color.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling silky and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Buying this product in bulk makes it so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Trying to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my hair from so many years of using other chemical hair color products.</li>
            <li>The color is great and lasts just as long as the harsh products.  </li>
            <li>It cover well over older colors.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as commercial products, but it also doesn&#x27;t make clumps of my hair brush out, so it&#x27;s a fair trade.</li>
            <li>and I want to protect my new head.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 6 pack of light brown and when I opened the box to do my hair about a month later, I noticed that the actual color inside the box was labeled ash blond.</li>
            <li>(and I am very sensitive to perfumes, dyes, and chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives it a very natural look.</li>
            <li>The box and actual dye are consistent; however, the color bottle is mislabeled.</li>
            <li>I just find the medium brown to be dark the lighter brown too light.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully gentle yet effective way to color your hair without ammonia or other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>soft hair the day after coloring</li>
            <li>No harsh smell or chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Same product, but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my husband who had sensitive skin reactions to stronger color products.</li>
            <li>sAys that its natural but contains some chemicals that are harmful</li>
            <li>My hair looks natural after coloring.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for nearly two years.</li>
            <li>Look old.</li>
            <li>Use it because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit dark at first, however, after a week the color looks and stays vibrant.  </li>
            <li>it covers grey very well</li>
            <li>fades rather fast and must leave on for a long time</li>
            <li>I have been buying the same product from Whole foods market for double the prize.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve had better color results with a few other products, (as well as with professional color), this is the ONLY color that I use now, because it is the only color I have found that gives me complete grey coverage without a FOUL ODOR or scalp</li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but I think I&#x27;ve tried every &#x27;natural&#x27; hair color on the market, and this one is the best--richest color, longest lasting.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Product purchased from this supplier in bulk is less than half the price you pay in the store + free shipping.</li>
            <li>Color is vibrant and lasts as well as other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because sometimes the grey hair at the roots on his forehead don&#x27;t completely take the color.</li>
            <li>&quot; but I have found that the actual color is closer to Medium Brown, especially if I leave it on as long as I have to to completely cover my stubborn greys (about 45 minutes on the roots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of hair color.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling silky and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Buying this product in bulk makes it so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Trying to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my hair from so many years of using other chemical hair color products.</li>
            <li> The color is great and lasts just as long as the harsh products.  </li>
            <li> It cover well over older colors.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as commercial products, but it also doesn&#x27;t make clumps of my hair brush out, so it&#x27;s a fair trade.</li>
            <li> and I want to protect my new head.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 6 pack of light brown and when I opened the box to do my hair about a month later, I noticed that the actual color inside the box was labeled ash blond.</li>
            <li> (and I am very sensitive to perfumes, dyes, and chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives it a very natural look.</li>
            <li> The box and actual dye are consistent; however, the color bottle is mislabeled.</li>
            <li> I just find the medium brown to be dark the lighter brown too light.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully gentle yet effective way to color your hair without ammonia or other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> soft hair the day after coloring</li>
            <li> No harsh smell or chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Same product, but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my husband who had sensitive skin reactions to stronger color products.</li>
            <li> sAys that its natural but contains some chemicals that are harmful</li>
            <li> My hair looks natural after coloring.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for nearly two years.</li>
            <li> Look old.</li>
            <li> Use it because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit dark at first, however, after a week the color looks and stays vibrant.  </li>
            <li> it covers grey very well</li>
            <li> fades rather fast and must leave on for a long time</li>
            <li> I have been buying the same product from Whole foods market for double the prize.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve had better color results with a few other products, (as well as with professional color), this is the ONLY color that I use now, because it is the only color I have found that gives me complete grey coverage without a FOUL ODOR or scalp</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but I think I&#x27;ve tried every &#x27;natural&#x27; hair color on the market, and this one is the best--richest color, longest lasting.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Product purchased from this supplier in bulk is less than half the price you pay in the store + free shipping.</li>
            <li> Color is vibrant and lasts as well as other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because sometimes the grey hair at the roots on his forehead don&#x27;t completely take the color.</li>
            <li> &quot; but I have found that the actual color is closer to Medium Brown, especially if I leave it on as long as I have to to completely cover my stubborn greys (about 45 minutes on the roots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike a semi-permanent, this really covers grey (I&#x27;m about 25% grey, with shoulder-length, dark to medium brown hair).</li>
            <li> It keeps it natural looking., and it doesn&#x27;t damage the hairs as other products do.</li>
            <li> development time is longer than they say on the box, especially for grey hair</li>
            <li> just leave it on long enough)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far less harmful to your body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Complete grey coverage (IF you leave it on long enough)&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t found this I would be grey.</li>
            <li> I have about 80% grey hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Very minor though.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no problem with this as long as it saves me money.</li>
            <li> However, this &amp;#34;light chestnut&amp;#34; is darker than expected-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was brought to my attention that the reason the product is discounted is due to a labeling issue.</li>
            <li> maybe a medium to dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> The color is so so unnaturally black.</li>
            <li> Dr. Karen Sun told me to use a less toxic hair color.  </li>
            <li> So I was advised by my hair stylist to leave it on my roots for 50 - 60 minutes because grey hair is so hard to cover.</li>
            <li> Mixing colors messy.</li>
            <li> It does not wash out or dull in the five week interval before dyeing again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shade is at least 1-2 shades darker than advertised, so choose accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not good at all..doesn&#x27;t cover your Greys properly...wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all..:(</li>
            <li> It does not have that horrible chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is easy to use with no mess. No skin irritation to scalp after application, with history of eczema skin condition. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - used it many times and this seller provided a wonderful discount!</li>
            <li> too dark for my dark brown hair but excellent product</li>
            <li> Strong consistent color - much darker color than expected but beautiful rich color!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent with no peroxide or ammonia - colors evenly and lasts well into the 5th week.  Product purchased from this supplier in bulk is less than half the price you pay in the store + free shipping. I am well-satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using Naturtint for about five years.  It&#x27;s great.  It does not have that horrible chemical smell.  It covers the gray hair, leaves my hair looking and feeling great. The color is a bit dark at first, however, after a week the color looks and stays vibrant.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want to use a chemical hair color. This is the best product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very Happy with the product and shipping&lt;br /&gt;Than you.  I would like to know when this product will go on sale. Thank you</li>
            <li> love the hair color been using it for years it&#x27;s fabulous doesn&#x27;t damage my head or my hair</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any of the popular brands I&#x27;ve tried and better than having my hair done at a spa.</li>
            <li> After changing tones every 6 months, I now feel that I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> This is a great value on a multi-pack of what is now my favorite hair color. Although I&#x27;ve had better color results with a few other products, (as well as with professional color), this is the ONLY color that I use now, because it is the only color I have found that gives me complete grey coverage without a FOUL ODOR or scalp irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a semi-permanent, this really covers grey (I&#x27;m about 25% grey, with shoulder-length, dark to medium brown hair). Now, a word of warning--I use 5N, which is supposed to be \\&quot;Light Chestnut Brown\\&quot; but I have found that the actual color is closer to Medium Brown, especially if I leave it on as long as I have to to completely cover my stubborn greys (about 45 minutes on the roots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Complete grey coverage (IF you leave it on long enough)&lt;br /&gt;No foul odor&lt;br /&gt;No ammonia smell&lt;br /&gt;Nice soft hair the day after coloring&lt;br /&gt;No scalp irritation for me (and I am very sensitive to perfumes, dyes, and chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The development time is longer than they say on the box, especially for grey hair&lt;br /&gt;The shade is at least 1-2 shades darker than advertised, so choose accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I wanted to add a bit of information. I recently purchased a cheap haircolor mixing bowl at a beauty supply, and it REALLY improves the consistency and the color application. You can easily just pour the color and developer into the bowl and use a mixing brush. It has given me much more even application, and an even better benefit-- I no longer have to buy \\&quot;root touch-up\\&quot; products. I just pour one ounce of developer and one ounce of color into the mixing bowl and I use Naturetint to color my hairline in-between full color jobs. IT saves a lot of money and the reseults are better. The mixing bowl and brush cost me about $5.</li>
            <li> This color met my expectations. It cover well over older colors.</li>
            <li> The color is so so unnaturally black. Not the real one I have been using for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair color for several years already. It&#x27;s pretty good and lasts long enough too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 6 pack of light brown and when I opened the box to do my hair about a month later, I noticed that the actual color inside the box was labeled ash blond. I even opened another box and it was same issue. I sent the company an e-mail, which they replied to with the speed of light. They literally called within minutes of my leaving them an e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was brought to my attention that the reason the product is discounted is due to a labeling issue. The box and actual dye are consistent; however, the color bottle is mislabeled. I have absolutely no problem with this as long as it saves me money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like some hair color.  If I hadn&#x27;t found this I would be grey.</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but I think I&#x27;ve tried every &#x27;natural&#x27; hair color on the market, and this one is the best--richest color, longest lasting. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as commercial products, but it also doesn&#x27;t make clumps of my hair brush out, so it&#x27;s a fair trade. I&#x27;ve been using it for years; this is the best price, as it retails for twice as much at my local market.</li>
            <li> I love this!  No harsh smell or chemicals.  The color is great and lasts just as long as the harsh products.  My hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for years.</li>
            <li> I used this hair color for almost a year. I got used to applying it every 2-3 weeks and it would take me just 10 min. I also like the consistency of the final product, after 2 of the ingredients are mixed.&lt;br /&gt;The color I would get after coloring, is very nice brown. There is also a lot of shine to it which I admire.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that I would lose more hair than normal after I was Naturtint off during after-application wash.</li>
            <li> Such a great product . Leaves hair lustrous and as a importantly it covers grey very well my hair is actually white . I just find the medium brown to be dark the lighter brown too light. Mixing colors messy. Overall I&#x27;m grateful to have found it . Amazon price kicks butt xo</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product!</li>
            <li> My wife use with this product for more then 10 years. She like it.  I bought it for her. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have found this to be very good for covering my grays if I follow the directions. You have to put it on the grays, wait about ten minutes and then do the rest of your hair. It does not wash out or dull in the five week interval before dyeing again.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I wish it stays longer than 2.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Same product, but much cheaper.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Good product good vendor</li>
            <li> The color is very fit me.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for my hair. It keeps it natural looking., and it doesn&#x27;t damage the hairs as other products do.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to have this product since it is organic it the best you can ever have for hair</li>
            <li> super deal for these prise! Definitely cheaper from whole food ,where you can fine one for $18, so happy that i found it here for that prise.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this hair color.  Doesn&#x27;t smell at all, great shampoo and conditioner.  I use it every 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> Best natural hair color</li>
            <li> met our needs, will continue ordering upon require</li>
            <li> I have used Naturtint for years.  For me - being able to color my hair on my own schedule is so freeing.  I don&#x27;t have to wait to get into a salon.  And this color is easy to use.  I use 5N.  The colors run (as many have reported) a bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;But - the beauty of this hair color is that there is no harsh chemical odor or burning which is important to me - because I also had a hair transplant in 2012...and I want to protect my new head.  This is the best!!!</li>
            <li> great product fades into a blend in time</li>
            <li> I use this for my husband who had sensitive skin reactions to stronger color products. This gives a good coverage with a natural color look. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because sometimes the grey hair at the roots on his forehead don&#x27;t completely take the color. Very minor though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all who wants to make your hair beautiful. :)</li>
            <li> Great safe hair color</li>
            <li> such a great product !  I love it !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product; I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and now can buy it at a great bulk price!</li>
            <li> as always this manufacturer makes EXCELLENT products!!! the color is wonderful and natural looking. No terrible smell, and my hair is soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Permanent Hair Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied with the product ordered. Color is vibrant and lasts as well as other products I&#x27;ve used but without the harsh chemicals and intense chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. Received in two days</li>
            <li> Naturtint is very good, so I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It is not good at all..doesn&#x27;t cover your Greys properly...wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all..:(</li>
            <li> I have been buying the same product from Whole foods market for double the prize. This is the same for a fraction of the cost. I love it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> fades rather fast and must leave on for a long time</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of hair color. It&#x27;s far less harmful to your body. It leaves my hair feeling silky and very shiny. The color last too. I have about 80% grey hair. So I was advised by my hair stylist to leave it on my roots for 50 - 60 minutes because grey hair is so hard to cover. Then comb some through to the ends if you want. I actually do the roots then streak some of the color through my hair. It gives it a very natural look. This multi pack is an awesome price too. Grab some for yourself. I Love it!</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job of covering gray - it tends to fade in a couple of weeks to a lighter shade that I like, but the gray stays covered.</li>
            <li> sAys that its natural but contains some chemicals that are harmful</li>
            <li> Nice color, almost what I wanted</li>
            <li> works great, thanks for a natural effective product&lt;br /&gt;Frank C</li>
            <li> Out of all the hair color products I have tried - Naturtint is my favorite. I will definitely be buying it again.  Even my hairdresser complimented on the color and shine. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> good coloring, covers grays, hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great color..</li>
            <li> not tested on animals and good color / coverage. easy to apply. wish the color would last a bit longer, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and lasts a long time.  I use this product because it is safer than most hair coloring products that are known to cause cancer.  Shipping was as expected with good packaging.  I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> Great color and grey coverage, love the multi-pack.  This was a good price as well.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. Great results everytime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 years already &amp; I&#x27;m happy about it.  It gives a good gray coverage &amp; permanent hair color.  They changed the packaging inside the box but it still has the same ingredients I think.  I did not have any problems at all.  I will continue using this product &amp; I would recommend this to anybody.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully gentle yet effective way to color your hair without ammonia or other harsh chemicals. Lasts a long time and leaves your hair soft and silky. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I pay more than double for this at health food stores.  Once I figured out what my color is, I buy them in bulk so I don&#x27;t have to be going constantly.</li>
            <li> Love this natural color! Trying to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my hair from so many years of using other chemical hair color products.</li>
            <li> The price is the best feature and the process is easy to follow producing remarkable results. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband use it to color his gray hair and I think he likes this product because the decoloration of the hair because of the washes is lees perceptible and gradual than others</li>
            <li> We have used Naturtint for years in our family. We all love the results and the relative safety of the product, compared to mainstream hair colors. We like Naturtint 5N better than its competitor, Herbatint 5N because it is not as dark as Herbatint and looks more natural.</li>
            <li> great dye, covers grays very well (even stubborn- just leave it on long enough) no smell or chemicals! However, this &amp;#34;light chestnut&amp;#34; is darker than expected- maybe a medium to dark brown.  Great savings in multipack!</li>
            <li> Dr. Karen Sun told me to use a less toxic hair color.  I love the way this colors the gray.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair. The 5N Light Chestnut color works well. My hair looks natural after coloring.</li>
            <li> Good coverage of grays..except the really stubborn ones!</li>
            <li> Great price and service</li>
            <li> Like this product and love the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> This product is great, but it arrived to me with one of the six boxes I ordered leaking and ruined.</li>
            <li> Why pay salons $60 -$80 for coloring your hair? If I can do it, so can you.  As for NATURTINT:  I buy it, I use it , I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for nearly two years. The color is beautiful and my hair seems healthier and shinier than with other hair coloring products I have used. It does a good job except on gray. I need to leave the hair color on for twice or three times the recommended time to color my gray. If hair coloring is only left on for the time specified, gray hair will likely not be colored.</li>
            <li> Terrible. It isn&#x27;t the same as the one in the store. Different texture and color. Low quality. Look old.</li>
            <li> Use it because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Buying this product in bulk makes it so much cheaper.  When buying the 6-pack, I can stock up for the entire year since I only use 1/2 a bottle a month. Always loved Naturtint.  It is very gentle on my hair and scalp and I am able to use it on my new growth every month with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for  a while. It is a lot cheaper to buy it from amazon.It is about 20 per package if you buy from sprout.&lt;br /&gt;The new formula is even better.</li>
