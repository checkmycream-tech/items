            <li>I have fairly oily skin and while this product did help with controlling that, it also seemed to clog my pores as well.</li>
            <li>, I have been trying the Korean skincare routine for a while but couldn&#x27;t find a good serum to go before my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and peachy, of course, and like another reviewer mentioned, when followed with make up my skin looked flawless.</li>
            <li>Because it didn&#x27;t do nothing good to my face.</li>
            <li>(I now have beautiful, healthy, blemish-free skin, but</li>
            <li>It smells great &amp; it minimizes pores &amp; it comes in a cute glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I put it on under my Holika Holika BB cream in the mornings and the peachy smell is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It had so many good reviews and it smells really nice too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I just removed my makeup with a remover cloth, and gave my face a nice good rinse before applying.</li>
            <li>I love this fine product and plan on reordering from this excellent seller.</li>
            <li>First of all the smell of this serum is delicious.</li>
            <li>This product has enabled me to be shine free until 1 to 2 PM which is a record!!  </li>

            <li>It also smells AMAZING like peaches.  </li>
            <li>The line smells fantastic, softens skin and does a great job of controlling shine/oil/sebum.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of confusion about the skincare line and what the products are, what they do, and how to use them.</li>

            <li>This skin serum is really nice.</li>
            <li>In the morning I wash my face with LG Su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do anything but smell nice on my face.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work.</li>
            <li>so I thought that was really nice of them.</li>
            <li>This product also looks nice over moisturizer by itself (with no makeup) like some primers do.</li>
            <li>really helpful and not oily ,smell of peaches are great!</li>
            <li>Smelled nice and all</li>
            <li>No change in pore appearance, but it smells peachy and nice.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed when I put it on was how amazing it smells, like the most delicious peach sake.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this and it makes my pores feel tighter when I use it! :)</li>
            <li>no irritation, the smell is very good, and it really does work for me</li>
            <li>Honestly :)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing :)</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>

            <li>with a cute cartoon stamp.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this serum and will continue to buy it once I run out.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is light and effective as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and really works for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using this for the rest of my days, what better recommendation can I offer you?</li>
            <li>My face looks more matte.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will reorder this even before it runs out to make sure that I won&#x27;t miss a day of it.</li>
            <li>My face looks so much better since incorporating this product into my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of peaches you&#x27;ll definitely love this.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time and effort to keep myself hydrated, make sure my skin is moisturized, and everything I can to make sure my skin is happy, but my face just wants to pump out oil like it&#x27;s going to solve the energy crisis.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cause any issues when I put makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li>The formula is nice and light.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s more of skin care product.</li>
            <li>It smooths the skin and fills tiny lines, making a wonderful canvas for foundation.</li>
            <li>I  love these Korean cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I love how this melts into your skin.</li>
            <li>i love the peachy smell.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging, prompt delivery but</li>
            <li>I finally realized that this product is best used as a base/primer for me (layered over moisturizer and under bb cream) and was amazed!  </li>
            <li>I finally achieved perfect balance of moisturized, non-greasy skin...</li>
            <li>Love the scent, love the way it makes my skin feel, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love how this serum smells.</li>
            <li>but I am really glad I did because it works wonder.</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>used so many products out there in the market.</li>
            <li>Planning to buy more from this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging is wonderful, as most asian products are.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheek!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I hope that the top is removable so that I can fully finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really  love the peach sake skin food line</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It really feels great when I put this on.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I looooove LOVE LOVE the way it makes my skin feel afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have run out of the Serum and re-ordered another bottle that I am saving for summer in case I need more oil control then.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, great line to try if your main concern is overproduction of sebum and oil control.</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, great line to try if your main concern is overproduction of sebum and oil control.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies a lot easier and smoothly since Skinfood Peach Sake, stays in place and looks just as good at the end of the day as when I freshly applied it in the morning.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies a lot easier and smoothly since Skinfood Peach Sake, stays in place and looks just as good at the end of the day as when I freshly applied it in the morning.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells so good, like real peaches :)</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to use all of the products in the series to get a more noticeable result, but for now I&#x27;ll try other Korean products since this one wasn&#x27;t impressive to me.</li>
            <li>This product smells so amazing like fresh peaches, and feels so velvety on my skin.</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m a fan of Skin Food (their Grape Seed BB Cream is fantastic) and love peach-scented products</li>
            <li>It has lovely, light peachy smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>This is really good for people with really oily skin.</li>
            <li>I actually wake up to beautiful, fresh looking skin!! ^_^</li>
            <li>My first serum, and I love it!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m semi sure this was a good product, when I received it, the glass bottle it was in was completely smashed.</li>
            <li>and this has worked great in not only minimizing my pores overtime but also decreasing the oiliness in my face, it also made my face brighter and more relaxed looking.</li>
            <li>It smells quite strongly of peach.</li>
            <li>Although it has a fragrance, it&#x27;s pleasant and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a light and clean feeling on my face after applying!</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a week now and the results are pretty amazing with the texture of skin.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the package it was not wrapped nicely at all.</li>
            <li>At first I was kind of iffy with buying it</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and I think the bottle is pretty darn cute as well :-)</li>
            <li>It is scented and has this wonderful fresh peach scent, but its not overpowering and does not linger to long.  </li>
            <li>It fades quickly as well so if you don&#x27;t like it, no worries!  </li>
            <li>It has a pump top that makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product-</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the peach sake line so far!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it, it makes my face nice and soft</li>
            <li>This really does control the oil on my face for a whole day, and doubles as a great primer as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin while using this.</li>
            <li>with two free samples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smelled really nice but went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>Here is another fantastic product from SkinFood.  </li>
            <li>Also they send you some free samples .</li>
            <li>This product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels light on the skin, not sticky or greasy like some silicone primers.</li>
            <li>after applying the serum onto my face, it feels so smooth and not oily at all;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Smells yummy and my skin seems to enjoy it. &#x3D;^_^&#x3D;</li>
            <li>My T-zone was shine free for over 10 hours.</li>
            <li>It also came with free samples</li>
            <li>Overall great porducts.</li>
            <li>This stuff has made my skin softer, smoother, free of blackheads (esp on nose and chin areas) without making me oily.</li>
            <li>You may need to add a light moisturizer underneath for winter.</li>
            <li>Company was prompt and they send free samples with your orders.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturize me as much as I would have liked</li>
            <li>At nearly 60 I still have good skin, but as we age, things happen...</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Your skin look pretty from the first application and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Sink right in to skin, leaving it silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Other than that if you have an oily face this serum will work great for you :)</li>
            <li>on the positive side it smells great, has cute packaging and only cost $12</li>
            <li>simply put this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews...but dude this stuff is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and makes everything so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I tried it as a primer at first, but found it tends to pill off when putting foundation on top and then becomes ineffective.</li>
            <li>It is pungent when first applied, but the smell softens and dissipates to a lovely peach smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product within the first use.</li>
            <li>I used it more than 3 weeks ,at first I felt that my skin became smoother.</li>
            <li>Skinfood is a brand I&#x27;ve been familiar with for a couple of years, but I hadn&#x27;t moved beyond their rice masks and their sugar scrubs until this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel super smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for months, and I really tried to enjoy it because I jut really love Skinfood.</li>
            <li>My skin was severely breaking out in pimples of all sizes and getting incredibly oily with the summer heat (105*F is not cool man), and I had been taking meds</li>
            <li>My combination/oily skin is supple and soft and I&#x27;m so glad I added this!</li>
            <li>, I discovered on a recent trip that using a few squirts of this serum on the roots of my hair did a great job to control oil and keep my hair looking good when I wasn&#x27;t able to wash it every day.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>The bottle is so adorable and the smell is very yummy.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with a super clean and exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really mattifies the skin without drying and does so even with moisturizers layered on top.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really cute and the pump works really well.</li>
            <li>but I say its cool.</li>
            <li>My skin is highly sensitive to most products and it also gets oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you have extremely oily skin mostly in the dreaded T-zone, the serum may only need to be applied in this zone to work best for you.</li>
            <li>Right after applying this, your skin will feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Lucky it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>bought this product from A Poly and it arrived quickly (as quickly as things can come all the way from Korea).</li>
            <li>It really does do a good job at minimizing pores(so far) and it does seem to help with oiliness.</li>
            <li>Absorbs super well into the skin.</li>
            <li>and now when I apply BB cream it looks smooth and natural :)</li>
            <li>Smells really good and soaks into my skin easily, but I feel it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my pores or skin overall.</li>
            <li>Its moisturizing but not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing because no other product has done that for me</li>
            <li>I use DHC cleansing oil), and then a ‘normal’ face wash to make sure all make-up/impurities are removed from your face.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>Skin Food is my new favorite skincare line.</li>
            <li>And today was the first day I started using this!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used higher brands, save your money on this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut to the next morning....I looked in the mirror and my face looked more refreshed than it had ever been!</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>makes you silky smooth and soft and sweet peach scent!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, absorbs quickly, and leaves me with a 90% matte appearance when I leave work even when it&#x27;s humid outside.</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute, the jar is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>, you can also gently tap your fingers as you go like you are lightly tapping on piano keys.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>, you can also gently tap your fingers as you go like you are lightly tapping on piano keys.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite oily, it&#x27;ll take a lot more than a soft face to impress me.</li>
            <li>worth to wait for this product.</li>
            <li>Skin care never worked out for my because my skin is ultra sensitive and breaks out to most skin care products.</li>
            <li>This primer keeps my makeup fresh and matte all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing-really yummy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and feels, it leaves my face feeling so soft too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking just on the Skinfood Peach Sake Toner, Serum, and Emulsion line alone – it has worked for me better than anything else I have tried for oil control without freaking out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking just on the Skinfood Peach Sake Toner, Serum, and Emulsion line alone – it has worked for me better than anything else I have tried for oil control without freaking out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it right away</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure other people will also love it.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderfully of peaches when you first put it on, makes your skin feel soft and smooth, and my skin did not break out or have any negative reaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I really can&#x27;t see any difference in my pores, but it sure does smell lovely!</li>
            <li>I have very large pores on my nose</li>
            <li>And this observation is on bare skin -- you could get more oil control if you wanted to use powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a few breakouts after using, but I would say it is well worth it because after they clear up my skin looks and feels incredible.</li>
            <li>Its gentle on face and not a bad chioce to make.</li>
            <li>The product is a nice hydrating serum (though mine had some grittiness to it which was strange, but this disappeared once rubbed in</li>
            <li>it made my face feel moisturized and not greasy, my skin felt a little tighter and the scent was pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have delegated this line to my morning routine and have recently started a tea tree oil skincare regimen for nights to see if that helps the acne side of my problem, which so far has been having good results for me</li>
            <li>I have delegated this line to my morning routine and have recently started a tea tree oil skincare regimen for nights to see if that helps the acne side of my problem, which so far has been having good results for me</li>
            <li>Feels nice and smells lovely, like peaches and champagne, but I&#x27;m not sure if it does much.</li>
            <li>the smell is so strong that my skin tingles upon application and for the first time in my life I developed an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>My pores are noticeably smaller and my skin smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li>Now I only wear makeup to work and many days, it&#x27;s just a bit of cc cream with a drop of beauty oil.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that has been able to control my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I actually wake up shine free!  </li>
            <li>Looks pretty on your vanity.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied it I could smell the peaches.</li>
            <li>but if I like it I&#x27;d most definitely order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but after two weeks, my pores stayed exactly the same with more whiteheads...</li>
            <li>First week I start using the product, it didn&#x27;t do any immprovement on my face.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for looking!</li>
            <li>Smaller pores and clearer skin :).</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose and for me it started working right away.</li>
            <li>While using this I noticed a definite increase in acne which faded soon after not using the serum, not to mention my sebaceous filaments were much more noticeable as well.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>makes me wonder is it safe to use on my naked face or for make up purpose?</li>
            <li>At first I tried to use this as a serum...after toner and before moisturizing cream...</li>
            <li>it looks bouncy and healthy, but finally not shiny!  </li>
            <li>I use that first now and then put the Skin Food Peach Sake serum on top of that and the smell is totally gone.</li>
            <li>It is easier to put on and delivers a pretty close effect.</li>
            <li>but this one wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have a T-zone complexion and it really helps with both!</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner (2 days), looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I then only applied it in T-zone, and have put it on hold to wait for more hot/humid summer weather in case I need it.</li>
            <li>(again, I will review that later after more time, but I am using a combination of products from both Skinfood and the Body Shop).face</li>
            <li>(again, I will review that later after more time, but I am using a combination of products from both Skinfood and the Body Shop).</li>
            <li>Rub your palms together to warm the product, press you palms vertically against both sides of your face/over your cheeks, then horizontally across your face with one hand across your forehead and the other across your mouth.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and I could see smaller pores right away.</li>
            <li>The bottle did have some minor damage at the top, where the pump dispenser screws onto the bottle itself.</li>
            <li>The smell is really appealing but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li>Lovely, delicate peach scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long but is pleasant to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may take up to a little more than a week to show changes but it should work!</li>
            <li>I have quite large pores on my nose and used to wear a primer and foundation every day.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy again (^^).</li>
            <li>Only thing is, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any huge difference in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li>As for the benefits, haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference in my skin quality before and afterwards (I have used up the whole bottle after about 3 months).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of any really.</li>
            <li>Shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Idk about shrinking my pores for the whole day</li>
            <li>and it really helps with oil.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of it.</li>
            <li>It really really worked well.</li>
            <li>It smells really yummy</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>If fragrance bothers you, I&#x27;d avoid this whole line.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and instantly disappears into skin, making the skin look matte and pores almost invisible.</li>
            <li>I squeeze 3 pumps of the peace sake pore primer onto my fingers and rub it all over my whole face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this isn&#x27;t really a primer, and I don&#x27;t use it as one (but some people can)</li>
            <li>I suggest Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder if you have very oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s some sparkling particles showed up when i look it real closely,</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Really recommend.</li>
            <li>serum smells absolutely delicious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really does the job.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very oily and this product keeps the oil at bay.</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t produce as much oil as it used to while using this.</li>
            <li>and I have seen real results with my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is also very pleasing.</li>
            <li>It is important to wash your face properly every morning and evening before applying the products.</li>
            <li>I also press my palms intomy neck/throat, then GENTLY pat all over my face</li>
            <li>Yea, I wasn’t really expecting it to help with that, as nothing but BC has controlled the whole hormonal cystic acne break-out nightmare, but I was hoping with the oil control that it wouldn’t be so</li>
            <li>Yea, I wasn’t really expecting it to help with that, as nothing but BC has controlled the whole hormonal cystic acne break-out nightmare, but I was hoping with the oil control that it wouldn’t be so</li>
            <li>I wear mineral foundation, and it gives me a nice glow when I first apply it, but I usually have to blot a couple of times throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong that it lingers for so long.</li>
            <li>Good for oil problems but if used in dry areas the cream will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I hope my other products will be better wrapped.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it might work better if I combine this with the other Peach Sake products.</li>
            <li>When absorbed, your face will feel powdery soft, smooth and moisturized (not as cottony dry as the serum).</li>
            <li>When absorbed, your face will feel powdery soft, smooth and moisturized (not as cottony dry as the serum).</li>
            <li>I usually put it before I put on BB cream and so far it&#x27;s been really good to my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with oily skin who wants to mattify the face before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>slightly mattifies my more oily areas while still hydrating my whole face.</li>
            <li>purchased all of the products through k-beauty and the products are authentic and shipped fast, usually less than one week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more or less like a mattifying lotion/primer if you have ever used one.</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly because of the reviews online &amp; they were correct.</li>
            <li>Love the product but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m patient enough to buy it regularly.</li>
            <li>I do seem to be going through it quickly and almost wish it were bigger</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift, and I really like it so far!  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this because it smells really nice and helps with oil, but the bad simply outweighs the good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This serum made my face feel so soft!!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a little drying, it&#x27;s helping with my acne a lot :)</li>
            <li>It helps absorb the oil only for a couple hours more than normal, however my pores do look much smaller and my skin is always very soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, particularly in the T-zone, and I was really surprised to find this serum controls shine very well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but have only experienced breakouts with &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;acne control&amp;#34; products or not moisturizing properly, so I typically treat it as dry skin</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t oily as much and its so soft.</li>
            <li>I use it after moisturiser (just a pea sized amount for my nose, then any leftover amount on my chin) and let it sink in for about 10 minutes before applying my normal primer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was worth a try since it was relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I am just mentioning this because this is my normal skincare routine: wash – toner – emulsion – moisturizer – finisher.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still got my normal hormonal acne break-outs.</li>
            <li>I am just mentioning this because this is my normal skincare routine: wash – toner – emulsion – moisturizer – finisher.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still got my normal hormonal acne break-outs.</li>
            <li>The Toner and Emulsion have been working just fine for me, even with my extreme sebum production.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>i say overall this product is okay because i have oily to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to try out their other products since they seem well made (and worth the price)</li>
            <li>People generally think because you have oily skin you must punish and strip it of all oils to ‘cure’ it and make it ‘normal’, when all you are doing is damaging your skin, making it freak out that it’s so dry, and forcing it to overproduce even more sebum and exacerbating your problem.&lt;br /&gt;Korean skincare products are generally applied lightest texture to thickest texture.</li>
            <li>Again, this is a new world for me as this has never happened before using this product.  </li>
            <li>Already bought a new batch</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin feel very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>this actually did work for absorbing oil and getting the bb cream on nicely, but my skin was not getting enough moisture with just the toner, so the texture was slightly off</li>
            <li>but it definitely did when I first applied it</li>
            <li>This is probably the first time I used up a product to the last pump.</li>
            <li>This was my first Skinfood product and definitely not my last.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and many products that I have used in the past, even those targeted towards sensitive skin, have always given me a burning sensation when applied.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a little reduction in pore size, but no miracle poor erasing (I don&#x27;t think there is a product that can completely win a fight against genetics like that), and find the price of the item to be very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth thin bit watery texture and smells nice, but it was not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and while my pores are probably about the same size, I&#x27;ve stopped being super shiny by the end of the day, which makes it WELL worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>Okay, I hardly EVER review on beauty products, FYI.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, and no matter what by midday my face is super greasy.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft and my pores really got smaller.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve started chugging acidophilus so that also helps clear up skin problems.</li>
            <li>I could not find a complete list of ingredients for this product.</li>
            <li>However, if you are sensitive to scents, you may not like it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin, and this serum hasn&#x27;t made me any break outs.</li>
            <li>In the summer it may be all you need as far a moisturizing goes, but in the winter expect to use something heavier after it.</li>
            <li>I use this together with the toner and emulsion and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for nearly a month</li>
            <li>product makes my skin feel soft, it absorbs oil and leaves my skin with a matte look</li>
            <li>My skin just sucked it up and after every use it feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>it really helps keep my skin hydrated after constantly washing it.</li>
            <li>I started these products and its almost all gone, and furthermore, my pores are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I never felt my skin as soft as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has an interesting consistency of a lotion, but is not as thick.</li>
            <li>One more thing, i recommend using half a pump to about 1 pump, because it tend to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>the product is absorbed (your skin will still have the feeling of being slightly moist), you can use 1-2 pumps of the emulsion, smoothing it onto your T-zone and either gently spread or tapping it from the center to the outside of your face until absorbed.</li>

            <li>Product was larger than expected and has a nice slight peachy smell to it</li>
            <li>but overall i used it after i shower, has no serious problem with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed as I get older that my pores are getting larger and of all the products I have tried over the years to get rid of blackheads nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>First of all let me point out that description/name of products that are used in different countries have totally different meanings/functions – case in point is the ‘toner’.</li>
            <li>I have visible clogged pores on certain parts of my face and this has really and truly reduced their appearance in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>For that to happen in a little less than 2 weeks is amazing.</li>
            <li>I personally use it at night since its a serum, therefore highly concentrate, and I want it to work its &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, but it could also work as a primer.</li>
            <li>I usually put it on after a light moisturizers it works well as a primer for liquid or powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Has a fresh peach scent and dries down to a matte finish/feeling after application.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to blot throughout the entire day which is definitely new for me</li>
            <li>serum is a thick cream, but it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the smell it doesn&#x27;t has a strong peach smell or anything, it has a small hint but not enough to drown your sense of smell. ^_^</li>
            <li>A HUGE improvement to say the least.</li>
            <li>A HUGE improvement to say the least.</li>
            <li>really can see differences in my pores, both short term and long term.  </li>
            <li>Product ships from Korea and takes a few weeks, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The only con I have for this line is that although it has helped immensely with controlling sebum, it has not PREVENTED new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>The only con I have for this line is that although it has helped immensely with controlling sebum, it has not PREVENTED new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>Combined with the toner, emulsion, and finishing powder I could tell that my skin was less oily after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I am not sure how much of a difference this product is actually making for me face, but I am certain about four things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think using the other products in the line in combination with this one really increases their performance.</li>
            <li>The Face Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF 40 PA+++), and topical BHA keep me relatively shine-free for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>And my skin was not dry or flaky what had happened before after using  anti-shine serums/creams.</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my cheeks near my nose, and I noticed after 5 days of use that they are a little bit smaller; and</li>
            <li>My main beef with this is that I hate how much product I&#x27;ve had to use because it soaks in quickly, so I have to work fast prior to it soaking in my fingers.</li>
            <li>Plus my skin feels baby smooth now and isn&#x27;t dry and icky.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel cottony/powdery soft and dry after this product is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, cup your palm again, tap out about a dime-nickel sized in circumference amount of the emulsion, rub your palms together again, and apply just as the toner described above.</li>

            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling SO smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Once I figured out where this fits in my routine, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> My makeup looked flawless on top of it.</li>
            <li> With this, I still get my nice glow, but I don&#x27;t have to blot at all!</li>
            <li> Cute packaging, Korean, smells great, and isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
            <li> pleasant smell, soaks into skin well, does not leave a residue or oil to the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing, I need to order more!!</li>
            <li> Performance wise its a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and while this product did help with controlling that, it also seemed to clog my pores as well.</li>
            <li> , I have been trying the Korean skincare routine for a while but couldn&#x27;t find a good serum to go before my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and peachy, of course, and like another reviewer mentioned, when followed with make up my skin looked flawless.</li>
            <li> Because it didn&#x27;t do nothing good to my face.</li>
            <li> (I now have beautiful, healthy, blemish-free skin, but</li>
            <li> It smells great &amp; it minimizes pores &amp; it comes in a cute glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I put it on under my Holika Holika BB cream in the mornings and the peachy smell is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It had so many good reviews and it smells really nice too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I just removed my makeup with a remover cloth, and gave my face a nice good rinse before applying.</li>
            <li> I love this fine product and plan on reordering from this excellent seller.</li>
            <li> First of all the smell of this serum is delicious.</li>
            <li> This product has enabled me to be shine free until 1 to 2 PM which is a record!!  </li>
            <li> My go to product and an important arsenal in my skin care routine!!</li>

            <li> AMAZING products.</li>
            <li> It also smells AMAZING like peaches.  </li>
            <li> The line smells fantastic, softens skin and does a great job of controlling shine/oil/sebum.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of confusion about the skincare line and what the products are, what they do, and how to use them.</li>
            <li> Loving everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely peach scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This skin serum is really nice.</li>
            <li> In the morning I wash my face with LG Su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything but smell nice on my face.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work.</li>
            <li> so I thought that was really nice of them.</li>
            <li> This product also looks nice over moisturizer by itself (with no makeup) like some primers do.</li>
            <li> really helpful and not oily ,smell of peaches are great!</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and all</li>
            <li> No change in pore appearance, but it smells peachy and nice.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed when I put it on was how amazing it smells, like the most delicious peach sake.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this and it makes my pores feel tighter when I use it! :)</li>
            <li> no irritation, the smell is very good, and it really does work for me</li>
            <li> Honestly :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing :)</li>

            <li> The packaging was so cute.</li>
            <li> with a cute cartoon stamp.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this serum and will continue to buy it once I run out.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This product is light and effective as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and really works for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this for the rest of my days, what better recommendation can I offer you?</li>
            <li> My face looks more matte.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will reorder this even before it runs out to make sure that I won&#x27;t miss a day of it.</li>
            <li> My face looks so much better since incorporating this product into my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of peaches you&#x27;ll definitely love this.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time and effort to keep myself hydrated, make sure my skin is moisturized, and everything I can to make sure my skin is happy, but my face just wants to pump out oil like it&#x27;s going to solve the energy crisis.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cause any issues when I put makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li> The formula is nice and light.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s more of skin care product.</li>
            <li> It smooths the skin and fills tiny lines, making a wonderful canvas for foundation.</li>
            <li> I  love these Korean cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I love how this melts into your skin.</li>
            <li> i love the peachy smell.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, prompt delivery but</li>
            <li> I finally realized that this product is best used as a base/primer for me (layered over moisturizer and under bb cream) and was amazed!  </li>
            <li> I finally achieved perfect balance of moisturized, non-greasy skin...</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the way it makes my skin feel, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love how this serum smells.</li>
            <li> but I am really glad I did because it works wonder.</li>
            <li> okay?</li>
            <li> used so many products out there in the market.</li>
            <li> Planning to buy more from this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is wonderful, as most asian products are.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheek!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I hope that the top is removable so that I can fully finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really  love the peach sake skin food line</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> It really feels great when I put this on.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I looooove LOVE LOVE the way it makes my skin feel afterward.  </li>
            <li> I have run out of the Serum and re-ordered another bottle that I am saving for summer in case I need more oil control then.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, great line to try if your main concern is overproduction of sebum and oil control.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, great line to try if your main concern is overproduction of sebum and oil control.</li>
            <li> My makeup applies a lot easier and smoothly since Skinfood Peach Sake, stays in place and looks just as good at the end of the day as when I freshly applied it in the morning.</li>
            <li> My makeup applies a lot easier and smoothly since Skinfood Peach Sake, stays in place and looks just as good at the end of the day as when I freshly applied it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells so good, like real peaches :)</li>
            <li> Maybe I have to use all of the products in the series to get a more noticeable result, but for now I&#x27;ll try other Korean products since this one wasn&#x27;t impressive to me.</li>
            <li> This product smells so amazing like fresh peaches, and feels so velvety on my skin.</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m a fan of Skin Food (their Grape Seed BB Cream is fantastic) and love peach-scented products</li>
            <li> It has lovely, light peachy smell.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> This is really good for people with really oily skin.</li>
            <li> I actually wake up to beautiful, fresh looking skin!! ^_^</li>
            <li> My first serum, and I love it!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m semi sure this was a good product, when I received it, the glass bottle it was in was completely smashed.</li>
            <li> and this has worked great in not only minimizing my pores overtime but also decreasing the oiliness in my face, it also made my face brighter and more relaxed looking.</li>
            <li> It smells quite strongly of peach.</li>
            <li> Although it has a fragrance, it&#x27;s pleasant and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves a light and clean feeling on my face after applying!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a week now and the results are pretty amazing with the texture of skin.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the package it was not wrapped nicely at all.</li>
            <li> At first I was kind of iffy with buying it</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and I think the bottle is pretty darn cute as well :-)</li>
            <li> It is scented and has this wonderful fresh peach scent, but its not overpowering and does not linger to long.  </li>
            <li> It fades quickly as well so if you don&#x27;t like it, no worries!  </li>
            <li> It has a pump top that makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product-</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the peach sake line so far!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it, it makes my face nice and soft</li>
            <li> This really does control the oil on my face for a whole day, and doubles as a great primer as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin while using this.</li>
            <li> with two free samples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smelled really nice but went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> Here is another fantastic product from SkinFood.  </li>
            <li> Also they send you some free samples .</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels light on the skin, not sticky or greasy like some silicone primers.</li>
            <li> after applying the serum onto my face, it feels so smooth and not oily at all;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and my skin seems to enjoy it. &#x3D;^_^&#x3D;</li>
            <li> My T-zone was shine free for over 10 hours.</li>
            <li> It also came with free samples</li>
            <li> Overall great porducts.</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my skin softer, smoother, free of blackheads (esp on nose and chin areas) without making me oily.</li>
            <li> You may need to add a light moisturizer underneath for winter.</li>
            <li> Company was prompt and they send free samples with your orders.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize me as much as I would have liked</li>
            <li> At nearly 60 I still have good skin, but as we age, things happen...</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> Your skin look pretty from the first application and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Sink right in to skin, leaving it silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Other than that if you have an oily face this serum will work great for you :)</li>
            <li> on the positive side it smells great, has cute packaging and only cost $12</li>
            <li> simply put this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews...but dude this stuff is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and makes everything so pretty.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as a primer at first, but found it tends to pill off when putting foundation on top and then becomes ineffective.</li>
            <li> It is pungent when first applied, but the smell softens and dissipates to a lovely peach smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product within the first use.</li>
            <li> I used it more than 3 weeks ,at first I felt that my skin became smoother.</li>
            <li> Skinfood is a brand I&#x27;ve been familiar with for a couple of years, but I hadn&#x27;t moved beyond their rice masks and their sugar scrubs until this product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel super smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for months, and I really tried to enjoy it because I jut really love Skinfood.</li>
            <li> My skin was severely breaking out in pimples of all sizes and getting incredibly oily with the summer heat (105*F is not cool man), and I had been taking meds</li>
            <li> My combination/oily skin is supple and soft and I&#x27;m so glad I added this!</li>
            <li> , I discovered on a recent trip that using a few squirts of this serum on the roots of my hair did a great job to control oil and keep my hair looking good when I wasn&#x27;t able to wash it every day.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so adorable and the smell is very yummy.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with a super clean and exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff really mattifies the skin without drying and does so even with moisturizers layered on top.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really cute and the pump works really well.</li>
            <li> but I say its cool.</li>
            <li> My skin is highly sensitive to most products and it also gets oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you have extremely oily skin mostly in the dreaded T-zone, the serum may only need to be applied in this zone to work best for you.</li>
            <li> Right after applying this, your skin will feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Lucky it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> bought this product from A Poly and it arrived quickly (as quickly as things can come all the way from Korea).</li>
            <li> It really does do a good job at minimizing pores(so far) and it does seem to help with oiliness.</li>
            <li> Absorbs super well into the skin.</li>
            <li> and now when I apply BB cream it looks smooth and natural :)</li>
            <li> Smells really good and soaks into my skin easily, but I feel it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my pores or skin overall.</li>
            <li> Its moisturizing but not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing because no other product has done that for me</li>
            <li> I use DHC cleansing oil), and then a ‘normal’ face wash to make sure all make-up/impurities are removed from your face.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Skin Food is my new favorite skincare line.</li>
            <li> And today was the first day I started using this!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used higher brands, save your money on this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut to the next morning....I looked in the mirror and my face looked more refreshed than it had ever been!</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> makes you silky smooth and soft and sweet peach scent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, absorbs quickly, and leaves me with a 90% matte appearance when I leave work even when it&#x27;s humid outside.</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute, the jar is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> , you can also gently tap your fingers as you go like you are lightly tapping on piano keys.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> , you can also gently tap your fingers as you go like you are lightly tapping on piano keys.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite oily, it&#x27;ll take a lot more than a soft face to impress me.</li>
            <li> worth to wait for this product.</li>
            <li> Skin care never worked out for my because my skin is ultra sensitive and breaks out to most skin care products.</li>
            <li> This primer keeps my makeup fresh and matte all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing-really yummy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and feels, it leaves my face feeling so soft too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking just on the Skinfood Peach Sake Toner, Serum, and Emulsion line alone – it has worked for me better than anything else I have tried for oil control without freaking out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking just on the Skinfood Peach Sake Toner, Serum, and Emulsion line alone – it has worked for me better than anything else I have tried for oil control without freaking out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed it right away</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure other people will also love it.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderfully of peaches when you first put it on, makes your skin feel soft and smooth, and my skin did not break out or have any negative reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I really can&#x27;t see any difference in my pores, but it sure does smell lovely!</li>
            <li> I have very large pores on my nose</li>
            <li> And this observation is on bare skin -- you could get more oil control if you wanted to use powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a few breakouts after using, but I would say it is well worth it because after they clear up my skin looks and feels incredible.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on face and not a bad chioce to make.</li>
            <li> The product is a nice hydrating serum (though mine had some grittiness to it which was strange, but this disappeared once rubbed in</li>
            <li> it made my face feel moisturized and not greasy, my skin felt a little tighter and the scent was pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have delegated this line to my morning routine and have recently started a tea tree oil skincare regimen for nights to see if that helps the acne side of my problem, which so far has been having good results for me</li>

            <li> Feels nice and smells lovely, like peaches and champagne, but I&#x27;m not sure if it does much.</li>
            <li> the smell is so strong that my skin tingles upon application and for the first time in my life I developed an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> My pores are noticeably smaller and my skin smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> Now I only wear makeup to work and many days, it&#x27;s just a bit of cc cream with a drop of beauty oil.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has been able to control my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I actually wake up shine free!  </li>
            <li> Looks pretty on your vanity.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied it I could smell the peaches.</li>
            <li> but if I like it I&#x27;d most definitely order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but after two weeks, my pores stayed exactly the same with more whiteheads...</li>
            <li> First week I start using the product, it didn&#x27;t do any immprovement on my face.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for looking!</li>
            <li> Smaller pores and clearer skin :).</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose and for me it started working right away.</li>
            <li> While using this I noticed a definite increase in acne which faded soon after not using the serum, not to mention my sebaceous filaments were much more noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> makes me wonder is it safe to use on my naked face or for make up purpose?</li>
            <li> At first I tried to use this as a serum...after toner and before moisturizing cream...</li>
            <li> it looks bouncy and healthy, but finally not shiny!  </li>
            <li> I use that first now and then put the Skin Food Peach Sake serum on top of that and the smell is totally gone.</li>
            <li> It is easier to put on and delivers a pretty close effect.</li>
            <li> but this one wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have a T-zone complexion and it really helps with both!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner (2 days), looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I then only applied it in T-zone, and have put it on hold to wait for more hot/humid summer weather in case I need it.</li>
            <li> (again, I will review that later after more time, but I am using a combination of products from both Skinfood and the Body Shop).face</li>
            <li> (again, I will review that later after more time, but I am using a combination of products from both Skinfood and the Body Shop).</li>
            <li> Rub your palms together to warm the product, press you palms vertically against both sides of your face/over your cheeks, then horizontally across your face with one hand across your forehead and the other across your mouth.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and I could see smaller pores right away.</li>
            <li> The bottle did have some minor damage at the top, where the pump dispenser screws onto the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> The smell is really appealing but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li> Lovely, delicate peach scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long but is pleasant to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may take up to a little more than a week to show changes but it should work!</li>
            <li> I have quite large pores on my nose and used to wear a primer and foundation every day.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy again (^^).</li>
            <li> Only thing is, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any huge difference in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> As for the benefits, haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference in my skin quality before and afterwards (I have used up the whole bottle after about 3 months).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of any really.</li>
            <li> Shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Idk about shrinking my pores for the whole day</li>
            <li> and it really helps with oil.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of it.</li>
            <li> It really really worked well.</li>
            <li> It smells really yummy</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> If fragrance bothers you, I&#x27;d avoid this whole line.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and instantly disappears into skin, making the skin look matte and pores almost invisible.</li>
            <li> I squeeze 3 pumps of the peace sake pore primer onto my fingers and rub it all over my whole face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this isn&#x27;t really a primer, and I don&#x27;t use it as one (but some people can)</li>
            <li> I suggest Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder if you have very oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s some sparkling particles showed up when i look it real closely,</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Really recommend.</li>
            <li> serum smells absolutely delicious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really does the job.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very oily and this product keeps the oil at bay.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t produce as much oil as it used to while using this.</li>
            <li> and I have seen real results with my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is also very pleasing.</li>
            <li> It is important to wash your face properly every morning and evening before applying the products.</li>
            <li> I also press my palms intomy neck/throat, then GENTLY pat all over my face</li>
            <li> Yea, I wasn’t really expecting it to help with that, as nothing but BC has controlled the whole hormonal cystic acne break-out nightmare, but I was hoping with the oil control that it wouldn’t be so</li>
            <li> Yea, I wasn’t really expecting it to help with that, as nothing but BC has controlled the whole hormonal cystic acne break-out nightmare, but I was hoping with the oil control that it wouldn’t be so</li>
            <li> I wear mineral foundation, and it gives me a nice glow when I first apply it, but I usually have to blot a couple of times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong that it lingers for so long.</li>
            <li> Good for oil problems but if used in dry areas the cream will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I hope my other products will be better wrapped.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it might work better if I combine this with the other Peach Sake products.</li>
            <li> When absorbed, your face will feel powdery soft, smooth and moisturized (not as cottony dry as the serum).</li>
            <li> When absorbed, your face will feel powdery soft, smooth and moisturized (not as cottony dry as the serum).</li>
            <li> I usually put it before I put on BB cream and so far it&#x27;s been really good to my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with oily skin who wants to mattify the face before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li> slightly mattifies my more oily areas while still hydrating my whole face.</li>
            <li> purchased all of the products through k-beauty and the products are authentic and shipped fast, usually less than one week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more or less like a mattifying lotion/primer if you have ever used one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because of the reviews online &amp; they were correct.</li>
            <li> Love the product but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m patient enough to buy it regularly.</li>
            <li> I do seem to be going through it quickly and almost wish it were bigger</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I really like it so far!  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this because it smells really nice and helps with oil, but the bad simply outweighs the good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This serum made my face feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little drying, it&#x27;s helping with my acne a lot :)</li>
            <li> It helps absorb the oil only for a couple hours more than normal, however my pores do look much smaller and my skin is always very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, particularly in the T-zone, and I was really surprised to find this serum controls shine very well.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, but have only experienced breakouts with &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;acne control&amp;#34; products or not moisturizing properly, so I typically treat it as dry skin</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t oily as much and its so soft.</li>
            <li> I use it after moisturiser (just a pea sized amount for my nose, then any leftover amount on my chin) and let it sink in for about 10 minutes before applying my normal primer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was worth a try since it was relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I am just mentioning this because this is my normal skincare routine: wash – toner – emulsion – moisturizer – finisher.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still got my normal hormonal acne break-outs.</li>
            <li> I am just mentioning this because this is my normal skincare routine: wash – toner – emulsion – moisturizer – finisher.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still got my normal hormonal acne break-outs.</li>
            <li> The Toner and Emulsion have been working just fine for me, even with my extreme sebum production.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> i say overall this product is okay because i have oily to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to try out their other products since they seem well made (and worth the price)</li>
            <li> People generally think because you have oily skin you must punish and strip it of all oils to ‘cure’ it and make it ‘normal’, when all you are doing is damaging your skin, making it freak out that it’s so dry, and forcing it to overproduce even more sebum and exacerbating your problem.&lt;br /&gt;Korean skincare products are generally applied lightest texture to thickest texture.</li>
            <li> Again, this is a new world for me as this has never happened before using this product.  </li>
            <li> Already bought a new batch</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin feel very, very soft.  </li>
            <li> this actually did work for absorbing oil and getting the bb cream on nicely, but my skin was not getting enough moisture with just the toner, so the texture was slightly off</li>
            <li> but it definitely did when I first applied it</li>
            <li> This is probably the first time I used up a product to the last pump.</li>
            <li> This was my first Skinfood product and definitely not my last.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and many products that I have used in the past, even those targeted towards sensitive skin, have always given me a burning sensation when applied.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little reduction in pore size, but no miracle poor erasing (I don&#x27;t think there is a product that can completely win a fight against genetics like that), and find the price of the item to be very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth thin bit watery texture and smells nice, but it was not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and while my pores are probably about the same size, I&#x27;ve stopped being super shiny by the end of the day, which makes it WELL worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, I hardly EVER review on beauty products, FYI.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and no matter what by midday my face is super greasy.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft and my pores really got smaller.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve started chugging acidophilus so that also helps clear up skin problems.</li>
            <li> I could not find a complete list of ingredients for this product.</li>
            <li> However, if you are sensitive to scents, you may not like it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin, and this serum hasn&#x27;t made me any break outs.</li>
            <li> In the summer it may be all you need as far a moisturizing goes, but in the winter expect to use something heavier after it.</li>
            <li> I use this together with the toner and emulsion and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for nearly a month</li>
            <li> product makes my skin feel soft, it absorbs oil and leaves my skin with a matte look</li>
            <li> My skin just sucked it up and after every use it feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> it really helps keep my skin hydrated after constantly washing it.</li>
            <li> I started these products and its almost all gone, and furthermore, my pores are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I never felt my skin as soft as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has an interesting consistency of a lotion, but is not as thick.</li>
            <li> One more thing, i recommend using half a pump to about 1 pump, because it tend to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> the product is absorbed (your skin will still have the feeling of being slightly moist), you can use 1-2 pumps of the emulsion, smoothing it onto your T-zone and either gently spread or tapping it from the center to the outside of your face until absorbed.</li>

            <li> Product was larger than expected and has a nice slight peachy smell to it</li>
            <li> but overall i used it after i shower, has no serious problem with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed as I get older that my pores are getting larger and of all the products I have tried over the years to get rid of blackheads nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> First of all let me point out that description/name of products that are used in different countries have totally different meanings/functions – case in point is the ‘toner’.</li>
            <li> I have visible clogged pores on certain parts of my face and this has really and truly reduced their appearance in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> For that to happen in a little less than 2 weeks is amazing.</li>
            <li> I personally use it at night since its a serum, therefore highly concentrate, and I want it to work its &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, but it could also work as a primer.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on after a light moisturizers it works well as a primer for liquid or powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Has a fresh peach scent and dries down to a matte finish/feeling after application.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to blot throughout the entire day which is definitely new for me</li>
            <li> serum is a thick cream, but it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the smell it doesn&#x27;t has a strong peach smell or anything, it has a small hint but not enough to drown your sense of smell. ^_^</li>
            <li> A HUGE improvement to say the least.</li>
            <li> A HUGE improvement to say the least.</li>
            <li> really can see differences in my pores, both short term and long term.  </li>
            <li> Product ships from Korea and takes a few weeks, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The only con I have for this line is that although it has helped immensely with controlling sebum, it has not PREVENTED new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> The only con I have for this line is that although it has helped immensely with controlling sebum, it has not PREVENTED new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> Combined with the toner, emulsion, and finishing powder I could tell that my skin was less oily after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I am not sure how much of a difference this product is actually making for me face, but I am certain about four things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think using the other products in the line in combination with this one really increases their performance.</li>
            <li> The Face Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF 40 PA+++), and topical BHA keep me relatively shine-free for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> And my skin was not dry or flaky what had happened before after using  anti-shine serums/creams.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my cheeks near my nose, and I noticed after 5 days of use that they are a little bit smaller; and</li>
            <li> My main beef with this is that I hate how much product I&#x27;ve had to use because it soaks in quickly, so I have to work fast prior to it soaking in my fingers.</li>
            <li> Plus my skin feels baby smooth now and isn&#x27;t dry and icky.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel cottony/powdery soft and dry after this product is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, cup your palm again, tap out about a dime-nickel sized in circumference amount of the emulsion, rub your palms together again, and apply just as the toner described above.</li>

            <li> For anybody who&#x27;s curious, right now I use (in order) skinfood black sugar cleansing oil (at night),</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product and other Skin Food items.</li>
            <li> The Velvet skin coat is more $,it tends to pull skin and the last bit in the container is always too thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use too much of this product to cover your entire face, and I usually use it only in the morning and feel like it&#x27;s a great base before I put on all my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I notice a real difference in the smoothness and less dry patches and oily skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is EXTREMELY oily, cystic/hormonal acne prone and sensitive to boot.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, and makes my skin seem really soft, but it actually just coats the skin like a spackle and has the horrible tendency to pill and roll off your skin, so it looks like you have dead skin everywhere.</li>
            <li> Less than 10 minutes later, my face felt unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> This product obviously doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it doesn&#x27;t dry you out or sting, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily like my last serum either.</li>
            <li> On first application, it mattifies the skin like you would expect from a silicone primer, and although it doesn&#x27;t stay that matte during the day, it manages to stop my skin from developing that greasy layer look for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I usually have  an issue with putting on my whole getup and looking shiny after but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> This is a product that should only be used in the morning when you are planning to go out all day (if your face gets oily when walking around in the sun for too long, you should use this product).</li>
            <li> I find it is hard to control the product and make sure you only get out what you need, which is a VERY small amount.</li>
            <li> it seems like it will last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin too dry by itself, so I have to layer it underneath my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> you use the Korean ‘tap-tap’ method, you will also only need a very small amount of product to cover your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> washing your face, PAT dry with a towel, a couple pats will do, your face should only be ‘damp dry’ – please do NOT rub at your face with your towel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrance, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> Also when applied it would leave this strange film on my skin.</li>
            <li> so maybe it will change with long term use.</li>
            <li> Too long even.</li>
            <li> I will buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This product gives my face a radiance glow cant wait for long term results.</li>
            <li> Warning: LONG review –</li>
            <li> Kept hair as fresh as dry shampoos without dull, powdery looking hair or powdery mess in the bathroom after use.</li>
            <li> I have never used a creme-like serum before, but now I am wondering what has take me so long!</li>
            <li> Secondly, it has yet to improve my skin, used alone (as in, not using any other pore refiner&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I wear the following makeup every day for work: liquid eyeliner, BB cream (recently changed from a little concealer), and lipstick that I carry in my pocket.  </li>
            <li> People with dry skin: do</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I wait about 3 minutes for it to dry</li>
            <li> My skin now is dry.</li>
            <li> i have oily to dry skin</li>
            <li> my skin was still dry.</li>
            <li> But if you have dry skin, i would stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> American ‘toners’ or astringents are extremely harsh and drying on the skin and contain a massive amount of alcohol.</li>
            <li> A little hours a long way with this stuff so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Which a plus for me because I usually have super oily skin, not cute!</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel too bad  :)</li>
            <li> This is really worth a try if you&#x27;re desperate for smaller pores.</li>
            <li> I was also curious about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any results as a pore refiner, but I have only been using it a few days.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was carefully wrapped so that there&#x27;s no damage to the bottle and a generous amount of samples.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it slightly dried out the parts that were not oily</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see smaller pores in the few months</li>
            <li> the product dried out my skin even after i used facial lotion</li>
            <li> I noticed less oily skin in the t-zone area but everywhere else looked and felt dry since I am not oily skinned.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to avoid parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it out, but I&#x27;m waiting for my other Skinfood products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and no product has worked for me before.  </li>
            <li> Even when I do get oily, it is not as oily as with other products.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I would purchase this again for the price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and sporadic problems with pimples.  </li>
            <li> Definitely different from other serums I have used though, since the others are usually clearer and melted jelly like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used other pore-reduction serums, but let me tell you that this one product makes my skin feel softer than my Olay ProX regimen (although I still use those products to keep my skin firm and youthful).  </li>
            <li> earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t broken out because of it, like I would with regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that they had a hard time pumping the product out and had to constantly pump for the product to come out.</li>
            <li> Because I have dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> but signs of smaller pores should be viable after a week, at least that was the case for me.</li>
            <li> I usually have to wait 2-5 weeks for my products coming straight from Korea, which is not great when you run out of something your skin loves.</li>
            <li> kanebo/kracie naive peach foaming cleanser, skinfood black sugar mask 2-3 times per week during the day (laneige water sleeping pack on alternate nights), hadalabo lotion (toner),</li>
            <li> However, I have gone from using 6-10 blotting sheets a DAY with reapplying powder 3-6 times a DAY, down to ONE sheet of blotting paper mid-day with MAYBE needing a dab of powder in my T-zone, but not always.</li>
            <li> However, I have gone from using 6-10 blotting sheets a DAY with reapplying powder 3-6 times a DAY, down to ONE sheet of blotting paper mid-day with MAYBE needing a dab of powder in my T-zone, but not always.</li>
            <li> I just received this serum along with my black sugar mask scrub yesterday.</li>
            <li> I put my makeup on at 7 and typically by 10 AM, I am getting shiny.  </li>
            <li> They gave me a sample of their black sugar mask wash off.</li>
            <li> The most horrible facial product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I typically use about 1 and a half pumps to cover my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for two months and still have half of the Toner and Emulsion.</li>
            <li> I live in New England, where we are having an especially cold and dry winter, the serum made my face dry and ashy on cheeks and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically quite skeptical about products, having been fooled by claims repeatedly in the past, but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> It may be a little drying for winter though.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid most of these reviews are fake since the serum had no impact on my pores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dead skin cells peeling off my skin</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t control oil while it was layered under a heavy moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up getting a few blemishes.  </li>
            <li> my face usually starts to get oily after 2 hours from washing or applying makeup but with the serum, I notice a lot less shine</li>
            <li> Before I made the switch from products geared &amp;#34;for oily skin&amp;#34; to moisturizing products, my skin would erupt weekly with 2-4 crazy &amp;#34;volcano sized&amp;#34; blemishes and several small scattered blemishes around my hairline and such, lots of blackheads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally going to be a staple for me from now on (or at least until my skin decides to enter its next crazy phase).</li>
            <li> The way my skin behaves lately, I don&#x27;t even need to wear makeup every day, if I do, just a lighter bb cream (I like skinfood honey black tea bb cream).  </li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> A small piece of glass had cracked off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you are supposed to use this under your makeup</li>
            <li> I also used to wake up with oily skin, but that is a thing of the past with this product.</li>
            <li> My dark spots were hardly visible, and my face looked like porcelain!</li>
            <li> people are saying it is hard to get the products out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Also, the other reviews were correct, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering at all and disappears (sadly, in my case) after a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> It claims to leave your face with less sebum, but sadly I have not seen this happen.</li>
            <li> and it was not good for my skin and</li>
            <li> I have used Murad, and other expensive oil control serums and it cannot touch this product!  </li>
            <li> I have recently started using Murad dark spot serum which smells horrible.</li>
            <li> so my bacteria was out of whack and making the acne worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Skinfood Peach Sake skincare and make-up line for approximately 2 months now and here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried about every expensive and inexpensive product out there for my oily skin</li>
            <li> So unfortunate.....</li>
            <li> I dont know if I did something wrong or this product doesn&#x27;t suits me.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you why this product has made me obsessed with Skinfood:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and smells divine.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they are awful, no one should use them, and they are too harsh for ANY skin.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> This contains alcohol which is bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> typically I hate &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> so if you are using a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; as a primer base then I would try this.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful (but hopeful) about this serum&#x27;s ability to reduce pores.  </li>
            <li> Let me remind you that I was very doubtful about its ability to shrink my pores, but lo and behold!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews...but dude this stuff is AWESOME. It shrinks your pores like almost instantly. And today was the first day I started using this! AMAZING.</li>
            <li> First of all the smell of this serum is delicious. It absorbed quickly and I could see smaller pores right away. It did well under my foundation. I could not find a complete list of ingredients for this product. I&#x27;m trying to avoid parabens and other chemicals. I was also curious about the fragrance. I&#x27;m hoping its not synthetic. Performance wise its a keeper. It did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Came earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t broken out because of it, like I would with regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Came with two free samples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of any really.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  Sink right in to skin, leaving it silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the toner and emulsion. I seriously couldn&#x27;t live without them. The scent is light and fresh. It fades quickly as well so if you don&#x27;t like it, no worries!  My pores are noticeably smaller and my skin smoother and more supple. I have quite large pores on my nose and used to wear a primer and foundation every day. Now I only wear makeup to work and many days, it&#x27;s just a bit of cc cream with a drop of beauty oil.</li>
            <li> wonderful serum that gives your skin a matte finish, i love it cause i use it before my makeup and i feel my pores get smaller.</li>
            <li> I just received this serum along with my black sugar mask scrub yesterday. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out, but I&#x27;m waiting for my other Skinfood products. When I first opened the package it was not wrapped nicely at all. It could&#x27;ve crack... Disappointing. Lucky it didn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m still happy. I hope my other products will be better wrapped. I will write another review after testing. Honestly :)</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m semi sure this was a good product, when I received it, the glass bottle it was in was completely smashed. Smelled really nice but went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> This serum made my face feel so soft!! Although it&#x27;s a little drying, it&#x27;s helping with my acne a lot :)</li>
            <li> Where do I start with this one???  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  I have extremely oily skin and no product has worked for me before.  This is the ONLY product that has been able to control my oily skin.  That being said, I still get oily but it takes a LOT longer to get there.  I have used Murad, and other expensive oil control serums and it cannot touch this product!  I put my makeup on at 7 and typically by 10 AM, I am getting shiny.  By noon 11 AM, I am glistening!  This product has enabled me to be shine free until 1 to 2 PM which is a record!!  Even when I do get oily, it is not as oily as with other products.  It may be my imagination, but I swear that it has actually changed the consistency of my skin.  My skin feels very soft and supple.  I use this under my makeup and before I got to bed.  I actually wake up shine free!  Again, this is a new world for me as this has never happened before using this product.  I will update on whether it actually makes my pores smaller over time.  I have used this for over a week now and the results are pretty amazing with the texture of skin.  Loving everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely peach scent.  Not overwhelming.  However, if you are sensitive to scents, you may not like it.  I love the scent and makes everything so pretty.  Packaging is beautiful!  Looks pretty on your vanity.  I use this after using the Skin Food Sake Peach Toner.  Works great together or alone!  My go to product and an important arsenal in my skin care routine!!</li>
            <li> I looove this product. Its great! I received it couple days ago and noticed a difference. My face isn&#x27;t oily as much and its so soft. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that they had a hard time pumping the product out and had to constantly pump for the product to come out. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. When I first applied it I could smell the peaches. I like peaches. After a short while the smell was gone.  The packaging was so cute. Came in a purple plastic envelope(purple is my favorite color!) with a cute cartoon stamp. They gave me a sample of their black sugar mask wash off. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but if I like it I&#x27;d most definitely order it from Amazon. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that when I opened the package I saw  bubble wrap and figured the serum was wrapped.So I dumped it out only to find out my serum wasn&#x27;t protected it fell out. Thank God it didn&#x27;t break. They used the bubble wrap for their business card and sample. So be careful. Other than that if you have an oily face this serum will work great for you :)</li>
            <li> I notice that my pores has gotten smaller after two weeks of using this product. Because of that, putting on my primer and foundation has been a breeze. I have sensitive acne prone skin, and this serum hasn&#x27;t made me any break outs.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for oily skin. Has a fresh peach scent and dries down to a matte finish/feeling after application. In the summer it may be all you need as far a moisturizing goes, but in the winter expect to use something heavier after it. To properly use, pat the product on as opposed to wiping/rubbing it in. People with dry skin: do not use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from A Poly and it arrived quickly (as quickly as things can come all the way from Korea). The bottle did have some minor damage at the top, where the pump dispenser screws onto the bottle itself. A small piece of glass had cracked off. Bottle still works as intended and I do not fault the seller for this, as she had the bottle wrapped in a generous amount of bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks. I don&#x27;t know if I need to use it longer to see the results but after two weeks, my pores stayed exactly the same with more whiteheads...(nose). It&#x27;s smooth thin bit watery texture and smells nice, but it was not worth the money for me. Shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> First week I start using the product, it didn&#x27;t do any immprovement on my face.  I did not continue using it.. Maybe, later on next week.&lt;br /&gt;No further comment at present.</li>
            <li> The most horrible facial product I have ever used. If you&#x27;ve used higher brands, save your money on this!</li>
            <li> I adore this product! It smells sooo good! Has a pump to make dispensing it easier. slightly mattifies my more oily areas while still hydrating my whole face. After using this a few times I noticed I didn&#x27;t produce as much oil in my &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone even under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It&#x27;s very refreshing, I need to order more!!</li>
            <li> This is literally the only product I have ever used that helps control the oil on my face. I haven&#x27;t had to blot throughout the entire day which is definitely new for me and I&#x27;m not greasy looking whatsoever! I seriously love this serum and will continue to buy it once I run out. Plus it smells so good, like real peaches :)</li>
            <li> Idk about shrinking my pores for the whole day but it definitely did when I first applied it and it really helps with oil. My makeup looked flawless on top of it. I have combo skin and just get oily in the T-zone. This worked great for that! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin though.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very effective. Seemed to make my t-zone oily and shiny</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because of the reviews online &amp; they were correct. It smells great &amp; it minimizes pores &amp; it comes in a cute glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Skin Food is my new favorite skincare line. I use this together with the toner and emulsion and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Seals and protects my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is light and effective as a moisturizer.  I have yet to see any results as a pore refiner, but I have only been using it a few days.  However it does seem to make my skin appear smoother when it is applied before the application of powder.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling SO smooth!!! It smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Okay, I hardly EVER review on beauty products, FYI.  I was given a sample of this recently and since I&#x27;m a fan of Skin Food (their Grape Seed BB Cream is fantastic) and love peach-scented products, I decided to try it.  I just removed my makeup with a remover cloth, and gave my face a nice good rinse before applying. No cleanser, no toner, nothing.  Less than 10 minutes later, my face felt unbelievably soft. Because I have dark spots on my face and I&#x27;m quite oily, it&#x27;ll take a lot more than a soft face to impress me. Figured \\&quot;it&#x27;s just a sample, no harm, no foul.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut to the next morning....I looked in the mirror and my face looked more refreshed than it had ever been! My dark spots were hardly visible, and my face looked like porcelain! It was unbelievable! No doubt, I&#x27;m buying a case of these just on the off-chance they might get discontinued, with my luck! I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone with oily and/or combination skin that needs a good evening! Amazing!  Also, the other reviews were correct, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering at all and disappears (sadly, in my case) after a minute or two.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really works for oily skin.  It may be a little drying for winter though.  I would use it again.</li>
            <li> Here is another fantastic product from SkinFood.  At nearly 60 I still have good skin, but as we age, things happen...pores do become larger.  So, if you&#x27;re like me, we&#x27;re all looking for a product that will reduce the appearance of our pores and this works.  I have been using it now for nearly a month and I noticed the difference after 3 weeks.  I was using this with my Hyaluronic Acid Serum so I was seeing results everywhere. As a bonus, it smells yummy but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger.  It arrived very fast and was well packaged.  I plan on using this for the rest of my days, what better recommendation can I offer you? Thanks for looking!</li>
            <li> I love it so far! I purchased this item as part of my skin care routine. It has lovely, light peachy smell. It makes my skin look and feel super smooth. It really does do a good job at minimizing pores(so far) and it does seem to help with oiliness. I&#x27;m using this alone with peach sake bb cream. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have never used a creme-like serum before, but now I am wondering what has take me so long! I saw this product on a Buzzfeed about Korean skin care products, and I am so hooked on this now! Smaller pores and clearer skin :).</li>
            <li> I use this daily under my BB cream. It definitely helps with oil control. I have already bought another as a backup!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my serum. Skin is so soft and my pores really got smaller. worth to wait for this product. Also they send you some free samples .</li>
            <li> Like this product as it does help a bit to control the oil on my face. My face looks more matte. I brought this for the summer month as I have oily skin and use one pump for my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is highly sensitive to most products and it also gets oily very quickly.  This product was about the best thing I have ever ran across!  I use it in the morning before putting on my make up and by bedtime, my skin still looks as good as it did in the morning! It&#x27;s amazing because no other product has done that for me and I&#x27;ve tried about every expensive and inexpensive product out there for my oily skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product makes my skin feel soft, it absorbs oil and leaves my skin with a matte look, it smells great, good for my skin, and it&#x27;s inexpensive!  Best find ever!</li>
            <li> This skin serum is really nice. Right after applying this, your skin will feel silky smooth. Helps control sebum. I really like the texture of it. Only thing is, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any huge difference in the appearance of my pores. But after using this my skin does feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product and other Skin Food items. This stuff is amazing and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. One pump before you apply your make up is all you need if you are looking for a touch of moisture.</li>
            <li> oily skin best  control oil</li>
            <li> This is probably the first time I used up a product to the last pump. It leaves a light and clean feeling on my face after applying! The smell is also plus. Oh yeah, and I think the bottle is pretty darn cute as well :-) The packaging was carefully wrapped so that there&#x27;s no damage to the bottle and a generous amount of samples. It claims to leave your face with less sebum, but sadly I have not seen this happen. Other than that, I would purchase this again for the price.</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic. My skin just sucked it up and after every use it feels incredibly soft. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin tone and my pores have shrunk with every use. Even hours after I&#x27;ve applied it I still feel like it&#x27;s benefiting my skin. The smell is really appealing but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long. My skin is really sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product. You don&#x27;t need to use too much of this product to cover your entire face, and I usually use it only in the morning and feel like it&#x27;s a great base before I put on all my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder this even before it runs out to make sure that I won&#x27;t miss a day of it.</li>
            <li> Great pore care product. My face looks so much better since incorporating this product into my cleansing routine. Thank you!</li>
            <li> makes you silky smooth and soft and sweet peach scent!</li>
            <li> This product smells so amazing like fresh peaches, and feels so velvety on my skin. I use it after my showers before applying BB cream. I would order again in a heart beat and even added it to my favorite summer items list on my blog!</li>
            <li> It really really worked well. My skin is smoother and feels fresher. I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I really really love the smell and finish to the skin when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin feel like satin!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It smells really yummy and it goes on really smooth. My skin absorbed it right away and it leaves your skin feeling soft. I have large pores on my nose and for me it started working right away. Put it on after exfoliating or cleansing and it works especially well. If you like the smell of peaches you&#x27;ll definitely love this.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and smells lovely, like peaches and champagne, but I&#x27;m not sure if it does much. I use it after cleansing and AHA serum.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for anyone with oily skin. I have combination skin so it helped control the oil on my nose and t zone. The only thing is that it slightly dried out the parts that were not oily</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. I spend a lot of time and effort to keep myself hydrated, make sure my skin is moisturized, and everything I can to make sure my skin is happy, but my face just wants to pump out oil like it&#x27;s going to solve the energy crisis. This serum, along with the Skin Food Peach Sake powder, an oil control sunscreen (The Face Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF 40 PA+++), and topical BHA keep me relatively shine-free for about 6 hours. I like this serum because it layers well. I use it over my sunscreen and it does not pill. It also doesn&#x27;t cause any issues when I put makeup on top of it. It smooths out the pores on my cheeks and leaves my skin with a matte finish, even after moisturizers and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a thick cream, but it spreads easily. It has a pump top that makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product- I typically use about 1 and a half pumps to cover my face. It feels light on the skin, not sticky or greasy like some silicone primers. It smells quite strongly of peach. I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrance, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell. If fragrance bothers you, I&#x27;d avoid this whole line.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel! I use it after the peach sake toner and my skin feels like silk!! The bottle is so adorable and the smell is very yummy. A fruity peach smell...not one of those over the top fake scents you get in beauty products sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is not greasy at all and dries to almost a powdery velvety feel. I am very pleased with the peach sake line so far!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I really like it so far!  I have extremely oily skin and sporadic problems with pimples.  I recently started using Korean products containing bee venom and taking Japanese herbal supplements that assist with correcting problematic skin.  With that being said, I am not sure how much of a difference this product is actually making for me face, but I am certain about four things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) after applying the serum onto my face, it feels so smooth and not oily at all;&lt;br /&gt;2) my face usually starts to get oily after 2 hours from washing or applying makeup but with the serum, I notice a lot less shine and my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily until about 5 hours or so later;&lt;br /&gt;3) I have large pores on my cheeks near my nose, and I noticed after 5 days of use that they are a little bit smaller; and&lt;br /&gt;4) serum has a very pleasant peach and sake scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what I has hoped.</li>
            <li> Absorbs super well into the skin. Might get it again!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! it really helps keep my skin hydrated after constantly washing it. I wish it would come in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Skin care never worked out for my because my skin is ultra sensitive and breaks out to most skin care products. Well SKin Food is different. It&#x27;s literally food for your skin because my skin didn&#x27;t break out and my pores were smaller within one night&#x27;s usage! I use it with the toner and serum as well. Plus my skin feels baby smooth now and isn&#x27;t dry and icky. I don&#x27;t have dead skin cells peeling off my skin and now when I apply BB cream it looks smooth and natural :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for my pore care, I believe it only worked because I used all 3 Skin Food toner, emulsion, serum set and instead of any BB cream, I use the Skin Food Peach BB as well or Petit Pore Clearing BB. Using just a BB or just a toner, etc. is definitely not effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Oil-based make up cleaner (I use a wipe)&lt;br /&gt;2. Foaming face wash&lt;br /&gt;3. Toner&lt;br /&gt;4. Emulsion&lt;br /&gt;5. Serum&lt;br /&gt;6. BB cream</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it, it makes my face nice and soft, I use it only during the night.</li>
            <li> This is another wonderful product from skinfood. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. I have noticed a reduction in oil production too. A little hours a long way with this stuff so it will last a long time. I usually put it on after a light moisturizers it works well as a primer for liquid or powder foundation. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I really can&#x27;t see any difference in my pores, but it sure does smell lovely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically quite skeptical about products, having been fooled by claims repeatedly in the past, but I really like this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and while my pores are probably about the same size, I&#x27;ve stopped being super shiny by the end of the day, which makes it WELL worth the money for me. It smells amazing, absorbs quickly, and leaves me with a 90% matte appearance when I leave work even when it&#x27;s humid outside. It&#x27;s totally going to be a staple for me from now on (or at least until my skin decides to enter its next crazy phase).</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this and it makes my pores feel tighter when I use it! :)</li>
            <li> I meant to order the toner and I accidentally ordered the serum. The serum is just not doing anything for me- dries out my skin and my pores look the same. I want to try the toner but I&#x27;m afraid most of these reviews are fake since the serum had no impact on my pores. Oh- on the positive side it smells great, has cute packaging and only cost $12 so I don&#x27;t feel too bad  :)</li>
            <li> Now mind you I&#x27;ve only been using this for two weeks and I started it in conjunction with using the body shop&#x27;s daily aloe cleanser. Also, I&#x27;ve started chugging acidophilus so that also helps clear up skin problems. So take this as you will. My skin was severely breaking out in pimples of all sizes and getting incredibly oily with the summer heat (105*F is not cool man), and I had been taking meds so my bacteria was out of whack and making the acne worse. I started these products and its almost all gone, and furthermore, my pores are almost completely gone. For that to happen in a little less than 2 weeks is amazing. This product obviously doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it doesn&#x27;t dry you out or sting, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily like my last serum either. It&#x27;s very thin and smells divine. Perfect product id say. Already bought a new batch so I can always use it.</li>
            <li> simply put this stuff is amazing! The packaging is super cute, the jar is nice and heavy. First thing I noticed when I put it on was how amazing it smells, like the most delicious peach sake. The formula is nice and light. It goes on smoothly and instantly disappears into skin, making the skin look matte and pores almost invisible.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m not sure if you are supposed to use this under your makeup but that&#x27;s how I use it. In the morning I wash my face with LG Su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick. It leaves me with a super clean and exfoliated skin. I squeeze 3 pumps of the peace sake pore primer onto my fingers and rub it all over my whole face. I wait about 3 minutes for it to dry and it leaves me with a velvety surface for my makeup. This primer keeps my makeup fresh and matte all day. I won&#x27;t be able to get by without from now on!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and no matter what by midday my face is super greasy. This product promised to control sebum and moisturizer which both it has done. It&#x27;s also cheaper than 70% of similar products. Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and while this product did help with controlling that, it also seemed to clog my pores as well. While using this I noticed a definite increase in acne which faded soon after not using the serum, not to mention my sebaceous filaments were much more noticeable as well. Also when applied it would leave this strange film on my skin. I really wanted to like this because it smells really nice and helps with oil, but the bad simply outweighs the good.</li>
            <li> I use this after my serum to keep the shine and oil at bay I love the peach scent and it goes on smoothly and your skin feels very nice and shipping is great even coming from korea</li>
            <li> My first serum, and I love it! Smells yummy and my skin seems to enjoy it. &#x3D;^_^&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.  Great value for the money.  Product was larger than expected and has a nice slight peachy smell to it and I am allergic to everything.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, particularly in the T-zone, and I was really surprised to find this serum controls shine very well. On first application, it mattifies the skin like you would expect from a silicone primer, and although it doesn&#x27;t stay that matte during the day, it manages to stop my skin from developing that greasy layer look for at least 6 hours. And this observation is on bare skin -- you could get more oil control if you wanted to use powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this isn&#x27;t really a primer, and I don&#x27;t use it as one (but some people can) -- it&#x27;s more of skin care product. I tried it as a primer at first, but found it tends to pill off when putting foundation on top and then becomes ineffective. I use it after moisturiser (just a pea sized amount for my nose, then any leftover amount on my chin) and let it sink in for about 10 minutes before applying my normal primer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any impact on pores or pore size, but I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month so maybe it will change with long term use. This is not a miracle product, but I do like it a lot just for the oil control. It smells wonderfully of peaches when you first put it on, makes your skin feel soft and smooth, and my skin did not break out or have any negative reaction.</li>
            <li> The smells is delicate and fresh. It smooths the skin and fills tiny lines, making a wonderful canvas for foundation. Helps oily skin stay matte. I suggest Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder if you have very oily skin like myself. I love this fine product and plan on reordering from this excellent seller.</li>
            <li> I have visible clogged pores on certain parts of my face and this has really and truly reduced their appearance in less than two weeks. A little goes a long way and I do not recomment putting the products on your entire face as it does have a drying effect - as it should because it is working to release the sebum. I noticed a few breakouts after using, but I would say it is well worth it because after they clear up my skin looks and feels incredible. Would buy again. Product ships from Korea and takes a few weeks, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This serum has a very pleasant scent. Combined with the toner, emulsion, and finishing powder I could tell that my skin was less oily after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and makes the skin feel silky afterwards.  The smell is very light but just lovely. When applied under makeup, skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li> It really works!  My T-zone was shine free for over 10 hours. And my skin was not dry or flaky what had happened before after using  anti-shine serums/creams. I  love these Korean cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped with my oily skin. I use to have to blot my face every couple hours. Now I only blot once a day. This is really good for people with really oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this melts into your skin. It does wonders. My pores looked smaller in about a week!</li>
            <li> Smells really good and soaks into my skin easily, but I feel it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my pores or skin overall. My main beef with this is that I hate how much product I&#x27;ve had to use because it soaks in quickly, so I have to work fast prior to it soaking in my fingers. Secondly, it has yet to improve my skin, used alone (as in, not using any other pore refiner&#x27;s) it didn&#x27;t do anything but smell nice on my face. Perhaps it might work better if I combine this with the other Peach Sake products.</li>
            <li> i love the peachy smell. i feel happy whenever i put it on. just the result needs to take some time and there&#x27;s some sparkling particles showed up when i look it real closely, makes me wonder is it safe to use on my naked face or for make up purpose? but overall i used it after i shower, has no serious problem with it. Its gentle on face and not a bad chioce to make.</li>
            <li> I love it! Your skin look pretty from the first application and smells so good.</li>
            <li> made me break out, so rather counterproductive in fact.</li>
            <li> Great feeling after it absorbs. It is pungent when first applied, but the smell softens and dissipates to a lovely peach smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower. Use sparingly if you have oily skin. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work. I wear mineral foundation, and it gives me a nice glow when I first apply it, but I usually have to blot a couple of times throughout the day. With this, I still get my nice glow, but I don&#x27;t have to blot at all! My pores look nicer as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and makes my skin feel really soft.  It also came with free samples so I thought that was really nice of them.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, prompt delivery but the product itself is too drying and the smell is so strong that my skin tingles upon application and for the first time in my life I developed an allergic reaction. So unfortunate.....</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong that it lingers for so long. Too long even. I&#x27;ve had headaches using this and I can&#x27;t use this anymore.</li>
            <li> I have to say...typically I hate &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; products. About my skin: I am mixed (Korean and white) and in my mid 20&#x27;s.  Before I made the switch from products geared &amp;#34;for oily skin&amp;#34; to moisturizing products, my skin would erupt weekly with 2-4 crazy &amp;#34;volcano sized&amp;#34; blemishes and several small scattered blemishes around my hairline and such, lots of blackheads.  I have very oily skin, but have only experienced breakouts with &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;acne control&amp;#34; products or not moisturizing properly, so I typically treat it as dry skin (I now have beautiful, healthy, blemish-free skin, but just figured I&#x27;d deal with the shine) .  This, however, has been my exception...now that I&#x27;ve figured out how to make it work for me.  At first I tried to use this as a serum...after toner and before moisturizing cream...wasn&#x27;t bad but didn&#x27;t control oil while it was layered under a heavy moisturizing cream.  Next, I tried to eliminate the cream entirely, putting this over my hadalabo toner with the bb cream directly above it...this actually did work for absorbing oil and getting the bb cream on nicely, but my skin was not getting enough moisture with just the toner, so the texture was slightly off and I ended up getting a few blemishes.  I finally realized that this product is best used as a base/primer for me (layered over moisturizer and under bb cream) and was amazed!  I finally achieved perfect balance of moisturized, non-greasy skin...it looks bouncy and healthy, but finally not shiny!  Once I figured out where this fits in my routine, it&#x27;s amazing!  For anybody who&#x27;s curious, right now I use (in order) skinfood black sugar cleansing oil (at night), kanebo/kracie naive peach foaming cleanser, skinfood black sugar mask 2-3 times per week during the day (laneige water sleeping pack on alternate nights), hadalabo lotion (toner), 2 drops 100% camellia oil (as serum), hadalabo cream, a couple spritzes of tonymoly moist bunny facial mist, skinfood peach sake serum (as base/primer).  The way my skin behaves lately, I don&#x27;t even need to wear makeup every day, if I do, just a lighter bb cream (I like skinfood honey black tea bb cream).  This product also looks nice over moisturizer by itself (with no makeup) like some primers do.</li>
            <li> Expired items received</li>
            <li> Skin food delivered a great product yet again. I really like this product, I have been trying the Korean skincare routine for a while but couldn&#x27;t find a good serum to go before my face moisturizer. I have combination T-zone oily skin and this has worked great in not only minimizing my pores overtime but also decreasing the oiliness in my face, it also made my face brighter and more relaxed looking. Its moisturizing but not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. It is scented and has this wonderful fresh peach scent, but its not overpowering and does not linger to long.  I personally use it at night since its a serum, therefore highly concentrate, and I want it to work its &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, but it could also work as a primer. Overall great porducts.</li>
            <li> Works great under makeup to visibly minimize pores and soak up excess oil.  Lovely, delicate peach scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long but is pleasant to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I discovered on a recent trip that using a few squirts of this serum on the roots of my hair did a great job to control oil and keep my hair looking good when I wasn&#x27;t able to wash it every day.  Kept hair as fresh as dry shampoos without dull, powdery looking hair or powdery mess in the bathroom after use.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the way it makes my skin feel, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that it took several weeks to a month to arrive. Love the product but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m patient enough to buy it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed as I get older that my pores are getting larger and of all the products I have tried over the years to get rid of blackheads nothing has worked. This stuff has made my skin softer, smoother, free of blackheads (esp on nose and chin areas) without making me oily. It smells good, very lightly scented. I have recently started using Murad dark spot serum which smells horrible. I use that first now and then put the Skin Food Peach Sake serum on top of that and the smell is totally gone. Love love love this! I bought some for my sister as a gift and even though she doesn&#x27;t layer products on like I do she has had the same results. Can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product. I will buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This really does control the oil on my face for a whole day, and doubles as a great primer as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin too dry by itself, so I have to layer it underneath my regular moisturizer. Makes my skin soft and smooth and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product within the first use. It leaves your face so silky, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and many products that I have used in the past, even those targeted towards sensitive skin, have always given me a burning sensation when applied. I didn&#x27;t feel it at all with this product. I also used to wake up with oily skin, but that is a thing of the past with this product. I actually wake up to beautiful, fresh looking skin!! ^_^ My pores have definitely improved as well. The scent is light and peachy, of course, and like another reviewer mentioned, when followed with make up my skin looked flawless.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my oily skin. It helps absorb the oil only for a couple hours more than normal, however my pores do look much smaller and my skin is always very soft after using it. I put it on under my Holika Holika BB cream in the mornings and the peachy smell is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I really love how this serum smells. I usually put it before I put on BB cream and so far it&#x27;s been really good to my skin. At first I was kind of iffy with buying it but I am really glad I did because it works wonder. Definitely buying again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be like the pore blurring products they sell to hide your skin imperfections. I was WRONG! This stuff really mattifies the skin without drying and does so even with moisturizers layered on top. I double cleanse, use toner, add this, an emulsion, a layer of snail repair cream, and a moisturizer and my face still isn&#x27;t shiny or oily. My combination/oily skin is supple and soft and I&#x27;m so glad I added this! I usually have  an issue with putting on my whole getup and looking shiny after but that wasn&#x27;t the case. This was my first Skinfood product and definitely not my last. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> really helpful and not oily ,smell of peaches are great!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, and works great for me. I still need an emulsion though because it&#x27;s a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I posted the review for this on the peach sake toner on accident and I&#x27;m not about to re-type it so it&#x27;s a great product okay?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for months, and I really tried to enjoy it because I jut really love Skinfood. It had so many good reviews and it smells really nice too! I have yet to see any&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin even for using it every night for 2 months. I hope it works for someone with different skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using DHC Velvet Skin Coat (make-up primer) but now will switch to this. Why? It is easier to put on and delivers a pretty close effect. The Velvet skin coat is more $,it tends to pull skin and the last bit in the container is always too thick and heavy. This is a lotion so if you are using a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; as a primer base then I would try this. You may need to add a light moisturizer underneath for winter. Company was prompt and they send free samples with your orders.</li>
            <li> I noticed less oily skin in the t-zone area but everywhere else looked and felt dry since I am not oily skinned. Good for oil problems but if used in dry areas the cream will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing :) It feels great on skin, no irritation, the smell is very good, and it really does work for me and I&#x27;m sure other people will also love it. I will certainly buy again (^^). Really recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it more than 3 weeks ,at first I felt that my skin became smoother. However all that has changed now. My skin now is dry. I dont know if I did something wrong or this product doesn&#x27;t suits me. Also, think it does work only with oily skin.</li>
            <li> The product is a nice hydrating serum (though mine had some grittiness to it which was strange, but this disappeared once rubbed in so perhaps they were some sort of lotion bead) but I didn&#x27;t see smaller pores in the few months I used it. I do like that it made my face feel moisturized and not greasy, my skin felt a little tighter and the scent was pleasant. I&#x27;d be willing to try out their other products since they seem well made (and worth the price) but this one wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> AMAZING products. I never felt my skin as soft as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used so many products out there in the market. And never have I had the results that the Peach Sake skin products has given me. I have the Toner, Serum and Emulsion. Planning to buy more from this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely be buying again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> This contains alcohol which is bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing-really yummy and fresh. It has an interesting consistency of a lotion, but is not as thick. Definitely different from other serums I have used though, since the others are usually clearer and melted jelly like. As for the benefits, haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference in my skin quality before and afterwards (I have used up the whole bottle after about 3 months). Maybe I have to use all of the products in the series to get a more noticeable result, but for now I&#x27;ll try other Korean products since this one wasn&#x27;t impressive to me. The packaging is wonderful, as most asian products are. It looks like a sake bottle and the cap is made of a plastic covered by textured cardboard to give the appearance of wood, while the body is made of glass.</li>
            <li> Skinfood is a brand I&#x27;ve been familiar with for a couple of years, but I hadn&#x27;t moved beyond their rice masks and their sugar scrubs until this product.  I was looking for a serum to make my skin softer.  I was doubtful (but hopeful) about this serum&#x27;s ability to reduce pores.  Let me tell you why this product has made me obsessed with Skinfood:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum smells absolutely delicious.&lt;br /&gt;I really can see differences in my pores, both short term and long term.  Let me remind you that I was very doubtful about its ability to shrink my pores, but lo and behold!  Even my overly critical mother was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel very, very soft.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheek!&lt;br /&gt;And it seems like it will last for a very long time.  Regardless, I&#x27;ve already ordered another because I don&#x27;t think I can stand my face without this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used other pore-reduction serums, but let me tell you that this one product makes my skin feel softer than my Olay ProX regimen (although I still use those products to keep my skin firm and youthful).  I like the pump on the bottle, but I have concerns about getting the rest of the product out when it is running low.  I hope that the top is removable so that I can fully finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I&#x27;ve already bought it again!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and feels, it leaves my face feeling so soft too.</li>
            <li> smells great and makes my skin so heavenly!</li>
            <li> really does the job. It&#x27;s more or less like a mattifying lotion/primer if you have ever used one. I use this under my bb cream to control oil production all day. I really  love the peach sake skin food line and I think using the other products in the line in combination with this one really increases their performance. The smell is great too.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using this for a couple of days and my pores appear a bit smaller on my nose. This product gives my face a radiance glow cant wait for long term results.</li>
            <li> This product is glorious at reducing some of your excess sebum! I recommend using it in the morning before makeup to help reduce oiliness throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I have combination, acne-prone skin that&#x27;s very oily and this product keeps the oil at bay. Although it has a fragrance, it&#x27;s pleasant and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin. The packaging is really cute and the pump works really well. I do seem to be going through it quickly and almost wish it were bigger though-- will be repurchasing soon.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, and makes my skin seem really soft, but it actually just coats the skin like a spackle and has the horrible tendency to pill and roll off your skin, so it looks like you have dead skin everywhere. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and all but it didn&#x27;t do it for me. It didn&#x27;t moisturize me as much as I would have liked but I say its cool.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores on my nose and I used it for months. No change in pore appearance, but it smells peachy and nice. It was worth a try since it was relatively inexpensive. Shipping took about a week.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  It really feels great when I put this on.  My pores got smaller,  they did disappear at all, but reduced in size. Definitely will purchase again maybe with toner .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin while using this. My face doesn&#x27;t produce as much oil as it used to while using this. Which a plus for me because I usually have super oily skin, not cute!</li>
            <li> It leaves a white layer on your face which feels like you put on make up or something. Don&#x27;t know if I was supposed to only use it in the morning before make up. There is no direction of use what so ever that&#x27;s in English for me to follow.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for about 2 months. I believe pores got smaller than before. Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that this product contains paraben.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use Skin Food BB cream and the facial powder and I have seen real results with my skin. I receive compliments on the look and I notice a real difference in the smoothness and less dry patches and oily skin. I have a T-zone complexion and it really helps with both!</li>
            <li> this product is for people who has oily skin ONLY. i have oily to dry skin and it was not good for my skin and the product dried out my skin even after i used facial lotion my skin was still dry. This is a product that should only be used in the morning when you are planning to go out all day (if your face gets oily when walking around in the sun for too long, you should use this product). One more thing, i recommend using half a pump to about 1 pump, because it tend to dry out your skin. Don&#x27;t worry about the smell it doesn&#x27;t has a strong peach smell or anything, it has a small hint but not enough to drown your sense of smell. ^_^ i say overall this product is okay because i have oily to dry skin. But if you have dry skin, i would stay away from this product. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> Love it! Cute packaging, Korean, smells great, and isn&#x27;t greasy! And my skin does look better! ^^ Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with oily skin who wants to mattify the face before putting on makeup.  I use this every day after showering and putting on facial moisturizer.  It matte-ifies my skin without drying it out and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue so my face is a smoother canvas for makeup application.  I wear the following makeup every day for work: liquid eyeliner, BB cream (recently changed from a little concealer), and lipstick that I carry in my pocket.  For the BB cream, I like putting this serum on before--I think it does actually make the application way smoother and I looooove LOVE LOVE the way it makes my skin feel afterward.  It also smells AMAZING like peaches.  Can&#x27;t beat it.  This product changed my life and up-ed the luxuriousness of my morning pre-work makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner (2 days), looks exactly as pictured. The bottle is glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant smell, soaks into skin well, does not leave a residue or oil to the skin. I have very oily skin, and have not noticed any heavy feeling with use of this item and find that it layers well beneath makeup. I have noticed a little reduction in pore size, but no miracle poor erasing (I don&#x27;t think there is a product that can completely win a fight against genetics like that), and find the price of the item to be very reasonably priced. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This actually works. I have massive pores that you can spot a mile away but after religiously using this after cleansing, my pores actually got smaller! It&#x27;s scent is also very pleasing. This is really worth a try if you&#x27;re desperate for smaller pores. It doesn&#x27;t work instantly but signs of smaller pores should be viable after a week, at least that was the case for me. It may take up to a little more than a week to show changes but it should work!</li>
            <li> Because it didn&#x27;t do nothing good to my face. And I didn&#x27;t see any changes. I don&#x27; t like this product and do not recommend it. Lydia.</li>
            <li> Warning: LONG review – My skin is EXTREMELY oily, cystic/hormonal acne prone and sensitive to boot. I have been using the Skinfood Peach Sake skincare and make-up line for approximately 2 months now and here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased all of the products through k-beauty and the products are authentic and shipped fast, usually less than one week. I usually have to wait 2-5 weeks for my products coming straight from Korea, which is not great when you run out of something your skin loves. The line smells fantastic, softens skin and does a great job of controlling shine/oil/sebum.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of confusion about the skincare line and what the products are, what they do, and how to use them. First of all let me point out that description/name of products that are used in different countries have totally different meanings/functions – case in point is the ‘toner’. American ‘toners’ or astringents are extremely harsh and drying on the skin and contain a massive amount of alcohol. In my opinion, they are awful, no one should use them, and they are too harsh for ANY skin. People generally think because you have oily skin you must punish and strip it of all oils to ‘cure’ it and make it ‘normal’, when all you are doing is damaging your skin, making it freak out that it’s so dry, and forcing it to overproduce even more sebum and exacerbating your problem.&lt;br /&gt;Korean skincare products are generally applied lightest texture to thickest texture. For the Peach Sake products they should be optimally applied in this order: Toner – Serum – Emulsion. If you have combination skin, I think you can skip the serum. If you have extremely oily skin mostly in the dreaded T-zone, the serum may only need to be applied in this zone to work best for you. I live in New England, where we are having an especially cold and dry winter, the serum made my face dry and ashy on cheeks and around my mouth. I then only applied it in T-zone, and have put it on hold to wait for more hot/humid summer weather in case I need it. The Toner and Emulsion have been working just fine for me, even with my extreme sebum production.&lt;br /&gt;All of the products have moisturizing properties, along with different skin benefits, that deliver the ingredients to different layers of your skin. It is important to wash your face properly every morning and evening before applying the products. In the evening, if you wear make-up, you should do a ‘double wash’, which means you use an oil based make-up remover cleanser (especially if you wear BB creams. I use DHC cleansing oil), and then a ‘normal’ face wash to make sure all make-up/impurities are removed from your face.&lt;br /&gt;Some people are saying it is hard to get the products out of the bottle. I find it is hard to control the product and make sure you only get out what you need, which is a VERY small amount. There is a rubber stopper, with a central rubber knob that pops out, in both the toner and emulsion bottles. I am wondering if some people are not realizing that the central rubber knob needs to be popped out to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;If you use the Korean ‘tap-tap’ method, you will also only need a very small amount of product to cover your whole face and neck. I have been using the products for two months and still have half of the Toner and Emulsion. I have run out of the Serum and re-ordered another bottle that I am saving for summer in case I need more oil control then.&lt;br /&gt;After washing your face, PAT dry with a towel, a couple pats will do, your face should only be ‘damp dry’ – please do NOT rub at your face with your towel! Cup you palm and dab about a dime sized in circumference amount of the Toner in your palm. Rub your palms together to warm the product, press you palms vertically against both sides of your face/over your cheeks, then horizontally across your face with one hand across your forehead and the other across your mouth. I also press my palms intomy neck/throat, then GENTLY pat all over my face (please, no slap-stick Three Stooges moves, don’t knock yourself out, ladies!), you can also gently tap your fingers as you go like you are lightly tapping on piano keys.&lt;br /&gt;When the product is absorbed (your skin will still have the feeling of being slightly moist), you can use 1-2 pumps of the emulsion, smoothing it onto your T-zone and either gently spread or tapping it from the center to the outside of your face until absorbed. Your skin will feel cottony/powdery soft and dry after this product is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, cup your palm again, tap out about a dime-nickel sized in circumference amount of the emulsion, rub your palms together again, and apply just as the toner described above. When absorbed, your face will feel powdery soft, smooth and moisturized (not as cottony dry as the serum). You can and may still need a moisturizer after the emulsion. I have been using Laneige Water bank Gel during the winter, afterwards I use a skin finisher, which I cannot find anywhere in the US. A skin finisher is NOT a moisturizer, primer, BB, or CC cream. I have been using the Sulwahsoo Luminature Essential Finisher which I will review later. I am just mentioning this because this is my normal skincare routine: wash – toner – emulsion – moisturizer – finisher.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking just on the Skinfood Peach Sake Toner, Serum, and Emulsion line alone – it has worked for me better than anything else I have tried for oil control without freaking out my sensitive skin. Does my skin still get oily, yes it does. However, I have gone from using 6-10 blotting sheets a DAY with reapplying powder 3-6 times a DAY, down to ONE sheet of blotting paper mid-day with MAYBE needing a dab of powder in my T-zone, but not always. A HUGE improvement to say the least. My makeup applies a lot easier and smoothly since Skinfood Peach Sake, stays in place and looks just as good at the end of the day as when I freshly applied it in the morning. The only con I have for this line is that although it has helped immensely with controlling sebum, it has not PREVENTED new acne from forming. At the same time, it has NOT CAUSED acne break outs or skin irritation. I still got my normal hormonal acne break-outs. Yea, I wasn’t really expecting it to help with that, as nothing but BC has controlled the whole hormonal cystic acne break-out nightmare, but I was hoping with the oil control that it wouldn’t be so bad.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, great line to try if your main concern is overproduction of sebum and oil control. I have delegated this line to my morning routine and have recently started a tea tree oil skincare regimen for nights to see if that helps the acne side of my problem, which so far has been having good results for me (again, I will review that later after more time, but I am using a combination of products from both Skinfood and the Body Shop).face (please, no slap-stick Three Stooges moves, don’t knock yourself out, ladies!), you can also gently tap your fingers as you go like you are lightly tapping on piano keys.&lt;br /&gt;When the product is absorbed (your skin will still have the feeling of being slightly moist), you can use 1-2 pumps of the emulsion, smoothing it onto your T-zone and either gently spread or tapping it from the center to the outside of your face until absorbed.
