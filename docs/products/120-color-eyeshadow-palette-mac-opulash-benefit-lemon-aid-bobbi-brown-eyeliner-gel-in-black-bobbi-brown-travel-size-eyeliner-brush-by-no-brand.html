            <li>so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>However, I love the pallet, the shadows are really beautiful colors, and they wear well!</li>
            <li>Very nice color match really good</li>
            <li>The color palette is bright, but where is everything else that was supposed to ship with it?</li>
            <li>I did not have a chance to swab the color and check how good the pigmentation is because they were wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li>I did not expect good quality.</li>
            <li>, you can make good eyes</li>
            <li>Would have loved to have the rest of the items :</li>
            <li>I used it for a look to go to the fair</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented and that is awesome</li>
            <li>So many colors!</li>
            <li>I got the shadows, which are really nice, but the additional stuff wasn&#x27;t sent.</li>
            <li>Lots of nice colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice though.</li>
            <li>The colors go on very nicely and are smooth and not chalky like some tend to be.</li>
            <li>They have every single color and are so bright and beautiful!</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow is a medium consistency but can be put on very lightly</li>
            <li>Worked pretty good had nice colors</li>
            <li>If this had better packaging maybe it would not be a bust.</li>
            <li>And just to think my love affair with amazon all started with a .99 cent bracelet:)</li>
            <li>I love the colors, so many to choose from........</li>
            <li>cheap to be honest</li>
            <li>When I placed my order, the add said that this palette came with, a cream liner, from Bibby Brown, a Mac mascara and one more item, but I forget what it is?</li>
            <li>love this palette its the best especially when i do bridal makeup didnt regret it at all, i will recommend it to everyone :)</li>
            <li>THERE ARE SO MANY COLORS TO EXPERIMENT WITH.</li>
            <li>some colors pop more than others and i had no prob with creasing ...</li>
            <li>and you can build up darker or add more color.</li>
            <li>I love the palette, but I will take my business some where else.</li>
            <li>I love this make-up.</li>
            <li>but i was hoping for more of a wider color range.</li>
            <li>soo pretty and works well, the colors are not as bright on you as they appear which I do not like</li>
            <li>I am happy I ordered it early because it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li>Also some colors do not apply easily on your eyes.</li>
            <li>But the eyeshadows are very pigmented :) so I&#x27;ll be nice and rate the product a 3</li>
            <li>Also the box was huge...</li>
            <li>but I found it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but the quality is the same as bh cosmetics and better then the grocery store eyeshadows  !!</li>
            <li>I was excited until I realized 2 weeks had passed</li>
            <li>I have been waiting for my product for almost more than one month, and havent recived response or information from you; so, please let me know the exact status of my product and date that I will be receiving it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my eye shadow pallet and to begin using it.</li>
            <li>It works well without primer because its not as easy to take off :) be sure to use the right brushes or you get powder on your cheeks or to far on the eyes(smonge or fingers preffered) .</li>
            <li>Not bad out of 120 colors.</li>
            <li>I am doing make up for weddings and need many different colors which this satisfied my needs.  </li>
            <li>SO MINE BROKE THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TO CLOSE IT SECURELY.</li>
            <li>The palette itself is very nice, came on time and in good condition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, it was supposed to come with gel liner, primer, and mascara, unfortunately it came with none of these things, which is a shame because i imagine they would be quite useful with this palette.</li>
            <li>Hope the next purchaser has better luck!</li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT AND EASY TO BLEND.  </li>
            <li>It does not crease at all nor do you have to reapply color to look fresh</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND CAN&#x27;T LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH A FULL FACE, YOU WILL GO THROUGH YOUR COLORS FAST.  </li>
            <li>but the few times I did, the color stays one all day and looks amazing!</li>
            <li>The colors are almost exact dupes.</li>
            <li>the inflatable packaging (bubble wrap etc.) was only at the top and there was no security at the bottom to protect the palette.</li>
            <li>There are soooo many different colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>And so pretty.</li>
            <li>and they go on easy  enough.</li>
            <li>One would need a good primer and the colors don&#x27;t last that long...</li>
            <li>they also arrived way before expected which I was super excited about because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a lot of shades to choose from.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as Mac if not better the only polem I found was 8 of the Loire were smashed when recieved</li>
            <li>Love the colors they last a long time on!</li>
            <li>I wanted to see some new colors.</li>
            <li>Came early!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that not of the powder came out.</li>
            <li>but it did have this very plastic gross smell to it</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know maybe i got the old stock.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time was secured properly and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors appeared old looking; they had spots on the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I got it five days early but did not want to do the review</li>
            <li>I got my palette about 2 days later and was happy and disappointed because this is infact not even real mac</li>
            <li>None of the colors were broken and everything was perfect about it other than the fact there are few colors other than browns and blacks.</li>

            <li> this palette is not bad but its not great either</li>
            <li> What makes me the most mad is that it is NOT MAC.</li>
            <li> Eventually a month and a few weeks later Amazon gave me my money back!</li>
            <li> I ordered a total of 3 items, the packaging was all wrong the palette was at the very bottom and</li>
            <li> SO YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN CLOSING THE CASE</li>
            <li> its not real mac of cores  </li>
            <li> However the other gifts that was suppose to come with it never did.</li>
            <li> A lot of orange shades which I haven&#x27;t seen in other palettes.</li>
            <li> i have been so excited about getting this palette in and when i finally got in i was slightly disappointed that my palette was nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> It came a few days before it was expected .</li>
            <li> THE TWO HALVES ARE NOT SECURED DOWN ON EACH SIDE</li>
            <li> Brown EYELINER GEL in Black + Bobbi brown travel size eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little in between with this palette.</li>
            <li> Should come with a few brushes.</li>
            <li> Usually there may be 1-2 shades of orange, but this has 7-8.</li>
            <li> This palette came with about 8 broken shadows with about 3 colors that were shattered completely which is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY SMALL.  </li>
            <li> They shadows did not fall all over at least but were clearly broken.</li>
            <li> but none of the eyeshadows were broken</li>
            <li> and it was that 1 color was broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get the gifts and False advertising.</li>
            <li> False advertising when you say its mac that is what it should be</li>
            <li> Their the worst eyeshadows I ever bought, they look totally faded on the eyes and a lot of the eyeshadow becomes color powder and gets all over the eye.....</li>
            <li> They failed to give you the items that&#x27;s included with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed and mad</li>
            <li> I did have two cracked colors but not that bad.</li>
            <li> Those items did not come with my order, so I was alittle disappointed.</li>
            <li> and they do not come with the Mac mascara, the lemon aid shadow base, or the liner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This company was very disappointing!!!</li>

            <li> soo pretty and works well, the colors are not as bright on you as they appear which I do not like however it still is awesome for the price!</li>
            <li> I just got it, so I have not got the chance to use it yet but it did come this all the colors I use.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> I was excited until I realized 2 weeks had passed and I had no tracking #, and the company was not responding to my emails. Eventually a month and a few weeks later Amazon gave me my money back! This company was very disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these shadows without reading the reviews. I got the shadows, which are really nice, but the additional stuff wasn&#x27;t sent. Benefit Lemon Aid Eyeshadow Primer&lt;br /&gt;Full size MAC OPULASH MASCARA in Black&lt;br /&gt;Bobbi Brown EYELINER GEL in Black + Bobbi brown travel size eyeliner brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for these items too. Send the stuff or put up the correct information.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow pallette is great! However the other gifts that was suppose to come with it never did. They also advertised it as Mac on the website and it&#x27;s not. So I give it a 1 star because:&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get the gifts and False advertising. But the eyeshadows are very pigmented :) so I&#x27;ll be nice and rate the product a 3</li>
            <li> I purchased this pallet to wear on my wedding day. I am happy I ordered it early because it took forever to get here. What makes me the most mad is that it is NOT MAC. I was expecting to receive mac eye shadow, and did not plus it did not come with all of the things it said it would. False advertising when you say its mac that is what it should be</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for my product for almost more than one month, and havent recived response or information from you; so, please let me know the exact status of my product and date that I will be receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrads,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oscar Paz</li>
            <li> The color palette is bright, but where is everything else that was supposed to ship with it? Also, its not even MAC.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the BH Cosmetics, Shany Cosmetics, and Coastal Scents palettes. They are come from the same manufacturer just with different labels. The colors are almost exact dupes. Now on with the review. This palette came with about 8 broken shadows with about 3 colors that were shattered completely which is useless to me. I am returning them. I got this through Amazon Prime and the order was fulfilled by Amazon. I ordered a total of 3 items, the packaging was all wrong the palette was at the very bottom and the inflatable packaging (bubble wrap etc.) was only at the top and there was no security at the bottom to protect the palette. Also the box was huge...really? If this had better packaging maybe it would not be a bust. I did not have a chance to swab the color and check how good the pigmentation is because they were wrapped in plastic. They shadows did not fall all over at least but were clearly broken. I took pictures too. Hope the next purchaser has better luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I was so excited to get my eye shadow pallet and to begin using it. I was waiting and waiting for my paackage to arrive but it never did. I even waiting about a week after its schedule date come to and it never came from the sender. I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed and mad I was. But amazon is wonderful and great the refunded me my money and gave excellent customer service. I love amazon!!! I hooked on this site online and on my iPhone! And just to think my love affair with amazon all started with a .99 cent bracelet:)</li>
            <li> I love the colors, so many to choose from........Now I can find the color for my eyes to match my clothes.</li>
            <li> &#x27;&#x27;Was  dissatisfied  it didn&#x27;t come with what  it  shows what happen to the rest of the items ... are you planing to see the rest of the items.</li>
            <li> Love the colors they last a long time on! They have every single color and are so bright and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Hard to put on. Doesn&#x27;t spread evenly on eyelid. Lots of nice colors. Has variety. Should come with a few brushes.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the shadow case arrived damaged. Icould still use the shadow but I found it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly. I wanted to see some new colors. I did not expect good quality. When you use your makeup brush you have to reapply several times. The colors are nice though.</li>
            <li> It was in perfect condition and I it recieved within the estimated time period. Colors work well, my sister loves it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am doing make up for weddings and need many different colors which this satisfied my needs.  I was surprised that not of the powder came out.</li>
            <li> Very nice color match really good, you can make good eyes Sharon . Very good money spend. Very happy with</li>
            <li> I bought two sets and we absolutely love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Their the worst eyeshadows I ever bought, they look totally faded on the eyes and a lot of the eyeshadow becomes color powder and gets all over the eye.....cheap to be honest</li>
            <li> It came a few days before it was expected . Worked pretty good had nice colors but it did have this very plastic gross smell to it but none of the eyeshadows were broken so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> The colors do not pop out on darker skin tones.....One would need a good primer and the colors don&#x27;t last that long...i don&#x27;t know maybe i got the old stock.</li>
            <li> When I placed my order, the add said that this palette came with, a cream liner, from Bibby Brown, a Mac mascara and one more item, but I forget what it is? Those items did not come with my order, so I was alittle disappointed. However, I love the pallet, the shadows are really beautiful colors, and they wear well! Would have loved to have the rest of the items :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. on the page you order the pallet, it says : Product features: Mac mascara, Bobby Brown cream liner &amp; a eyeliner brush!</li>
            <li> love this palette its the best especially when i do bridal makeup didnt regret it at all, i will recommend it to everyone :) xoxoxoxox...</li>
            <li> me encantan los colores lo malo es que me vinieron 3 rotas me imagino por el traslado</li>
            <li> THERE ARE SO MANY COLORS TO EXPERIMENT WITH. THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT AND EASY TO BLEND.  ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY SMALL.  IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND CAN&#x27;T LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH A FULL FACE, YOU WILL GO THROUGH YOUR COLORS FAST.  NOTE: THE TWO HALVES ARE NOT SECURED DOWN ON EACH SIDE SO YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN CLOSING THE CASE AND IT DID NOT LOCK INTO PLACE CORRECTLY SO MINE BROKE THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TO CLOSE IT SECURELY.</li>
            <li> this palette is not bad but its not great either but for 26 $ it was a steal i had to get it !! its not real mac of cores  i know that but the quality is the same as bh cosmetics and better then the grocery store eyeshadows  !! some colors pop more than others and i had no prob with creasing ... i will be useing this palette on a daily !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as Mac if not better the only polem I found was 8 of the Loire were smashed when recieved</li>
            <li> Came early! but product wayyy smaller than the picrture</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time was secured properly and it works really well. I haven&#x27;t used it a lot but the few times I did, the color stays one all day and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I had only 1 problems with this and it was that 1 color was broken. Not bad out of 120 colors. The delivery time was excellent! I think I got this in about 5 days. There are soooo many different colors to choose from. A lot of orange shades which I haven&#x27;t seen in other palettes. Usually there may be 1-2 shades of orange, but this has 7-8. The colors go on very nicely and are smooth and not chalky like some tend to be. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a lot of shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors appeared old looking; they had spots on the eyeshadow. Also some colors do not apply easily on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful and are as the pictures looks. The eyeshadow is a medium consistency but can be put on very lightly and you can build up darker or add more color. It does not crease at all nor do you have to reapply color to look fresh (Ive checked after my face got sweaty). It works well without primer because its not as easy to take off :) be sure to use the right brushes or you get powder on your cheeks or to far on the eyes(smonge or fingers preffered) .</li>
            <li> I gave this seller two star&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t return emals AND THEY LIED!!! They failed to give you the items that&#x27;s included with your purchase. I love the palette, but I will take my business some where else.</li>
            <li> The palette itself is very nice, came on time and in good condition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, it was supposed to come with gel liner, primer, and mascara, unfortunately it came with none of these things, which is a shame because i imagine they would be quite useful with this palette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little in between with this palette. The colors are super pigmented and that is awesome they also arrived way before expected which I was super excited about because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. But both of the of the sheets that I got are the same colors. It makes me want to send it back.</li>
            <li> So many colors! And so pretty. I can find a color for almost anything.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up. I got it five days early but did not want to do the review tell I used it. The make-up is awesome, The colors are just like in the picture and they go on easy  enough. I used it for a look to go to the fair and it stead great! I did have two cracked colors but not that bad. They can still be used so its not a big deal. Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got my palette about 2 days later and was happy and disappointed because this is infact not even real mac and they do not come with the Mac mascara, the lemon aid shadow base, or the liner</li>
            <li> i have been so excited about getting this palette in and when i finally got in i was slightly disappointed that my palette was nothing like the picture. it was a lot of neutral colors. Don&#x27;t get me wrong i was going to order a neutral palette but i was hoping for more of a wider color range. None of the colors were broken and everything was perfect about it other than the fact there are few colors other than browns and blacks.</li>
