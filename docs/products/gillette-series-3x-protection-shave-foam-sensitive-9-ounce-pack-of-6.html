            <li>Excellent lubrication provides very comfortable shaving with Mach3 blades that I prefer.</li>

            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s good</li>

            <li>Love Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>EXCEPT so far the first 2 cans have stopped working after just 2-3 uses!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It yields a  very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Only that Gillette makes the best and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>is his &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find it available on amazon!</li>
            <li>Pushing on the button on top caused the area below it to fill with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>An even better choice is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it arrived well and the price was ok.......</li>
            <li>But I suppose some people will just feel like it&#x27;s doing a better job if they pay more.</li>
            <li>Hello every one, this is an excellent product, highly, highly recomended for all people, I like very much.</li>
            <li>Stay clean shaven my friends, if you want too!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and his razor glides easily, with no residual razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>Same great product at a better price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always went back to using this exact product because it gives me the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES HELP HAVE  BETTER,SMOOTH,AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE</li>
            <li>They did include a voucher for a free can, but I can&#x27;t use the voucher on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a great simple shaving gel for any guy.</li>
            <li>My husband got a sample of this and liked it so much we&#x27;ve got it on subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>It provides a smooth residue after going over an area with the razor.  </li>
            <li>Love that is comes economically priced in a six-pack.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling smooth....</li>
            <li>now i have enough until the end of the year, it is a great deal for the amount I get.</li>
            <li>Just what i needed and good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>May not be the cheapest shave product out there but does the job well and in my opinion is better than the straight creams that you get from aerosols, works better and does not have issues liquifying after flying and being pressurized in an airplane.</li>
            <li>Gillette R&amp;D, you should develop a product beyond just shaving, you must develop product that is environment friendly.</li>
            <li>There was no damage at all and they are exactly what you would buy at brick &amp; mortar retailers for more money.</li>
            <li>Men can&#x27;t have all the fun!</li>
            <li>Keeps me clean shaving</li>
            <li>Anyway, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced shaving gel that goes on smooth, has a nice fresh and clean scent, and provides optimal protection against nicks, cuts, bumps, razor burn, etcâ€¦</li>
            <li>This gel works well and activates quickly when it is rubbed on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy shaving with this very productive gel.</li>
            <li>I am \wondering about how much product is actually available from the can.</li>
            <li>Like this much better than the old, &amp;#34;grandpa&#x27;s&amp;#34; type of foam cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot find anything to complain about.</li>
            <li>A beautiful, subtle smell and provides a close shave.</li>
            <li>I am an avid Amazon shopper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown more of these away than I&#x27;ve actually gotten to use.</li>
            <li>After first use, the cans start to leak the propellent..</li>
            <li>Hoping the next 4 cans work better</li>
            <li>As usual, it feels good during and after the shave.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>He highly recommends!</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves it.......</li>
            <li>I have used all different varieties of Gillette shaving creams over the years and none has really stuck out to me as working better than the next.  </li>
            <li>The one problem with gels is that they tend to be cold on the face in the winter time, but they make for a very good shave.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t shave too much because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It specifies the net weight but how much you really get out of the can before it runs out of propellant I wonder about.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a whole bunch of shaving cream, will have supply for a longgg time.)&lt;br /&gt;works perfectly, have extremely sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t hate shaving anymore.)</li>
            <li>Pressure starts running low after using for first week, in the 3 that I have used already.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried other more pricey shave gels from the Gillette line as well as other brands, and in my honest opinion, it seems to be all marketing gimmicks, and they seem to work the same as any other shaving gel I have tried.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gillette Series Shave Gel with Aloe for Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I received a canned response telling me how to use a can of shaving gel (I&#x27;ve only been shaving for 20 years, so thanks for the info).</li>
            <li>It would be like paying $20 for a car wash when the guy next door charges $5 and the outcome is exactly the same!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and this gel keeps my legs moist while I shave them and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>price seemed a bit high for the entire pack.</li>
            <li>but it is hard to fit bulk shaving cream, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>i am not sure i made the right decision on this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I prefer to use this product over anything else I have tried. It yields a  very comfortable shave. On the other hand this stuff is expensive. I am \wondering about how much product is actually available from the can. It specifies the net weight but how much you really get out of the can before it runs out of propellant I wonder about.  I tried measuring the gross weight of a couple of cans then their net weight after they were drained. My equipment being an electronic kitchen scale is probably not accurate enought to fully trust the results&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;but I shure do wonder about all this.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Amazon has the best price and policy on this item.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a shaving cream? Only that Gillette makes the best and this is one of them. Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I always prefer shaving cream gel over the foam type and i have used different brands like Nivea and Schick. I usually shave in the toilet sink and not in the shower. The problem with gillette shaving gel is that it clogs the drain. My drain develop a slimy or slippery gel texture. I have observed other shaving gels and they do not accumulate or cling to the drain pipe - they are water soluble. Gillette R&amp;D, you should develop a product beyond just shaving, you must develop product that is environment friendly. Some points to ponder beyond shaving...</li>
            <li> great stuff!! i look forward to shaving now!!, but I use the schick quad with the battery operated handle</li>
            <li> This is a very good value for us to get it through amazon the price on here is way cheaper then if we went to to get it. It came wrapped all together so nothing was rolling around in the box to get all busted up. 6 cans at one time.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel itself is great. Good lubrication, feels good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate. I&#x27;d buy it again and again if it came in a different can. The one I got starts to rust (!) at the bottom so the can leaves brown circles wherever you put it. Fail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why Gilette is doing this as it would them cost a fraction of a penny to coat the bottom area with plastic or use a different material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I prefer this shaving cream because I find that I actually have to change my razor less often (it&#x27;s that effective!). The one problem with gels is that they tend to be cold on the face in the winter time, but they make for a very good shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave alot, but when I do I use Gillette Series Shavin-it-up Gel wits the Aloes.  Stay clean shaven my friends, if you want too!</li>
            <li> I based my buy decision on the picture above but it was not what I received! Be warned! What you see may not be what you get!    I am an avid Amazon shopper but after this, I will start thinking twice about buying such items.</li>
            <li> Great product coupled with Amazon&#x27;s convienence of scheduled deliveries makes the value even greater. I would recomend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought the 6-pack of this, came when expected, ( P.S. that&#x27;s a whole bunch of shaving cream, will have supply for a longgg time.)&lt;br /&gt;works perfectly, have extremely sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t hate shaving anymore.) well, still do, but at least now it doesn&#x27;t hurt forever after.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pale and blonde and has VERY sensitive skin.  Gillette Series Shave Gel with Aloe for Sensitive skin is his &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product for many years now.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and his razor glides easily, with no residual razor bumps.  He highly recommends!</li>
            <li> it is a good shaving gel</li>
            <li> thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s good but i didn&#x27;t use it a lot .. i don&#x27;t shave too much because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year without the slightest of problems. Like this much better than the old, &amp;#34;grandpa&#x27;s&amp;#34; type of foam cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot find anything to complain about. Excellent product - Recommend!</li>
            <li> Great bargain for this product!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 15 years ago. I&#x27;ve tried several other Gillette products and different brands but I&#x27;ve always went back to using this exact product because it gives me the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;I use it along with the &amp;#34;Gillette; Series; after shave; gel, 2.5 oz&amp;#34; for the best and closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind buying it in bulk because it saves me time and money. Now I don&#x27;t have to run out to the local store when I need it... I&#x27;m glad to find it available on amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent price! Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;Unlike another reviewer, I received what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, what I received appear to be factory rejects (or \\&quot;seconds\\&quot;). Pushing on the button on top caused the area below it to fill with shaving cream. Removing the cap, cleaning out the mess and putting the cap back on resulted in it no longer functioning. I have bought this product before in drug stores and have not had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based upon my experience, a better alternative is: [[ASIN:B0032ANCUU Edge Shave Gel, Senstive Skin, 7-Ounces Cans (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE [08/20/2013]: An even better choice is [[ASIN:B002UUT44Q Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] A beautiful, subtle smell and provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> The best shave gel I have found. Excellent lubrication provides very comfortable shaving with Mach3 blades that I prefer. Very light and pleasant fragrance. The 6-pack bundle arrives shrink wrapped and well padded in shipping box. There was no damage at all and they are exactly what you would buy at brick &amp; mortar retailers for more money. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it....... it arrived well and the price was ok....... I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> AN EXCELLENT VALUE AND IT DOES HELP HAVE  BETTER,SMOOTH,AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE</li>
            <li> A great product... The best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected</li>
            <li> Easy shaving with this very productive gel.</li>
            <li> I know this is a man&#x27;s line of shaving cream but it is hard to fit bulk shaving cream, so I bought it.  As a woman, the smell is to manly.  The product works well but I won&#x27;t buy for me again</li>
            <li> I bought this pack for my husband and it has almost been a year and he still has 2 cans left! He loves everything about it as well</li>
            <li> Just what i needed and good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of cans of this shave gel that will leave 1/6 of the can contents in the bottom.  Making an already premium product more expensive. Also, the plastic cap has a tendency to pull the dispensing nozzle from the can when it is pulled off. It seems the nozzle is not secured firmly enough. Trying to get the nozzle back in place is messy and some product will be lost. I simply leave the cap off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my second can left product in the bottom, I wrote to customer service and offered to send one of the affected cans. I received a canned response telling me how to use a can of shaving gel (I&#x27;ve only been shaving for 20 years, so thanks for the info). They did include a voucher for a free can, but I can&#x27;t use the voucher on Amazon. Also, I&#x27;d rather have a working product than a voucher for another can that has these problems.</li>
            <li> price seemed a bit high for the entire pack. i am not sure i made the right decision on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product.  The cans come without pressure and you cannot get anything out of them.  Seriously wish that I would have read the reviews on this.</li>
            <li> Great shaving gel.  I have very sensitive and this gel keeps my legs moist while I shave them and does not dry my skin. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hello every one, this is an excellent product, highly, highly recomended for all people, I like very much. I hope you like it too.</li>
            <li> Same great product at a better price.</li>
            <li> Pressure starts running low after using for first week, in the 3 that I have used already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This shave gel is great! I never have had a problem with face irritation and comfortability!  I bought the six pack because I had the chance to get it cheaper and it is the stuff that works great for me! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great simple shaving gel for any guy. It does what it is supposed to do and does it well â€” provides protection while shaving. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s just shaving gel. I have tried other more pricey shave gels from the Gillette line as well as other brands, and in my honest opinion, it seems to be all marketing gimmicks, and they seem to work the same as any other shaving gel I have tried. This is no better or worse than any other shave gel out there. Why would you want to pay a crazy amount of money on something that does the same exact job as a cheaper one? It would be like paying $20 for a car wash when the guy next door charges $5 and the outcome is exactly the same!! It just doesn&#x27;t make any sense to meâ€¦But I suppose some people will just feel like it&#x27;s doing a better job if they pay more. Anyway, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced shaving gel that goes on smooth, has a nice fresh and clean scent, and provides optimal protection against nicks, cuts, bumps, razor burn, etcâ€¦Great product!</li>
            <li> My husband got a sample of this and liked it so much we&#x27;ve got it on subscribe and save.  He gets a great shave and it leaves his skin smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> Half the cans when you press the button, it would spit and release gas but no shaving cream.  I have to conjecture that this sellers is selling counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> Great product, but slower delivery than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of shipping container crushed by UPS....but no damage to product.</li>
            <li> Its shaving gel, as seen in stores. I like that I can buy it in a 6 pack so I don&#x27;t have to shop for it as often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown more of these away than I&#x27;ve actually gotten to use. After first use, the cans start to leak the propellent.. within a week or 2 all the gel will be left in the can with no way to get it out.. Done with these. Terrible product design and quality control.</li>
            <li> Have used this shave cream for years.  Men can&#x27;t have all the fun!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaving gel for the last 5 years.  I have used all different varieties of Gillette shaving creams over the years and none has really stuck out to me as working better than the next.  This gel works well and activates quickly when it is rubbed on your skin.  I have a dense beard that comes in and this has no issues making the hair stand up for the razor.  It provides a smooth residue after going over an area with the razor.  I could not ask a shaving gel or cream to do anything different.  As long as it continues to work as it has for years, I will keep buying it and keep giving it 5 stars.  May not be the cheapest shave product out there but does the job well and in my opinion is better than the straight creams that you get from aerosols, works better and does not have issues liquifying after flying and being pressurized in an airplane.</li>
            <li> Keeps me clean shaving</li>
            <li> this might be the best saving cream/gel i have tried</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> We just subscribed to this product so received a 6-pack... Great...... EXCEPT so far the first 2 cans have stopped working after just 2-3 uses!!!!!!!!  The can is full but the gel just won&#x27;t come out!!!!!  Hoping the next 4 cans work better but I will be UN-subscribing from this product today!</li>
            <li> Love that is comes economically priced in a six-pack.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite some time now. As usual, it feels good during and after the shave. It leaves the skin feeling smooth....</li>
            <li> now i have enough until the end of the year, it is a great deal for the amount I get.</li>
