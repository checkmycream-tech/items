            <li>/&gt;I very highly recommend this product.  </li>

            <li> She was bed ridden for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wore medicated uniboots and tried various other processes.</li>
            <li> The hospital used this to help heal bed sores and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> The woman I care for had several small sores that would not heal even with prescription medications.  </li>
            <li> She is incontinent, and prone to skin break down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helped keep down the soreness</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping the rash a little.  </li>
            <li> My father is wheelchair bound and can get open sores on his behind.</li>
            <li> By putting this cream on his behind three times a day my father doesn&#x27;t get open sores.  </li>
            <li> Lasts and no strong odor.</li>
            <li> My toddler had a bad diaper rash, and while in the hospital the nurses gave us this product to use for it, it cleared up his diaper rash in 3 diaper changes, and is thick enough to provide a proper barrier!</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital a while back, and I arrived with a nasty ant bite (I am very allergic to ants).  </li>

            <li> Great product. Wonderful skin protectant Paste. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> My dad said this is the best barrier cream he has used. He likes the menthol. This has a very high zinc oxide content for good protectoon and no petroleum which is not compatible with his oxygen tank.</li>
            <li> My daughter spent time in the NICU due to an early arrival and nurses sent us home with this diaper rash cream.  It continues to perform better than Johnsons, Desitin, Burts Bees and Butt Paste!</li>
            <li> This product is so good for certain situations that can be painful. As a nurse I use it on patient&#x27;s skin and it soothes them.</li>
            <li> This is a good product,,it has helped to heal a couple of wounds that I&#x27;ve had the best part is It doesn&#x27;t sting nor do you need a proscription to buy it , Get stuff!!</li>
            <li> Relieves irritated skin better than anything we have tried.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product to help prevent skin break down. I use it on my Mother who is 95 years old. She is incontinent, and prone to skin break down. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and I get this sores that pop up on my lower legs. Mostly around my ankles. This product is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found that will dry the sores and heal them. I tried many other things before to heal them. I even went to the hospital and had whirlpools done. I wore medicated uniboots and tried various other processes. This stuff works people!! I&#x27;ve told others about the paste and everyone that I told that used it said it worked for them also. If you have sores that won&#x27;t seem to heal up give it a try. Remedy Calazime Protectant Paste good stuff. You might want to ask your doctor before using though.</li>
            <li> this ointment was recommended by a home care nurse.  a little goes a long way to keep irritants away from tender skin....and love the orange dcent</li>
            <li> Used this to heal a diabetic Ulcer.  I had used everything the doctor prescribed for two years.  After six months of usings Calazime Protectant Paste, the ulcer was completely healed.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this when my mom was hospitalized. She was bed ridden for a long time. The hospital used this to help heal bed sores and other skin irritations. It is excellent. The paste forms a protective seal on the skin upon application. My mom had a stroke and also suffers from Parkinson&#x27;s. She has mobility issues and bed sores are an issue. This stuff is a god send.</li>
            <li> Great quality item.  Fast delivery.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and very reasonably price.  Delivery was slow but the product was an exact match to the medicine used in the hospital.</li>

            <li> This paste is a wonderful product.  I use this on everything...bug bites...pimples...any and all skin irritations and eruptions.  Clean the area..I use silver soap..dry well and apply this calazime...I tend to use this at night.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my Mother and she is quite pleased with it and is always teeling when her supply gets low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product the last 4 years for both of my girls while in diapers.  It is the perfect barrier cream for any level of diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Protects skin while keeping it smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping the rash a little.  Not wonderful - but a little.</li>
            <li> Just what friend wanted!</li>

            <li> This stuff kicked a nasty diaper rash on my 10 month old in 3 days. We purchased this after running out of Calmoseptine which was recommended by our pediatrician. Calazime has the same active ingredients, yet is much easier to apply.  It layers well over other ointments and is easy to spread. Has a nice citrus scent as well. We&#x27;re going to be buying in bulk from now on!</li>
            <li> We first started using it after my mother-in law was hospitalized. We found it is quite wonderful for diaper rash!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My toddler had a bad diaper rash, and while in the hospital the nurses gave us this product to use for it, it cleared up his diaper rash in 3 diaper changes, and is thick enough to provide a proper barrier! It also smells pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> I so glad I was finally able to find this product.</li>

            <li> I first heard of this cream while my preemie son was in NICU. This is what they used on all their babies and after we got discharged from hospital, they sent me home with it. It works wonders and is very gentle on the skin. I used it for diaper and skin rash on both, my baby and my toddler. Wonderful stuff! Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great skin protectant! Best product we&#x27;ve found. Treats and prevents diaper rash and skin breakdown. Lasts and no strong odor.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t work as well as Desitin (which stinks).</li>
            <li> This is the best product for sores anyplace. It is perfect for someone that is bedridden and gets bed sores.</li>
            <li> This is excellent!  I think it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for diaper rash.  I learned about it from a nurse who works in a facility where pressure wounds are common.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the home health nurse said it was so great. HOWEVER, when I had to take him to Duke&lt;br /&gt;they recommended Desitin ointment....a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years professionally and now am buying it for a family member with skin protection needs.  there are several places in my area that sell this product but your price and free shipping make this a much better deal.  It come within the delivery time stated  and as it is a product we will continue to use, i will continue to  order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for protecting and healing fragile skin. The woman I care for had several small sores that would not heal even with prescription medications.  This product has healed her wounds and improved her overall skin health. Thanks Medline for a super product!</li>
            <li> Great for skin redness and rashes</li>
            <li> I use this product for diaper rash on my son (as recommended by our pediatrician).  It&#x27;s so great!  It has a nice smell to it (a bit fruity/sweet) and is a nice thick paste that protects his little bottom well.  If he does develop redness and irritation from his diaper, it doesn&#x27;t take more than one or two treatments with this paste to make his skin return to it&#x27;s normal color.  Very nice product!</li>
