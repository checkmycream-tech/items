            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved B&amp;B shampoo and conditioner, but have never been impressed with their styling products.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that it protects my hair from damage when flat-ironing, but it minimizes fly aways.</li>

            <li>This SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This product is good, but I have found that RUSK is by far does the best job.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful product for keeping the frizz out of your hair especially in the summer humidity!</li>
            <li>On top of the scent, the product does not work as well as before.  </li>
            <li>I have not found anything that works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hair products throughout the years.</li>

            <li>So many people have asked me what I use.</li>
            <li>love this bumble and bumble</li>
            <li>I love it, and there is no grimy residue after.</li>
            <li>Using this before blow drying (not too much at a time) is great</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>And at a greart price... :-)</li>
            <li>I had the 5 oz tube which has lasted for more than a year.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight with a tendency to fly away on top.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the B&amp;B straighten products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for smoothing and straightening hair, even without the use of a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I found a great stylist, and he used BB products, which is new for me.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for blowing dry.</li>
            <li>Lol it makes my hair super straight, shinny and smoothe :)</li>
            <li>Works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good product to use when blow drying your hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, and I love this brand.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I do my hair, get out and about and develop this fine frizz all over</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft with a pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li>Easy to use, smells great - enough said.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>This is important to me</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much I immediately bought a tube of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, sleek, and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it as much as Oribe&#x27;s Royal Blowout but that&#x27;s also $20 more.</li>
            <li>great heat protecting, for flat iron.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>a little pricy, but very good</li>
            <li>Amazing product for frizzy, natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product, I have been using it for years and my hair always comes out straight with just a blow drier.</li>
            <li>Good overall!</li>
            <li>My main reasons for liking this version better are:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>and my daughter has super curly, spooly hair.</li>
            <li>i loved the old straight.  </li>
            <li>Excellent to make short work of daily smoothing and frizz-fighting rituals.</li>
            <li>I just love love love the straight blow dry from bumble and bumble.</li>
            <li>love the new look.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it promises to be!</li>
            <li>I can get my hair straight and it feels light.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to keep hair smooth without los of volume.</li>
            <li>and my style stays straight and smooth all</li>
            <li>This product tames the frizz, smooths the thickness down to a manageable level, and works great without hindering any curl I may place in my hair with hot rollers or a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Then I put another pea-sized amount in right before blow drying (on the coolest setting).</li>
            <li>I tried it out from a free sample I received and when that was used up, I knew I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Tried so many ways to smooth and straighten but hair remained dry an had unruly areas.</li>
            <li>But the very first time I used it, I was amazed - after blow-drying, it left my hair looking almost as smooth as it did when I got a keratin treatment a few months ago (which made my hair look great for a month or two, but I believe ultimately really damaged my hair).</li>
            <li>Was a faithful user of the old &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34;, which made my bleached hair shiny &amp; smooth, always got compliments.</li>
            <li>Really helps!  </li>
            <li>This one is perfumed and doesn&#x27;t work as well, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I first tried this straightener at the salon.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me smooth, frizz free hair every single day.</li>
            <li>I also like the smell which is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Any product that can reduce my usage of my flat iron gets top marks from me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair straight and super soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle, product makes my hair feel sleek and keeps frizz down.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, but it gets dry pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>It removes the frizz from my hair and lets it keep a much tamer look, even when air-dried.</li>
            <li>This product did keep my hair straight when I used it</li>
            <li>so much I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>but it depends on how much of the product I use.  </li>
            <li>We all use it, it does not make our hair straight, we don&#x27;t try for that.</li>
            <li>So when I got a sample size tube of this stuff, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hair is much straighter and smoother than without B&amp;B Straight.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and use it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>I still have to use the straight iron</li>
            <li>and then if I use the flat iron I can have smooth hair for days.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells great - very subtle.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit, in fact if I use too much my hair gets a little film on it, but if I just use a pea size amount it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Most, even if they work for a little while, end up not working.</li>
            <li>I find that a little bit comes out of the top each time I close it.</li>
            <li>I have a little wave, my sister has more wave</li>
            <li>using the shampoo and conditioner right now, too, but I think the Straight Blow Dry is what&#x27;s really making a difference for me.</li>
            <li>Really helps my course, curly hair unwind softly.</li>
            <li>this new one leaves my hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing, seriously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a blow dry in the mornings, girl, but without the blast of hot air, this product doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Redkin, but I like the smell of this cream better.  </li>
            <li>I tried it as part of a sample for beauty insider members and it makes my hair so soft after blow drying!  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and am always trying to find a new product to help straighten it when blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would bring the old straight back.  </li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to scents, do not order this product.  </li>
            <li>I was a faithful user of the old \\&quot;straight\\&quot; until this came along.</li>
            <li>Enter BB Straight Blowdry and &amp;#34;viola&amp;#34;, I can actually style my hair (myself)!  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that makes my hair look and feel soft and conditioned even days after I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>I do still have to finish my hair off with a flat iron, to get the ends to go under and make it a little smoother, but I don&#x27;t need to do nearly as many passes over my hair with the flat iron as I do without B&amp;B Straight.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair and blow dry it straight this time in a tube!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive hair products, but I was very impressed with this product and will continue to buy it!  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair and their other products work great</li>
            <li>The way I use B&amp;B Straight is to comb a pea-sized amount through my shoulder-length hair right after showering, then put my hair up in a clip for about 30-45 minutes to partially air dry.</li>
            <li>This new &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; is NOTHING like the old, smells and leaves my hair in the same condition as if I didn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>My frizz is manageable with some minor straightener use, but for paying so much for this Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry product, I should see some difference without having to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>If you have been using Straight for a long time, beware!  </li>
            <li>This new and improved product left my hair with a frizzy and flyaway look.  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t even need to replace the new one - just call it something different.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and wavy hair that curls into an \\&quot;S\\&quot; shape as soon as they dry.</li>
            <li>I need to blow dry them straight every time I wash them.</li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Considerable protection against the daily blasts of damaging heat from my blow dryer and iron.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for what you get</li>
            <li>So when I have a few extra minutes, I&#x27;ll use the Straight Blow Dry and focus on my frizzy section and then give the top of my hair a little air</li>
            <li>Its expensive but given the fact that it lasts this long, I am ready to spend this much for straight soft hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is still very straight and shiny a few days after I initially straightened my hair.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, sleek, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it as much as Oribe&#x27;s Royal Blowout but that&#x27;s also $20 more.</li>
            <li> great heat protecting, for flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> a little pricy, but very good</li>
            <li> Amazing product for frizzy, natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product, I have been using it for years and my hair always comes out straight with just a blow drier.</li>
            <li> Good overall!</li>
            <li> My main reasons for liking this version better are:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has super curly, spooly hair.</li>
            <li> i loved the old straight.  </li>
            <li> Excellent to make short work of daily smoothing and frizz-fighting rituals.</li>
            <li> I just love love love the straight blow dry from bumble and bumble.</li>
            <li> love the new look.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it promises to be!</li>
            <li> I can get my hair straight and it feels light.  </li>
            <li> Really helps to keep hair smooth without los of volume.</li>
            <li> and my style stays straight and smooth all</li>
            <li> This product tames the frizz, smooths the thickness down to a manageable level, and works great without hindering any curl I may place in my hair with hot rollers or a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Then I put another pea-sized amount in right before blow drying (on the coolest setting).</li>
            <li> I tried it out from a free sample I received and when that was used up, I knew I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Tried so many ways to smooth and straighten but hair remained dry an had unruly areas.</li>
            <li> But the very first time I used it, I was amazed - after blow-drying, it left my hair looking almost as smooth as it did when I got a keratin treatment a few months ago (which made my hair look great for a month or two, but I believe ultimately really damaged my hair).</li>
            <li> Was a faithful user of the old &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34;, which made my bleached hair shiny &amp; smooth, always got compliments.</li>
            <li> Really helps!  </li>
            <li> This one is perfumed and doesn&#x27;t work as well, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first tried this straightener at the salon.  </li>
            <li> This product gives me smooth, frizz free hair every single day.</li>
            <li> I also like the smell which is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Any product that can reduce my usage of my flat iron gets top marks from me.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair straight and super soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle, product makes my hair feel sleek and keeps frizz down.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but it gets dry pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> It removes the frizz from my hair and lets it keep a much tamer look, even when air-dried.</li>
            <li> This product did keep my hair straight when I used it</li>
            <li> so much I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> but it depends on how much of the product I use.  </li>
            <li> We all use it, it does not make our hair straight, we don&#x27;t try for that.</li>
            <li> So when I got a sample size tube of this stuff, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hair is much straighter and smoother than without B&amp;B Straight.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and use it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I still have to use the straight iron</li>
            <li> and then if I use the flat iron I can have smooth hair for days.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells great - very subtle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit, in fact if I use too much my hair gets a little film on it, but if I just use a pea size amount it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Most, even if they work for a little while, end up not working.</li>
            <li> I find that a little bit comes out of the top each time I close it.</li>
            <li> I have a little wave, my sister has more wave</li>
            <li> using the shampoo and conditioner right now, too, but I think the Straight Blow Dry is what&#x27;s really making a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Really helps my course, curly hair unwind softly.</li>
            <li> this new one leaves my hair</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing, seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a blow dry in the mornings, girl, but without the blast of hot air, this product doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Redkin, but I like the smell of this cream better.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as part of a sample for beauty insider members and it makes my hair so soft after blow drying!  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and am always trying to find a new product to help straighten it when blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would bring the old straight back.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to scents, do not order this product.  </li>
            <li> I was a faithful user of the old \\&quot;straight\\&quot; until this came along.</li>
            <li> Enter BB Straight Blowdry and &amp;#34;viola&amp;#34;, I can actually style my hair (myself)!  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that makes my hair look and feel soft and conditioned even days after I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> I do still have to finish my hair off with a flat iron, to get the ends to go under and make it a little smoother, but I don&#x27;t need to do nearly as many passes over my hair with the flat iron as I do without B&amp;B Straight.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and blow dry it straight this time in a tube!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive hair products, but I was very impressed with this product and will continue to buy it!  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and their other products work great</li>
            <li> The way I use B&amp;B Straight is to comb a pea-sized amount through my shoulder-length hair right after showering, then put my hair up in a clip for about 30-45 minutes to partially air dry.</li>
            <li> This new &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; is NOTHING like the old, smells and leaves my hair in the same condition as if I didn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> My frizz is manageable with some minor straightener use, but for paying so much for this Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry product, I should see some difference without having to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have been using Straight for a long time, beware!  </li>
            <li> This new and improved product left my hair with a frizzy and flyaway look.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t even need to replace the new one - just call it something different.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and wavy hair that curls into an \\&quot;S\\&quot; shape as soon as they dry.</li>
            <li> I need to blow dry them straight every time I wash them.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Considerable protection against the daily blasts of damaging heat from my blow dryer and iron.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> So when I have a few extra minutes, I&#x27;ll use the Straight Blow Dry and focus on my frizzy section and then give the top of my hair a little air</li>
            <li> Its expensive but given the fact that it lasts this long, I am ready to spend this much for straight soft hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is still very straight and shiny a few days after I initially straightened my hair.  </li>
            <li> somewhat thick, wavy hair and the old straight did wonders for my hair - it actually helped shape my waves an curls.  </li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair it is straight and way less frizzy than it would be without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have coarse and frizzy hair and keeps it tame even through high humidity days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hot and somewhat humid here lately, but my hair looks like I just walked out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> i used to get lots of compliments on my hair, and the compliments came back when i found a little of the old product tucked away in a cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I far prefer the previous, now discontinued product &amp;#34;Straight&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and think so I will take anything to help me get out of the house faster.  </li>
            <li> but it took so long to arrive that the trial month was over before I could.</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt dull, frizzy, and super dried out.  </li>
            <li> This really gives ME control of my hair instead of the other way round!</li>
            <li> I put some of this on dry hair and went out when it was raining.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended using this before I blow dry and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> This may be a little more expensive than other straightening balms...</li>
            <li> It also seems to last longer and with less product</li>
            <li> However, while it helps to slightly straighten my wavy, somewhat frizzy hair, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t actually take any frizz away.</li>
            <li> Simply use a small amount of the product, grab a brush and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it is hard to blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t add nasty product-weight to my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so experiment.  </li>
            <li> This product helps tame the frizz, I still need to flat iron to finish off the look</li>
            <li> I have really wavy thick hair and it helps tame my beast!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair everyday and nothing works like this product.</li>
            <li> The alcohol in this left my hair looking dull and the ends frizzy and burnt looking.  </li>
            <li> The new one has a bad smell, while  the old one had no smell.</li>
            <li> Works wonders, My hair is Curly, curly, and next to impossible to get straight.</li>
            <li> It cuts down the drying time.  </li>
            <li> But, it shuts down that halo of frizzle.</li>
            <li> This product weighs less and your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have cut my drying time in half and leaves my hair so silky.</li>
            <li> Why do they try to fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken and give their clients no other viable options?</li>
            <li> She has long and thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and when I blow dry my hair is frizzy.</li>
            <li> but it dried out my hair and scalp</li>
            <li> this use this before blow drying my hair with a round brush...</li>
            <li> My hair is already kinda limp</li>
            <li> product leaves my hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> my hair is heavily highlighted and I believe quite damaged.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I moved recently and had to find a new hair guy :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can tame that frizzy section</li>
            <li> If I section my hair, apply this stuff, and take my time blow drying it, I can get by without a straightener, but I usually run one through it, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging needs improvement.</li>
            <li> put a small amount in my hands and run it through my hair (all over) and then zap it with the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it makes your hair dull looking.</li>
            <li> but this one makes my hair a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick wavy hair, and this product helps save me from triangle hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length color treated hair that frizzes in humidity.</li>
            <li> (I have really thick, frizzy, curly hair).</li>
            <li> I think this product does weigh my hair down a little and can make it feel dirty faster</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it twice because the first time I used it with the B&amp;B thickening spray (which is also terrible).  </li>
            <li> It keeps the waves in check and smooths out the annoying ones in the back.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t need anything to make it worse.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, frizzy and difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> There are no more bad hair days.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> How very disappointing.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works wonders, My hair is Curly, curly, and next to impossible to get straight. This product, does what it says and works. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful product for keeping the frizz out of your hair especially in the summer humidity! Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that great. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair after I use this product, it works that well.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I have naturally curly hair, and am always trying to find a new product to help straighten it when blow drying.  This product is good, but I have found that RUSK is by far does the best job.</li>
            <li> Works every time. Heat activated and imparts a shine and smoothness to even the frizziest hair. I have coarse and frizzy hair and keeps it tame even through high humidity days.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Leaves my hair straight and super soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.  If you have been using Straight for a long time, beware!  This product has changed.  It now has a very, very strong scent.  If you are at all sensitive to scents, do not order this product.  I have Migraines triggered by scents, and this product sent me into a three-day migraine.  On top of the scent, the product does not work as well as before.  This new and improved product left my hair with a frizzy and flyaway look.  How very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair smoother and worth the money. I have not found anything that works better.</li>
            <li> It removes the frizz from my hair and lets it keep a much tamer look, even when air-dried. It&#x27;s a must for me to remove fly-aways. I have medium length thick wavy hair, and this product helps save me from triangle hair. It greatly reduces volume when put on towel-dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does not straighten my hair, and I still have some ringlet curls when air drying. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it protects my hair from damage when flat-ironing, but it minimizes fly aways.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aveda. This product weighs less and your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> a little pricy, but very good</li>
            <li> This product did keep my hair straight when I used it but it dried out my hair and scalp so much I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair products throughout the years. Most, even if they work for a little while, end up not working. Not the case with this, at all. It&#x27;s perfect for smoothing and straightening hair, even without the use of a flat iron. Simply use a small amount of the product, grab a brush and blow dry. Amazing results !</li>
            <li> I was a faithful user of the old \\&quot;straight\\&quot; until this came along. My main reasons for liking this version better are:&lt;br /&gt;1. It gives the hair a great texture without making it feel greasy or even like there is much product in there.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has a pleasant smell that is mild and not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;3. It does what it says. After I blow dry my hair it is straight and way less frizzy than it would be without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have thick shoulder length color treated hair that frizzes in humidity. This product tames the frizz, smooths the thickness down to a manageable level, and works great without hindering any curl I may place in my hair with hot rollers or a curling iron. If I want my hair straighter, I skip the curling products and this use this before blow drying my hair with a round brush...the product smooths beautifully. I also like the smell which is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a fan of bumble and bumble products but this one is my favorite. I have thick curly hair and when I blow dry my hair is frizzy. This product helps tame the frizz, I still need to flat iron to finish off the look but it has definitely helped.</li>
            <li> Overpriced but excellent. It keeps the waves in check and smooths out the annoying ones in the back. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years. If I section my hair, apply this stuff, and take my time blow drying it, I can get by without a straightener, but I usually run one through it, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging needs improvement. I find that a little bit comes out of the top each time I close it.</li>
            <li> This product gives me smooth, frizz free hair every single day. There are no more bad hair days. It never leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Cuts drying time &amp; leaves hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me and works good.  It cuts down the drying time.  My hair is long and think so I will take anything to help me get out of the house faster.  I think this product does weigh my hair down a little and can make it feel dirty faster but it depends on how much of the product I use.  I take this with me when I go traveling.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have really wavy thick hair and it helps tame my beast! Lol it makes my hair super straight, shinny and smoothe :)</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff. I love it. I had given up on any anti frizz products until I got this in an Ipsy bag. My hair is already kinda limp so it doesn&#x27;t need anything to make it worse. In the morning, I do my hair, get out and about and develop this fine frizz all over and it makes your hair dull looking. Depending on the humidity, it can be a real coarse frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This stops that, it&#x27;s amazing, seriously. I have a little wave, my sister has more wave and my daughter has super curly, spooly hair. We all use it, it does not make our hair straight, we don&#x27;t try for that. But, it shuts down that halo of frizzle.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works great on my naturally curly hair. I will continue to purchase this product  truly love it!</li>
            <li> Best product for straightening hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have thick curly hair and it is hard to blow dry it straight.  I can get my hair straight and it feels light.  I would recommend this product.  The only thing I would change... make it easier to get and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it!&lt;br /&gt;The product leaves my hair heavy and greasy. Almost like I haven&#x27;t just washed it. I&#x27;d like to retutn it but it took so long to arrive that the trial month was over before I could.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair everyday and nothing works like this product. Love it.Easy to use, smells great - enough said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, but I&#x27;ve always bought thru my salon.  What I received doesn&#x27;t feel, smell or work like what I bought at the salon.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for blowing dry. I have cut my drying time in half and leaves my hair so silky. So many people have asked me what I use. Should I tell them?</li>
            <li> The alcohol in this left my hair looking dull and the ends frizzy and burnt looking.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice because the first time I used it with the B&amp;B thickening spray (which is also terrible).  This last time I used it alone and only used a tiny amount (I have really short hair).  My hair looked and felt dull, frizzy, and super dried out.  Try Bed Head Control Freak instead.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed. Was a faithful user of the old &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34;, which made my bleached hair shiny &amp; smooth, always got compliments. This new &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; is NOTHING like the old, smells and leaves my hair in the same condition as if I didn&#x27;t even use it. Why do they try to fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken and give their clients no other viable options?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved B&amp;B shampoo and conditioner, but have never been impressed with their styling products. So when I got a sample size tube of this stuff, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But the very first time I used it, I was amazed - after blow-drying, it left my hair looking almost as smooth as it did when I got a keratin treatment a few months ago (which made my hair look great for a month or two, but I believe ultimately really damaged my hair). The way I use B&amp;B Straight is to comb a pea-sized amount through my shoulder-length hair right after showering, then put my hair up in a clip for about 30-45 minutes to partially air dry. Then I put another pea-sized amount in right before blow drying (on the coolest setting). Afterwards, my hair is much straighter and smoother than without B&amp;B Straight. I do still have to finish my hair off with a flat iron, to get the ends to go under and make it a little smoother, but I don&#x27;t need to do nearly as many passes over my hair with the flat iron as I do without B&amp;B Straight. This is important to me b/c my hair is heavily highlighted and I believe quite damaged. Any product that can reduce my usage of my flat iron gets top marks from me. p.s. Also, it smells great - very subtle.</li>
            <li> I moved recently and had to find a new hair guy :( I found a great stylist, and he used BB products, which is new for me. I liked this product so much I immediately bought a tube of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
            <li> i loved the old straight.  i have somewhat thick, wavy hair and the old straight did wonders for my hair - it actually helped shape my waves an curls.  The new one has a bad smell, while  the old one had no smell. this new one leaves my hair blah .... listless with no texture.  i used to get lots of compliments on my hair, and the compliments came back when i found a little of the old product tucked away in a cabinet.  I wish they would bring the old straight back.  they don&#x27;t even need to replace the new one - just call it something different.  The 2 products are night in day anyway in color, odor, texture and results.</li>
            <li> I put some of this on dry hair and went out when it was raining.  My hair stayed straightened without frizzing.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and blow dry it straight this time in a tube!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is the best one I have found to help easily straighten my curls.  I tried it out from a free sample I received and when that was used up, I knew I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have curly wavy hair that is frizzy. This product works great</li>
            <li> love this bumble and bumble... works great on all hair . great heat protecting, for flat iron.</li>
            <li> Really helps!  I love it, and there is no grimy residue after.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, frizzy and difficult to style.  Enter BB Straight Blowdry and &amp;#34;viola&amp;#34;, I can actually style my hair (myself)!  Thank you Bumble and bumble.</li>
            <li> This is a great time saver for those of you that straighten your hair after shampoo &amp; conditioning. It helps to straighten the hair with a brush while drying, then is reactivated while straightening. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Best product I have found this year. Smells good. Works well on 2nd day hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really helps to keep hair smooth without los of volume.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for my naturally curly/frizzy hair.  The humidity of Florida is such a challenge and I&#x27;ve used dozens of products.  Using this before blow drying (not too much at a time) is great and then if I use the flat iron I can have smooth hair for days.</li>
            <li> It is a good product to use when blow drying your hair straight.  Not too heavy.  Kind of expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> Nothing special, and I love this brand. I don&#x27;t see any change when I use this product.I have long, thick hair and their other products work great but this one makes my hair a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and use it a couple times a week. I don&#x27;t love it as much as Oribe&#x27;s Royal Blowout but that&#x27;s also $20 more. Either way, be sure to use these with the Bumble &amp; Bumble Invisible Hairdressers Oil for the best finish.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended using this before I blow dry and straighten my hair and it comes out great each time.  My hair is still very straight and shiny a few days after I initially straightened my hair.  This is coming from a girl who had frizzy and unmanageable hair before.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it promises to be! Excellent to make short work of daily smoothing and frizz-fighting rituals.</li>
            <li> I far prefer the previous, now discontinued product &amp;#34;Straight&amp;#34;.  This one is perfumed and doesn&#x27;t work as well, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells great, and really helps with the static!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Can&#x27;t live without this stuff! And at a greart price... :-)</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product, I have been using it for years and my hair always comes out straight with just a blow drier.</li>
            <li> I first tried this straightener at the salon.  I usually use Redkin, but I like the smell of this cream better.  It also seems to last longer and with less product (I have really thick, frizzy, curly hair).</li>
            <li> I just love love love the straight blow dry from bumble and bumble. It works wonders for my hair. I have very frizzy and wavy hair that curls into an \\&quot;S\\&quot; shape as soon as they dry. I need to blow dry them straight every time I wash them. My hair stylist used this on my hair once and I have been using it since then. I had the 5 oz tube which has lasted for more than a year. I shampoo twice a week and use a pea size amount after every hair wash. So that gives you an idea. Its expensive but given the fact that it lasts this long, I am ready to spend this much for straight soft hair. Try it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it moisturizes my hair perfectly for blow drying.</li>
            <li> Considerable protection against the daily blasts of damaging heat from my blow dryer and iron. Leaves hair soft with a pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle, product makes my hair feel sleek and keeps frizz down. Good overall!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but it gets dry pretty easily.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that makes my hair look and feel soft and conditioned even days after I blow dry it.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it but I&#x27;m a convert.  I have fine-ish hair but a lot of it, and this cream allows my hair to keep its body and movement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she swears by it. She has long and thick curly hair and this is the ONLY straightening balm that seems to work. It gets her hair super straight and smooth and it has a great scent (which is great for me!) It&#x27;s also great at removing frizz, her biggest pet peeve. This may be a little more expensive than other straightening balms...but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff freaky works! Tried so many ways to smooth and straighten but hair remained dry an had unruly areas. This really gives ME control of my hair instead of the other way round!</li>
            <li> My hair is straight with a tendency to fly away on top.  It also has one section that&#x27;s frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can tame that frizzy section so it looks like the rest of my hair.  Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a small amount in my hands and run it through my hair (all over) and then zap it with the blow dryer.  I&#x27;m not usually a blow dry in the mornings, girl, but without the blast of hot air, this product doesn&#x27;t really work.  So when I have a few extra minutes, I&#x27;ll use the Straight Blow Dry and focus on my frizzy section and then give the top of my hair a little air and my style stays straight and smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the new look.  It&#x27;s been hot and somewhat humid here lately, but my hair looks like I just walked out of the salon.  It&#x27;s smooth, sleek, and the best part is that my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it has any product in it.  My fingers glide through my hair without sticking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the shampoo and conditioner right now, too, but I think the Straight Blow Dry is what&#x27;s really making a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all of my life?  This product is one of the best that I have used to help with my super curly and frizzy hair.  A little goes a long way, so experiment.  I now just use it on the lower area of my hair and avoid my scalp.  I used it on my scalp and my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it yet, greasy!  I love it!  I still have to use the straight iron but it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair greasy. It could just be my hair, since it is oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive hair products, but I was very impressed with this product and will continue to buy it!  I tried it as part of a sample for beauty insider members and it makes my hair so soft after blow drying!  It smells great too! You only need to use a little bit, in fact if I use too much my hair gets a little film on it, but if I just use a pea size amount it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this product. A little bit goes a long way! Really helps my course, curly hair unwind softly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It protects my hair from the ocean salty breeze and sun.  It also provides so holding quailities.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble products never disappoint</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Hair remains straight even a few days after using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for frizzy, natural curly hair. Put it in sections when applying, and it tames the frizz well.</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff around</li>
            <li> I love all of the B&amp;B straighten products.  Come back to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This SMELLS AMAZING. It is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t add nasty product-weight to my hair. However, while it helps to slightly straighten my wavy, somewhat frizzy hair, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t actually take any frizz away. My frizz is manageable with some minor straightener use, but for paying so much for this Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry product, I should see some difference without having to straighten my hair. Nonetheless, 4 stars for excellent smell, great feel, and overall heat protection from styling equipment.</li>
