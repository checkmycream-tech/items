            <li>Nice clean fragrance - excellent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>but it can become to strong</li>
            <li>everything was fine</li>
            <li>I was not crazy about it at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying this scent</li>
            <li>and it is my first choice.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent last a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice dry down and smells even better when it fades away.</li>
            <li>This is one of my daily scents because it is a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people.</li>

            <li>To to counter this, I use only one or two quick sprays.</li>
            <li>The absolute must have for young men.</li>
            <li>Just remember to use with caution ( no more than 2-3) sprays, as it projects strong in the initial application, but the dry down is absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li>And at that price it&#x27;s definitely a steal ;)</li>
            <li>But, once a lady gets close to you, it has been known to drive them wild.  </li>
            <li>I usually get 10 hours easy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this item fast.  It was in excellent condition.  It&#x27;s my first time buying this scent and it&#x27;s not my fave but I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Love this smell!!! Got this for my boyfriend and it&#x27;s delicious! And at that price it&#x27;s definitely a steal ;)</li>
            <li> Perfect gift....everything was fine</li>
            <li> This cologne is an attention getting fragrance that will have you beating the ladies off of you. They all seem to LOVE it! Just remember to use with caution ( no more than 2-3) sprays, as it projects strong in the initial application, but the dry down is absolutely incredible. You will not be disappointed in your purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing smells great girls love it and lasts a long time this is an easy 60+ dollar cologne that your getting for 20$ buy it you won&#x27;t regret</li>
            <li> Very nice scent last a long time. I usually get 10 hours easy.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Love this scent</li>
            <li> Smells great but it can become to strong</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for over 4 years and it is my first choice. If you like the scent of this colonge, go for it all the time. Probably the best buy in the market.</li>
            <li> Went shopping last week and in the check out lane the woman running the cash register&#x27;s  said do you have clone on I replied yes and she called the other female over and both said come back and what is it I said Chrome Legend, they were overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Smell Great! Decent size bottle... Larger than expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas - it was a hit.  Nice clean fragrance - excellent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent but be forewarned, even though it is freash smelling, it&#x27;s very strong. Like I said in the title, it projects and makes itself  known when you walk in a room. To to counter this, I use only one or two quick sprays. It has a really nice dry down and smells even better when it fades away. Deeper cleaner, soapy,  spicy orginal chrome smell to it. I was not crazy about it at first but... it grew on me. I was really a big fan of the orginal chrome. But now the orginal smells to sharp to me. It also depends on your body too! Everyone has different smelling phermones. Very nice bottle. You can spray a little before going out to dinner,or every day at work, Solid scent and a good value.</li>
            <li> Great price for great cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I love chrome products. I get compliments from girls when I wear this. I would buy again A++</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good, but the scent wears off rapidly. Other reviewers speculate that the solution is diluted, but DUH it&#x27;s an eu de toilette. That means it&#x27;s diluted. I end up putting on a lot (4 hits), and it smells nice. This is one of my daily scents because it is a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people. But, once a lady gets close to you, it has been known to drive them wild.  Note that this is neither Chrome nor Legend. I have Chrome, and it is a better date scent than this.</li>
            <li> Love it smells great.</li>
            <li> The absolute must have for young men. I got two for my boys!</li>
