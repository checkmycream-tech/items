            <li>I&#x27;ve never had that kind of reaction before, but I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li>So kind of have no idea how it work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is as effective at all as a moisturizer.</li>

            <li>Nice feel when you are done.  </li>
            <li>feels great, smells fantastic- not over powering at all, very clean light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Plus, this is really cheap and good.</li>
            <li>Good winter and summer because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion, love that you use it in shower right after bathing.</li>
            <li>Super food for your skin!!  </li>

            <li>I would recommend Olay in shower, works better.</li>

            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>It is really a innovative product to use just before you are done with your shower.  </li>
            <li>It smells better and works better too.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent and nice skin feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does cause more work - leaves the shower floor a bit slippery and directions</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>SO LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Love Niveaproducts.</li>
            <li>I normally love Nivea products</li>
            <li>It makes it more supple, nourished and radiant.</li>
            <li>It is the most moisturizing skin care product in the world, so</li>
            <li>I have so many lotions already but always either forget or just don&#x27;t have time to stop and apply it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally like Nivea because of the smell, but this is more pleasant and you rinse it off, so the scent doesn&#x27;t stay anyway, but the moisture does!</li>
            <li>I have always liked Nivea lotion - the original</li>
            <li>Shea butter is an extraordinary skin care and an amazing body healer.  </li>
            <li>its easy to put on</li>
            <li>say to make sure you clean it after use.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes adding lotion to your morning routine easy.</li>
            <li>Light &amp; creamy</li>
            <li>The smell was light</li>
            <li>when I am in a rush is fantastic b/c</li>
            <li>only - and this stuff is great too.  </li>
            <li>And it leaves the skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>So, smooth skin and no falls.</li>
            <li>keeps my normally smooth skin even softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Target and was excited to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Great to use after shaving, saves you from having to shower, lotion, wait for lotion to dry, then get dressed.</li>
            <li>(Hydrating in the white bottle) is much more effective and has a lighter scent.  </li>
            <li>Great dry skin, no irritation and noticed a immediate improvement.</li>
            <li>Cool idea</li>
            <li>and my skin has been nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and it makes your hair nice, soft and curly.</li>
            <li>its a step I quickly add in the shower</li>
            <li>After a quick rinse (DONT OVER RINSE YOUR SKIN, Youll be washing off all that product)</li>
            <li>wish it can do a good job on changing my dry skin.</li>
            <li>While I love the idea of being able to moisturize my dry skin by using lotion in the shower, it didn&#x27;t work fir</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, pretty classic Nivea smell.</li>
            <li>but isn&#x27;t effective enough to purchase another.</li>
            <li>I love it skin so soft</li>
            <li>Love this product on my skin and add it to your hair if you have natural curls, while in the shower then rinse</li>
            <li>but i think its worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super fast and convenient!</li>
            <li>So after a bath and full bod exfoliation, i used 2 pumps and its more than enough to lather.</li>
            <li>Tried this one and it is not at thick feeling but probably will be a good fit for the summer</li>
            <li>Bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find the first product.</li>
            <li>, also, I smell my actual body wash more than I do this lotion</li>
            <li>i can skip my regular lotion step, and for when i got the time to pamper myself it even helps me to maintain my legs with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>and I think it absorbs well in the hot, steamy shower.  </li>
            <li>had to quit using it after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is my first time to use in-shower lotion.</li>
            <li>THIS SAVES SO MUCH TIME!</li>
            <li>This lotion works better than regular lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried this one first but ordered both versions.</li>
            <li>I love taking a hot shower, then applying this lotion while still wet, and then doing a quick rinse.</li>
            <li>pleased with this lotion but too much washes away when following directions on bottle.</li>
            <li>This did not do much, except for the first 5 min. of use.  </li>
            <li>At first, it feels like it leaves a little bit of a film, but as soon as I dry off, it&#x27;s all absorbed and feels great.</li>
            <li>I love this product for helping to eliminate dry, scaly winter skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh and unisex, and my husband also uses this on areas of his body where he&#x27;s prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I thought that this Smoothing one would be better since it seems to offer more moisturizing (very hard to tell from the verbiage on the bottle or website).  </li>
            <li>Like the idea of this product, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I can see that if your tub or shower isn&#x27;t textured, it could be very slippery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the in-shower lotions before, and they always felt like I had a very moist barrier on my skin.</li>
            <li>but i feel like it doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>Me, not so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, you really feel like you have lotion on after the shower.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>I expected the product to be more oil based which would require it to be rinsed off but instead most of the product just goes down the drain.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother anyone who is sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize skin and rinses off easily; I still feel the need to use a very light moisturizer after showering -- in my case, a few spritzes of a dry oil suffices, whereas without this in-shower moisturizer I&#x27;d need to slather on a heavy-duty body butter-type cream that would take forever to absorb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try out the Very Dry Skin version, however as others have pointed out- this lotion requires more effort than regular lotion.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I had used too much, so I gave it a couple more tries using different amounts and rinsing it for longer or shorter periods</li>
            <li>I have emptied this bottle so will see how the normal skin version works now.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>Saw this as a new product and decided to check it out.</li>
            <li>so I have absolutely no problem with it being slippery or having to clean it up afterwards.</li>
            <li>Bought the In-Shower lotion for regular skin first.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this daily and it really has seem to help!</li>
            <li>The only caution is that it can coat your shower floor or even the drain and back up your water, so be sure to rinse everything down with hot water after use.</li>
            <li>And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks, and every time I use it, no matter how much I rinse it off, it&#x27;s sticky, and the stickiness lasts for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Its actually quite fun to put it on, leaves your skin feeling soft, be careful when you are putting on though it is very slippery.</li>
            <li>I had used the Hydrating for several months and really like the results.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>GRAIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have keloid scars, and so far Nivea&#x27;s in shower body lotion has soften, conditioned and lightened the color.</li>
            <li>I put on additional lotion after showering when I am extremely dry, but it usually does the trick on its own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of these Nivea in shower moisturizers, although I think I prefer the one for extra-dry skin over this particular one.  </li>
            <li>First off I will point out that I was debating between this version and the Very Dry Skin version.</li>
            <li>I can certainly feel it on my skin after I first put it on, however &amp;#60;5 minutes later my skin is back to dry.</li>
            <li>Its very slippery &amp; greasy until you dry off.</li>
            <li>Decent item, not sure it works any better than using a regular body lotion while your still wet.</li>
            <li>my skin feels fantastic like baby ass without the heavy lotion dry spell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the feeling of thick body lotion air drying, but with this you just rinse 2 secs and wipe clean and HOLY</li>
            <li>My skin feels very relieved &amp; the itching is substantially less.</li>

            <li> Cool idea</li>
            <li> and my skin has been nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and it makes your hair nice, soft and curly.</li>
            <li> its a step I quickly add in the shower</li>
            <li> After a quick rinse (DONT OVER RINSE YOUR SKIN, Youll be washing off all that product)</li>
            <li> wish it can do a good job on changing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> While I love the idea of being able to moisturize my dry skin by using lotion in the shower, it didn&#x27;t work fir</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, pretty classic Nivea smell.</li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t effective enough to purchase another.</li>
            <li> I love it skin so soft</li>
            <li> Love this product on my skin and add it to your hair if you have natural curls, while in the shower then rinse</li>
            <li> but i think its worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super fast and convenient!</li>
            <li> So after a bath and full bod exfoliation, i used 2 pumps and its more than enough to lather.</li>
            <li> Tried this one and it is not at thick feeling but probably will be a good fit for the summer</li>
            <li> Bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find the first product.</li>
            <li> , also, I smell my actual body wash more than I do this lotion</li>
            <li> i can skip my regular lotion step, and for when i got the time to pamper myself it even helps me to maintain my legs with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> and I think it absorbs well in the hot, steamy shower.  </li>
            <li> had to quit using it after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to use in-shower lotion.</li>
            <li> THIS SAVES SO MUCH TIME!</li>
            <li> This lotion works better than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried this one first but ordered both versions.</li>
            <li> I love taking a hot shower, then applying this lotion while still wet, and then doing a quick rinse.</li>
            <li> pleased with this lotion but too much washes away when following directions on bottle.</li>
            <li> This did not do much, except for the first 5 min. of use.  </li>
            <li> At first, it feels like it leaves a little bit of a film, but as soon as I dry off, it&#x27;s all absorbed and feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this product for helping to eliminate dry, scaly winter skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh and unisex, and my husband also uses this on areas of his body where he&#x27;s prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought that this Smoothing one would be better since it seems to offer more moisturizing (very hard to tell from the verbiage on the bottle or website).  </li>
            <li> Like the idea of this product, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I can see that if your tub or shower isn&#x27;t textured, it could be very slippery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the in-shower lotions before, and they always felt like I had a very moist barrier on my skin.</li>
            <li> but i feel like it doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> Me, not so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, you really feel like you have lotion on after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I expected the product to be more oil based which would require it to be rinsed off but instead most of the product just goes down the drain.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother anyone who is sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize skin and rinses off easily; I still feel the need to use a very light moisturizer after showering -- in my case, a few spritzes of a dry oil suffices, whereas without this in-shower moisturizer I&#x27;d need to slather on a heavy-duty body butter-type cream that would take forever to absorb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try out the Very Dry Skin version, however as others have pointed out- this lotion requires more effort than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I had used too much, so I gave it a couple more tries using different amounts and rinsing it for longer or shorter periods</li>
            <li> I have emptied this bottle so will see how the normal skin version works now.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> Saw this as a new product and decided to check it out.</li>
            <li> so I have absolutely no problem with it being slippery or having to clean it up afterwards.</li>
            <li> Bought the In-Shower lotion for regular skin first.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this daily and it really has seem to help!</li>
            <li> The only caution is that it can coat your shower floor or even the drain and back up your water, so be sure to rinse everything down with hot water after use.</li>
            <li> And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks, and every time I use it, no matter how much I rinse it off, it&#x27;s sticky, and the stickiness lasts for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Its actually quite fun to put it on, leaves your skin feeling soft, be careful when you are putting on though it is very slippery.</li>
            <li> I had used the Hydrating for several months and really like the results.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> GRAIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have keloid scars, and so far Nivea&#x27;s in shower body lotion has soften, conditioned and lightened the color.</li>
            <li> I put on additional lotion after showering when I am extremely dry, but it usually does the trick on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of these Nivea in shower moisturizers, although I think I prefer the one for extra-dry skin over this particular one.  </li>
            <li> First off I will point out that I was debating between this version and the Very Dry Skin version.</li>
            <li> I can certainly feel it on my skin after I first put it on, however &amp;#60;5 minutes later my skin is back to dry.</li>
            <li> Its very slippery &amp; greasy until you dry off.</li>
            <li> Decent item, not sure it works any better than using a regular body lotion while your still wet.</li>
            <li> my skin feels fantastic like baby ass without the heavy lotion dry spell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feeling of thick body lotion air drying, but with this you just rinse 2 secs and wipe clean and HOLY</li>
            <li> My skin feels very relieved &amp; the itching is substantially less.</li>
            <li> It does not last long if your using it on your entire body but it does seem to soften skin in about a week.</li>
            <li> I am lazy and in-shower body lotion really saves time</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re already in the shower your skin doesn&#x27;t drink it up like it would normal lotion, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this stuff is no different than other regular Nivea lotions except that it is packaged and marketed differently.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin that can get scaly at times and living in south america where no winter is present</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that this is going to be my final remedy for that dreaded dry winter skin!  </li>
            <li> I also the smell to be very strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Strange</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry, very dry, damaged, Shea butter will make all of these problems vanish and bring your skin back to life.</li>
            <li> The package also cautions you to be very careful to wash the tub/shower because of the potential to slip on the wash-off.</li>
            <li> At the end my skin was still dry and had to use lotion anyway.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my skin still feels dry.</li>
            <li> I use Nivea lotion after I dry off as well</li>
            <li> Skin still dry after use.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to wait for lotion to dry before I can dress.  </li>
            <li> So dry that it&#x27;s like I never even put it</li>
            <li> so I am looking forward to that because my skin itches and gets so dry in the winter</li>
            <li> Even on my dry dry skin.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, my skin was still dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, putting this on in the shower feels like less of a chore to me than putting on regular body lotion.</li>
            <li> You have to dry the water off when you get out of the shower which probably removes what little moisturizer the shower left on you.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry &amp; itchy in the winter.</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t have dry skin, but over the past seasons of autumn and winter, my skin has been crackling and stiff.</li>
            <li> This requires way too work in the shower for minimal return on claims.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Be careful getting out of the tub or shower.</li>
            <li> No real difference in skin after using, still have to apply lotion.</li>
            <li> : DONT USE ON YOUR FEET AND BE CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU WILL FALL</li>
            <li> Use every other day to help hydrate the skin while in the shower</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> The other Nivea</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this because I saw it in a magazine, but i needed it because my skin wouldn&#x27;t take anymore of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After towel drying I have to apply other lotion.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product since I hate the oily feel of lotion but need something during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> The real test though will be in the winter, I haven&#x27;t tried it in cold weather before....</li>
            <li> It protects your skin from UV sunlight, harsh climate, dehydration and pollution damages.  </li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed in this one and really do not like the scent much.  </li>
            <li> Its been a long, cold winter and my skin is so dry.</li>
            <li> a bonus, this one also doesn&#x27;t leave the bottom of the shower slick.</li>
            <li> I like this but do not love it.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Product works but bottle arrived broken</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear body lotion after showering because i HATE the sticky feeling!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no small feat, as my skin is insanely dry.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a terrible red and itchy rash.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, no a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  </li>
            <li> Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> Have to say- after 3 days of using, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I hate putting on lotion after I shower.</li>
            <li> I hate lotion and the sticky, greasy feeling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will say the product is great.. Works well.. Smells great..BUT IT MADE THE SHOWER SO SLIPPERY I FELL!!</li>
            <li> Not the biggest fan of the scent. Makes my bathtub slippery.</li>
            <li> My body loved this product &amp; so did the hands of my boo. Greatest product Nivea has invented. It&#x27;s smooth, silky, &amp; a wonderful fragrance. Light &amp; creamy</li>
            <li> Like the idea of this product, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be very moisturizing. I also the smell to be very strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This requires way too work in the shower for minimal return on claims. You have to dry the water off when you get out of the shower which probably removes what little moisturizer the shower left on you. It take s some concentration to not use this under arm pits and pubes because it feels like you are using soap (in time you can adjust I guess). The package also cautions you to be very careful to wash the tub/shower because of the potential to slip on the wash-off. At the end my skin was still dry and had to use lotion anyway. Cool idea but isn&#x27;t effective enough to purchase another.</li>
            <li> Bought the In-Shower lotion for regular skin first. Saw a big difference. Bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find the first product. This is wonderful lotion. Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Moisturize before you rinse it off. After rinsing, my skin still feels dry.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt this smooth!</li>
            <li> This worked wonderfully. I definitely feel and see a difference. I gave this product a try because I wanted a lotion that would not just wipe off after I put it on or stick to my clothing. Using this product has definitely cut the time I spend on my morning routine. The smell was light and so was the feel of the lotion, also, I smell my actual body wash more than I do this lotion so...(it doesn&#x27;t mask on and you won&#x27;t be smelling it after your shower anyway). I do recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that can get scaly at times and living in south america where no winter is present that&#x27;s quite a statement. For that matter i use every moisturizing product i can find to improve the hydration level in my skin and THIS IS THE BOMB.COM&lt;br /&gt;For when I am in a rush is fantastic b/c i can skip my regular lotion step, and for when i got the time to pamper myself it even helps me to maintain my legs with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> goes on great and rinses off great!  seems to leave my skin hydrated all day!</li>
            <li> works really great.  And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li> Good lotion.Very nice feeling after the shower.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> love this In shower lotion</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use</li>
            <li> Decent item, not sure it works any better than using a regular body lotion while your still wet.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I live in the desert but I hate putting on lotion after I shower. For some reason, putting this on in the shower feels like less of a chore to me than putting on regular body lotion. At first, it feels like it leaves a little bit of a film, but as soon as I dry off, it&#x27;s all absorbed and feels great. The smell is ok, pretty classic Nivea smell. I have a bathtub with a textured bottom so I have absolutely no problem with it being slippery or having to clean it up afterwards. I can see that if your tub or shower isn&#x27;t textured, it could be very slippery. Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  Use every other day to help hydrate the skin while in the shower</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find an oil of olay in shower body lotion in the stores but they didn&#x27;t have any, so I saw Nivea online and decided to purchase it.  I like this product and it smells good, I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and I can say I would purchase again. Leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shower lotion!!  I have always liked Nivea lotion - the original only - and this stuff is great too.  The idea is genius and I think it absorbs well in the hot, steamy shower.  I apply it after I bathe with soap while my hair conditions.</li>
            <li> What a great concept, lotion in the bath/shower! Ive been using this daily and it really has seem to help! I use Nivea lotion after I dry off as well and my skin has been nice and soft. Added to my subscribe and save items!</li>
            <li> While I love the idea of being able to moisturize my dry skin by using lotion in the shower, it didn&#x27;t work fir me.&lt;br /&gt;I had to quit using it after the first use. It gave me a terrible red and itchy rash. I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;ve never had that kind of reaction before, but I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> Not the best thing that I have ever used for this purpose, but generally am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, no a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, love that you use it in shower right after bathing.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to use in-shower lotion. So kind of have no idea how it work. But I fell good after three times using it. Plus, this is really cheap and good. wish it can do a good job on changing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  Skin still dry after use.  I would recommend Olay in shower, works better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love the way it makes your skin feel, and it also lasts all day.</li>
            <li> THIS SAVES SO MUCH TIME! I love this stuff and will be buying another immediately. Great to use after shaving, saves you from having to shower, lotion, wait for lotion to dry, then get dressed. I feel moisture without greasiness for hours after my shower.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It is really a innovative product to use just before you are done with your shower.  And it leaves the skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the in-shower lotions before, and they always felt like I had a very moist barrier on my skin. I can&#x27;t explain it, but it felt like they didn&#x27;t penetrate. Not this one! It leaves my skin super-soft and has even eliminated my scaly elbows. That&#x27;s no small feat, as my skin is insanely dry.&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, this one also doesn&#x27;t leave the bottom of the shower slick. So, smooth skin and no falls. YAY!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My skin gets very dry &amp; itchy in the winter. I love taking a hot shower, then applying this lotion while still wet, and then doing a quick rinse. My skin feels very relieved &amp; the itching is substantially less. I put on additional lotion after showering when I am extremely dry, but it usually does the trick on its own.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target.  I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks, and every time I use it, no matter how much I rinse it off, it&#x27;s sticky, and the stickiness lasts for quite some time.  Other than that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a good product, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love it skin so soft</li>
            <li> for years we have used oil of olay in shower moisturizer with no complaints. Tried this one and it is not at thick feeling but probably will be a good fit for the summer</li>
            <li> I Love it!!! Its actually quite fun to put it on, leaves your skin feeling soft, be careful when you are putting on though it is very slippery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is as effective at all as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this but do not love it.  The other Nivea In Shower Body Lotion (Hydrating in the white bottle) is much more effective and has a lighter scent.  I had used the Hydrating for several months and really like the results.  It saves me a lot of time putting on lotion after my shower.  And I don&#x27;t have to wait for lotion to dry before I can dress.  I thought that this Smoothing one would be better since it seems to offer more moisturizing (very hard to tell from the verbiage on the bottle or website).  However, I was disappointed in this one and really do not like the scent much.  I will be finishing this one and going back to the white bottle Hydrating In Shower Body Lotion.  It smells better and works better too.</li>
            <li> not a big fan . its easy to put on but i feel like it doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin. doesnt seem to make a difference</li>
            <li> I love this product for helping to eliminate dry, scaly winter skin.  Great after swimming in a chlorinated pool, too.</li>
            <li> Product works but bottle arrived broken</li>
            <li> I am lazy and in-shower body lotion really saves time</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  Makes my morning routine much faster, especially when I need to shave a few minutes off my &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; time.  Fabulous scent and nice skin feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> This lotion works better than regular lotion. Since you&#x27;re already in the shower your skin doesn&#x27;t drink it up like it would normal lotion, so a little goes a long way. The scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother anyone who is sensitive to scents. I truly love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this product on my skin and add it to your hair if you have natural curls, while in the shower then rinse and it makes your hair nice, soft and curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of these Nivea in shower moisturizers, although I think I prefer the one for extra-dry skin over this particular one.  It does moisturize skin and rinses off easily; I still feel the need to use a very light moisturizer after showering -- in my case, a few spritzes of a dry oil suffices, whereas without this in-shower moisturizer I&#x27;d need to slather on a heavy-duty body butter-type cream that would take forever to absorb. The scent is light and fresh and unisex, and my husband also uses this on areas of his body where he&#x27;s prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful getting out of the tub or shower. Its very slippery &amp; greasy until you dry off. I like the concept of this. Its been a long, cold winter and my skin is so dry. This did not do much, except for the first 5 min. of use.  Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of NIVEA products and this is the only one I have found that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Olay brand I usually buy.&lt;br /&gt;Some ladies may like this but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for moisturizing my skin. I hate lotion and the sticky, greasy feeling. This keeps my skin feeling soft. The only caution is that it can coat your shower floor or even the drain and back up your water, so be sure to rinse everything down with hot water after use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Target and was excited to give it a shot. Have to say- after 3 days of using, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. First off I will point out that I was debating between this version and the Very Dry Skin version. Decided on this. The smell is descent and it&#x27;s def. not oily, but  I can&#x27;t say I have found any benefit to using it over regular lotion. I can certainly feel it on my skin after I first put it on, however &amp;#60;5 minutes later my skin is back to dry. So dry that it&#x27;s like I never even put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try out the Very Dry Skin version, however as others have pointed out- this lotion requires more effort than regular lotion. The amount of time you spend spreading this on and then rinsing it off leads to longer showers which defeats the purpose. I could just spend that time putting on regular lotion. It&#x27;s definitely a niche product. Seems others like it a lot. Me, not so much.</li>
            <li> No real difference in skin after using, still have to apply lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEEEE this stuff. It makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really really awesome!!!!  I like that its a step I quickly add in the shower and it eliminates the step needed AFTER the shower!  feels great, smells fantastic- not over powering at all, very clean light pleasant scent. My skin is so hydrated and healthy!  The real test though will be in the winter, I haven&#x27;t tried it in cold weather before.... so I am looking forward to that because my skin itches and gets so dry in the winter.... I have a feeling that this is going to be my final remedy for that dreaded dry winter skin!  I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, better than soap for showers.  Nice feel when you are done.  Good winter and summer because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, rinses clean.  My skin never felt so nourished. Strange my Dermatologist didn&#x27;t mention it,I  had to find it in a woman&#x27;s magazine. (Male Doctor)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely skin smoothing and softening. Saves time using it in the shower, your skin keeps moist and this is good.</li>
            <li> Even on my dry dry skin. I did not have this last winter so I hope it does as well during that super-drying season. Does cause more work - leaves the shower floor a bit slippery and directions say to make sure you clean it after use.</li>
            <li> pleased with this lotion but too much washes away when following directions on bottle.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this because I saw it in a magazine, but i needed it because my skin wouldn&#x27;t take anymore of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t have dry skin, but over the past seasons of autumn and winter, my skin has been crackling and stiff. So after a bath and full bod exfoliation, i used 2 pumps and its more than enough to lather. After a quick rinse (DONT OVER RINSE YOUR SKIN, Youll be washing off all that product) my skin feels fantastic like baby ass without the heavy lotion dry spell. I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a genius idea to have a in-shower lotion because the pores are open and absorbs all of it. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of thick body lotion air drying, but with this you just rinse 2 secs and wipe clean and HOLY GRAIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have keloid scars, and so far Nivea&#x27;s in shower body lotion has soften, conditioned and lightened the color. SO LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Super fast and convenient! And not sticky like regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, THIS IS AWESOME. i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion. I normally don&#x27;t wear body lotion after showering because i HATE the sticky feeling! but i decided to give this a try and i love it! keeps my normally smooth skin even softer and smoother. I love it a lot. it is a bit pricey but i think its worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: DONT USE ON YOUR FEET AND BE CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU WILL FALL IF YOU GET ANY ON THE FLOOR OF THE SHOWER. IT IS SLIPPERY.</li>
            <li> I have used the Olay in shower lotion and loved it, so I decided to give this one a try and I regret it. It&#x27;s nothing like the Olay, it&#x27;s way too sticky. I thought maybe I had used too much, so I gave it a couple more tries using different amounts and rinsing it for longer or shorter periods but Nooo. I noticed that a lot of the reviews were from people who got it free for testing, so I don&#x27;t know if that had anything to do with the good reviews, but I&#x27;m sticking with Olay!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Awesome moisturizer for my skin that I can put on in the shower. No greasiness because I rinse it off. It&#x27;s like conditioner for your skin! Try it, you&#x27;ll love it. I don&#x27;t generally like Nivea because of the smell, but this is more pleasant and you rinse it off, so the scent doesn&#x27;t stay anyway, but the moisture does! Love Love Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love Niveaproducts. This one falls short. After towel drying I have to apply other lotion.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product since I hate the oily feel of lotion but need something during the winter months.  This didn&#x27;t come close to meeting expectations.  In my opinion, this stuff is no different than other regular Nivea lotions except that it is packaged and marketed differently.  I expected the product to be more oil based which would require it to be rinsed off but instead most of the product just goes down the drain.  At the end of the day, my skin was still dry and itchy.  I normally love Nivea products but I think I&#x27;ll stick regular lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, you really feel like you have lotion on after the shower.  Great dry skin, no irritation and noticed a immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> Super food for your skin!!  Shea butter is extracted from the nuts of the Shea tree (Butyrospermum parkii), which grows in the savannah of Western Africa.  Anyone with a nut based allergy may want to try another version of this lotion.Shea butter is an extraordinary skin care and an amazing body healer.  It protects your skin from UV sunlight, harsh climate, dehydration and pollution damages.  It strengthens your skin by stimulating the production of collagen, which is the youthful protein in your skin. It makes it more supple, nourished and radiant. If your skin is dry, very dry, damaged, Shea butter will make all of these problems vanish and bring your skin back to life. It is the most moisturizing skin care product in the world, so it&#x27;s a no brainer that Nivea would use it in their formulation of this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Saw this as a new product and decided to check it out. I have so many lotions already but always either forget or just don&#x27;t have time to stop and apply it. This lotion makes adding lotion to your morning routine easy. It does not last long if your using it on your entire body but it does seem to soften skin in about a week. I tried this one first but ordered both versions. I have emptied this bottle so will see how the normal skin version works now. I would say a bottle of this will last 1 - 1 1/2 weeks with daily use.</li>
