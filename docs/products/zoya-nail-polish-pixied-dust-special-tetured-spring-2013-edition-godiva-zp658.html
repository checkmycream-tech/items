            <li>This is my new favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>what a cool concept, right?</li>
            <li>Will be buying several more colors!</li>
            <li>So so pretty!  </li>
            <li>one of my favorite nail polishes so far!</li>
            <li>I really love this soft and graceful color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten SOOOOOO many compliments from gals 15 to 89 years young.  </li>
            <li>This one is stunning alone or as a little bling on top of another color.</li>
            <li>It truly looks like you&#x27;re wearing a glittery (in a good way-definitely not little girl or teeny booper) layer of tiny diamonds on your nails when you&#x27;re in the sunlight!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very elegant and lasts longer than other polish.  </li>
            <li>This polish is so pretty.</li>
            <li>I can say with confidence that this is my favorite nail polish in my rather extensive collection!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely like it more if it was easier to remove.  </li>
            <li>I usually only wear darker colors, so I thought I would love this.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many sparkly nail polishes before but they never have enough sparkles!</li>
            <li>This is my first Zoya polish purchase.</li>
            <li>really pretty color and texture</li>
            <li>A girlfriend kept asking me if I had the bottle on me because she really wanted to wear it!</li>
            <li>A great nail polish when you need something that isn&#x27;t too dramatic but still is special.  </li>
            <li>This color takes two plus coats to get a good coverage - DON&#x27;T use a base or top coat!!  </li>
            <li>Easy application, mess free</li>
            <li>I am generally fan of textured nail polish, but this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish.  </li>
            <li>Although its a matte finish and textured, it is still very sparkly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in the USA and big 5 free.</li>
            <li>Took two coats to really show, but stays on for longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Something is very off with this product- grainy and not sparkly.</li>
            <li>And for some reason, the odd texture makes it super easy to touch up chips in the polish.  </li>
            <li>I was somewhat sceptical, because this is kind of expensive for my budget, but I love sparkly</li>
            <li>It feels fun when it is dried and offers a nice matte glitter nailpolish.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy light colors; I&#x27;m much more into reds, deep reds, dark colors</li>
            <li>The pixie dust polishes are easy to apply, dry quickly and are long wearing.  </li>
            <li>Its kind of hard to remove though.  </li>
            <li>generally like this brand (I usually use OPI or smth similar, but this brand works great).</li>
            <li>I can compare the color and texture to concrete.  </li>
            <li>It lasts forever on my nails and normally nail polish lasts with out chipping on my nails for 2 days max!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>, I did apply many coats and still dried in a manageable time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional in my mid-twenties, and this color is just right for someone my age: not too edgy, but definitely not boring!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see where the touch up has been done and your nails look newly</li>
            <li>If  you have natural nails and are looking for polish that does not chip or peel, stop looking and buy Zoya Pixied Dust!</li>
            <li>I just applied it for the first time last night as I have had Zoya Pixie Dust in Solange on my nails for the holidays</li>
            <li>Wearing now but can&#x27;t wait for the holidays as this color over a nice dark red or royal blue will be so festive.</li>
            <li>Also, although it does chip, it lasts a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li>- I am 56 years young.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty, didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped though.</li>
            <li>the compliments are endless and super long lasting!  </li>
            <li>The polishes only took 3 days to get here, and I could barely</li>
            <li>It is a little harder to get off but worth it.</li>

            <li> I truly hope Zoya continues this product for at least the next 30 years while I should still be on Planet Earth.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> tried the London first, and I was actually a bit disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I typically buy this at Ulta, so know what it should look and feel like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an understated taupe color with LOTS of little diamond-like glistens.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>

            <li> Perfect nude polish! Will never clash with selected outfits.</li>
            <li> This sparkle nail polish is easy and quick to put on. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it looking perfect. Quick and great way to add to my outfit is with coloring my nails.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish.  The color is very nice and the sandy texture is pretty cool.  It is a perfect beachy polish.</li>
            <li> finish feels like sandpaper. Chips easily.</li>
            <li> Definitely a 5 star purchase. Polish arrived quickly, as described. Great polish and the bottle was full. Perfect easy transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately went out and purchased a few other Pixie Dusts because this polish was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> very pretty color and easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;now i know why it&#x27;s so famous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the color and very special texture</li>
            <li> Another winner from Zoya.  This is my new favorite brand.  The pixie dust polishes are easy to apply, dry quickly and are long wearing.  This one is stunning alone or as a little bling on top of another color.</li>
            <li> This polish is so pretty. Wearing now but can&#x27;t wait for the holidays as this color over a nice dark red or royal blue will be so festive. Love the texture too. Will be buying more of this brand.</li>
            <li> The best sparkly nail polish I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> The texture is very unique, it&#x27;s like sand.&lt;br /&gt;and I really love this soft and graceful color&lt;br /&gt;I bought Godiva and Vespa together, and love both~</li>
            <li> LOVE this color. Got it within 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this polish, I had high hopes that it would be beautiful. I thought, matte glitter, what a cool concept, right? I was way off. This looks gross. The color is a yucky yellowish that makes nails look dirty and not gorgeous. I was hoping for a beautiful nude with some pizazz.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> My first textured nail polish and I love it! Although its a matte finish and textured, it is still very sparkly. Godiva is a perfect nude/silver/gold nail polish for everyday/every occasion wear. I don&#x27;t normally buy light colors; I&#x27;m much more into reds, deep reds, dark colors but this one is amazing and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great sparkly but neutral color (I tried a lot of Zoya&#x27;s Pixied Dust colors and this one is one of my favorites). It stays for a long time. You don&#x27;t need a top coat or anything like that as it has an interesting texture (it&#x27;s also very easy to apply - it looks great even if you&#x27;re not a pro (I&#x27;m definitely not!). The only problem is getting this thing off - it takes a lot of nail polish remover to get all of this sparkle off.&lt;br /&gt;In generally like this brand (I usually use OPI or smth similar, but this brand works great).</li>
            <li> I can say with confidence that this is my favorite nail polish in my rather extensive collection!  It&#x27;s so unique, the compliments are endless and super long lasting!  Will be buying several more colors!</li>
            <li> If  you have natural nails and are looking for polish that does not chip or peel, stop looking and buy Zoya Pixied Dust!</li>
            <li> I bought the Godiva and the London.  Overall, I like these polishes.  The texture is kind of like sand.  Its matte, but the sparkle gives it a shine.  And for some reason, the odd texture makes it super easy to touch up chips in the polish.  It doesn&#x27;t look awkward when you paint over the little part where it chipped like my other nail polishes do.  Also, although it does chip, it lasts a pretty long time.  Its kind of hard to remove though.  Not a huge deal, but I&#x27;d definitely like it more if it was easier to remove.  The polishes only took 3 days to get here, and I could barely wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the London first, and I was actually a bit disappointed with it.  I usually only wear darker colors, so I thought I would love this.  I can compare the color and texture to concrete.  It was okay, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be using it very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried the Godiva, and like I said, I don&#x27;t usually use lighter colors.  But this is an exception! I absolutely love it!  When I&#x27;m wearing the Godiva, I can&#x27;t even keep track of all the compliments I receive.  I&#x27;m a professional in my mid-twenties, and this color is just right for someone my age: not too edgy, but definitely not boring! So so pretty!  My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I love the Zoya brand, and this color was no exception. It is a beautiful pixie dust glitter with a textural finish but doesn&#x27;t feel too rough. It made a great sand look for a beach scene nail art I was attempting. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it ,its so nude but still so sprakly ! it would be perfect for the wedding day:)  i use it daily for work!</li>
            <li> I love the pixie dust collection and Godiva is no exception. It&#x27;s a lovely creamy sparkly color. Looks great on and lasts for quite a while. It&#x27;s made in the USA and big 5 free.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat sceptical, because this is kind of expensive for my budget, but I love sparkly so I went ahead and bought. Gorgeous, and many compliments. Will buy different colors.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite polish! It&#x27;s so stylish and girly! I tried so many sparkly nail polishes before but they never have enough sparkles! But, this is perfect! I will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li> Really nice nude color alternative</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend and she loves the color.  Does have a sparkle to it.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! I love this polish! I would defiantly recommend it. Very unique. Unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this color, super cute and matches just about anything. Took two coats to really show, but stays on for longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this nail polish.  I wear it all the time.  It is very elegant and lasts longer than other polish.  It is a little harder to get off but worth it.</li>
            <li> Whatever I received, it was not Zoya&#x27;s usual polish. I typically buy this at Ulta, so know what it should look and feel like. Something is very off with this product- grainy and not sparkly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sparkly as I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s more like those textured sand polishes.</li>
            <li> A great nail polish when you need something that isn&#x27;t too dramatic but still is special.  I wear this one a lot.</li>
            <li> I loved this one. I am generally fan of textured nail polish, but this is my favorite by far. Discrete and shiny at the same time. Well done Zoya!</li>
            <li> This is my first Zoya polish purchase. I LOVE the colour. It&#x27;s a neutral shade and though there is glitter it&#x27;s not a loud shade of polish that I can still wear at work. The polish is long wearing and my nails, not sure if it&#x27;s the polish, don&#x27;t bend and seem stronger while this is worn. When I need to remove the colour it&#x27;s not difficult which with glitter can sometimes be hard. This is my new favorite go to colour!</li>
            <li> IF I could give this 100 stars I would!  I am in love with this color.  I just applied it for the first time last night as I have had Zoya Pixie Dust in Solange on my nails for the holidays (check it out if you want to TRUE GOLD!).&lt;br /&gt;This is an understated taupe color with LOTS of little diamond-like glistens.  It is beautiful to look at.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about the sand texture.  This color takes two plus coats to get a good coverage - DON&#x27;T use a base or top coat!!  It lasts forever on my nails and normally nail polish lasts with out chipping on my nails for 2 days max!&lt;br /&gt;This sand type from Zoya lasts for 7+ days.  What&#x27;s even better is you can keep adding a layer on the top if it does chip.  You can&#x27;t see where the touch up has been done and your nails look newly polished.&lt;br /&gt;This is the FASTEST DRYING nail polish I have ever owned.  I truly hope Zoya continues this product for at least the next 30 years while I should still be on Planet Earth.&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I am 56 years young.  I&#x27;ve gotten SOOOOOO many compliments from gals 15 to 89 years young.  As soon as gals see it, they complimented my nails THEN they hurried to write down the color and product brand as they were anxious to buy it for their nails.  They for sure didn&#x27;t want to forget.  I know if I had seen it on someone I definitely would&#x27;ve wanted to know the name of it.  It truly looks like you&#x27;re wearing a glittery (in a good way-definitely not little girl or teeny booper) layer of tiny diamonds on your nails when you&#x27;re in the sunlight!&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say, I have never had that happen with a nail color EVER!</li>
            <li> Dries fast, its very subtle and lasts long. Loving it.</li>
            <li> Super pretty color, easy to apply, I didn&#x27;t have messy, glopy  problems like some people complained off. Easy application, mess free, I did apply many coats and still dried in a manageable time. Very pretty, didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped though. Would still purchase more and or again.</li>
            <li> looks good on my girl friends fingers</li>
            <li> really pretty color and texture one of my favorite nail polishes so far!</li>
            <li> I love the pixie dust nail polish. It feels fun when it is dried and offers a nice matte glitter nailpolish. The godiva nailpolish is a very nice colour and a nice take on a sophisticated neutral.</li>
            <li> Probably my newest most favorite color.  It&#x27;s glitzy but not chunky or coarse glittery.  and it&#x27;s a nice golden-but-not-gold color.  A girlfriend kept asking me if I had the bottle on me because she really wanted to wear it!</li>
