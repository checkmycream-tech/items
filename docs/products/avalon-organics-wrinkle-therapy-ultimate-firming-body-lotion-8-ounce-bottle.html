            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>Am very happy to find this at such a good price.</li>
            <li>but I love the scent and it does do a nice job moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Neck area looks very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about everything that I have read on the Internet, but this lotion is the ultimate best.</li>
            <li>Avalon Organics products are a favorite of mine &amp; I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the many organic herbal ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard either way, if they have used it or are enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure that it is firming</li>
            <li>This lotion is helping give my skin more elasticity</li>
            <li>and I do not knock off top layer of skin since I began using this product.</li>
            <li>I have to remember to use it more and more.</li>
            <li>am 58 year old and people say I look like 45 because of this great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I held off on reviewing this for awhile, because I wanted to make sure, but it truly seems to help significantly.</li>
            <li>I was having easily bruised skin that has worsened with age.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong and so pervasive</li>
            <li>Nice texture, very emollient...</li>
            <li>but i like the smell and the way it is absorbed and mostly organic.  </li>
            <li>and it was far superior to protect skin from tears.</li>
            <li>Awesome results, no strong fragrance</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>It has a light and fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li>I saw somewhere that Avalon Organics Ultimate Firming Body Lotion, CoQ10 was really good for this.  </li>
            <li>Seems to clear up and tighten skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Super for aging skin.</li>
            <li>Have sent for some more but normal delivery for when we run out.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;being 95% healed up and the his skin feels much more strong&lt;br /&gt;and normal</li>
            <li>but if it does what they claim it will be worth it.  </li>
            <li>love the product so far</li>
            <li>The perfumey flowery smell is not subtle, and a significant deterrent from use for me.</li>
            <li>Now this lotion may do better for others on different parts of the body but not for hands, I use castor oil on them at night and it is wonderful but incredibly messy if not careful, so I am Always looking for something else.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no such bruising since using this product daily on my hands and forearms.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and it is really helping my skin toughen up!  </li>
            <li>But then, nothing I have tried has done much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad some people had luck with it, but it&#x27;s back to square one for him.</li>
            <li>, you just smell it when you first put it on, then it goes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, the first one I&#x27;ve ever reviewed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only okay because I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I found this lotion recommended on Amazon and it is indeed a great product - at least one that has worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>My 65 year old husband continually got large bruises on the top of his hands when barely nicking them on anything.</li>
            <li>It may not have added fragrance, but the odor from all those natural ingredients adds up to a rather unbearable experience for someone sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>Really helped toughen the skin on husband&#x27;s arms.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thank you much</li>
            <li>It really seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I sent for the cream for a fast.</li>
            <li>Has not done much for me after 6 weeks, but it might help someone else.</li>
            <li>My arms seem to stay much clearer, not as much blood clots, bruises.  </li>
            <li>I look so much</li>
            <li>This is way cheaper than whole foods sells it for.</li>
            <li>It is really making a difference on the crepe-y skin on my arms.</li>
            <li>Right now my arms are completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this is simply due to sun damage over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps bruising,particullarly in older people.</li>
            <li>Love it and have seen dry and old looking skin look healthier than it ever has.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion twice or more a day on my arms for just a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in these unsightly red spots.  </li>
            <li>My doctor has me using Tretinoin Cream (Retin-A) at night which is a tremendous help with the bruising and red spots.  </li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone with older or thinning skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom uses it on her fragile skin and it is super helpful to minimize the purple bruising she gets</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Lordy, this stuff smells to high heaven.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my skin is more firm</li>
            <li>The price is pretty fair, but I&#x27;m still getting the weird brusing for lack of collagen.</li>
            <li>Thus far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much as far as collagen goes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, &amp; as a nurse appeciate products that will not compromise the integrity of my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all gals who care not only how your skin will look, but also about what it is absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I think they would be completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Makes .y skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, but not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised to see how well the skin has tightened and firmed.</li>
            <li>Purchase Euericin Professional moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have used this consistently since February on the loose skin on my tummy.  </li>
            <li>I lost 70 pounds and have lose skin and being realistic with possible results</li>
            <li>Really helped firm up some loose skin and smooth out some wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I do hard labor with my hands, so at night I slather on this lotion and put on light gloves to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I can not vouch for other uses but for this it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I like all of the other Avalon Organics, but this one didn&#x27;t really do what was promised.  </li>

            <li> I like all of the other Avalon Organics, but this one didn&#x27;t really do what was promised.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure that this has changed the texture of my skin much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to determine whether it works or not (i.e. does what it is supposed to for the skin).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Much too thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics CoQ10 Ultimate Firming Body lotion is my choice for thin shin injuries I have tried all the rest and keep coming back to  Avalon Organics CoQ10 Ultimate.</li>
            <li> I also am trying to be careful not to bang my arms when working about the house.</li>
            <li> Approaching the age of 70, I&#x27;ve been recently bothered by very thin, fragile skin on my arms and red blotches that appear without any seeming provocation.  </li>
            <li> In only 2 weeks, my husband&#x27;s skin is stronger and is bruising much less!  </li>
            <li> Other than softness</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> My wife has extremely thin skin, every time she bumped her arm she would get a blotch mark, so far it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible scent but the cream feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> up and down his arms to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet since I haven&#x27;t accidentally slightly injured my arms; so I had to give my review</li>
            <li> one star less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen less cuts and scratches on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing results, and see less purple under-skin bruising.  </li>
            <li> Just a typical body lotion....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price of bio oil.</li>
            <li> It appears to have thickened my skin and as a result I&#x27;m also not experiencing cuts on my arms when I even just slightly bump into something.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product and almost immediately my skin became resistant to the little bumps that has previously caused bleeding.</li>
            <li> has such a bad smell that it has been hard to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I would hardly bump up against something and my lower arms would get extremely bruised with dark spots.</li>
            <li> Needed something to firm up skin.  </li>
            <li> did not seem to firm up my arms, to help stop bruising and blotching from medication,  but help with dryness on my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;R.W.</li>
            <li> and it has helped my skin in a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After shaving I apply on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of bruises on my legs and it seems to help them subside a little faster than usual.</li>
            <li> I suffer with Crohn&#x27;s disease and have been put on steroids for many years which has caused a very bad thinning of the skin and bad bruising, purple, red and blue.  </li>
            <li> Well I like the faint aroma, the little needed for my arms, (I bought it to hopes it prevents or lessons the red marks that I get when accidentally bumping or scratching into something)</li>
            <li> has gotten no more bruises.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;skin WAS as thin as wet tissue paper.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it because of comments that it would prevent bruising due to thin, aging skin.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE, STRONG SMELL.  </li>
            <li> If I do accidentally scrape my thin skin the bruising seems much less and heals faster.  </li>
            <li> My husband also suffers on his arms only and has said it is improving his skin already.  </li>
            <li> I almost did not order after alot of people complained about the smell</li>
            <li> The results were not amazing</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend hundreds on other expensive products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which was so bad on my skin -- especially arms.</li>
            <li> My husband has geriatric purpura, very bad dark red bruising&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not particular about scents, and this isn&#x27;t terrible, but it smells very weird like the whole food store, grass, moldy citrus</li>
            <li> like this product is helping skin after taking blood thinners as medication made skin thin</li>
            <li> I use this for thin skin on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I was looking online for a solution for my thin skin.</li>
            <li> If you have skin that is paper thin and tears and bruises by just bumping something, please give this a try!</li>
            <li> Delivery, which was quite expensive to France</li>
            <li> Already it is helping my bruising issue on my arms and my skin thinning isn&#x27;t as bad now.</li>
            <li> It was so ugly.</li>
            <li> I use it at night because it has an awful insect repellant order.</li>
            <li> Now I use a lot of lotion, a lot, I work in a factory with paper and cardboard and my skin looks terrible a lot of the time, so I decided to try this lotion for my arthritic hands which are wrinkly as well</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Nice lotion but no affect on age spots over 3 mths</li>
            <li> Well I like the faint aroma, the little needed for my arms, (I bought it to hopes it prevents or lessons the red marks that I get when accidentally bumping or scratching into something) but I don&#x27;t know the answer to that yet since I haven&#x27;t accidentally slightly injured my arms; so I had to give my review one star less. It&#x27;s also not greasy; a plus!</li>
            <li> like this product is helping skin after taking blood thinners as medication made skin thin</li>
            <li> My skin is getting thinner with age. ugh  I kept cutting/scratching myself with my own finger nails!  Needed something to firm up skin.  Read the reviews and let me tell you...this is working!!  I even apply to neck area.  I&#x27;ve seen less cuts and scratches on my hands.  Neck area looks very smooth.  Good lotion for all over body.  Very pleasant fragrance too.  Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Really helped toughen the skin on husband&#x27;s arms. Haven&#x27;t had a bruise or break in skin and only been using for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> As one who has reached what is called the \\&quot;senior\\&quot; years I found that the skin on my arms had become fragile. I work outdoors and around horses every day and the slighted bump would cause either a bruise or bleeding.  I am sure this is simply due to sun damage over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried this product and almost immediately my skin became resistant to the little bumps that has previously caused bleeding. I apply to my arms once in the morning. I have now used it for six months and it finally ran out. Ordered another container today. It works.</li>
            <li> Thus far it&#x27;s working well. My wife has extremely thin skin, every time she bumped her arm she would get a blotch mark, so far it&#x27;s working. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased it and it is everything they said it was.  If you have skin that is paper thin and tears and bruises by just bumping something, please give this a try! I have been using it now for about a month and I can def. see a difference.  My doctor has me using Tretinoin Cream (Retin-A) at night which is a tremendous help with the bruising and red spots.  But each morning I apply this firming body lotion and it is really helping my skin toughen up!  I have tried just about everything that I have read on the Internet, but this lotion is the ultimate best. I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li> This a 2-pack &amp; the price is lower than purchasing it at the local health food coop.  Avalon Organics products are a favorite of mine &amp; I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 10 years.  Nice texture, very emollient...and it does have a distinctive lavender scent.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exceedingly impressive product.  Immediately decided to stock up in case I ran out.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but not the best! Will continue my search! For reference, I have dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. But it is too soon to know if it&#x27;s working or not. It&#x27;s only been a few days. I haven&#x27;t had any allergic reactions so thats good.</li>
            <li> Second order of this CoQ10 Lotion. It is amazing for helping with &amp;#34;thin skin&amp;#34; after a year of chemo! I would highly recommend it! PLH</li>
            <li> My 65 year old husband continually got large bruises on the top of his hands when barely nicking them on anything. He has been applying this to his hands for about 3 weeks (once a day) has gotten no more bruises. Hands look softer and smoother,  without constant unsightly bruises!</li>
            <li> did not seem to firm up my arms, to help stop bruising and blotching from medication,  but help with dryness on my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;R.W.</li>
            <li> Really helped firm up some loose skin and smooth out some wrinkles.  Very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. Already it is helping my bruising issue on my arms and my skin thinning isn&#x27;t as bad now. I can honestly say this  is  a  great  product.</li>
            <li> Sent to relative who uses it regularly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avalon CoQ10 for several months.  I ordered it because of comments that it would prevent bruising due to thin, aging skin.  I have experienced no such bruising since using this product daily on my hands and forearms.  Really good product!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, smooth. Skin feels nourished! I don&#x27;t know if my skin is more firm but I like the way the lotion feels. Not sticky, sinks in and keeps skin soft. I&#x27;ve only been using for a short period of time but I would buy again. Just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE, STRONG SMELL.  COULDNT STAND IT.</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics CoQ10 Ultimate Firming Body lotion is my choice for thin shin injuries I have tried all the rest and keep coming back to  Avalon Organics CoQ10 Ultimate.</li>
            <li> It is like any regular moisturizer I have used. I use it at night because it has an awful insect repellant order. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> used this before and liked it. Am very happy to find this at such a good price. Thank you much</li>
            <li> I do hard labor with my hands, so at night I slather on this lotion and put on light gloves to sleep.  This has arnica as an ingredient, which aids recovery from the strain I put my hands through.  I love the many organic herbal ingredients.  Thank you, Avalon Organics!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only okay because I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  Other than softness it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much as far as collagen goes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and twice a day.  The price is pretty fair, but I&#x27;m still getting the weird brusing for lack of collagen.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. I could tell the difference when I ran out and started using a different firming product. Its something you have to use. The results were not amazing but I could tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and been using it over a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend. I haven&#x27;t heard either way, if they have used it or are enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now, I was drawn to it because it is Organic &amp; also firming.  I have sensitive skin, &amp; as a nurse appeciate products that will not compromise the integrity of my skin. I recommend this to all gals who care not only how your skin will look, but also about what it is absorbing.  It&#x27;s not in anyone&#x27;s best interest to apply &amp;#34;chemcials&amp;#34; to your skin. I  welcome more organic products.  Hope to find a 50+ sunscreen that is organic.</li>
            <li> Although I have only just received this firming cream and used now for the third day (including my husband).  It really seems to be working. I suffer with Crohn&#x27;s disease and have been put on steroids for many years which has caused a very bad thinning of the skin and bad bruising, purple, red and blue.  This cream seems to be truly helping. My husband also suffers on his arms only and has said it is improving his skin already.  I sent for the cream for a fast. Delivery, which was quite expensive to France but if it does what they claim it will be worth it.  Have sent for some more but normal delivery for when we run out.  Can definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> love the product so far</li>
            <li> A great lotion and it has helped my skin in a few days. I ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I read the C0Q10 could help in the thickening of the forearm&#x27;s cellular firmness.  I was having easily bruised skin that has worsened with age.  I am seeing results, and see less purple under-skin bruising.  I also am trying to be careful not to bang my arms when working about the house.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference.  The scent was great, though...</li>
            <li> Has not done much for me after 6 weeks, but it might help someone else. But then, nothing I have tried has done much!</li>
            <li> Im not sure that this has changed the texture of my skin much but I love the scent and it does do a nice job moisturizing. I will probably continue to buy for awhile.</li>
            <li> Super for aging skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has geriatric purpura, very bad dark red bruising&lt;br /&gt;on the lower arms with bleeding at the smallest trauma.  His&lt;br /&gt;skin WAS as thin as wet tissue paper.  And he had band aids&lt;br /&gt;all up and down his arms to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this cream twice daily for the last two weeks&lt;br /&gt;and there is already a remarkable improvement with his arms&lt;br /&gt;being 95% healed up and the his skin feels much more strong&lt;br /&gt;and normal in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will let his dermatologist, who could do nothing for him&lt;br /&gt;six weeks ago, know about this treatment as well as telling&lt;br /&gt;his G.P. know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend this to anyone with older or thinning skin.&lt;br /&gt;We are so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for thin skin on my arms.  I use twice a day.  My arms seem to stay much clearer, not as much blood clots, bruises.  If I do accidentally scrape my thin skin the bruising seems much less and heals faster.  Right now my arms are completely clear.  I held off on reviewing this for awhile, because I wanted to make sure, but it truly seems to help significantly.</li>
            <li> After trying numerous more expensive firming cream this is the gem of all.&lt;br /&gt;I am 58 year old and people say I look like 45 because of this great product.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I apply on my face everyday. I look so much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has COQ 10 and loss of that collagen facial starts wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avalon is the best firming anti wrinkle product. Don&#x27;t spend hundreds on other expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best answer&lt;br /&gt;Pete T, Novi, MI</li>
            <li> Now I use a lot of lotion, a lot, I work in a factory with paper and cardboard and my skin looks terrible a lot of the time, so I decided to try this lotion for my arthritic hands which are wrinkly as well, I saw no improvement whatsoever in my skin and just very basic moisturizing properties. Now this lotion may do better for others on different parts of the body but not for hands, I use castor oil on them at night and it is wonderful but incredibly messy if not careful, so I am Always looking for something else. The search continues.&lt;br /&gt;Oh plus the smell.....not a fan, and I&#x27;m not particular about scents, and this isn&#x27;t terrible, but it smells very weird like the whole food store, grass, moldy citrus....I don&#x27;t know, I will not be buying again. I will be trying vitamin e oil next!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to determine whether it works or not (i.e. does what it is supposed to for the skin).&lt;br /&gt;It has such a bad smell that it has been hard to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> Yes, my husband&#x27;s blood blisters have almost entirely gone away.  If I could get him to use it regularly I think they would be completely gone.  I can not vouch for other uses but for this it worked very well.</li>
            <li> In only 2 weeks, my husband&#x27;s skin is stronger and is bruising much less!  Already recommending it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Just a typical body lotion....nothing special.</li>
            <li> I like all of the other Avalon Organics, but this one didn&#x27;t really do what was promised.  Much too thick.  Took forever to blend into the skin.</li>
            <li> Makes .y skin feel soft.  No big chance in lumps bumps on legs yeg</li>
            <li> It has a horrible scent but the cream feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> allergic reaction arm swoll up</li>
            <li> When used daily, I feel that this tightens and smoothes the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I did not purchase this for any sort of skin firming purposes, I don&#x27;t believe any of that works. I get a lot of bruises on my legs and it seems to help them subside a little faster than usual. It makes my skin soft, but not greasy or oily. It has a light and fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li> My husband has purpura on his arms and I read reviews from several people that the Avalon Organics CoQ10 Ultimate Firming Body lotion helped a lot.  I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so I ordered it from Amazon.  After using it for a month, there has been no improvement on his arms.  I&#x27;m glad some people had luck with it, but it&#x27;s back to square one for him.</li>
            <li> I had a baby five months ago and the skin on my tummy is lose and kinda saggy. (Shriveled looking) I have tried bio oil, body coco butter, and some face products for wrinkles.  I do believe the bio oil helped with my stretch marks but none helped with the extra skin. I used this one night and this morning I am amazed that it helped. I have never reviewed anything online! If you have the same issue or something similar you should try this. It&#x27;s half the price of bio oil.</li>
            <li> Love it and have seen dry and old looking skin look healthier than it ever has. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure that it is firming but i like the smell and the way it is absorbed and mostly organic.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> The perfumey flowery smell is not subtle, and a significant deterrent from use for me.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion recommended on Amazon and it is indeed a great product - at least one that has worked very well for me.  Approaching the age of 70, I&#x27;ve been recently bothered by very thin, fragile skin on my arms and red blotches that appear without any seeming provocation.  After using this lotion twice or more a day on my arms for just a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in these unsightly red spots.  It appears to have thickened my skin and as a result I&#x27;m also not experiencing cuts on my arms when I even just slightly bump into something.  I highly recommend this product, the first one I&#x27;ve ever reviewed!</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference in my skin - smoother</li>
            <li> Now that I am in my 60&#x27;s, my skin has started to get thinner.  I saw somewhere that Avalon Organics Ultimate Firming Body Lotion, CoQ10 was really good for this.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks, I can tell a difference in my skin already.  I almost did not order after alot of people complained about the smell, you just smell it when you first put it on, then it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone else, in fact I already have.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Seems to clear up and tighten skin nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes time to work but I do see results . I&#x27;m almost on my third bottle . This is way cheaper than whole foods sells it for. I lost 70 pounds and have lose skin and being realistic with possible results I have to say I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps bruising,particullarly in older people. It cleared up my arms when nothing else I have used did.</li>
            <li> Can see the difference on my neck.  Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells wonderful and results are noticeable fairly quickly. My mom uses it on her fragile skin and it is super helpful to minimize the purple bruising she gets</li>
            <li> I had to take prednisone for over 18 months which was so bad on my skin -- especially arms. This lotion is helping give my skin more elasticity and I do not knock off top layer of skin since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently since February on the loose skin on my tummy.  I have been pleasantly surprised to see how well the skin has tightened and firmed. Of course as with anything else, daily use is key and this has been several months now that have passed.</li>
            <li> Many of my friends bought this also!</li>
            <li> I have to remember to use it more and more. It is really making a difference on the crepe-y skin on my arms.</li>
            <li> Awesome results, no strong fragrance</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it. Purchase Euericin Professional moisturizer and it was far superior to protect skin from tears.</li>
            <li> I was looking online for a solution for my thin skin. I would hardly bump up against something and my lower arms would get extremely bruised with dark spots. It was so ugly. I did a Google search and read about a woman that said she used this lotion and Emu oil and her bruising on her lower arms stopped. I had to try it.  I had no desire to use Emu oil but I do use Josie Maran Argan Oil so I decided to give it a try. It has been about two months and I don&#x27;t bruise anymore. I still can&#x27;t believe it!  I start with the Argan oil then finish with the lotion every morning. Just a miracle! It actually works.</li>
            <li> Lordy, this stuff smells to high heaven. It&#x27;s so strong and so pervasive I can&#x27;t use it without my allergies going into overdrive, eyes watering, sneezing, nose running allergies - and I only applied the lotion to one arm. It may not have added fragrance, but the odor from all those natural ingredients adds up to a rather unbearable experience for someone sensitive to strong smells.</li>
