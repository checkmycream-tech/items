    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I also noted that even though this product is in the EWG database, it is not in the Best Sport &amp; Beach category, and for that level of protection I would recommend a product from that list.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has the best rating for safety in sunscreens from the ewg.org website.</li>
            <li>This one has a very good score.  </li>
            <li>Great under makeup</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of protecting my skin from the sum but still allowing me tto get a great tan.</li>
            <li>Works great, not greasy, protects well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair, and the discoloration has still not faded all the way (3 months)</li>
            <li>I loved the texture--</li>
            <li>I used to love this sunscreen because is went on beautifully without leaving any residue or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a body lotion with a higher SPF and this one is great!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Works great, easy to apply and,</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer also.</li>
            <li>Feels nice when put on.</li>
            <li>and I went through about two bottles a month and didn&#x27;t even mind the price because it worked so well, it&#x27;s vegan, and it doesn&#x27;t contain any controversial ingredients.</li>
            <li>Excellent to use on sensitive skin, even the face.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly and is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>As a lotion, I thought it was very nice, although more than I need in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I really love the products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores like the Burt&#x27;s Bees daily SPF 15 lotion I was using.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>When I went to apply my latest purchase, it was a thicker paste, not like the lotion it used to be.</li>
            <li>I think it could be an excellent body lotion if you were not going to be outside.</li>
            <li>But if you are using it for sun protection, and you plan to be out over 30 minutes, I would put something more reliable on top.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a recorded message asking you to return it for a better batch.  </li>
            <li>It was the PERFECT sunscreen, going on smoothly and clear.  </li>
            <li>I enthusiastically converted many friends and family, as well.  </li>
            <li>way to improve this product it to offer it for free!</li>
            <li>best coverage- no white streaks or caking.</li>
            <li>Okay, check the rating on the EWG website for safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is pretty good</li>
            <li>Spreads easily</li>
            <li>It is important to me that my sunscreens are safe and chemical free, and yet not sticky or greasy or too thick/heavy.  </li>
            <li>It has worked well for me and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Good SPF, Organic ingredients, great texture and easily penetrates and vanishes, not oily, nice packaging, and its enough to last you a month or two</li>
            <li>That worked fine, and my skin did not show any effects from the sun.</li>
            <li>It no longer goes on smoothly and leaves a residue on my face.</li>
            <li>It is light and creamy and absorbs like skin lotion.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product</li>
            <li>I have sensitive fair skin</li>
            <li>With sensitive and fair skin, I have used this sunscreen for years.  </li>
            <li>Both have an SPF of 30, and it is my understanding that both give full spectrum (UVA/UVB) protection.</li>
            <li>It was still cool and cloudy a lot of the time, and I was wearing shirts and hats.</li>
            <li>My face is also now very dry, so I don&#x27;t think even the moisturizer in this product is very effective.</li>
            <li>The products are light, easy to apply and do not leave a white residue as many of the zinc oxide products do.</li>
            <li>Highly ranked on EWG&#x27;s safe list.  </li>
            <li>I started off using a regular sunscreen, the kind you can buy at any drug store.</li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen because it has all natural safe ingredients, is a very high SPF, goes on relatively clear (no whitish residue), and is very light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>When I first got on Amazon to read the reviews I saw the comments in the 1,2,3-star reviews about the spotty protection this sunblock offered and honestly thought people weren&#x27;t applying enough.  </li>
            <li>I have used the previous formula of this product for a long time and it was the best sunscreen I had ever used.</li>
            <li>DeVita used to be my favorite physical sunblock.  </li>
            <li>BUT my latest tube is completely different though the ingredients are identical.  </li>
            <li>I understand that formulations change, however, I feel that Devita &amp; Nutricity are responsible for making changes known to the consumer before the purchase.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t burn, but got very brown on my arms.</li>
            <li>It has a bit too much on a sunscreeny smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It was very sunny, and I needed sun protection.</li>
            <li>This lotion almost immediately disappears into the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t always take all the zinc oxide with it if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I not only slathered this on, but layered the Devita 50 spf professional face cream on top and used both products all over my body.</li>
            <li>weeks and multiple uses later, I have to agree that this is not an effective sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more from an SPF30 sunscreen, particularly one that costs as much as this one does.</li>
            <li>It went on just like a lotion, not a thick white paste like most natural sun care products.</li>
            <li>Definitely too rich for my face anytime but winter.</li>
            <li>Decent sun protection.</li>
            <li>I was told that they have changed suppliers to get the micronized zinc oxide and the formula that I received in the new bottle is the formula they will be using from now on.</li>
            <li>I called Devita and like another reviewer said, they have changed zinc suppliers and it didn&#x27;t sound like returning to the previous supplier</li>
            <li>It spreads evenly and goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>The Solar Body Block and the Solar Protective Moisturizer are very similiar, with the Body Block being recommended for the entire body.</li>
            <li>(Photo on Amazon is completely inaccurate, even before)  </li>
            <li>(If you get it near your eyes, this formula stings my eyes.)</li>
            <li>Similar scoring items I have tried leave me looking ready for kabuki theater or just too greasy.  </li>
            <li>My arms are actually red in splotches, so apparently some zinc oxide made it to certain areas but not others.</li>
            <li>it is more like the typical physical blocker sunscreens, going on white and crumbly/flaky, leaving a gross-feeling coating on your skin and hands.  </li>
            <li>This is my new daily sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>Especially at the prices &#x27;natural&#x27; products charge!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub in at all and the more you try to rub it in, the worse it gets.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect due to bad reviews, but I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It felt like fancy face lotion, barely stung my eyes, and was absolutely sheer without using nanoparticles.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight, no odor, not filled with the usual poisons.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>This goes on fairly well, however, I prefer their previous formula which was less moisturizing and leaves less of the slight white film.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very slight smell but not much and way less than most sunscreens.</li>

            <li> it dried clear and was not oily--</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: None, as long as you use it on your body and not your face.</li>
            <li> May need to be reapplied because it does not seem to be a stable SPF for long.</li>
            <li> I still use hats and monitor how long I am in the sun.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was only zinc oxide, which I think is safer  and other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Can be worn alone or under moisturizer if skin is dry</li>
            <li> This is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> example, today I was only outside for an hour, during the late afternoon</li>
            <li> I walk daily in the year round California sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using the solar body block for several years as my everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> No thanks, I&#x27;m on to BurnOut.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful to protect my face because of rosacea and this product has given me 100% protection.</li>
            <li> I spent much less time in the sun that day, but the uncovered parts of my face are all sunburned and splotchy.</li>
            <li> Every brand I tried had a thick texture and/or resisted absorption and leaving a white residue along with a feeling that my skin was coated with something I needed to wash off.  </li>
            <li> It blends in well enough and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a thick white paste, I would use my Badger sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The one down side is that it is so moisturizing that it feels slimy when you get in the pool</li>
            <li> The Protective Moisturizer is slightly thinner and recommended for the face.</li>
            <li> Because it dried translucent there&#x27;s no way of knowing,</li>
            <li> I use it on my face every day because it is less expensive than the facial</li>
            <li> A little bit hard to rub it in all the way.</li>
            <li> I am wary of their claims that everyone seems to have received the same off batch.</li>
            <li> The new formula is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately something in the formula for this sunscreen has changed.</li>
            <li> Devita absorbs into skin, softens skin, does not cause breakouts (and man can I break out), does not leave the uncomfortable film on skin.  </li>
            <li> My friend in NYC swears by it for humid summers, it stays on skin without uncomfortable build up.</li>
            <li> but it is useless.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid the brown spots are here to stay.     </li>
            <li> Nor does it have an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I called DeVita to ask about this, because I thought maybe I just got some from a bad batch.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> and I like De Vita product, but not am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used the previous formula of this product for a long time and it was the best sunscreen I had ever used. I have sensitive fair skin and I went through about two bottles a month and didn&#x27;t even mind the price because it worked so well, it&#x27;s vegan, and it doesn&#x27;t contain any controversial ingredients. The new formula is absolutely terrible. I&#x27;m returning the bottle I just purchased and will not be buying this again. It doesn&#x27;t rub in at all and the more you try to rub it in, the worse it gets. It leaves a thick, sticky, white residue on your skin that just dries and rolls right off (see photos). As a result, it provides no sun protection and isn&#x27;t even usable as a moisturizer. I called DeVita to ask about this, because I thought maybe I just got some from a bad batch. I was told that they have changed suppliers to get the micronized zinc oxide and the formula that I received in the new bottle is the formula they will be using from now on. That&#x27;s unfortunate. It used to be a five-star product. Now, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> The product I received was different .  It was DeVita sunscreen just not this one .  No shea butter.  I kept it because I need sunscreen and I like De Vita product, but not am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I used to love this sunscreen because is went on beautifully without leaving any residue or causing breakouts. I could use this on my body and face. I was a dedicated consumer of this product. Unfortunately something in the formula for this sunscreen has changed. It no longer goes on smoothly and leaves a residue on my face. Big drop in quality.</li>
            <li> I began trying zinc based sunscreens after I began reading about the dangers of sunscreen.  Every brand I tried had a thick texture and/or resisted absorption and leaving a white residue along with a feeling that my skin was coated with something I needed to wash off.  I found this brand and have been using it ever since. It is light and creamy and absorbs like skin lotion. Nor does it have an unpleasant odor.  I walk daily in the year round California sun. I have to be very careful to protect my face because of rosacea and this product has given me 100% protection.</li>
            <li> This works well for me. I am not getting burned. It blends in well enough and isn&#x27;t too thick. There&#x27;s a very slight smell but not much and way less than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. I use it on my face every day because it is less expensive than the facial one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Spreads easily&lt;br /&gt;- Dries matte&lt;br /&gt;- Great under makeup&lt;br /&gt;- Can be worn alone or under moisturizer if skin is dry&lt;br /&gt;- Isn&#x27;t white&lt;br /&gt;- EWG hazard score of 1</li>
            <li> Ever since I learned about the DeVita sunscreen products (the Solar Body Block and the Solar Protective Moisturizer) from my daughter, I&#x27;ve become a faithful fan. I really love the products. It is important to me that my sunscreens are safe and chemical free, and yet not sticky or greasy or too thick/heavy.  The products are light, easy to apply and do not leave a white residue as many of the zinc oxide products do. The Solar Body Block and the Solar Protective Moisturizer are very similiar, with the Body Block being recommended for the entire body. The Protective Moisturizer is slightly thinner and recommended for the face. Both have an SPF of 30, and it is my understanding that both give full spectrum (UVA/UVB) protection.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had.  Goes on very smoothly and is not greasy at all.  I wear it alone or with foundation over the sunscreen.  Fabulous.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This goes on fairly well, however, I prefer their previous formula which was less moisturizing and leaves less of the slight white film.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily sunscreen!  It feels like a high-quality lotion and is totally invisible.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores like the Burt&#x27;s Bees daily SPF 15 lotion I was using.  The one down side is that it is so moisturizing that it feels slimy when you get in the pool so I wouldn&#x27;t use it when swimming.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect due to bad reviews, but I love this lotion.  It spreads evenly and goes on clear.  No burns, even after swimming.  Highly ranked on EWG&#x27;s safe list.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I feel protected and it rubs in thoroughly.  I never feel greasy or pasty.  Will continue to buy it each year!</li>
            <li> I have been using the solar body block for several years as my everyday moisturizer. It went on just like a lotion, not a thick white paste like most natural sun care products. When I went to apply my latest purchase, it was a thicker paste, not like the lotion it used to be. A check at the Devita website verified that there had been a change in the way the lotion is made.&lt;br /&gt;The seller, Nutricity, is looking into it, so I&#x27;ll wait to see what the outcome is. I understand that formulations change, however, I feel that Devita &amp; Nutricity are responsible for making changes known to the consumer before the purchase. Especially at the prices &#x27;natural&#x27; products charge!&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to use a thick white paste, I would use my Badger sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I picked this product because of the EWG report. As a lotion, I thought it was very nice, although more than I need in hot, humid weather. Definitely too rich for my face anytime but winter. But as protection, I would NOT rely on it. We went on vacation this Spring and it did not protect me.     It was still cool and cloudy a lot of the time, and I was wearing shirts and hats. I not only slathered this on, but layered the Devita 50 spf professional face cream on top and used both products all over my body. I didn&#x27;t burn, but got very brown on my arms. And I didn&#x27;t get brown as in a tan, but brown as in splotchy sun spots. I&#x27;m fair, and the discoloration has still not faded all the way (3 months) and I&#x27;m afraid the brown spots are here to stay.     I think it could be an excellent body lotion if you were not going to be outside. But if you are using it for sun protection, and you plan to be out over 30 minutes, I would put something more reliable on top.     I also noted that even though this product is in the EWG database, it is not in the Best Sport &amp; Beach category, and for that level of protection I would recommend a product from that list.</li>
            <li> DeVita used to be my favorite physical sunblock.  It felt like fancy face lotion, barely stung my eyes, and was absolutely sheer without using nanoparticles.  Now, it&#x27;s terrible.  The zinc is not sheer and goes on splotchy and white.  The zinc globs into white pieces when you try to rub it in.  If you call in, they have an option for you to choose regarding the formula change/issues with consistency.  It&#x27;s a recorded message asking you to return it for a better batch.  No thanks, I&#x27;m on to BurnOut.  I am wary of their claims that everyone seems to have received the same off batch.</li>
            <li> With sensitive and fair skin, I have used this sunscreen for years.  It was the PERFECT sunscreen, going on smoothly and clear.  I enthusiastically converted many friends and family, as well.  BUT my latest tube is completely different though the ingredients are identical.  Also, they have changed the name to \\&quot;Solar Body Moisturizer\\&quot; from \\&quot;Solar Body Block.\\&quot;  (an FDA thing i guess)  (Photo on Amazon is completely inaccurate, even before)  NOW... it is more like the typical physical blocker sunscreens, going on white and crumbly/flaky, leaving a gross-feeling coating on your skin and hands.  I called Devita and like another reviewer said, they have changed zinc suppliers and it didn&#x27;t sound like returning to the previous supplier was an option.  This is a huge disappointment.  i will be returning this tube and warning my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, no odor, not filled with the usual poisons.&lt;br /&gt;Only way to improve this product it to offer it for free!</li>
            <li> PROS: I like this sunscreen because it has all natural safe ingredients, is a very high SPF, goes on relatively clear (no whitish residue), and is very light and non-greasy. This sunscreen has the best rating for safety in sunscreens from the ewg.org website. Because it is not greasy at all, it can be used on oily skin and can be reapplied and reapplied throughout the day without building up grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None, as long as you use it on your body and not your face. (If you get it near your eyes, this formula stings my eyes.) May need to be reapplied because it does not seem to be a stable SPF for long.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Works great, easy to apply and, even though it contains zinc, it only makes me a tiny bit paler.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of protecting my skin from the sum but still allowing me tto get a great tan. Nice moisturizer also.</li>
            <li> best coverage- no white streaks or caking. I&#x27;ve never burned with it but I am also not a sun bather. I still use hats and monitor how long I am in the sun. Excellent to use on sensitive skin, even the face.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body lotion with a higher SPF and this one is great! It has a bit too much on a sunscreeny smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. It doesn&#x27;t settle onto the skin well. You get white patches all of your face. The product also balls up as you rub it in. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Good SPF, Organic ingredients, great texture and easily penetrates and vanishes, not oily, nice packaging, and its enough to last you a month or two</li>
            <li> Okay, check the rating on the EWG website for safe sunscreens.  This one has a very good score.  Similar scoring items I have tried leave me looking ready for kabuki theater or just too greasy.  Devita absorbs into skin, softens skin, does not cause breakouts (and man can I break out), does not leave the uncomfortable film on skin.  I use it on myself and my kids.  I have also recommended to everyone I know.  My friend in NYC swears by it for humid summers, it stays on skin without uncomfortable build up.</li>
            <li> Feels nice when put on. A little bit hard to rub it in all the way. So some spots might stay white with the cream showing</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works great, not greasy, protects well.  Enough said!</li>
            <li> I used this suncreen one day during a ski trip. It was very sunny, and I needed sun protection. I started off using a regular sunscreen, the kind you can buy at any drug store. That worked fine, and my skin did not show any effects from the sun. One day, I decided to use the Devita sunscreen because I&#x27;m concerned about the chemicals in the regular sunscreen. I spent much less time in the sun that day, but the uncovered parts of my face are all sunburned and splotchy. I expected a lot more from an SPF30 sunscreen, particularly one that costs as much as this one does. My face is also now very dry, so I don&#x27;t think even the moisturizer in this product is very effective. Definitely stay away if you&#x27;re fair-skinned.</li>
            <li> When I first got on Amazon to read the reviews I saw the comments in the 1,2,3-star reviews about the spotty protection this sunblock offered and honestly thought people weren&#x27;t applying enough.  That&#x27;s the #1 issue with sunblock reliability-- you need to use a LOT, and OFTEN.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks and multiple uses later, I have to agree that this is not an effective sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;For example, today I was only outside for an hour, during the late afternoon (3:30-4:30), I applied a THICK application of Devita on my arms and chest and I am now very, very burned.  My arms are actually red in splotches, so apparently some zinc oxide made it to certain areas but not others. Because it dried translucent there&#x27;s no way of knowing, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I loved the texture-- it dried clear and was not oily-- but it is useless.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is pretty good but it did not come in the bottle shown in the photo. Decent sun protection.</li>
            <li> This lotion almost immediately disappears into the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t always take all the zinc oxide with it if you put too much on.  Overall this is a great product</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was only zinc oxide, which I think is safer  and other sunscreens.  It has worked well for me and is easy to apply.</li>
