            <li>excellent product.  </li>
            <li>and it the best addition I have made to my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>I have battled with breakouts for 10 years or so, and after trying everything the beauty aisle at the store had to offer, I settled on a benzoyl peroxide-containing that seemed to work the best.  </li>

            <li>Great item that seems to be out of stock in my area.</li>

            <li>The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I had heard that rosewater was good if you were looking to achieve even skin tone or even just to freshen up</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Just as good as thayer&#x27;s toners.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked or felt this good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>I read so much good reviews about burt bee rosewater and glycerin toner, so i went to target and got a bottle....</li>
            <li>But it smells good.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all of the reviews, no complaints, product smells good and tones.</li>
            <li>I was impressed because I clean my face well.  </li>
            <li>I especially love the fresh rosewater smell.</li>
            <li>This refreshing toner is great for preping my skin for makeup as well as removing any remaining dirt or oil before bed.</li>
            <li>Also I have no scars from the infection and its so nice and smells so good</li>
            <li>I love this toner!</li>
            <li>It effectively removes the residue from my cleanser and makeup and it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>that I use 3 times a week and follow up with Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin and smells so good</li>
            <li>Really a nice toner.  </li>
            <li>beg to differ that rose water is known for it&#x27;s astringent property.</li>
            <li>For years I had been using rose water to soothe my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product and received really fast.</li>
            <li>The Witch Hazel smells nice</li>
            <li>However, here is my experience;  It does have the rose smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>does a nice job for an over the counter product.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin, great for improving skin health, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it is not my favorite, but I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the rose smell.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Toner!!!</li>
            <li>Having tried many others, this is by far the best toner!  </li>
            <li>This is a very mild but effective toner.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my face but leaves it feeling awesome.  </li>
            <li>Some people like the feeling, but it is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is great, very old rose perfume type.</li>
            <li>and I notice a huge difference using it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toner.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially for the winter.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Another great product from Burt&#x27;s Bees and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>Made me wonder whether it was authentic product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more alcohol-intense than it used to be.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love refreshed my skin feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this line of products.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and continues to improve.</li>
            <li>I know my skin is getting the best care possible.</li>
            <li>Probably much better for oily or acne skin?</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>but do they use more \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; to preserve longer life?</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toner.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and after making the switch from witch hazel years ago</li>
            <li>I read that some love it</li>
            <li>That thrills me as most things cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>However, my skin feels soft and smooth after applying this toner and it smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even carried in most stores in the Bay Area either,</li>
            <li>/firms my skin up a bit :)</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>I love the results too.</li>
            <li>the cover inside should be better if is a plastic one with a hole, the one time use paper cover inside easy to be broekn and flow out</li>
            <li>The product is very natural too, which is great.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>Works great and is all natural.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin like most toners and it has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>The glass bottle is lovely, but not travel friendly.</li>
            <li>but this is nice--not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It does smell a bit strong, however the smell does not stay on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is to strong</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best products I have ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t so impressed with it compared to the neutrogena toner I had been using prior</li>
            <li>B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream ]] is aloe vera based exactly like the Burts Bees but is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I acutally put it in a spray bottle and lightly spritz my skin after cleansing and pat it in.</li>
            <li>time i will buy something alcohol free though.</li>
            <li>I will never go back, this is just all around great stuff.</li>
            <li>Worth the $, Burts Bees doesnt disappoint. :)</li>
            <li>The tonic smells so sweet and is wonderful to use in the morning and when it&#x27;s hot outside to refresh my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees old product of rosewater and glycerin toner</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, is natural, and does the job.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, yet I can tell leaves my skin very clean!    </li>
            <li>I read great reviews but was semi-skeptical since I have sensitive, acne-prone, oily skin (sounds like a dream, right..?)</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it!!!!</li>
            <li>(Btw, i think this bottle i got is very fresh, did not sit on shelf for over 5 yrs....)</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin refreshed and clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil my skin produces.</li>
            <li>it is true that it&#x27;s paraben free....</li>
            <li>I use this on my clients when I do a rose themed facial and they love it.</li>
            <li>Little did I know that alcohol denat fits between those two in the list of ingredients, which means this toner is incredibly drying.</li>
            <li>It helps to clean your face, that is for sure, nut it has too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>probably my favorite part of this product is how fresh your face smells when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the more gentle brands on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural too which is nice.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, clear and smells great.</li>
            <li>item received quickly.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly with no after smell.  </li>
            <li>But Amazon quickly sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li>Along with the repair serum and a mild soap (from another company)</li>
            <li>Great scent and rejuvenating feel...but not worth the break out</li>
            <li>I think this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would be nice to use as a way to freshen up later in the afternoon, but</li>
            <li>I recently started making my own oatmeal, milk &amp; honey mask</li>
            <li>When you open the bottle you wanna smell a bunch of rose</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most toners irritate it...</li>
            <li>If it flops, then back to making my own.</li>
            <li>but after some time I came to realize this is much better for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Some said that it irritates sensitive skin, I have fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The product has a really really pleasant rose smell, only used it for few days, so I&#x27;m still waiting for it to work, but it feels cool when I apply it...</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>As others have said, this really does smell fresh and clean....</li>
            <li>But this product may not be right for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right.  </li>
            <li>This toner is amazing, especially in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>i personally think that this kind of product should be bought after smelling it first at a mall.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is it does not leave your skin dry or irritated, which is a HUGE bonus for someone with my type of skin.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is the main ingredient and leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and tried it, and it actually works incredibly well on my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>last rose water toner was perfect sadly</li>
            <li>I am not new to using rose water.</li>
            <li>it is also very gently on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a cleanser mixed with a very light lotion, which seems to hydrate without leaving a sheen on my skin.</li>
            <li>Use it on a daily basis, leaves my skin feeling great specially when you use it with other Burt&#x27;s bees products.</li>
            <li>Because Burt&#x27; Bees has been sold to the Clorox Company, they have chosen to place product in a petroleum concentrated vessel, that is, a plastic bottle; unfortunately, I do not want to spend twice to three times the price to get a glass bottle overseas</li>
            <li>*cough*) from my skincare routine</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>While the packaging is pretty, it&#x27;s not that practical.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first issue I&#x27;ve had with the Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; Skincare line.</li>
            <li>Bert&#x27;s Bees never fails.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but I already see my skin looking more dewey.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to real, true, pure rosewater for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes your face so soft and has no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I rarely wear make up, but when I do, I think i&#x27;ll have more confidence about getting it all off my face with Burts than the other stuff.</li>
            <li>I have average to dry sensitive skin, and this is the best toner I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even take note of the brand name because i thought it will be easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Still sticking with my earlier review,</li>
            <li>I give this two stars because I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really help with even skin tone or controlling oil throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>and I just wanted to say that I didn&#x27;t really like the smell as much as i thought i would.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is not drying; much cheaper than products like Estee Lauder, Shiseido, etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>.dries too much.</li>
            <li>Its organic real rosewater.</li>
            <li>Otherwise - big bottle, comfortable use, smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>it smells too much alcohol in it....</li>
            <li>Actually,  somehow it makes my face feel smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>Wayyyyyy too much alcohol in this toner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely buying this again.</li>
            <li>good for cleaning dry feet or dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels dramatically less stripped of moisture each time I wash, and the smell is so light and fresh</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and found that the first ingredient in this product was alcohol.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel very pampered (and I&#x27;m not typically very girly, so that&#x27;s odd for me to admit :P)  </li>
            <li>so I use less on more of my face.</li>
            <li>but you smell just a bottle of vodka.the main ingredient is alcohol.</li>
            <li>This Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosewater Toner product has softened my facial skin tremendously...</li>
            <li>I also use it in the morning when I need something to wake me up; it feels refreshing to dab a little under your eyes or on your cheeks.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and is in such a pretty bottle that I plan to keep afterwards!</li>
            <li>I prefer to make my own so BB&#x27;s is really gonna have to stand up to some serious standards.</li>
            <li>but this does no such thing, leaving it calm.  </li>
            <li>(it is not readily available at many drugstores in my area).  </li>
            <li>When I opened it, i thought it was a bit overwhelming, but when you apply it to a cotton ball and on your face, it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li>I usually do not like rosewater scents</li>
            <li>Funny enough my face is quite oily</li>
            <li>I have normal to sensitive skin, am 27, and I use the toner at night, after washing my face.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t expect it to have such high % of Alcohol!!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin that is also very sensitive to harsh chemicals and dries out easily.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling fresh, but the major downfall is it without a doubt made me breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not particularly good about washing my face daily, I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and I&#x27;m not really into strict skin regimens, but I&#x27;ve been pretty good about sticking with this stuff, because it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>This particular toner even though it is part rosewater, it left my skin super dry after using it for 2 days.</li>
            <li>The lower alcohol content is important; but it is not alcohol free unfortunately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and by no means have \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; but decided to try this toner anyway</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>Because of that I&#x27;ve been working toward eliminating alcohol completely from my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this so far 4 times.</li>
            <li>It was like walking into a funeral home, or an old ladies&#x27; tea party.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product not only to anyone with oily skin, but anyone who prefers natural skin care.</li>
            <li>the skin feels a little bit tight, but when I am in a warm place, I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have naturally overly dry skin in the first place, the Burts is gonna work fine but for serious dryness or peeling/flaking, try to stray away from anything with alcohol.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive or normal to dry skin, please please please do not come near this product.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, even with the addition of alcohol, and removes any last traces of makeup/dead skin that may be left after cleansing (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees&lt;br /&gt;Orange Essence Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s only been a couple of days since I started using this product, so I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone with a review at this point saying it worked miracles and fixed every skin issue on my face.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to remove additional dirt and oil that my cleanser leaves behind, yet gentle enough to avoid stinging and drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>For use as a post shave treatment for sensitive skin, I found that this product lacked the cooling qualities necessary and the ingredients needed to soothe and treat flaking facial skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>Anyone with dry and sensitive skin should stay away from this.</li>
            <li>My extremely sensitive, dry skin loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>A little too much alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 15 (10 years) and have spent hundreds &amp; hundreds of dollars on dermatology visits and prescription topical creams &amp; gels in order to clear my acne up</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This toner is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my face, and I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> 100% recommend it, one of the best Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  </li>
            <li> and it the best addition I have made to my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> I have battled with breakouts for 10 years or so, and after trying everything the beauty aisle at the store had to offer, I settled on a benzoyl peroxide-containing that seemed to work the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found Burts Bees Rosewater and Glycerin Toner on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Burts Bees is a great brand!</li>
            <li> It is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> This toner is very good.</li>
            <li> It smells great, cleans my skin wonderfully, and leaves me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Smells great, good quantity, and has my skin looking the best it has in years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t burn like some others, makes my comlexion beautiful and smells so</li>
            <li> It smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Smells great also.</li>
            <li> I tried this rose water toner on a whim, and it&#x27;s been the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Great item that seems to be out of stock in my area.</li>
            <li> Works great, but smell is overpowering.  </li>
            <li> two months now and find it has helped my skin a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great service.</li>
            <li> With this toner, my dry/combination skin is happy.</li>
            <li> Their toner is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful and refreshing toner.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I had heard that rosewater was good if you were looking to achieve even skin tone or even just to freshen up</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Just as good as thayer&#x27;s toners.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked or felt this good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> I read so much good reviews about burt bee rosewater and glycerin toner, so i went to target and got a bottle....</li>
            <li> But it smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all of the reviews, no complaints, product smells good and tones.</li>
            <li> I was impressed because I clean my face well.  </li>
            <li> I especially love the fresh rosewater smell.</li>
            <li> This refreshing toner is great for preping my skin for makeup as well as removing any remaining dirt or oil before bed.</li>
            <li> Also I have no scars from the infection and its so nice and smells so good</li>
            <li> I love this toner!</li>
            <li> It effectively removes the residue from my cleanser and makeup and it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> that I use 3 times a week and follow up with Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and smells so good</li>
            <li> Really a nice toner.  </li>
            <li> beg to differ that rose water is known for it&#x27;s astringent property.</li>
            <li> For years I had been using rose water to soothe my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent product and received really fast.</li>
            <li> The Witch Hazel smells nice</li>
            <li> However, here is my experience;  It does have the rose smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> does a nice job for an over the counter product.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin, great for improving skin health, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it is not my favorite, but I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the rose smell.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Toner!!!</li>
            <li> Having tried many others, this is by far the best toner!  </li>
            <li> This is a very mild but effective toner.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my face but leaves it feeling awesome.  </li>
            <li> Some people like the feeling, but it is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is great, very old rose perfume type.</li>
            <li> and I notice a huge difference using it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for the winter.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Another great product from Burt&#x27;s Bees and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Ok product.</li>
            <li> Made me wonder whether it was authentic product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot more alcohol-intense than it used to be.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I love refreshed my skin feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this line of products.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better and continues to improve.</li>
            <li> I know my skin is getting the best care possible.</li>
            <li> Probably much better for oily or acne skin?</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> but do they use more \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; to preserve longer life?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and after making the switch from witch hazel years ago</li>
            <li> I read that some love it</li>
            <li> That thrills me as most things cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> However, my skin feels soft and smooth after applying this toner and it smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even carried in most stores in the Bay Area either,</li>
            <li> /firms my skin up a bit :)</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I love the results too.</li>
            <li> the cover inside should be better if is a plastic one with a hole, the one time use paper cover inside easy to be broekn and flow out</li>
            <li> The product is very natural too, which is great.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> Works great and is all natural.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin like most toners and it has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is lovely, but not travel friendly.</li>
            <li> but this is nice--not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a bit strong, however the smell does not stay on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is to strong</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best products I have ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t so impressed with it compared to the neutrogena toner I had been using prior</li>
            <li> B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream ]] is aloe vera based exactly like the Burts Bees but is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I acutally put it in a spray bottle and lightly spritz my skin after cleansing and pat it in.</li>
            <li> time i will buy something alcohol free though.</li>
            <li> I will never go back, this is just all around great stuff.</li>
            <li> Worth the $, Burts Bees doesnt disappoint. :)</li>
            <li> The tonic smells so sweet and is wonderful to use in the morning and when it&#x27;s hot outside to refresh my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees old product of rosewater and glycerin toner</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, is natural, and does the job.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle, yet I can tell leaves my skin very clean!    </li>
            <li> I read great reviews but was semi-skeptical since I have sensitive, acne-prone, oily skin (sounds like a dream, right..?)</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it!!!!</li>
            <li> (Btw, i think this bottle i got is very fresh, did not sit on shelf for over 5 yrs....)</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin refreshed and clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil my skin produces.</li>
            <li> it is true that it&#x27;s paraben free....</li>
            <li> I use this on my clients when I do a rose themed facial and they love it.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that alcohol denat fits between those two in the list of ingredients, which means this toner is incredibly drying.</li>
            <li> It helps to clean your face, that is for sure, nut it has too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> probably my favorite part of this product is how fresh your face smells when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the more gentle brands on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural too which is nice.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft, clear and smells great.</li>
            <li> item received quickly.</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly with no after smell.  </li>
            <li> But Amazon quickly sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li> Along with the repair serum and a mild soap (from another company)</li>
            <li> Great scent and rejuvenating feel...but not worth the break out</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it would be nice to use as a way to freshen up later in the afternoon, but</li>
            <li> I recently started making my own oatmeal, milk &amp; honey mask</li>
            <li> When you open the bottle you wanna smell a bunch of rose</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most toners irritate it...</li>
            <li> If it flops, then back to making my own.</li>
            <li> but after some time I came to realize this is much better for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Some said that it irritates sensitive skin, I have fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The product has a really really pleasant rose smell, only used it for few days, so I&#x27;m still waiting for it to work, but it feels cool when I apply it...</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> As others have said, this really does smell fresh and clean....</li>
            <li> But this product may not be right for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right.  </li>
            <li> This toner is amazing, especially in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li> i personally think that this kind of product should be bought after smelling it first at a mall.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is it does not leave your skin dry or irritated, which is a HUGE bonus for someone with my type of skin.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is the main ingredient and leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and tried it, and it actually works incredibly well on my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> last rose water toner was perfect sadly</li>
            <li> I am not new to using rose water.</li>
            <li> it is also very gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a cleanser mixed with a very light lotion, which seems to hydrate without leaving a sheen on my skin.</li>
            <li> Use it on a daily basis, leaves my skin feeling great specially when you use it with other Burt&#x27;s bees products.</li>
            <li> Because Burt&#x27; Bees has been sold to the Clorox Company, they have chosen to place product in a petroleum concentrated vessel, that is, a plastic bottle; unfortunately, I do not want to spend twice to three times the price to get a glass bottle overseas</li>
            <li> *cough*) from my skincare routine</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> While the packaging is pretty, it&#x27;s not that practical.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first issue I&#x27;ve had with the Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; Skincare line.</li>
            <li> Bert&#x27;s Bees never fails.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but I already see my skin looking more dewey.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to real, true, pure rosewater for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes your face so soft and has no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I rarely wear make up, but when I do, I think i&#x27;ll have more confidence about getting it all off my face with Burts than the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have average to dry sensitive skin, and this is the best toner I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even take note of the brand name because i thought it will be easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Still sticking with my earlier review,</li>
            <li> I give this two stars because I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really help with even skin tone or controlling oil throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> and I just wanted to say that I didn&#x27;t really like the smell as much as i thought i would.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is not drying; much cheaper than products like Estee Lauder, Shiseido, etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> .dries too much.</li>
            <li> Its organic real rosewater.</li>
            <li> Otherwise - big bottle, comfortable use, smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> it smells too much alcohol in it....</li>
            <li> Actually,  somehow it makes my face feel smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy too much alcohol in this toner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely buying this again.</li>
            <li> good for cleaning dry feet or dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels dramatically less stripped of moisture each time I wash, and the smell is so light and fresh</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and found that the first ingredient in this product was alcohol.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel very pampered (and I&#x27;m not typically very girly, so that&#x27;s odd for me to admit :P)  </li>
            <li> so I use less on more of my face.</li>
            <li> but you smell just a bottle of vodka.the main ingredient is alcohol.</li>
            <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosewater Toner product has softened my facial skin tremendously...</li>
            <li> I also use it in the morning when I need something to wake me up; it feels refreshing to dab a little under your eyes or on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and is in such a pretty bottle that I plan to keep afterwards!</li>
            <li> I prefer to make my own so BB&#x27;s is really gonna have to stand up to some serious standards.</li>
            <li> but this does no such thing, leaving it calm.  </li>
            <li> (it is not readily available at many drugstores in my area).  </li>
            <li> When I opened it, i thought it was a bit overwhelming, but when you apply it to a cotton ball and on your face, it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I usually do not like rosewater scents</li>
            <li> Funny enough my face is quite oily</li>
            <li> I have normal to sensitive skin, am 27, and I use the toner at night, after washing my face.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect it to have such high % of Alcohol!!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin that is also very sensitive to harsh chemicals and dries out easily.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling fresh, but the major downfall is it without a doubt made me breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly good about washing my face daily, I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and I&#x27;m not really into strict skin regimens, but I&#x27;ve been pretty good about sticking with this stuff, because it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> This particular toner even though it is part rosewater, it left my skin super dry after using it for 2 days.</li>
            <li> The lower alcohol content is important; but it is not alcohol free unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and by no means have \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; but decided to try this toner anyway</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Because of that I&#x27;ve been working toward eliminating alcohol completely from my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this so far 4 times.</li>
            <li> It was like walking into a funeral home, or an old ladies&#x27; tea party.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product not only to anyone with oily skin, but anyone who prefers natural skin care.</li>
            <li> the skin feels a little bit tight, but when I am in a warm place, I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have naturally overly dry skin in the first place, the Burts is gonna work fine but for serious dryness or peeling/flaking, try to stray away from anything with alcohol.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive or normal to dry skin, please please please do not come near this product.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, even with the addition of alcohol, and removes any last traces of makeup/dead skin that may be left after cleansing (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees&lt;br /&gt;Orange Essence Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s only been a couple of days since I started using this product, so I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone with a review at this point saying it worked miracles and fixed every skin issue on my face.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to remove additional dirt and oil that my cleanser leaves behind, yet gentle enough to avoid stinging and drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> For use as a post shave treatment for sensitive skin, I found that this product lacked the cooling qualities necessary and the ingredients needed to soothe and treat flaking facial skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Anyone with dry and sensitive skin should stay away from this.</li>
            <li> My extremely sensitive, dry skin loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> A little too much alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 15 (10 years) and have spent hundreds &amp; hundreds of dollars on dermatology visits and prescription topical creams &amp; gels in order to clear my acne up</li>
            <li> I used Clinique clarifying lotion for a long time and they have different numbered bottles for different types of skin.</li>
            <li> To cut a long story short, I threw it within a week of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find where I live, apparently it sells out and takes a while to get back in.  </li>
            <li> The alcohol in the mixture only dries out dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to dry out a lot, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a couple weeks and have found that it doesnt dry out my skin quite as bad as my previous toner which is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not, it&#x27;s practically almost like liquid watered down soap, it makes me question whether this product has real rosewater or not.</li>
            <li> comes in a glass bottle so the first shipment was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks now, and my skin is clearer than it used to be, and much less dry.</li>
            <li> Toners typically make my face red after use</li>
            <li> I use several Burt&#x27;s Bees products and so this was a little bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li> I actually use this everyday, twice a day</li>
            <li> Another confusion is customers really do not know whatnot expect from a product labelled \\&quot;toner\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> i  don&#x27;t know why people give 5 or 4 star for this such a waste product.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit long for shipping, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner.  Having tried many others, this is by far the best toner!  It does not dry out my skin like most toners and it has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I give this two stars because I really wanted to like it. I used it for about a week. It left my skin feeling fresh, but the major downfall is it without a doubt made me breakout. Great scent and rejuvenating feel...but not worth the break out I had to try to recover from.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin that is also very sensitive to harsh chemicals and dries out easily. This product is gentle, yet I can tell leaves my skin very clean!    Smells great, too!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  I had heard that rosewater was good if you were looking to achieve even skin tone or even just to freshen up so I thought I&#x27;d go for a Burt&#x27;s Bees product. As others have said, this really does smell fresh and clean.... probably my favorite part of this product is how fresh your face smells when you first put it on.  Although after a few weeks of using this every morning I have noticed nothing... it didn&#x27;t really help with even skin tone or controlling oil throughout the day.  Perhaps it would be nice to use as a way to freshen up later in the afternoon, but even so I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle product...</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it twice daily. My face feels so refreshed after using it. I also like the glass bottles that it comes in..Not many products come in glass containers anymore. Very cool.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for the winter.  I have average to dry sensitive skin, and this is the best toner I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees old product of rosewater and glycerin toner but it works.  I may be trying something else next time.</li>
            <li> The product has a really really pleasant rose smell, only used it for few days, so I&#x27;m still waiting for it to work, but it feels cool when I apply it... :) Hope it fix my face..</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, slightly dry skin. This toner is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my face, and I use it morning and night. I apply it after cleansing my skin, and it leave my face feeling cleaner and slightly tighter. I&#x27;ve had no breakouts since I began using this product. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the only toner I use anymore (this one along with the tomato one). It is great for sensitive skin, great for improving skin health, and smells amazing. It&#x27;s a little expensive but it lasts a while and is gentle enough to be used every day. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> i personally think that this kind of product should be bought after smelling it first at a mall. It is such a subjective matter and I just wanted to say that I didn&#x27;t really like the smell as much as i thought i would.</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful and refreshing toner. I love the rose smell. It effectively removes the residue from my cleanser and makeup and it does not irritate my skin at all. Another great product from Burt&#x27;s Bees and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Because Burt&#x27; Bees has been sold to the Clorox Company, they have chosen to place product in a petroleum concentrated vessel, that is, a plastic bottle; unfortunately, I do not want to spend twice to three times the price to get a glass bottle overseas so I have to support the Clorox company if I wish to continue to use the product.  The product seems not to have been changed, according to how it tones up my skin and cleans the collected oils but since Clorox produces poison for the environment, I am not sure whether they have not made a change in the formula unless I analyze it in a lab.</li>
            <li> Ok product. Packaging is terrible with tag attached in a weird place. Made me wonder whether it was authentic product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I went from using $100 a month in expensive facial cleansers and ran out and they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.  I researched this product and it lived up to it&#x27;s reviews.  Smells great, good quantity, and has my skin looking the best it has in years.  Plus, it&#x27;s not filled with a bunch of chemicals.  Witch hazel is the main ingredient and leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE ROSIES WHICH I WANTED. NOW IF I CAN ONLY FIND IT IN ROSEWATER OIL FOR MY BODY! I WOULD BE BUYING BOTH EVERY MONTH.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best products I have ever used on my skin. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 15 (10 years) and have spent hundreds &amp; hundreds of dollars on dermatology visits and prescription topical creams &amp; gels in order to clear my acne up and NOTHING has worked...until now. I recently started making my own oatmeal, milk &amp; honey mask that I use 3 times a week and follow up with Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water. I actually use this everyday, twice a day and I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil my skin produces. What I like most about this product is it does not leave your skin dry or irritated, which is a HUGE bonus for someone with my type of skin. I highly recommend this product not only to anyone with oily skin, but anyone who prefers natural skin care.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and smells so good I want to eat it! 100% recommend it, one of the best Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and by no means have \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; but decided to try this toner anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using the Burt&#x27;s Garden Tomato Toner and switched to this one for the winter months. So far so good. The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with a lot of people here- it&#x27;s a lot more alcohol-intense than it used to be. Still, I use it every night and make my husband use it on parts of his skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts. I also use it in the morning when I need something to wake me up; it feels refreshing to dab a little under your eyes or on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  it leaves my skin refreshed and clean and smooth.  I love the scent.  it is also very gently on my skin. no irritation.  Just as good as thayer&#x27;s toners.</li>
            <li> I usually do not like rosewater scents but this is nice--not too strong.  It works very well and is not drying; much cheaper than products like Estee Lauder, Shiseido, etc.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used - especially for the price.  I&#x27;m 40 years old with combination skin.  It makes my skin soft, clear and smells great.</li>
            <li> Really a nice toner.  No stinging even after exfoliating.  Just soothing, calming, and somehow manages to give a little tightening to the skin.  Smells great also.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a moisturizer. I had no idea I was buying an astringent packaged as a moisturizer and it burnt my face. To cut a long story short, I threw it within a week of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I beg to differ that rose water is known for it&#x27;s astringent property. I am not new to using rose water. For years I had been using rose water to soothe my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t know what Burt has packaged there. Another confusion is customers really do not know whatnot expect from a product labelled \\&quot;toner\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;My last rose water toner was perfect sadly I didn&#x27;t even take note of the brand name because i thought it will be easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Still sticking with my earlier review, if you have sensitive or normal to dry skin, please please please do not come near this product. It is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is very harsh on the face. Funny enough my face is quite oily so I wonder if they made this product for any skin type at all.&lt;br /&gt;Run away!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product - I have normal to sensitive skin, am 27, and I use the toner at night, after washing my face. It does smell a bit strong, however the smell does not stay on your skin. You have to put moisturizer after otherwise the skin feels a little bit tight, but when I am in a warm place, I don&#x27;t need to. The product is very natural too, which is great.</li>
            <li> I acutally put it in a spray bottle and lightly spritz my skin after cleansing and pat it in. My extremely sensitive, dry skin loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did without this product. It smells great, cleans my skin wonderfully, and leaves me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> YES!  Since I&#x27;ve eliminated harsh ingredients (*cough* benzoyl peroxide, sulfates *cough*) from my skincare routine, my entire regimen is Burt&#x27;s Bees and I&#x27;ve wanted to try this for quite some time (it is not readily available at many drugstores in my area).  I read great reviews but was semi-skeptical since I have sensitive, acne-prone, oily skin (sounds like a dream, right..?) and this contains alcohol.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now and it the best addition I have made to my skincare routine.  It is gentle, even with the addition of alcohol, and removes any last traces of makeup/dead skin that may be left after cleansing (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees&lt;br /&gt;Orange Essence Facial Cleanser. This too has transformed my skin but that&#x27;s another story).  Toners typically make my face red after use but this does no such thing, leaving it calm.  It also leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.  I use it both in the morning and evening after cleansing and before applying moisturizer. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i  don&#x27;t know why people give 5 or 4 star for this such a waste product.I paid almost  19 $ but receive a bottle of rum. IT smell disgusting .I don&#x27;t know how people use it but is s impossible to use.When you open the bottle you wanna smell a bunch of rose but you smell just a bottle of vodka.the main ingredient is alcohol. it s very bad for skin care .dries too much.I don&#x27;t think that Its organic real rosewater.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Toner!!! I have used it for years and it makes me feel so refreshed!</li>
            <li> item received quickly. Thank you.  But, smelled like rubbing alcohol, yuck.  Kept the Rosa Damascenes, and poured this one down the drain.</li>
            <li> the cover inside should be better if is a plastic one with a hole, the one time use paper cover inside easy to be broekn and flow out</li>
            <li> I have battled with breakouts for 10 years or so, and after trying everything the beauty aisle at the store had to offer, I settled on a benzoyl peroxide-containing that seemed to work the best.  I tried this rose water toner on a whim, and it&#x27;s been the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  After a week, I dared to switch away from my chemical-ridden face wash, and began using a much gentler one (which I had tried before, and after a few days the breakouts came back).  It has been two months now of using the gentler wash + this toner (and a lotion with spf 15) and I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked or felt this good.  My skin feels dramatically less stripped of moisture each time I wash, and the smell is so light and fresh it makes me feel very pampered (and I&#x27;m not typically very girly, so that&#x27;s odd for me to admit :P)  I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> For use as a post shave treatment for sensitive skin, I found that this product lacked the cooling qualities necessary and the ingredients needed to soothe and treat flaking facial skin</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and received really fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> This particular toner even though it is part rosewater, it left my skin super dry after using it for 2 days. Do not recommend it unless you have oily skin. Anyone with dry and sensitive skin should stay away from this. The alcohol in the mixture only dries out dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great item that seems to be out of stock in my area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found Burts Bees Rosewater and Glycerin Toner on Amazon!  It&#x27;s been hard to find where I live, apparently it sells out and takes a while to get back in.  I love this toner!</li>
            <li> However, I am not thilled with this product due to the heavy fragrance.  Works great, but smell is overpowering.  If you are sensitive to fragrance this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love refreshed my skin feels after using this product.  I love this line of products.  My skin has never looked better and continues to improve.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is a great brand! I&#x27;m a big fan of their lip balm and chapstick! I use them religiously. Their toner is very nice as well. It&#x27;s one of the more gentle brands on the market. The lower alcohol content is important; but it is not alcohol free unfortunately. Regardless, the aloe vera helps offset that because it soothes your skin while cleaning it all at once. It&#x27;s a good combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tend to dry out a lot, especially in the winter. Because of that I&#x27;ve been working toward eliminating alcohol completely from my face. Witch Hazel [[ASIN:B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream ]] is aloe vera based exactly like the Burts Bees but is alcohol free. It&#x27;s all natural too which is nice. I know my skin is getting the best care possible. If you don&#x27;t have naturally overly dry skin in the first place, the Burts is gonna work fine but for serious dryness or peeling/flaking, try to stray away from anything with alcohol. The Witch Hazel smells nice and I notice a huge difference using it!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect it to have such high % of Alcohol!! I have combination skin, but it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me. Probably much better for oily or acne skin? Don&#x27;t use on delicate areas, it will irritate the skin (around eyes)!! Otherwise - big bottle, comfortable use, smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Next time i will buy something alcohol free though.</li>
            <li> It helps to clean your face, that is for sure, nut it has too much alcohol. Some people like the feeling, but it is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is great, very old rose perfume type.</li>
            <li> Works great and is all natural. No breakouts here! I love the product. While the packaging is pretty, it&#x27;s not that practical. I switched mine into a mini spray bottle so I use less on more of my face.</li>
            <li> I read so much good reviews about burt bee rosewater and glycerin toner, so i went to target and got a bottle....it is to my disappointment....when i apply on my face...it smells too much alcohol in it....it is true that it&#x27;s paraben free....but do they use more \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; to preserve longer life? (Btw, i think this bottle i got is very fresh, did not sit on shelf for over 5 yrs....)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner.  I have sensitive skin and most toners irritate it...this one does not.  I highly recommended it!!!!</li>
            <li> This toner is very good. Admittedly, it is not my favorite, but I am very pleased with it. It is strong enough to remove additional dirt and oil that my cleanser leaves behind, yet gentle enough to avoid stinging and drying out my skin. The glass bottle is lovely, but not travel friendly.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing, especially in the hot summer months. I especially love the fresh rosewater smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good, is natural, and does the job. Believe it or not both my husband and I both use it (he uses it after shaving).</li>
            <li> I prefer to make my own so BB&#x27;s is really gonna have to stand up to some serious standards. If it flops, then back to making my own.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit long for shipping, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I like the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff has gotten so hard to find locally I was afraid that Burt&#x27;s Bees had discontinued production. This is a very mild but effective toner. Not that I am troubled by the claim but all natural is a bit of a stretch so read the ingredients label if your gonna be freaky about it as the product does include denatured alcohol. I love this stuff and after making the switch from witch hazel years ago I will never go back, this is just all around great stuff.</li>
            <li> I read fthe reviews on this and took some time to think about it.  I read that some love it and some don&#x27;t.  However, here is my experience;  It does have the rose smell.  I don&#x27;t think it is to strong and it dries quickly with no after smell.  It is not drying out my skin even though it does have alcohol in it.  Actually,  somehow it makes my face feel smooth and glowing.  It does take off left over residue that may have been  missed by washing.  I was impressed because I clean my face well.  All in all I&#x27;m a fan of it.  It does not dry out my face but leaves it feeling awesome.  Also no breakouts.  That thrills me as most things cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. At first, I wasn&#x27;t so impressed with it compared to the neutrogena toner I had been using prior but after some time I came to realize this is much better for my sensitive skin and it smells lovely. My skin feels refreshed after using this product and it always cleans off the extra make-up/facial masks that my face wash fails to cleanse.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy too much alcohol in this toner. I&#x27;m going back to real, true, pure rosewater for my skin. This dried out my face.</li>
            <li> Use it on a daily basis, leaves my skin feeling great specially when you use it with other Burt&#x27;s bees products. Would recommend this toner to anyone.</li>
            <li> This refreshing toner is great for preping my skin for makeup as well as removing any remaining dirt or oil before bed.</li>
            <li> I bought this toner to use with cosmetic mask sheets. It makes my skin look a bit shiny (oily). However, my skin feels soft and smooth after applying this toner and it smells great!</li>
            <li> My face after using this for a week was chapped, inflamed and broken out. I have sensitive skin and found that the first ingredient in this product was alcohol.This isn&#x27;t the first issue I&#x27;ve had with the Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; Skincare line. I won&#x27;t make the same mistake of purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for approx. two months now and find it has helped my skin a great deal. Use it before applying makeup and again before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased two to give as Christmas gifts. Ordered it the evening of 10/20 and it was on my door step on the 22nd. Great service.</li>
            <li> But it smells good. But this product may not be right for me. I use several Burt&#x27;s Bees products and so this was a little bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a glass bottle so the first shipment was broken. And everything evaporated! Wow! But Amazon quickly sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li> good for cleaning dry feet or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not, it&#x27;s practically almost like liquid watered down soap, it makes me question whether this product has real rosewater or not. It&#x27;s not even carried in most stores in the Bay Area either, so yeah, I&#x27;ll probably look for another product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right.  A little too much alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting this--being that it had rosewater and glycerin. Little did I know that alcohol denat fits between those two in the list of ingredients, which means this toner is incredibly drying. Sigh. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosewater Toner product has softened my facial skin tremendously... It is PERFECT! My daughter also uses it and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all of the reviews, no complaints, product smells good and tones. Some said that it irritates sensitive skin, I have fair sensitive skin and it didnt bother me. Ive been using it for a couple weeks and have found that it doesnt dry out my skin quite as bad as my previous toner which is good. Worth the $, Burts Bees doesnt disappoint. :)</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and is in such a pretty bottle that I plan to keep afterwards! The tonic smells so sweet and is wonderful to use in the morning and when it&#x27;s hot outside to refresh my skin.  It has glycerin in it and it seems to keep my pores from opening as much as usual/firms my skin up a bit :)</li>
            <li> I use this every night... I don&#x27;t break out with it at all and I&#x27;m prone to do so. It shows you how dirty your face is even after you&#x27;ve washed it... No sting and I love the feel of it. I&#x27;ve purchased this so far 4 times. If you can&#x27;t find it on here... I&#x27;ve bought it from target as well....</li>
            <li> Would and have reccomended this toner to friends and family. Along with the repair serum and a mild soap (from another company) This toner helped me get over a pretty bad skin infection I picked up at Basic training. Also I have no scars from the infection and its so nice and smells so good it helped me feel pretty even when my skin looked and felt pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I received this toner as part of a gift bag of Burt&#x27;s goodies. When I opened it up, the smell was... unpleasant. It was like walking into a funeral home, or an old ladies&#x27; tea party. I went ahead and tried it, and it actually works incredibly well on my dry winter skin. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks now, and my skin is clearer than it used to be, and much less dry. It&#x27;s like a cleanser mixed with a very light lotion, which seems to hydrate without leaving a sheen on my skin. I use it with cosmetic rounds instead of cotton balls, and it pulls lots of dirt from my face. I&#x27;m not particularly good about washing my face daily, I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and I&#x27;m not really into strict skin regimens, but I&#x27;ve been pretty good about sticking with this stuff, because it makes my skin feel so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I wish it didn&#x27;t smell the way it does, but I like what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> Bert&#x27;s Bees never fails.  I love this stuff, it makes your face so soft and has no harsh chemicals.  It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> I use this on my clients when I do a rose themed facial and they love it. I love the results too.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this toner, and I don&#x27;t have one bad thing to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t burn like some others, makes my comlexion beautiful and smells so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely buying this again.</li>
            <li> It softens the skin and does an additional cleansing boost after you have washed already. I&#x27;ve always liked Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price. does a nice job for an over the counter product.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s only been a couple of days since I started using this product, so I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone with a review at this point saying it worked miracles and fixed every skin issue on my face. However, I will say that my skin feels refreshed after using it. I used Clinique clarifying lotion for a long time and they have different numbered bottles for different types of skin. With this toner, my dry/combination skin is happy. I like the smell of the product. When I opened it, i thought it was a bit overwhelming, but when you apply it to a cotton ball and on your face, it&#x27;s not strong at all. And on that note, the cotton ball actually picks up dirt. I never saw that with the clinique clarifying lotion. I rarely wear make up, but when I do, I think i&#x27;ll have more confidence about getting it all off my face with Burts than the other stuff. Like I said, it&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but I already see my skin looking more dewey.  I think this is my new favorite.</li>
