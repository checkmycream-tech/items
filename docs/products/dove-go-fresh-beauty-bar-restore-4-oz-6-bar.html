            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Dove works great for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this soap is so strong that those of us preparing Thanksgiving baskets for charity were being sickened</li>
            <li>I already use them and they smell wobnderfull and refreshing , true to the name, feels so relaxing afetr shower.</li>
            <li>I always buy dove but not this particular one smells great and makes my skin fell soft and vibrant a great buy</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>It has a strong yet sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>This scent leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>i love dove it make your skin feel so soft and smell so refreshing throughout the day,so it is well worth it</li>
            <li>, I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t pomegranate to be honest.</li>
            <li>However, this particular variety smells more like men&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other dove products and have been satisfied with the way they clean and moisturize, but I&#x27;ve found most of their scents overpowering.</li>

            <li>This soap smells amazing, and does not leave any kind of weird residue.</li>
            <li>Unlike the plum &amp; sakura blossom scent (which is way too sweet for me) and the cool cucumber (which I just don&#x27;t like), Restore smells is clean while still being slightly fruity.</li>
            <li>More fragrant than expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks for manufacturing.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about buying this without being able to smell it first</li>

            <li>It isn&#x27;t like other dove soaps that leave your skin feeling soft and smooth though</li>
            <li>... lather really well :O)</li>
            <li>Not floral like so many other Dove options, but definitely not masculine either.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dove products and have been satisfied with the way they clean and moisturize, but I&#x27;ve found most of their scents overpowering. Unlike the plum &amp; sakura blossom scent (which is way too sweet for me) and the cool cucumber (which I just don&#x27;t like), Restore smells is clean while still being slightly fruity. It has the potential to be a men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s soap bar, but is still leans towards a feminine scent in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine overtones of lever 2000 soap combined with a citrus-y pomegranate smell. Overall, great product. Lathers, moisturizes, and cleans well. Highly recommended.</li>
