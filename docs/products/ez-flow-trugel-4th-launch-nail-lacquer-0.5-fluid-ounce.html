            <li>I am not disappointed, it is great.</li>
            <li>My favorite, absolute favorite brand of Gel polish!!!!!</li>
            <li>it is nice color and texture, easy to put on nails and wears well, I just love it...</li>
            <li>ok, but that takes 10 more minutes of time that I did not have.  </li>
            <li>color was perfect Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li>Love this Tiffany color.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s still lovely.</li>
            <li>Generous bottle of FABULOUS polish!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I get the most complements from this shade.  </li>
            <li>II will purchase more of this brand again, especially if the colors are as good as this one!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this polish and it was true to color.  </li>
            <li>Its a perfect blue very springy!</li>
            <li>Super cute color.</li>
            <li>It lasts just as long as the IBD and the consistency was great.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I thought the color would be more of a light blue than it is in actuality (more of an aqua).</li>
            <li>One hand lasted a full 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this polish, its gel and looks great, however doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on long before beginning to peel, but that isn&#x27;t necessarily the fault of the polish!</li>
            <li>The color is pretty true to the picture/a Tiffany box.</li>
            <li>Great polish and so much cheaper than the other gel polishes!!</li>
            <li>I will put a picture below to help see the color, but I only did one nail in this color this time around:)</li>
            <li>this color was so pretty</li>
            <li>It is pretty close though.  </li>
            <li>A shade darker and more gree than the Tiffany Co blue.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish</li>
            <li>It was not too thin and watery so the coverage was great.</li>
            <li>It held up really well despite how much I work with my hands and me being in and out of the water a lot.</li>
            <li>SHipping was fast came in just one day</li>
            <li>and this did last for me 10 days chip free</li>
            <li>Maybe it was so fast because of the new Amazon warehouse they opened here in California.</li>
            <li>Not tiffany blue, actually not really a blue at all, more of a minty type green to me which is ok,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more green.</li>
            <li>Pretty color but more sage green than blue.</li>
            <li>While this color was still pretty, it definitely wasn&#x27;t the color the pictures show.</li>
            <li>It is a bit too blue so it does not match exactly.</li>
            <li>and they said that it needed to be dried under a special lamp to see the real color....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the Tiffany Co blue, I would buy Finger Paint Gel Polish in Cool Blue Harmony.</li>
            <li>Hard to use especially because it is a gel polish and making sure you get it on the nail precisely is important, too hard to do with this polish.</li>
            <li>I usually use gelish or IBD for my gel polish, but couldn&#x27;t find the right blue color</li>

            <li> It is very thin and took three thin coats to cover and lasted over a week, which is great for me.  </li>
            <li> but it goes on well and stays on just as long as my gelish products which for me is about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality even with the great price.</li>
            <li> You can see swatches of this shade and other Trugels on my blog here - http://www.reneebeautygroupe.com/search/label/nails</li>
            <li> I typically by gelish but</li>
            <li> My dominant hand had chips/peeling occur a little after the 2 week mark.</li>
            <li> It does need a third coat though as its a tad thin.</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this polish</li>
            <li> I brought this polish to the nail salon and they said that it needed to be dried under a special lamp to see the real color.... ok, but that takes 10 more minutes of time that I did not have.  I will be buying regular nail polish from now on.</li>
            <li> Had not tried EZ Flow b4 but it worked great!  My nail tech hadn&#x27;t either but they are now ordering some too.  It does need a third coat though as its a tad thin.</li>
            <li> Not tiffany blue, actually not really a blue at all, more of a minty type green to me which is ok, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> color was perfect Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li> Great polish and so much cheaper than the other gel polishes!! Love this Tiffany color. I would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I usually use gelish or IBD for my gel polish, but couldn&#x27;t find the right blue color so I decided to use TruGel in the Tiffany color. I am not disappointed, it is great. It lasts just as long as the IBD and the consistency was great. It was not too thin and watery so the coverage was great. II will purchase more of this brand again, especially if the colors are as good as this one! I will put a picture below to help see the color, but I only did one nail in this color this time around:)</li>
            <li> I thought the color would be more of a light blue than it is in actuality (more of an aqua). That said, it&#x27;s still lovely.</li>
            <li> This gel last about the same as regular polish. Very disappointed in the quality even with the great price. Save your money!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty true to the picture/a Tiffany box. Maybe just a shade brighter than the picture here. I received multiple compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Amazing color! Amazing quality. You can see swatches of this shade and other Trugels on my blog here - http://www.reneebeautygroupe.com/search/label/nails</li>
            <li> Did not like the color</li>
            <li> Thus is the perfect tiffany color!!! I love it so much! Its look great under some glitter too!! Its a perfect blue very springy!</li>
            <li> While this color was still pretty, it definitely wasn&#x27;t the color the pictures show. It&#x27;s definitely more green. It&#x27;s still a nice color! It held up really well despite how much I work with my hands and me being in and out of the water a lot. One hand lasted a full 3 weeks. My dominant hand had chips/peeling occur a little after the 2 week mark. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> What a great buy!!!  Generous bottle of FABULOUS polish!  The color is AMAZING!!!  The durability is awesome and the coverage ROCKS!  My favorite, absolute favorite brand of Gel polish!!!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this polish and it was true to color.  I received several compliments on the color.  It is very thin and took three thin coats to cover and lasted over a week, which is great for me.  Would use this product again.</li>
            <li> I typically by gelish but this color was so pretty I thought I would give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. It takes about 2 coats because it is a bit thinner but it goes on well and stays on just as long as my gelish products which for me is about 2 weeks.  I get the most complements from this shade.  I also use monster nail stamps that I bought on amazon with a white polish to stamp on designs.  It works perfect because if you make a mistake you can wipe it off with remover and try again unlike with the non-cured polishes.</li>
            <li> Polish stayed on well..good price. Pretty color but more sage green than blue. Would recommend for sage geenish blue. I did get compliments even though i wanted s different color</li>
            <li> I bought this color to match the Tiffany Blue signature color.  It is a bit too blue so it does not match exactly. It is pretty close though.  I will wear it however.  SHipping was fast came in just one day and I used standard shipping.  Maybe it was so fast because of the new Amazon warehouse they opened here in California.</li>
            <li> This is a beatiful color very happy with my purchase and this did last for me 10 days chip free</li>
            <li> Very thin. Hard to use especially because it is a gel polish and making sure you get it on the nail precisely is important, too hard to do with this polish.</li>
            <li> I love this polish, its gel and looks great, however doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on long before beginning to peel, but that isn&#x27;t necessarily the fault of the polish! Who knows!! lol</li>
            <li> it is nice color and texture, easy to put on nails and wears well, I just love it... happy about this choice :)</li>
            <li> Super cute color. A shade darker and more gree than the Tiffany Co blue. The polish appears to be the same quality as Gelish. Love it!!! If you&#x27;re looking for the Tiffany Co blue, I would buy Finger Paint Gel Polish in Cool Blue Harmony. Currently sold at Sally Beauty.</li>
