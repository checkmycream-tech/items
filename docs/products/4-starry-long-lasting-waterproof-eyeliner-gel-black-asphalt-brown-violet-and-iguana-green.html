            <li>When I asked how she liked them</li>
            <li>but the are kind of greasy and do not set well.</li>
            <li>And the colors are really nice...</li>
            <li>They each came with their own brush</li>
            <li>i thought these would be nice</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but I would not call it waterproof at all.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice, and the application easy, and it looks nice on.</li>
            <li>I go for a very fine line and it makes my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li>so they do not go on very smooth.</li>
            <li>i love it the colors pop.</li>
            <li>i cant wait until i need more.</li>
            <li>if all i do is put this liner on my top eye</li>

            <li>I love this eye liner.  </li>

            <li>i love the darker look</li>
            <li>i tried this and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>This is okay liner.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it there appeared to be a film on the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I cant say enough how awesome these are.</li>
            <li>missing,,,,,,love love love them</li>
            <li>It smudges at times, but that happens with most eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I love these colors and this brand.</li>
            <li>(Tx and Ok are triple digits in the summer)</li>
            <li>Love the way they work together</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of colors and the ease and longevity of the eyeliner in my humid area of the country...</li>
            <li>So pleased.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice though not as rich as I was hoping for</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and gilides on just perfect and lasts a long time without smearing.</li>
            <li>lol wow this stuff never comes off.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and super glossy and shimmeryâ€¦ will purchase these again</li>
            <li>melts right off!!</li>
            <li>like the brown and black shades the best because they seem to be more pigmented.</li>
            <li>Two colors together are also super easy to do!</li>
            <li>i definitely recomend these for a more experienced make up user.</li>
            <li>Gel is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It smears rather easily.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and stays put.  </li>
            <li>..does smear easily unless set with powder &amp; spray.</li>
            <li>The are easy to go on.</li>
            <li>The brushes are also finer which allows for a nice crisp line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and look fantastic.</li>
            <li>First and foremost this seller was awesome in assisting with my delayed shipment du to the Labor day holiday last week.  </li>
            <li>Now back to the prouduct, beautiful silky smooth staying power.  </li>
            <li>They do their job, it applies smoothly (although I use a different brush than the ones that came with the eyeliner pots), and it looks great.</li>
            <li>, it stays on great always last all day, and night if needed.</li>
            <li>Product is cheap (Made in Taiwan).</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with these, and the jars are indeed small...</li>
            <li>They are bold and go onto the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>I labeled the brushes so it makes it easier to make sure I get the right brush for the right color</li>
            <li>They go on so easily, true to color, stays on and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product, and found them to smudge pretty easily.</li>
            <li>The colors are bold and stay well for hours.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant, as these are pretty cheap</li>
            <li>The colors came out pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL COLORS - LONG LASTING @</li>
            <li>The green and purple are pretty in the bottle, but are very light on skin, I have a very fair complexion so this surprised me.</li>
            <li>You for putting everything about your customers first!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>The tiny tool made it so easy to apply and I could picture this being great for beginners who are starting to learn about makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not wear makeup on a daily schedule, but I was able to make myself look nice with this type of eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It stays fresh forever.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are ideal for thick lines.</li>
            <li>That product furthers the wear of these extremely colorful eyeliners and you can enhance your look with eyeshadow powders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of a more mature age...</li>
            <li>I have watery eyes sometimes, and it washes right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool that you get 4 different colored pots for so cheap!</li>
            <li>I loved that a different eyeliner comes with each so that you don&#x27;t have to keep washing or wiping immediately to use, and can just wash on your normal weekly brush day :</li>
            <li>The lighter colors are vibrant, although sometimes they take more than one go-over to show up super clearly.</li>
            <li>I like this item very much, but I don&#x27;t use it when I am doing something that makes me sweat because it is not water proof like it says, it runs and smudges when sweating.</li>
            <li>Good product some of the colors are very dark which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>Last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Most recently &amp;#34;your eyemake up is just beautiful&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I drive a semi and am in/out of the truck all day getting hot etc</li>
            <li>I had raccoon eyes within the first hour.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually a pretty neat deal for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>No, they don&#x27;t exactly qualify as waterproof, so</li>
            <li>I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors!</li>
            <li>the price is great but it doesnt last on my eyes, it is easy to use if your skin is dry it will last ....</li>
            <li>Nice soft glide, they do smudge on upper eyelid if you don&#x27;t set with some powder.</li>
            <li>I was in search of a highly pigmented gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away.</li>
            <li>The little brush that comes with them is nice too.  </li>
            <li>so i run through eyeliners fast</li>
            <li>I can put this on when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and it will stay all day.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I expected a better product.</li>
            <li>Applies very silky.</li>
            <li>so you can use the edge or tip for a fine line or the flat side for a thicker line.  </li>
            <li>one on top of the other...</li>
            <li>Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
            <li>The purple and green are very pretty and look nice enough on but they are glittery</li>
            <li>I also separately purchased a &#x27;white&#x27; eyeliner in this brand for the upper inside line and a very light line on the lower inside of the lid.</li>
            <li>These are not only great for beginners who may have a hard time putting on eyeliner or are intimidated by</li>
            <li>Love the black and brown</li>
            <li>I mostly use the black and brown though.</li>
            <li>Love the black ND brown color.</li>
            <li>However, these do tend to stay on when I&#x27;m outside in the hot sun sweating a bit!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it as I loved the way it looked when applied, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>These colors are a nice medium tone and are not too thick.  </li>
            <li>I mean amazing.  </li>
            <li>, i had heard from my daughter that gel in the new liquid.</li>
            <li>pots seem small, but they hold slightly more</li>
            <li>They black and brown are smooth with no glitter</li>
            <li>Not stiff and crinkly like some I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I always cover with a &#x27;stuck on you&#x27; clear type product.  </li>
            <li>Pigmented and velvety soft for application.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I did swatches and it was difficult to wash out, which is good for all day wear.</li>
            <li>The eyeliners are pretty small but you only need a very little for good coverage.</li>
            <li>At first I thought they were pretty small</li>
            <li>The green really doesnt qualify as a liner, but the other three are dark enough to look amazing!</li>
            <li>I used the black one most as I was starting to learn how to line my upper lid back then</li>
            <li>The product is fine for anyone who likes thick make-up.</li>
            <li>the colors are not very dark.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to make a straight line that isn&#x27;t haphazard like how it usually is when I apply eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It cakes and flakes off, isn&#x27;t entirely smooth to apply and the colors are dull.</li>
            <li>other colors don&#x27;t go on very heavy, they are more of just a shimmer</li>
            <li>This product is not waterproof, and it is certainly not long wearing.</li>
            <li>They are smudgable before they dry completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is my set or what, but the green and purple shades are more translucent</li>
            <li>The black,  purple  and brown gel eyeliners go on smooth and dark,  and dry to a flexible matte finish that lasts all day.  </li>

            <li> The green and purple are pretty in the bottle, but are very light on skin, I have a very fair complexion so this surprised me.</li>
            <li> You for putting everything about your customers first!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> The tiny tool made it so easy to apply and I could picture this being great for beginners who are starting to learn about makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not wear makeup on a daily schedule, but I was able to make myself look nice with this type of eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It stays fresh forever.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are ideal for thick lines.</li>
            <li> That product furthers the wear of these extremely colorful eyeliners and you can enhance your look with eyeshadow powders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of a more mature age...</li>
            <li> I have watery eyes sometimes, and it washes right off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool that you get 4 different colored pots for so cheap!</li>
            <li> I loved that a different eyeliner comes with each so that you don&#x27;t have to keep washing or wiping immediately to use, and can just wash on your normal weekly brush day :</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are vibrant, although sometimes they take more than one go-over to show up super clearly.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much, but I don&#x27;t use it when I am doing something that makes me sweat because it is not water proof like it says, it runs and smudges when sweating.</li>
            <li> Good product some of the colors are very dark which I like a lot.</li>
            <li> Last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Most recently &amp;#34;your eyemake up is just beautiful&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I drive a semi and am in/out of the truck all day getting hot etc</li>
            <li> I had raccoon eyes within the first hour.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually a pretty neat deal for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> No, they don&#x27;t exactly qualify as waterproof, so</li>
            <li> I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors!</li>
            <li> the price is great but it doesnt last on my eyes, it is easy to use if your skin is dry it will last ....</li>
            <li> Nice soft glide, they do smudge on upper eyelid if you don&#x27;t set with some powder.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a highly pigmented gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away.</li>
            <li> The little brush that comes with them is nice too.  </li>
            <li> so i run through eyeliners fast</li>
            <li> I can put this on when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and it will stay all day.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I expected a better product.</li>
            <li> Applies very silky.</li>
            <li> so you can use the edge or tip for a fine line or the flat side for a thicker line.  </li>
            <li> one on top of the other...</li>
            <li> Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
            <li> The purple and green are very pretty and look nice enough on but they are glittery</li>
            <li> I also separately purchased a &#x27;white&#x27; eyeliner in this brand for the upper inside line and a very light line on the lower inside of the lid.</li>
            <li> These are not only great for beginners who may have a hard time putting on eyeliner or are intimidated by</li>
            <li> Love the black and brown</li>
            <li> I mostly use the black and brown though.</li>
            <li> Love the black ND brown color.</li>
            <li> However, these do tend to stay on when I&#x27;m outside in the hot sun sweating a bit!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it as I loved the way it looked when applied, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These colors are a nice medium tone and are not too thick.  </li>
            <li> I mean amazing.  </li>
            <li> , i had heard from my daughter that gel in the new liquid.</li>
            <li> pots seem small, but they hold slightly more</li>
            <li> They black and brown are smooth with no glitter</li>
            <li> Not stiff and crinkly like some I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I always cover with a &#x27;stuck on you&#x27; clear type product.  </li>
            <li> Pigmented and velvety soft for application.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I did swatches and it was difficult to wash out, which is good for all day wear.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are pretty small but you only need a very little for good coverage.</li>
            <li> At first I thought they were pretty small</li>
            <li> The green really doesnt qualify as a liner, but the other three are dark enough to look amazing!</li>
            <li> I used the black one most as I was starting to learn how to line my upper lid back then</li>
            <li> The product is fine for anyone who likes thick make-up.</li>
            <li> the colors are not very dark.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to make a straight line that isn&#x27;t haphazard like how it usually is when I apply eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It cakes and flakes off, isn&#x27;t entirely smooth to apply and the colors are dull.</li>
            <li> other colors don&#x27;t go on very heavy, they are more of just a shimmer</li>
            <li> This product is not waterproof, and it is certainly not long wearing.</li>
            <li> They are smudgable before they dry completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is my set or what, but the green and purple shades are more translucent</li>
            <li> The black,  purple  and brown gel eyeliners go on smooth and dark,  and dry to a flexible matte finish that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> but will definitely last long enough.</li>
            <li> So , I guess it isn&#x27;t horrible since it was like you know a pretty good price for four eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I can tell it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It says that it is long lasting and waterproof and I have to say that once I had applied it to my eyes it did not stay put.</li>
            <li> It may be long lasting and waterproof but it does not stay put.</li>
            <li> Having not heard much of this brand (very few blog reviews exist), I was worried that the product would not deliver the pigmentation I was looking for.</li>
            <li> i ordered the small one and its not even half empty and iv had it for about 6months now use it everyday :) will deff order again.</li>
            <li> you dont need much, its beautiful.and the black one is as black as you can get.</li>
            <li> Does not apply well, clumpy , clumpy, clumpy,  does not stay or very long and</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like to change up the makeup all the time, however, I really only like the brown and black in this set.  </li>
            <li> You can make the line as thin or thick as needed easily.  </li>
            <li> My package came with 4 individual little boxes of the gel eye liners.</li>
            <li> That little poke will be enough to cover tightlining on my eyelid, and the wing I do to the side.</li>
            <li> it just spend a few extra bucks and get a brand name like Maybelline or MAC.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use for the cat eyes but it only lasts a few hours, after that u don&#x27;t have cat eyes</li>
            <li> And really, no eyeliner is all day wear proof.  </li>
            <li> so I have to careful about the glitter...</li>
            <li> and it is to be expected.</li>
            <li> iv used mac and other products</li>
            <li> then the other two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and flat</li>
            <li> Really not worth</li>
            <li> Delivery was a slight problem was guaranteed sameday delivery, took 2 days.</li>
            <li> black and brown does wonder for me..</li>
            <li> The black is shimmery</li>
            <li> only complaint that doesn&#x27;t make this a 5 star product is that after wearing these for a few hours, I start to notice that the eyeliner spreads to the crease in my eye.</li>
            <li> I need like three layers and the black</li>
            <li> The green is shimmery and less pigmented.  </li>
            <li> but i will use this over all of them.does not take mutch 2 little dabs</li>
            <li> Smaller than expensive brands that will dry out&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even remotely waterproof!!!</li>
            <li> the green and purple shades are too glittery and this is not a waterproof product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Boo</li>
            <li> I totally wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> and so is the green and purple.</li>
            <li> It lasts a few hours on me.</li>
            <li> I mix the green and violet...</li>
            <li> the liner cream is way too thick and the brush is not fine enough to create a thin line.</li>
            <li> These little guys work just as well!</li>
            <li> but just a little dab will do you!</li>
            <li> Small containers</li>
            <li> The brush has a very narrow tip that lets you apply it just where you want it.</li>
            <li> Very messy is smeared and hard to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> It gets annoying after a while to be constantly wetting a paper towel with a little soup in the bathroom at clubs or bars to remove the black crease I have going on.</li>
            <li> and so I hardly wear it.  </li>
            <li> the applicator that&#x27;s supplied with it sucks.</li>
            <li> BUT if you are not experienced in putting these gel liners on, you could have a mess!</li>
            <li> i mean make the line so thin what is the point of wearing it.</li>
            <li> they run, even with eyeshadow base, they bleed into the crease of your eye unless you barely use any,</li>
            <li> Not great for all day wear, but I do like all of the colors if I am going out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible, don&#x27;t get it, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> i went crazy when I culdnt find them in the store..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> but I have to on this product because I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very, Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t make me stop using it, but it does get annoying!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wearability was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> worked for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> Gave these to my daughter for Christmas as she likes gel eyeliners.  When I asked how she liked them she says they flake of when she&#x27;s wearing them and the colors are not very dark.</li>
            <li> lol wow this stuff never comes off. i love it the colors pop. they are beautiful. i cant wait until i need more. im definitly gonna buy these. im no pro at putting on make up but for some reason these make it look like i am. if all i do is put this liner on my top eye lid im good to go. you dont need much, its beautiful.and the black one is as black as you can get. its what i&#x27;ve been searching for!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years... and replaced them with these recently. They go on so easily, true to color, stays on and doesn&#x27;t smear. And lasts...</li>
            <li> I ordered these from the advice of my sister that gel eyeliner is awesome! I do love it, it stays on great always last all day, and night if needed. BUT if you are not experienced in putting these gel liners on, you could have a mess! i definitely recomend these for a more experienced make up user.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner.  It goes on smooth and looks great!  Last most of the day.  Great colors. The brush works great while applying.</li>
            <li> Love the black and brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other colors don&#x27;t go on very heavy, they are more of just a shimmer</li>
            <li> Greasy and doesn&#x27;t stay put. I threw them away after 1 use. Really not worth it just spend a few extra bucks and get a brand name like Maybelline or MAC.</li>
            <li> Good product some of the colors are very dark which I like a lot. Delivery was a slight problem was guaranteed sameday delivery, took 2 days.</li>
            <li> Product is cheap (Made in Taiwan). NOT waterproof.Gel is easy to apply. Pots and brushes are smaller in person than you would think. I will not buy again, but this might be good for a teenager or someone that can not afford good make up. Can not use on waterline. looks better if you use a mac 266 brush.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are pretty small but you only need a very little for good coverage. I can tell it will last a long time. Super easy to apply</li>
            <li> melts right off!! not lasting at all!!</li>
            <li> the liner cream is way too thick and the brush is not fine enough to create a thin line. the green and purple shades are too glittery and this is not a waterproof product.</li>
            <li> i love the darker look so i run through eyeliners fast i tried this and fell in love with it iv used mac and other products but i will use this over all of them.does not take mutch 2 little dabs and you have enough for almost both eyes i ordered the small one and its not even half empty and iv had it for about 6months now use it everyday :) will deff order again.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of work to make it stay. I had to keep  freshening up. I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product, and found them to smudge pretty easily. Definitely not waterproof.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good gel eyeliner for an affordable price. This set is great.</li>
            <li> It smears rather easily.</li>
            <li> Does not apply well, clumpy , clumpy, clumpy,  does not stay or very long and the applicator that&#x27;s supplied with it sucks. Wish it could be returned but am told because it&#x27;s a cosmetic I can&#x27;t. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Boo</li>
            <li> Waterproof? I dont think so!</li>
            <li> The colors look like they are pictured. They are bold and go onto the skin smoothly. The colors are bold and stay well for hours. The packaging was secure and arrived in perfect condition. I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is okay liner.  When I opened it there appeared to be a film on the top. Not great for all day wear, but I do like all of the colors if I am going out.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  It is so easy to use and stays put.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  Most recently &amp;#34;your eyemake up is just beautiful&amp;#34;.  This from someone who uses no makeup!  It stays fresh forever.  Smaller than expensive brands that will dry out&lt;br /&gt;before you use all of the product.</li>
            <li> The black,  purple  and brown gel eyeliners go on smooth and dark,  and dry to a flexible matte finish that lasts all day.  Not stiff and crinkly like some I&#x27;ve tried.  They are smudgable before they dry completely.  The little brush that comes with them is nice too.  It&#x27;s small and flat so you can use the edge or tip for a fine line or the flat side for a thicker line.  The green is shimmery and less pigmented.  I would dab it on with a finger as an eyeshadow or use it on the lower lash line.  They don&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.  It&#x27;s cool that you get 4 different colored pots for so cheap!</li>
            <li> It goes on good &amp; looks good&lt;br /&gt;..does smear easily unless set with powder &amp; spray. Also use primer.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much, but I don&#x27;t use it when I am doing something that makes me sweat because it is not water proof like it says, it runs and smudges when sweating.</li>
            <li> I like these products.  I usually do not wear makeup on a daily schedule, but I was able to make myself look nice with this type of eyeliner.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the set and have only used the brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased the set but I have only used the brown. I use it every day for work. The brush has a very narrow tip that lets you apply it just where you want it. I go for a very fine line and it makes my eyes stand out. It stays in place all day. I will get around to trying the others colors but I get stuck in a retune.</li>
            <li> The purple and green are very pretty and look nice enough on but they are glittery so they do not go on very smooth. They black and brown are smooth with no glitter but the are kind of greasy and do not set well.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how awesome these are. They are easy to use and look fantastic. My only wish was that it had five colors which would include blue,,,that is the only color missing,,,,,,love love love them</li>
            <li> Not even remotely waterproof!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are good, but the durability is not what was described. I wanted a liner that lasted all day... this one does not!</li>
            <li> black and brown does wonder for me..i went crazy when I culdnt find them in the store..don&#x27;t care for the colors but I gotta have the brown n black,,i hope they don&#x27;t go out of business</li>
            <li> I LOVED  this product!  I used the black one most as I was starting to learn how to line my upper lid back then when I purchased it.  Pigmented and velvety soft for application.  The tiny tool made it so easy to apply and I could picture this being great for beginners who are starting to learn about makeup application.  It lasted a good amount of time on my lids.  Nice and affordable!</li>
            <li> Very messy is smeared and hard to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant, as these are pretty cheap and I thought they&#x27;d be lower quality. But if they, are I haven&#x27;t noticed. They do their job, it applies smoothly (although I use a different brush than the ones that came with the eyeliner pots), and it looks great. It smudges at times, but that happens with most eyeliners. The lighter colors are vibrant, although sometimes they take more than one go-over to show up super clearly. I mostly use the black and brown though. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I love these colors and this brand. I can put this on when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and it will stay all day. I drive a semi and am in/out of the truck all day getting hot etc (Tx and Ok are triple digits in the summer) and once I&#x27;m home at the end of the day it&#x27;s still there with no runs at all. I labeled the brushes so it makes it easier to make sure I get the right brush for the right color but that&#x27;s the only extra I&#x27;ve had to do. No fumes to make my eyes water either. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. And the colors are really nice... as per my wife</li>
            <li> The colors are nice though not as rich as I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Color pops, but not waterproof or smudgeproof. Only wear this if your not going to do anything...but sit in a chair or something...</li>
            <li> GREAT EYELINER! WONDERFUL COLORS - LONG LASTING @ A LOW COST!</li>
            <li> First and foremost this seller was awesome in assisting with my delayed shipment du to the Labor day holiday last week.  Once I notified seller I hadn&#x27;t receive.  I had it within 48 hours!  Woo Hoo!  Now back to the prouduct, beautiful silky smooth staying power.  All the colors are so universal they go with all skin types.  I loved that a different eyeliner comes with each so that you don&#x27;t have to keep washing or wiping immediately to use, and can just wash on your normal weekly brush day :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for putting everything about your customers first!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I have to on this product because I was so disappointed. It says that it is long lasting and waterproof and I have to say that once I had applied it to my eyes it did not stay put. I had raccoon eyes within the first hour.It may be long lasting and waterproof but it does not stay put.I didn&#x27;t even want to give it one star but the star is because it was delivered on time. I totally wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I got my package today. I was pretty excited. I thought it would come with one brush but I was wrong. My package came with 4 individual little boxes of the gel eye liners. At first I thought they were pretty small but it&#x27;s actually a pretty neat deal for the price and quality. The colors came out pretty smooth. The black is shimmery and so is the green and purple. The brown is matte. They each came with their own brush so I was happy about that. The brushes are ideal for thick lines. If you want thinner lines you might want to use a different brush. I did swatches and it was difficult to wash out, which is good for all day wear. The colors are perfect for any skin tone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use for the cat eyes but it only lasts a few hours, after that u don&#x27;t have cat eyes any  more.&lt;br /&gt;you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Love the way they work together and they stay in place instead of rolling to the creace of the eye lid when I use as shadow.&lt;br /&gt;Shadow goes on with my finger and the liner on with a brush for a darker and deeper color. Mix and matchs well.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for anyone who likes thick make-up. It was totally my mistake. The colors are really beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners with great colors for cosplay.</li>
            <li> i purchased these since i wear liquid i thought these would be nice, i had heard from my daughter that gel in the new liquid. anyway they go on great, HOWEVER!!! they run, even with eyeshadow base, they bleed into the crease of your eye unless you barely use any, i mean make the line so thin what is the point of wearing it. i would not recommend these to anyone. sorry</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like to change up the makeup all the time, however, I really only like the brown and black in this set.  The green and purple are pretty in the bottle, but are very light on skin, I have a very fair complexion so this surprised me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and super glossy and shimmeryâ€¦ will purchase these again</li>
            <li> These colors are a nice medium tone and are not too thick.  As a result, there has not been a problem with smudging throughout the day and the dreaded raccoon mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pots seem small, but they hold slightly more that companies that use bulky packaging to look more impressive( .11 vs .106).  The brushes are also finer which allows for a nice crisp line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually going to buy these again and try different colors.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I mean amazing.  Easy to use and control and stays on perfectly all day, no smudging, no matter the color.  You can make the line as thin or thick as needed easily.  Two colors together are also super easy to do! I love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on at all and smears!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and gilides on just perfect and lasts a long time without smearing. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is not waterproof, and it is certainly not long wearing. It lasts a few hours on me. The colors are nice, and the application easy, and it looks nice on. It just does not last. I have watery eyes sometimes, and it washes right off. I wanted to love it as I loved the way it looked when applied, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are a great mix and match for the eyes.  The supplied brushes a bit too big so I opted for a bamboo angled one that I also purchased on this site. I also separately purchased a &#x27;white&#x27; eyeliner in this brand for the upper inside line and a very light line on the lower inside of the lid. And really, no eyeliner is all day wear proof.  They do wear well but for an ALL day look and for &#x27;added&#x27; staying power I always cover with a &#x27;stuck on you&#x27; clear type product.  That product furthers the wear of these extremely colorful eyeliners and you can enhance your look with eyeshadow powders.</li>
            <li> These are good! I love how easy it is to make a straight line that isn&#x27;t haphazard like how it usually is when I apply eyeliner. These are not only great for beginners who may have a hard time putting on eyeliner or are intimidated by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brown and black shades the best because they seem to be more pigmented. I&#x27;m not sure if it is my set or what, but the green and purple shades are more translucent then the other two. So, I don&#x27;t use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint that doesn&#x27;t make this a 5 star product is that after wearing these for a few hours, I start to notice that the eyeliner spreads to the crease in my eye. It it obviously from blinking my eye, and I haven&#x27;t found a way to make this stop happening. It gets annoying after a while to be constantly wetting a paper towel with a little soup in the bathroom at clubs or bars to remove the black crease I have going on. This won&#x27;t make me stop using it, but it does get annoying!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are awesome! I have been using MAC&#x27;s gel liner for some while now, but didn&#x27;t have the money to continue purchasing it. These little guys work just as well! No, they don&#x27;t exactly qualify as waterproof, so going in the lake with these on will not end up glamorous. However, these do tend to stay on when I&#x27;m outside in the hot sun sweating a bit! I&#x27;m very impressed with these, and the jars are indeed small...but just a little dab will do you! I just poke my MAC eyeliner brush into the pot and apply to my lid. That little poke will be enough to cover tightlining on my eyelid, and the wing I do to the side. The green really doesnt qualify as a liner, but the other three are dark enough to look amazing! Love these gel eyeliners!</li>
            <li> The quality of this make up was not what I was hoping it would be. It cakes and flakes off, isn&#x27;t entirely smooth to apply and the colors are dull. In retrospect, I wish I had saved the money and passed on this item.</li>
            <li> I like these. The are easy to go on. Nice soft glide, they do smudge on upper eyelid if you don&#x27;t set with some powder. Very easy for making  your eyes looks  you best.</li>
            <li> the price is great but it doesnt last on my eyes, it is easy to use if your skin is dry it will last ....maybe</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say its perfect, the purple doesn&#x27;t slide on easy I need like three layers and the black doesn&#x27;t at all look like the picture. It sparkles. So , I guess it isn&#x27;t horrible since it was like you know a pretty good price for four eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and although the price was low I expected a better product. This product didn&#x27;t even last two hours. It was practically melting off of my eyes, I even put on urban decay primer before using this product. Absolutely horrible, don&#x27;t get it, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I mix the green and violet... one on top of the other... I&#x27;m of a more mature age... so I have to careful about the glitter... I&#x27;m enjoying the &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of colors and the ease and longevity of the eyeliner in my humid area of the country...</li>
            <li> By the end of the day it had melted all under my eyes. I&#x27;m guessing it is just because it is a gel and it is to be expected. I&#x27;ve never used a gel before.  Goes on beautifully.  Just wish it stayed there.</li>
            <li> Love the black ND brown color.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but I would not call it waterproof at all.  They smudge all over and so I hardly wear it.  Very, Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE! It was running and smudging before I even got to my event. I even had a primer on underneath and it&#x27;s wearability was terrible. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> So pleased. Applies very silky. Stays on all day. Great colors. Small containers but will definitely last long enough. Especially at the price. Love it!</li>
            <li> Having not heard much of this brand (very few blog reviews exist), I was worried that the product would not deliver the pigmentation I was looking for. I was in search of a highly pigmented gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away. I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors! Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
