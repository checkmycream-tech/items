            <li>I bought this set and honestly didn&#x27;t bother with the free e-download of the idea book (you do not get the book with your purchase, just the free download).</li>

            <li>I think an adult would be happy with them too.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a free ebook download.</li>

            <li>thoughtful addition</li>
            <li>I do need the e-mail for free e-book.</li>
            <li>They look like a lot of creative fun.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter will have fun with them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and Amazon sells a variety.</li>
            <li>Although the booklet says to clean the tools as you work, that is not always easy.</li>

            <li>They seem well-made and the case holds them securely between uses.</li>
            <li>They are all what I need for my nail arts which comes with a free e-book of guidance for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li>There is really every kind of design you can use these for.</li>
            <li>The case is very convenient and the brushes and dotters are amazing.</li>
            <li>It was a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>I would assume that if you&#x27;re going to use them for nail art the manufacturer would make them so they fit into the bottle.  </li>
            <li>i used the tiny brush, which was great at outlining.</li>
            <li>And I really like the pouch, handy</li>
            <li>Really good kit for professional looking nails at home.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter (14 years old) was thrilled with this set.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I used it right away and love it already.</li>
            <li>Book is mediocre at best, YouTube and pinterest have better resources, but the product itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are higher end products</li>
            <li>They are having so much fun doing their nails!</li>
            <li>I am more interested in using this for art and sculpture of miniatures.</li>
            <li>Excited to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for doing my nails at home. :)</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was good!</li>
            <li>but I think they are good and the little case is really nice to have.</li>
            <li>(Note: don&#x27;t try to clean the weighing boats --</li>
            <li>(Note: don&#x27;t try to clean the weighing boats --</li>
            <li>As a bonus to me, she does not know I got it on a lightning deal at a super cheap price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced just right, and the carrying case makes it so convenient!</li>
            <li>Brushes and case very nice but 2 of the actual brush parts fell right</li>
            <li>While I do agree that the set could benefit from the brush handles being a little smaller to fit inside the polish bottles (which can be very easily solved), this set is absolutely perfect for beginners.</li>
            <li>12 year old was thrilled with the kit and is devouring the e-book.</li>
            <li>i stayed up for about 4 hours painting the day i got this in the mail because i was highly satisfied with my nail art thanks to the variety of the brushes.</li>
            <li>The striper isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;boingy,&amp;#34; it runs true to my line where I want it.</li>
            <li>I am new at doing my own nails and I am having fun.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be an appealing useful gift for those interested in fingernail art- at the right price.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in only 3 days from purchase, amazing seeing as I used Free Shipping which has 5-8 shipping days.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and great for simple to intricate nail designs!</li>
            <li>These are good quality brushes, I was surprised with how fast the shipping was.</li>
            <li>so I had time to adequately work with them before I made a decision.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the dotting tools and fine brushes, but so far everything works great.</li>
            <li>The dotting tools are very pretty with the purple design.</li>
            <li>I look forward to many new designs  .</li>
            <li>I love my New Art Brush nail kit.</li>
            <li>Delivery was really fast!!</li>

            <li>The book was easy to download and my daughter will love it for her Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little set.  </li>
            <li>An amazing gift for any female who enjoys spending time doing nails.</li>
            <li>items looked well, however upon opening, some brushes were mostly out of the pouches rather than secure, same goes for the plastic protection.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of different tools in a nice roll-up case.</li>
            <li>so I can start doing different designs on my own without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li>I have found disposable plastic weighing boats (meant for chemistry labs) to be useful for this.</li>
            <li>The booklet is useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.oats (meant for chemistry labs) to be useful for this.</li>
            <li>The booklet is useful.</li>
            <li>It is really worth the price</li>
            <li>For the price they are worth buying.</li>
            <li>Good set, paint comes off brushes when using remover be careful of that.</li>
            <li>Product was as expected, quality was good</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The ebook is a nice extra!</li>
            <li>I am having fun learning how to do nail art on my toes with the brushes.  </li>
            <li>doing it as a hobby and for friends, something fun to piddle with for me.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 11 and 8 year old granddaughters to keep up their creative interest in nail art.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with their customer service.</li>
            <li>Carry bag was worth it, keeps everything in place.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this set for beginners and even for the more advanced.</li>
            <li>The set is exactly how it was described and shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>gf loved it, shes says shes gona use the brushes for other make up stuff.</li>
            <li>I use straight acetone to clean them, just don&#x27;t dip the stem of the brushes in the acetone.</li>
            <li>The sizes of the dotters is a good variety, I like the double ended design, makes it easy to just yank one tool out even when you want various sizes on your art work.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and the brushes are exactly how they appear!</li>
            <li>It came super fast (2 days) and was delivered on a Sunday (which is rare).</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t appear cheap to me, but I&#x27;m new at using these and am not a Nail Tech.</li>
            <li>great gift, my wife loved it, fast shipping seller, and durable products, the bag is nicely made, and the handy book that comes with the purchase as direct download in pretty smart idea, cutting down shipping weight on actual product, will surely buy again</li>
            <li>She is happy with them, but we had already had to glue several of the metal heads back to the wood handles.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for teen niece who should get good use of kit as she changes the color and design of her nails frequently</li>
            <li>Our 14 year old grand daughter really enjoys creating fancy nails</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>The handles seem pretty cheap, but the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very nice and solid nail art kit along with a ebook on how to use the various tools</li>
            <li>I have just been sticking it back on and using it anyways, and it will be a pretty easy fix with some super glue, but there is still the fact that it came off.</li>
            <li>And the delivery was fast!</li>

            <li>the case is not of great quality and I can already tell that the clips/ clasps will not last long.</li>

            <li>The brushes came in a really nice black fold over bag.</li>
            <li>Only a minor inconvenience to fix, else-wise a good buy.</li>
            <li>I wanted smaller tools, these are ok just not small enough for my needs for fine art work.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I know she will really like it.</li>
            <li>she will be very please with them.</li>
            <li>, however I really like the presentation and the variety of brushes.  </li>

            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I will have to seek out a bit of advice elsewhere online to really understand how to make the fan brushes work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this brushes!</li>
            <li>These items were much nicer than I thought they would be.  </li>

            <li>I needed a smaller thinner brush to shade my eyebrows and these fit the bill.</li>

            <li>It was a gift and the &amp;#34;How to&amp;#34; booklet  on line was very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much,  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li>They came right away and they are just what my 13 year old daughter wanted.</li>
            <li>a major holiday cause she did created cute nail designs obviously on her kid girly hands.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they seem okay.</li>
            <li>The only two cons about this kit is if you try to clean the brushes with remover the purple paint comes off.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same quality, great for doing small detail, dotting, and anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li>We spent a fun afternoon trying them out and were really surprised at how easy they made it to add pizzazz to our nails.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of a funky smell when you first open, but everything seems good so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very new to nail art</li>
            <li>The tools are stored nicely in this small pouch.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that it is hard to find good striping brushes, but other than the brush falling off, they have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>My nail art has been raised a level now that I have the proper tools in a proper holder. :-)</li>
            <li>The different shapes and sizes of brush only help make more designs.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this product is that it has to be clear with nail polish thinner (hard to find even in beauty supply stores) and properly washed without the use of nail polish remover in order to keep the brushes perfect.</li>
            <li>All of the brush handles were securely fastened to the metal bristle holders, and none of the bristles came loose.</li>
            <li>The handles of the dotting tools are works of art and the carrying case is in keeping with a high end product.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The closest I can come to a complaint is to wish that the depth of the brush sleeves and the overall size of the case were a little smaller, since the height of the case is several inches greater than the actual length of even the longest brush; if the case were just an inch or two shorter, it would have fit perfectly into the organizer for the rest of my tools and equipment.</li>
            <li>Bought theses for my 12 year old daughter and she loves them!!</li>
            <li>My Grandaugther who is 11 years old absolutely loves this kit.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my 13 year old because she is really into nail art.  </li>
            <li>(Next time I have a success, I&#x27;ll add a photo to this</li>
            <li>(Next time I have a success, I&#x27;ll add a photo to this review.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very professional looking and the brushes are fairly high quality.  </li>
            <li>I can only say they arrived on time, they are very pretty, and it looks like a complete set like my nail person uses.</li>
            <li>, if was going to refer to computer each time new technique would be tried.  </li>
            <li>They spend a lot of time trying out new products and techniques relating to beauty.</li>
            <li>I am a new nail tech</li>
            <li>Professional grade!</li>
            <li>She added that the  E-Book that came with the set was extremely helpful, and has already had to purchase more polish removal from all the different designs etc.</li>
            <li>One problem with these is that they don&#x27;t fit down into the nail polish bottle.  </li>
            <li>shipping was quick, brushes seam to be of decent quality however one came broken with the bristle top disconnected from the wooed handle; it glues back together.</li>
            <li>I have no problem with paint or polish being stuck in them or dying the bristles, even the white ones clean well, and they all come back soft just cleaning with acetone.  </li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>So far no shedding either.</li>
            <li>I am far from a professional.</li>
            <li>I have used only a few of the tools so far and LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I like the set so far not complaints.</li>
            <li>Really recommend buying this for any nail work, I am starting In the nail world and this set has make it for me!!</li>
            <li>The roll away style makes it very convenient especially with the magnetic clasps.  </li>
            <li>but so far, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I received the nail art kit and was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Daughter is 10 years old and has created all types of professional designs on her nails with this kit.  </li>
            <li>So far I am liking this brush and dotting tool set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these brushes for a few of my nail art projects and I can&#x27;t love them enough.</li>
            <li>My fault though, I should have paid closer attention to the item description if I was shopping for something in a specific size rather than something high quality.</li>
            <li>For those just starting out I highly recommend watching missjenfabulous beginners videos for nail art.</li>
            <li>The case does smell slightly, but that is expected with most cases like this.</li>
            <li>I am interested to try the fan brushes next although I will admit my first few attempts were failures.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old sister!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to plastic smells, leave this open in an unused room or the garage or something for a night and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only took 3 (standard) shipping days and seller was very in-touch throughout entire process.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I have three other sets similar to this one and they were a little more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please and will tell other about you.</li>
            <li>These are a lot of fun for an amateur like myself.</li>
            <li>Two of the pointy needles kind of got loose from the main stick but nothing that crazy glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I am not great with the brushes but the pens worked easily.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s so cute</li>
            <li> , you can do many things with it</li>
            <li> Love this kit</li>
            <li> Contacted by seller to make sure I got the pdf of instructions (not a book) and then to make sure I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d looked at others and the dotting pens on this one seem to be the best in different dot sizes.</li>
            <li> If I were a nail artist I would be beyond pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I feel like they should have been more sizes.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using the dotting tools.</li>
            <li> The set is better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a guy that does not know jack about nail art.</li>
            <li> The color of the handles is as depicted, the dotting tools have the ribbony design in the handles and it&#x27;s quite cute.  </li>

            <li> I love the kit, it has everything you need.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price, product better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes and the dotters.</li>
            <li> Love that it came with an instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> I will look into more products from this company.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, this was a gift for my best friend who loves to do nails at home, she absolutely loved this, thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Nice set excited to use it</li>
            <li> They are definitely high quality tools and brushes and the case is great for storing them.</li>
            <li> Wife is loving decorating granddaughter&#x27;s toes and hers with these special tools.</li>
            <li> Loved it as first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and the little ebook is nice.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a nice pouch to keep the tools in.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice set of beginner nail art brushes and were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Cleaning that up required taking more paint off the handle and an acetone soak to wipe it clean, but the wood under was nice and smooth with no splinters or defects.</li>
            <li> though I can&#x27;t comment on how well this product works since I purchased it as a gift, it is far more attractive</li>
            <li> I bought this set and honestly didn&#x27;t bother with the free e-download of the idea book (you do not get the book with your purchase, just the free download).</li>
            <li> It is always challenging finding brushes for fine detail work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Very cool - just wish there were instructions and ideas to go with it.</li>

            <li> They seem well-made and the case holds them securely between uses.</li>
            <li> They are all what I need for my nail arts which comes with a free e-book of guidance for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> There is really every kind of design you can use these for.</li>
            <li> The case is very convenient and the brushes and dotters are amazing.</li>
            <li> It was a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> I would assume that if you&#x27;re going to use them for nail art the manufacturer would make them so they fit into the bottle.  </li>
            <li> i used the tiny brush, which was great at outlining.</li>
            <li> And I really like the pouch, handy</li>
            <li> Really good kit for professional looking nails at home.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter (14 years old) was thrilled with this set.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I used it right away and love it already.</li>
            <li> Book is mediocre at best, YouTube and pinterest have better resources, but the product itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are higher end products</li>
            <li> They are having so much fun doing their nails!</li>
            <li> I am more interested in using this for art and sculpture of miniatures.</li>
            <li> Excited to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for doing my nails at home. :)</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was good!</li>
            <li> but I think they are good and the little case is really nice to have.</li>
            <li> (Note: don&#x27;t try to clean the weighing boats --</li>
            <li> (Note: don&#x27;t try to clean the weighing boats --</li>
            <li> As a bonus to me, she does not know I got it on a lightning deal at a super cheap price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced just right, and the carrying case makes it so convenient!</li>
            <li> Brushes and case very nice but 2 of the actual brush parts fell right</li>
            <li> While I do agree that the set could benefit from the brush handles being a little smaller to fit inside the polish bottles (which can be very easily solved), this set is absolutely perfect for beginners.</li>
            <li> 12 year old was thrilled with the kit and is devouring the e-book.</li>
            <li> i stayed up for about 4 hours painting the day i got this in the mail because i was highly satisfied with my nail art thanks to the variety of the brushes.</li>
            <li> The striper isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;boingy,&amp;#34; it runs true to my line where I want it.</li>
            <li> I am new at doing my own nails and I am having fun.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be an appealing useful gift for those interested in fingernail art- at the right price.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in only 3 days from purchase, amazing seeing as I used Free Shipping which has 5-8 shipping days.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and great for simple to intricate nail designs!</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes, I was surprised with how fast the shipping was.</li>
            <li> so I had time to adequately work with them before I made a decision.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the dotting tools and fine brushes, but so far everything works great.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools are very pretty with the purple design.</li>
            <li> I look forward to many new designs  .</li>
            <li> I love my New Art Brush nail kit.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really fast!!</li>
            <li> Plan on making that as my new 2015 years resolution to get in that habit of creating cute and fun designs using this nail art kit.</li>
            <li> The book was easy to download and my daughter will love it for her Christmas present.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little set.  </li>
            <li> An amazing gift for any female who enjoys spending time doing nails.</li>
            <li> items looked well, however upon opening, some brushes were mostly out of the pouches rather than secure, same goes for the plastic protection.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of different tools in a nice roll-up case.</li>
            <li> so I can start doing different designs on my own without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I have found disposable plastic weighing boats (meant for chemistry labs) to be useful for this.</li>
            <li> The booklet is useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.oats (meant for chemistry labs) to be useful for this.</li>
            <li> The booklet is useful.</li>
            <li> It is really worth the price</li>
            <li> For the price they are worth buying.</li>
            <li> Good set, paint comes off brushes when using remover be careful of that.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected, quality was good</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The ebook is a nice extra!</li>
            <li> I am having fun learning how to do nail art on my toes with the brushes.  </li>
            <li> doing it as a hobby and for friends, something fun to piddle with for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 11 and 8 year old granddaughters to keep up their creative interest in nail art.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with their customer service.</li>
            <li> Carry bag was worth it, keeps everything in place.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this set for beginners and even for the more advanced.</li>
            <li> The set is exactly how it was described and shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> Product exactly as described and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> gf loved it, shes says shes gona use the brushes for other make up stuff.</li>
            <li> I use straight acetone to clean them, just don&#x27;t dip the stem of the brushes in the acetone.</li>
            <li> The sizes of the dotters is a good variety, I like the double ended design, makes it easy to just yank one tool out even when you want various sizes on your art work.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and the brushes are exactly how they appear!</li>
            <li> It came super fast (2 days) and was delivered on a Sunday (which is rare).</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t appear cheap to me, but I&#x27;m new at using these and am not a Nail Tech.</li>
            <li> great gift, my wife loved it, fast shipping seller, and durable products, the bag is nicely made, and the handy book that comes with the purchase as direct download in pretty smart idea, cutting down shipping weight on actual product, will surely buy again</li>
            <li> She is happy with them, but we had already had to glue several of the metal heads back to the wood handles.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for teen niece who should get good use of kit as she changes the color and design of her nails frequently</li>
            <li> Our 14 year old grand daughter really enjoys creating fancy nails</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> The handles seem pretty cheap, but the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice and solid nail art kit along with a ebook on how to use the various tools</li>
            <li> I have just been sticking it back on and using it anyways, and it will be a pretty easy fix with some super glue, but there is still the fact that it came off.</li>
            <li> And the delivery was fast!</li>

            <li> This is my first nail brush set</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The brush set is exactly what I need to keep my brushes from getting bed head.</li>
            <li> the case is not of great quality and I can already tell that the clips/ clasps will not last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just received my purchase (in amazing time, about a week since purchasing) and haven&#x27;t gotten to really test them out too much</li>

            <li> She is excited about the different uses for all of the brushes, mostly about the 10 different dotting sizes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Even if you are really new to nail art, you can do some fun things.</li>
            <li> The brushes came in a really nice black fold over bag.</li>
            <li> Only a minor inconvenience to fix, else-wise a good buy.</li>
            <li> I wanted smaller tools, these are ok just not small enough for my needs for fine art work.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I know she will really like it.</li>
            <li> she will be very please with them.</li>
            <li> , however I really like the presentation and the variety of brushes.  </li>
            <li> These brushes work really well for me.</li>
            <li> The book sent is also very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I will have to seek out a bit of advice elsewhere online to really understand how to make the fan brushes work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very well used it alot</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> She said they are very well made and she likes using them a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brushes!</li>
            <li> These items were much nicer than I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> One of my brushes arrived broke and they offered to replace the whole set or refund me $5.</li>
            <li> The brushes and dotting tools are very well made.</li>
            <li> I really like the kit and look forward to trying some of the techniques shown in the e-book.</li>
            <li> She is really into nail art and also learns a lot of techniques on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> I needed a smaller thinner brush to shade my eyebrows and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The ebook it&#x27;s really helpful for someone that doesn&#x27;t know much about the functions of each brush.</li>
            <li> Very affordable too.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and the &amp;#34;How to&amp;#34; booklet  on line was very helpful.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much,  </li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> They came right away and they are just what my 13 year old daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> a major holiday cause she did created cute nail designs obviously on her kid girly hands.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they seem okay.</li>
            <li> The only two cons about this kit is if you try to clean the brushes with remover the purple paint comes off.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same quality, great for doing small detail, dotting, and anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li> We spent a fun afternoon trying them out and were really surprised at how easy they made it to add pizzazz to our nails.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of a funky smell when you first open, but everything seems good so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very new to nail art</li>
            <li> The tools are stored nicely in this small pouch.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that it is hard to find good striping brushes, but other than the brush falling off, they have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> My nail art has been raised a level now that I have the proper tools in a proper holder. :-)</li>
            <li> The different shapes and sizes of brush only help make more designs.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that it has to be clear with nail polish thinner (hard to find even in beauty supply stores) and properly washed without the use of nail polish remover in order to keep the brushes perfect.</li>
            <li> All of the brush handles were securely fastened to the metal bristle holders, and none of the bristles came loose.</li>
            <li> The handles of the dotting tools are works of art and the carrying case is in keeping with a high end product.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The closest I can come to a complaint is to wish that the depth of the brush sleeves and the overall size of the case were a little smaller, since the height of the case is several inches greater than the actual length of even the longest brush; if the case were just an inch or two shorter, it would have fit perfectly into the organizer for the rest of my tools and equipment.</li>
            <li> Bought theses for my 12 year old daughter and she loves them!!</li>
            <li> My Grandaugther who is 11 years old absolutely loves this kit.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my 13 year old because she is really into nail art.  </li>
            <li> (Next time I have a success, I&#x27;ll add a photo to this</li>
            <li> (Next time I have a success, I&#x27;ll add a photo to this review.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very professional looking and the brushes are fairly high quality.  </li>
            <li> I can only say they arrived on time, they are very pretty, and it looks like a complete set like my nail person uses.</li>
            <li> , if was going to refer to computer each time new technique would be tried.  </li>
            <li> They spend a lot of time trying out new products and techniques relating to beauty.</li>
            <li> I am a new nail tech</li>
            <li> Professional grade!</li>
            <li> She added that the  E-Book that came with the set was extremely helpful, and has already had to purchase more polish removal from all the different designs etc.</li>
            <li> One problem with these is that they don&#x27;t fit down into the nail polish bottle.  </li>
            <li> shipping was quick, brushes seam to be of decent quality however one came broken with the bristle top disconnected from the wooed handle; it glues back together.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with paint or polish being stuck in them or dying the bristles, even the white ones clean well, and they all come back soft just cleaning with acetone.  </li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> So far no shedding either.</li>
            <li> I am far from a professional.</li>
            <li> I have used only a few of the tools so far and LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I like the set so far not complaints.</li>
            <li> Really recommend buying this for any nail work, I am starting In the nail world and this set has make it for me!!</li>
            <li> The roll away style makes it very convenient especially with the magnetic clasps.  </li>
            <li> but so far, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I received the nail art kit and was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Daughter is 10 years old and has created all types of professional designs on her nails with this kit.  </li>
            <li> So far I am liking this brush and dotting tool set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for a few of my nail art projects and I can&#x27;t love them enough.</li>
            <li> My fault though, I should have paid closer attention to the item description if I was shopping for something in a specific size rather than something high quality.</li>
            <li> For those just starting out I highly recommend watching missjenfabulous beginners videos for nail art.</li>
            <li> The case does smell slightly, but that is expected with most cases like this.</li>
            <li> I am interested to try the fan brushes next although I will admit my first few attempts were failures.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old sister!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to plastic smells, leave this open in an unused room or the garage or something for a night and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only took 3 (standard) shipping days and seller was very in-touch throughout entire process.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I have three other sets similar to this one and they were a little more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please and will tell other about you.</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun for an amateur like myself.</li>
            <li> Two of the pointy needles kind of got loose from the main stick but nothing that crazy glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I am not great with the brushes but the pens worked easily.</li>
            <li> Also they are very hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I give just two star before, I downloaded the EBOOK and I just find that it was originally bend!</li>
            <li> Most brushes fell apart right away, very bad quality</li>
            <li> They are going to allow me to do some delicate filigree work and legible</li>
            <li> Using these for an art project and not a professional nail artist</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been using kits like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will post picture so you can see what I mean since I can&#x27;t explain it really well.</li>
            <li> but I was so tired of paying $50-60 to get fake nails and a good manicure every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> She said the tutorials are not very good however she downloaded the EBook and said that the instructions are very clear and helpful.  </li>
            <li> Excelent, like all other reviews, only thing is the dotting tools, two of the big, two of the small, should be each different sizes.</li>

            <li> I got the brushes well before the expected date.  </li>
            <li> I received the item quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a total waste</li>
            <li> The price and quality afforded me the ability to play without feeling like I over spent.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife who has enough of this stuff to stock several nail salons (seriously).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brushes before.</li>
            <li> It only toke 3 days with Amazon prime and that was because of the weekend if not I&#x27;m sure it would have been 2 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they would compare to other brushes/ dotting tools that are being sold for around 3 or 4 bucks</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with the brushes for the past several months.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to try the other tools.</li>
            <li> I had a small bump one of the brushes but that doesn&#x27;t mid me at all!</li>
            <li> For some of the brushes, I had to repeat this a few times and pat dry with a paper towel in between.</li>

            <li> *decided to change my review and bring the set down to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> the possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re painted themselves so the paint they have will strip and make a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s have complained about their tools falling apart from other manufacturer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for a little while and likes them.</li>
            <li> I poured a little non-acetone nail polish remover in a bowl (not plastic) and swirled the tools around until the polish came off.</li>

            <li> The amber bristled fan brush got a little clumpy after about 4 nails, but that may have been my paint/polish, not the brush.</li>
            <li> It shows a few brushes and then says what it can be used for.</li>
            <li> When I emailed about the broken piece I received an email back within an hour.</li>
            <li> The hairs are not cheap and do not shed when used.</li>
            <li> I held off on writing my review for a few months after receiving them</li>
            <li> All the protection they need in one small holder.</li>
            <li> At least, I know there has to be a lot of tutorials online for me to watch!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed as one of the brushes was bent.</li>
            <li> My wife is in a nursing home she is bedridden and unable to use her hands and fingers</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she&#x27;s obsessed with nail art.</li>
            <li> but I hate to have her pour the polish out and waste that just to get a design.</li>
            <li> However I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the book being an e-book</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It arrived on time.  The book was easy to download and my daughter will love it for her Christmas present.  I&#x27;d definitely look to purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Bought this kit for my daughter, she was and still happy with it.sooo many projects she has done Halloween was a major holiday cause she did created cute nail designs obviously on her kid girly hands. Two of the pointy needles kind of got loose from the main stick but nothing that crazy glue couldn&#x27;t fix. Besides that everything was and is perfect.</li>
            <li> Bought theses for my 12 year old daughter and she loves them!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Set, I have not used it yet but it arrived fast and it looks to be a very nice set!</li>
            <li> Book is mediocre at best, YouTube and pinterest have better resources, but the product itself is fantastic! Any nail diy-er definitely needs these!</li>
            <li> Just okay. One of the brushes fell apart when I opened the package. Other than that, they seem okay.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this kit to use on polymer clay (I use the brushes for painting pieces and the &amp;#34;dotting&amp;#34; tools as stylus tools to shape the clay).  Very happy with it.  Quick delivery and a nice pouch to keep the tools in.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased the set for my pre-teen daughter and she loves it! It&#x27;s a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for a few of my nail art projects and I can&#x27;t love them enough. The case is perfect for storage and each brush works wonderfully with either nail polish or craft paint. You can&#x27;t beat the price either, especially since it ships domestically and you don&#x27;t have to wait weeks to cross the ocean to get here.</li>
            <li> It arrived in only 3 days from purchase, amazing seeing as I used Free Shipping which has 5-8 shipping days.&lt;br /&gt;All items looked well, however upon opening, some brushes were mostly out of the pouches rather than secure, same goes for the plastic protection. Only a minor inconvenience to fix, else-wise a good buy.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time - the set was great and my nieces loved it.</li>
            <li> This was a presente for my niece and she is very satisfied and happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter - and she says that is great!  She&#x27;s always making different designs on her nails, and this kit is with her almost constantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my daughter. I know she will really like it. There are a lot of different tools in a nice roll-up case.</li>
            <li> Great product. Professional grade!</li>
            <li> great product and awesome shipping time!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for a little while and likes them. Delivery was quick the tools were better than I exoected but I am no expert by any means.</li>
            <li> I received my order of nail Art Brushes , It is a gift for my Granddaughter, they look great she will be very please with them. And the delivery was fast! I&#x27;m very please and will tell other about you. Thank you and have a blessed Christmas.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! It came on time, it is everything i have always wanted so I can start doing different designs on my own without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Great communication and great product!!</li>
            <li> I did receive but this is a Xmas gift for my Teenage Granddaughter .  It looks great packaging was good and items look really nice.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b1386667c763153f069cf53f0e8dcb7b]] I do not really have nails, however, I do theatre, photography and face painting make-up. It is always challenging finding brushes for fine detail work. These brushes are great for that purpose. They are going to allow me to do some delicate filigree work and legible script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the product up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own. I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description. The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions. I hope this look at the products has helped you make the decision to buy or not to buy. Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
            <li> Received by date as promised.  Did not open, as gifts.  Will have to wait until after Christmas for recipients to say if they liked this product.  Seemed to be an appealing useful gift for those interested in fingernail art- at the right price.  Guide was 55 pages long--that is a lot of paper and ink if printed..thoughtful addition, if was going to refer to computer each time new technique would be tried.  Not very practical.</li>
            <li> Really good kit for professional looking nails at home. Diverse tools for salon style.</li>
            <li> treated myself with this getting it soon after christmas, i can not wait to start using it. Plan on making that as my new 2015 years resolution to get in that habit of creating cute and fun designs using this nail art kit.</li>
            <li> Got it today and it is awesome!! Love it.</li>
            <li> Everything came perfectly intact!</li>
            <li> Love it. Looks exactly like what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Excelent, like all other reviews, only thing is the dotting tools, two of the big, two of the small, should be each different sizes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was shown. Came very quickly. My granddaughters are very happy.</li>
            <li> These are great. Cane nicely packaged with no flaws.</li>
            <li> I received this on time and what I got looks exactly like the picture.  I have not tested them yet, however I really like the presentation and the variety of brushes.  I do wish there was more room to put my art tools, but I managed to squeeze my dotting tools in by doubling up on spaces.</li>
            <li> I Got the EBook. very nice format and easy to use and follow. The brushes came in a really nice black fold over bag. The brushes don&#x27;t appear cheap to me, but I&#x27;m new at using these and am not a Nail Tech. So I think they are great, I really love the look of the dotting tools, they are a beautiful shade if lavender and white swirl, I&#x27;m fixing to start doing my nail today so maybe I can get back to u on how they actually work.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter-in-law she loved it.</li>
            <li> These were bought as a gift so I can&#x27;t rate how well they work or anything. I can only say they arrived on time, they are very pretty, and it looks like a complete set like my nail person uses.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it came with an instruction booklet or design ideas.</li>
            <li> All arrived just fine.  I do need the e-mail for free e-book.</li>
            <li> I love this set, it has all the brushes and nail art tools you could want and then some. The closest I can come to a complaint is to wish that the depth of the brush sleeves and the overall size of the case were a little smaller, since the height of the case is several inches greater than the actual length of even the longest brush; if the case were just an inch or two shorter, it would have fit perfectly into the organizer for the rest of my tools and equipment. My fault though, I should have paid closer attention to the item description if I was shopping for something in a specific size rather than something high quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and the little ebook is nice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> Excellent value! Very nice pouch and  brushes well protected. Thankyou</li>
            <li> Also sharing with my nail artist! the possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> I love these nail art brushes! The only two cons about this kit is if you try to clean the brushes with remover the purple paint comes off.  Also they are very hard to clean.  Over all they work great!</li>
            <li> Love them perfect for nail art and I loved the book that was included :)</li>
            <li> Looks nice.  Easy to carry</li>
            <li> It is good. I like it</li>
            <li> Exactly the tools I needed and Higher quality then I thought, Love It!!</li>
            <li> They look like a lot of creative fun. My grand daughter will have fun with them.</li>
            <li> These brushes work really well for me.</li>
            <li> Using these for an art project and not a professional nail artist but they&#x27;re great.  Very high quality and a good variety of shapes and sizes.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very nice! Its a great set has everything youll need. So far no shedding either.</li>
            <li> Great product fast service will buy from this buyer again!</li>
            <li> Daughter got into doing nails so bought these brushes for her to work along with videos.  She is happy with them, but we had already had to glue several of the metal heads back to the wood handles.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter who turned 22! She was really happy with all the brushes and tools, she immediately started experimenting with them.  She added that the  E-Book that came with the set was extremely helpful, and has already had to purchase more polish removal from all the different designs etc. that she has already tried!</li>
            <li> An amazing gift for any female who enjoys spending time doing nails.</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal for all these brushes and dotting pens ! I am having so much fun ! Great creative tools. !</li>
            <li> Love this set.  Has all the tools I need for at home nail art.</li>
            <li> Great nail art set.  The book sent is also very helpful.  Looking forward to designing my nails with this nice set with the added bonus of having its own storage case.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality brushes, good variety, exactly what I was looking for.  However I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the book being an e-book</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Product was on point.</li>
            <li> Some brushes were damaged</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of beginner nail art brushes and were shipped quickly. I would have given this 5 stars but some of the brushes are a bit wobbly where the metal attaches to the wood.</li>
            <li> Nail art is something I&#x27;ve wanted to try for awhile so I was happy to receive this set. It has pretty much everything a beginner would want. I feel like the components of the set are well-made. All of the brush handles were securely fastened to the metal bristle holders, and none of the bristles came loose. There was something of a plastic smell when I first opened the package, but that dissipated overnight. If you are sensitive to plastic smells, leave this open in an unused room or the garage or something for a night and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the dotting tools make the same size dots. I like this, though, because you can make dots in different colors that are the same size without cleaning the tools between uses (see my photo for one example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The e-booklet that comes with the set is definitely for beginners, as well. (If you don&#x27;t receive a download link for the e-booklet, contact the seller and they will send it to you.) I like that it walks you through what each brush is and gives examples of how to use it. More experienced people might not need that level of explanation, but I certainly do. There are some design ideas, or you can always just look for ideas online. Most (if not all) of the tools you will see in online tutorials are available in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are really new to nail art, you can do some fun things. I attached a picture of what I did with the dotting tools. (Please forgive the messiness of my manicure. I am far from a professional. But I am improving. And any mistakes are my fault, not that of the dotting tools.) I am interested to try the fan brushes next although I will admit my first few attempts were failures. I will have to seek out a bit of advice elsewhere online to really understand how to make the fan brushes work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes and tools are not meant to be dipped into polish bottles. I would suggest pouring or dripping polish out into another container and using it from there. I have found disposable plastic weighing boats (meant for chemistry labs) to be useful for this. They&#x27;re cheap and Amazon sells a variety. Get the smallest ones you can or use all the corners of larger ones for different colors. (Note: don&#x27;t try to clean the weighing boats -- nail polish remover may dissolve them. Just throw them out after use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple. I poured a little non-acetone nail polish remover in a bowl (not plastic) and swirled the tools around until the polish came off. For some of the brushes, I had to repeat this a few times and pat dry with a paper towel in between. Although the booklet says to clean the tools as you work, that is not always easy. And I am worried that I will mess up my progress if I have an open container of nail polish remover around while I am doing my nails. (FYI, if you think you will get polish on your fingers while you are working, you may want to use Q-tips or other cotton swabs instead of cotton balls to apply acetone to the skin. Or you can use a corrector pen. This will be less likely to damage your manicure.) Please try to only touch the ends of the bristles or dotting tool in the nail polish remover, and not the handles, or you may have some paint/coloring come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the variety of tools you receive. They seem well-made and the case holds them securely between uses. The booklet is useful. Now I just need to practice. (Next time I have a success, I&#x27;ll add a photo to this review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.oats (meant for chemistry labs) to be useful for this.

            <li> Very well used it alot</li>
            <li> gf loved it, shes says shes gona use the brushes for other make up stuff.</li>
            <li> These are some nice brushes. The case is beautiful and the brushes are good quality. It is beautiful for the price</li>
            <li> Wonderful value and great product</li>
            <li> Great buy my daughter enjoyed thing.</li>
            <li> Just what I had been searching for</li>
            <li> everything arrived and is awesome...thank you!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for teen niece who should get good use of kit as she changes the color and design of her nails frequently</li>
            <li> Quite an impressive looking set for how inexpensive it was.  I&#x27;d buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Have not used all the tools yet, but the stripers work well and the tools look solid and well made.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these tools yet, but they look exactly as I expected. The case does smell slightly, but that is expected with most cases like this. The brushes fit in nicely and are in perfect condition and I love the color. I did receive the book and after a quick scan through looks like there will be some good information in there on how to use all these tools. Looking forward to using these.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, this was a gift for my best friend who loves to do nails at home, she absolutely loved this, thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality for such a good price. Was bought as a gift for someone going ro school for cosmetology and her favorite part is nails. She loved these when she used them and she found that it consisted of every tool needed to have beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> amazing product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Most brushes fell apart right away, very bad quality</li>
            <li> Ordered Friday, received Sunday!!!  Haven&#x27;t used the products yet, but after inspecting and fumbling around with them, they appear to be sturdy and durable.  Other&#x27;s have complained about their tools falling apart from other manufacturer&#x27;s.  I am also excited about the FREE Nail Art Instruction Guide (ebook) that came with the kit; great for beginners like myself.  Seems like News8Beauty is the way to go!!!</li>
            <li> These are really very nice nail art brushes.I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Everything came just as it was explained. Everything in great shape. I have used only a few of the tools so far and LOVE them.</li>
            <li> shipping was quick, brushes seam to be of decent quality however one came broken with the bristle top disconnected from the wooed handle; it glues back together. There are 5 double ended dotting tools but two of them are duplicates. There are a total of 5 different sizes dot sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the kit is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my teenage grand daughters. They spend a lot of time trying out new products and techniques relating to beauty. This kit seems to be very complete and good quality. I think they will them!</li>
            <li> The brushes was delivered on time and exactly as described. They are all what I need for my nail arts which comes with a free e-book of guidance for a beginner like me. I also love the pouch that holds all brushes in order.  It is really worth the price and I would recommend for anyone who are looking for a set of handy brushes for nail arts.</li>
            <li> ... F I v e s t a r s</li>
            <li> My nail art has been raised a level now that I have the proper tools in a proper holder. :-)</li>
            <li> Not paint covered wood so poslish remover does not ruin the finish</li>
            <li> I like the set so far not complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice set excited to use it</li>
            <li> Nice brush set. It includes nail and makeup brushes. It has a nice case to store items in and keep from losing them. It also has a plastic piece that covers the brushes to keep them from falling out of the case. I have not used all of the brushes yet but they seem to be made well and work well. For the price they are worth buying.</li>
            <li> Great price for this kit @ $12.99! I have three other sets similar to this one and they were a little more. They&#x27;re the same quality, great for doing small detail, dotting, and anything else you can think of. I do nails so I&#x27;ve been using kits like this for a long time. The dotting tools are very pretty with the purple design. I use straight acetone to clean them, just don&#x27;t dip the stem of the brushes in the acetone. They&#x27;re painted themselves so the paint they have will strip and make a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I am a cosmotologist and these are amazing for nails! They arrived quickly and love the color :) great buy!!</li>
            <li> Received everything intact!! Delivery was really fast!! Really good quality for a great price!! Really recommend buying this for any nail work, I am starting In the nail world and this set has make it for me!! Plus you get a free e book!!</li>
            <li> 12 year old was thrilled with the kit and is devouring the e-book. Thanks, timely delivery with good packaging, etc.</li>
            <li> I love it and I already use them.</li>
            <li> The case is cheap but the brushes work great.</li>
            <li> fast service, great products</li>
            <li> its great i love it!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! Very good quality.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Best assortment of nail tools out there! There is really every kind of design you can use these for. The pouch is great closing with two push buttons. The case easily unrolls while keeping your brushes in place. All the protection they need in one small holder. The different shapes and sizes of brush only help make more designs. The quality seems to be really nice I&#x27;m sure there are higher end products but your going to pay a fortune for. I can use these at home on my daughter and that is exactly why I bought them. I need sensible priced and good quality and this has both. Now, I need to practice. The Ebook has lots of pictures and words but not step by step designs. It shows a few brushes and then says what it can be used for. At least, I know there has to be a lot of tutorials online for me to watch! I received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but I never got the free book and a tool was already broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> though I can&#x27;t comment on how well this product works since I purchased it as a gift, it is far more attractive than I expected based on the photos.  The handles of the dotting tools are works of art and the carrying case is in keeping with a high end product.  I will be proud to give this to my friend.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes well before the expected date.  They look great but won&#x27;t use them since they are a Christmas gift for family.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters and granddaughters and they love it. They are having so much fun doing their nails!</li>
            <li> Very nice set for the price, haven&#x27;t use them yet but look good quality</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old sister! She&#x27;s going to love it!! Only took 3 (standard) shipping days and seller was very in-touch throughout entire process.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!!</li>
            <li> love the quality of the brushes</li>
            <li> Nice brush set.  However, I never received my ebook.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this kit! I received it quickly and everything from the case it is kept in to the tools themselves is of good quality. My 11 year old daughter is so excited to get started and this kit has every imaginable tool she might need. Great service as well.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for someone, and they love it.  They&#x27;re very in to doing their nails, and they love the variety of tools in the package; it helps expand their creative horizons :)  I didn&#x27;t see the link for the ebook, and when I contacted the seller they responded immediately with a download link.  The ebook is quite basic, but does explain how to use the tools and gives ideas about design.</li>
            <li> I love these, they work perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. I received exactly what was advertised, and the brushes appear to be very good quality and as well as the storage pouch that comes with it. I was also pleasantly surprised by the free e-book I received that explained tips, tricks, and caring for these brushes. This is my first nail brush set and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Made doing my own nails so much easier!</li>
            <li> Got it.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine. Haven&#x27;t opened them because they are a gift.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described and they made good contact</li>
            <li> These look to be fine tools for detailed painting ... of all kinds. I&#x27;m looking forward to using them. Thanks</li>
            <li> I absolulety love this nail art set. The brushes are good quality and the ebook really helps to understand the purpose of each tool. I believe that this is a great buy for the price. Moreover, the cover helps keep all of the brushes packed up neatly. I recommend this product to all nail art fanatics!</li>
            <li> I wanted smaller tools, these are ok just not small enough for my needs for fine art work.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister and she LOVES them! She is excited about the different uses for all of the brushes, mostly about the 10 different dotting sizes.</li>
            <li> These are great!! I would give them five stars, but my striping brush fell off of the handle. I have just been sticking it back on and using it anyways, and it will be a pretty easy fix with some super glue, but there is still the fact that it came off. I have heard that it is hard to find good striping brushes, but other than the brush falling off, they have been fantastic. The handles seem pretty cheap, but the bristles are very soft. I only use mine with acrylic paint, and wash it off with water. Doing this keeps the brushes really nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and great for simple to intricate nail designs!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> great gift, my wife loved it, fast shipping seller, and durable products, the bag is nicely made, and the handy book that comes with the purchase as direct download in pretty smart idea, cutting down shipping weight on actual product, will surely buy again</li>
            <li> Our 14 year old grand daughter really enjoys creating fancy nails and she absolutely loved this kit, she thought it was of the finest quality and design.</li>
            <li> i purchased this order and i only received the case for the brushes but the brushes itself wasn&#x27;t in the case.....TOTAL RIP OF!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set for my daughter for a Christmas gift.  She has used most of them already and LOVES them.  She said they are very well made and she likes using them a lot.</li>
            <li> The brush set is exactly what I need to keep my brushes from getting bed head. The roll away style makes it very convenient especially with the magnetic clasps.  The price is perfect for this style tool.  I look forward to many new designs  .</li>
            <li> Brushes and case very nice but 2 of the actual brush parts fell right off/</li>
            <li> Great quality! Highly recommend this brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes fall apart.</li>
            <li> These items were much nicer than I thought they would be.  I ordered them for a gift and am sure they will be liked.</li>
            <li> I Bought this for my daughter -she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set. It was better than I expected. The case is very convenient and the brushes and dotters are amazing. Great customer service as well. One of my brushes arrived broke and they offered to replace the whole set or refund me $5. I decided to just glue the part back on to the handle.  When I emailed about the broken piece I received an email back within an hour. I will definitely be purchasing from here again.</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife and she is very happy with the quality and the versatility of the kit.  It came in a very timely fashion in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The brushes and dotting tools are very well made. I did not give five stars bc the case is not of great quality and I can already tell that the clips/ clasps will not last long.</li>
            <li> Good set, paint comes off brushes when using remover be careful of that. Otherwise wonderful to have</li>
            <li> This is a great little set.  I like the case rolls up and the tools all have protective covers.  I just wish thee book had more photos.  I received the item quicker than expected.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Can&#x27;t wait to play :)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just received the brushes today will give u an update when i try it out but they feel great.  I&#x27;ve used other brushes before. These feel allot better</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a really great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty decent. I&#x27;ve only just received my purchase (in amazing time, about a week since purchasing) and haven&#x27;t gotten to really test them out too much but so far, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Had it open before I could get in the house excellent  tools to have beautiful nails I love this kit and for the price I love it more I would recommend  this product to every nail diva out there</li>
            <li> These are very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I am more interested in using this for art and sculpture of miniatures. I am not that &#x27;Into&amp;#34; nails,  but I will have a girlfriend try out this and another set I purchased and see which interests and works best for her nails and which for my craft making. So far this is awesome for sculpting and minute painting.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that it has to be clear with nail polish thinner (hard to find even in beauty supply stores) and properly washed without the use of nail polish remover in order to keep the brushes perfect. Such is the price for quality.</li>
            <li> I love them!!! very beautiful. Came in earlier than I thought and all in one piece. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them just yet but I can&#x27;t wait til I do lol!!!</li>
            <li> I am not great with the brushes but the pens worked easily. any one could use them</li>
            <li> I am very pleased  with the set and the e book , I find very useful  and informative. Thank you.</li>
            <li> excellent kit, excellent price, got here very fast :)</li>
            <li> Product was as expected, quality was good</li>
            <li> i love these nail art brushes. they are much better than the nail art brushes i purchased from sallys. i havent gotten a chance to use the dotting tools. i stayed up for about 4 hours painting the day i got this in the mail because i was highly satisfied with my nail art thanks to the variety of the brushes. i just wish the dotting tools were labled for size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the dotting tools and fine brushes, but so far everything works great.</li>
            <li> Great brush set.  Absolutely worth the price.  The ebook is a nice extra!</li>
            <li> It is a Christmas gift, but all look good.  It was a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail brush set and delivery was very quick!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set for the money.  It&#x27;s very professional looking and the brushes are fairly high quality.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the kit and look forward to trying some of the techniques shown in the e-book.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my daughter. It looks great. Looks like it has everything she needs for nails.</li>
            <li> I received the nail art kit and was very pleasantly surprised. Everything about it is very nice from the brushes and tools to the roll out pouch. I know my friend is going to love it. Very nicely done. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas present. Hope recipient will like it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I like the way they look.  They seem to be good quality and a very nice set.  Everything I can think that one would need to create beautiful nails!  The set is exactly how it was described and shipping was quick.  I would definitely buy from this seller again!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My Grandaugther who is 11 years old absolutely loves this kit.  She said the tutorials are not very good however she downloaded the EBook and said that the instructions are very clear and helpful.  She is really into nail art and also learns a lot of techniques on YouTube.  Great buy and very prompt service.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with the product and delivery!</li>
            <li> The dotting pens are just perfect and the brushes too. I really love them:-)</li>
            <li> I really love this set, started using it just now and it&#x27;s so cute, you can do many things with it</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing!  I bought it for my 12-yr-old daughter, and she absolutely loves it!  The product is just as it was described, and there were no issues with delivery.  I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I am waiting on the polish order to try the brushes, however I have given the tools microscopic attention and find that they are well made.  The number of tools including a well crafted case make this a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art brush kit! While I do agree that the set could benefit from the brush handles being a little smaller to fit inside the polish bottles (which can be very easily solved), this set is absolutely perfect for beginners. It&#x27;s priced just right, and the carrying case makes it so convenient! I had no idea how to use any of these brushes when I bought them but I was so tired of paying $50-60 to get fake nails and a good manicure every couple of weeks. I bought this set and honestly didn&#x27;t bother with the free e-download of the idea book (you do not get the book with your purchase, just the free download). I looked up videos on youtube.com and found plenty of beginner videos. For those just starting out I highly recommend watching missjenfabulous beginners videos for nail art. You&#x27;ll become an expert in no time! Happy painting!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment,  items as described!</li>
            <li> Great quality!  Love this kit</li>
            <li> A little bit of a funky smell when you first open, but everything seems good so far!</li>
            <li> Gift for my niece. Contacted by seller to make sure I got the pdf of instructions (not a book) and then to make sure I got it. Thank you. I&#x27;d looked at others and the dotting pens on this one seem to be the best in different dot sizes. Excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  My daughter will be thrilled with this for Christmas.  It arrived in immaculate condition and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Daughter is 10 years old and has created all types of professional designs on her nails with this kit.  Checkout &amp;#34;Candy Corn&amp;#34; nail style she did this with perfection.  Wish I had photographed and upload to show you all.  Great set!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Very good value for the money.  The free e-book is a wonderful bonus with this set to help you understand all the brushes &amp; tools too.  Excellent communication from the seller and prompt delivery too.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these for my nails. I needed a smaller thinner brush to shade my eyebrows and these fit the bill. They are of excellent quality, and are easy to maneuver. If I were a nail artist I would be beyond pleased. I can certainly see how these brushes can be masterfully utilized to create unique designs. The hairs are not cheap and do not shed when used. The case used to hold the brushes is also of quality material and it is secured using magnetic snaps. I am pleased and I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg for this so that is a win.</li>
            <li> Wonderful bruises. Great product. Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> These are great. They came right away and they are just what my 13 year old daughter wanted. I think an adult would be happy with them too.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> Love it. Every tool you need to indulge your creative mind in nail art in a nice handy pouch.</li>
            <li> Love my nail set! It came super fast (2 days) and was delivered on a Sunday (which is rare). I used it right away and love it already. It&#x27;s a great buy! *decided to change my review and bring the set down to 3 stars. Loved it as first but after a while when cleaning the brushes, paint came off easily! Got all over the place! Stick to wooden brushes with no paint. Works much better!*</li>
            <li> My grand daughter (14 years old) was thrilled with this set.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed as one of the brushes was bent.</li>
            <li> I loved the set. The brushes are really good and of course the bag they come with us awesome because they are really organized. I only have one complain and is the dotting tools. I feel like they should have been more sizes. They are four sizes in the five double sided dotting tools(10 dots). I will post picture so you can see what I mean since I can&#x27;t explain it really well. The shipping was awesome. It only toke 3 days with Amazon prime and that was because of the weekend if not I&#x27;m sure it would have been 2 days. The ebook it&#x27;s really helpful for someone that doesn&#x27;t know much about the functions of each brush. I don&#x27;t know how they would compare to other brushes/ dotting tools that are being sold for around 3 or 4 bucks but I think they are good and the little case is really nice to have.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes, I was surprised with how fast the shipping was. I would definitely  recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for doing my nails at home. :)</li>
            <li> Very nice and solid nail art kit along with a ebook on how to use the various tools</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner &amp; product was exactly was pictured &amp; described.</li>
            <li> This set looks amazing! Bought this for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday in July so she has seen them or used them. She actually picked these out so I know she will be very happy using them.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit.  I have been experimenting with the brushes for the past several months.  Very affordable too.</li>
            <li> I love my New Art Brush nail kit. I can&#x27;t wait to start making my nails look pretty &amp; sparkly. I purchased this kit because I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and I used hers and loved it. I wanted my own after I used hers. I love that it comes with a free ebook download. That is going to help me a lot. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of nail art brushes!</li>
            <li> I am a new nail tech so this set is perfect! Can&#x27;t wait to try them all!</li>
            <li> I purchased the nail art kit for my wife. My wife is in a nursing home she is bedridden and unable to use her hands and fingers so I paint her finger nails for her. This is the second kit I have purchased. This kit contains every tool that I need to paint artwork onto her nails. I am still learning how to paint fingernails. The quality of the tools are very good and kit is housed in a neat foldable pouch that is easy carry.</li>
            <li> Great selection of tools....my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Really nice kit every tool has its own slot and protective plastic to ensure the are stored well. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Will get a lot of use out of it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the nail art brushes!  We spent a fun afternoon trying them out and were really surprised at how easy they made it to add pizzazz to our nails.  They are definitely high quality tools and brushes and the case is great for storing them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as a gift, but I&#x27;m please with the way it looks. I think my daughter will love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she&#x27;s obsessed with nail art. This kit is awesome! It has everything you need to make beautiful nails!</li>
            <li> Everything looked like what was pictured. The purple paint does come off the brushes if you leave it in the nail polish remover. Other than that, it was good!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter just loves these brushes. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I love them! Perfect for what I needed!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 13 year old because she is really into nail art.  One problem with these is that they don&#x27;t fit down into the nail polish bottle.  I would assume that if you&#x27;re going to use them for nail art the manufacturer would make them so they fit into the bottle.  It&#x27;s not a total waste but I hate to have her pour the polish out and waste that just to get a design.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and the &amp;#34;How to&amp;#34; booklet  on line was very helpful.</li>
            <li> I loved it :-) great seller :-)</li>
            <li> Got here quicker than I thought it would! And they&#x27;re great products</li>
            <li> The brushes and dotting pens are great for novice like me.  I am having fun learning how to do nail art on my toes with the brushes.  The price and quality afforded me the ability to play without feeling like I over spent.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Came on time and it is what it is!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect set for any nail artist. Complete assortment of brushes and dotting tools all in a very nice and easy to carry case. Excellent quality and very professional.</li>
            <li> VERY Fast Delivery!!!!  Thank you so much,  I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Granddaughter, she LOVES it! Excellent product! Will absolutely buy from this company again. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The brushes and dotting tools are exactly what I was looking for. I love the ease of using the dotting tools. These are a lot of fun for an amateur like myself.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. No damages upon opening the product and i used the tiny brush, which was great at outlining. I have yet to try the other tools.</li>
            <li> So sorry I give just two star before, I downloaded the EBOOK and I just find that it was originally bend! Now I know how it works! Love them!</li>
            <li> It was a gift so I couldn&#x27;t tell you lol.</li>
            <li> I got my brush and tool set in a timely manner even tho the weather was impossible. The set is better than I thought it would be. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Love it! I had a small bump one of the brushes but that doesn&#x27;t mid me at all! Always wanted this kinf od brush set and I have it. And I really like the pouch, handy</li>
            <li> I got the brushes today, they look really nice.</li>
            <li> works well for the price</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described and shipped quickly.  I love the colors of these nail tools!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a guy that does not know jack about nail art. I bought these for my wife who has enough of this stuff to stock several nail salons (seriously). She was quite impressed with the selection, quality, and even the pouch everything came in. As a bonus to me, she does not know I got it on a lightning deal at a super cheap price.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this brush and dotting tool set. I held off on writing my review for a few months after receiving them so I had time to adequately work with them before I made a decision.  I wanted to get out the kinks before just saying, &amp;#34;They&#x27;re gorgeous!&amp;#34;  But they really kind of are.  The color of the handles is as depicted, the dotting tools have the ribbony design in the handles and it&#x27;s quite cute.  The sizes of the dotters is a good variety, I like the double ended design, makes it easy to just yank one tool out even when you want various sizes on your art work. The brushes are good quality and clean easily. I have no problem with paint or polish being stuck in them or dying the bristles, even the white ones clean well, and they all come back soft just cleaning with acetone.  The striper isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;boingy,&amp;#34; it runs true to my line where I want it. The amber bristled fan brush got a little clumpy after about 4 nails, but that may have been my paint/polish, not the brush. My one drawback is that the paint on the brush handles comes off if it comes in contact with acetone, and it&#x27;s sticky!  Cleaning that up required taking more paint off the handle and an acetone soak to wipe it clean, but the wood under was nice and smooth with no splinters or defects.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived exactly as represented.</li>
            <li> I love the kit, it has everything you need. I am just beginning so the book sure is a big help.&lt;br /&gt;Just doing it as a hobby and for friends, something fun to piddle with for me.</li>
            <li> You get alot for the price. Comes in a nice storage case.</li>
            <li> Very cool - just wish there were instructions and ideas to go with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 11 and 8 year old granddaughters to keep up their creative interest in nail art. Great price, arrived quickly, and they are thrilled!</li>
            <li> This will be a Christmas gift.  My daughter thinks they are just what she needed to do nails.  The tools are stored nicely in this small pouch.  I think it is going to be a great gift!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have everything in one set.</li>
