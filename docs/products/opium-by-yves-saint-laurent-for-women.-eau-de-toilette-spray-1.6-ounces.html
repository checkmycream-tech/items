            <li>If you like an exotic,  floral smelling perfume than Opium is for you!</li>
            <li>My favorite for years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked this perfume for years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think it is perfume of any kind.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I am familiar with for over 30 years!!.</li>
            <li>this time it came in a &#x27;new&#x27; BEAUTIFUL bottle that looks so glamourous on my bathroom vanity !</li>
            <li>This parfume is the BEST ever created, as far as I&#x27;m concerned!  </li>
            <li>more of a warm spice scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite for many years</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure that Amazon will not allow its service to be used in this manner.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Many times it was a bottle of parfum or cologne.</li>
            <li>This fragrance was always my favorite of all the ones I purchased for her.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of my most favorite perfumes out of over a hundred I purchased her over the years.</li>
            <li>i find opium to be a more dense experience of fragrance...</li>
            <li>it is more sensual...</li>
            <li>it is more spicy...  </li>
            <li>Its fragrance to me is sexy, sultry and alluring and I still enjoy it when she wears it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used the original Opium since 1978 and know the difference.  </li>
            <li>I shopped on line because you can no longer buy the original in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super excited to find this and the price was resonable.</li>
            <li>Pretty as it is---</li>
            <li>Higher cost for this?</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The service and product was even more than I expected !</li>
            <li>and I do not care for the new one as much as this.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this particular &#x27;scent&#x27; for twenty years.  </li>
            <li>what I received is the new junk that YSL is now calling Opium.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the new one, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Opium in the clear glass container and instead got the Opium in the brown container.</li>
            <li>From the picture I thought this would be the old formula of Opium, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this new bottle of Opium is the same as the old bottle of Opium because it is not.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in the new bottle is even different than the old Opium.  </li>
            <li>The company should have given it a new name like Opium II, because when I bought it I thought it was the same as the old Opium only in a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>Suddenly there&#x27;s a new bottle (not the one shown).</li>
            <li>The charged amout I actually paid is more that the invoice states and I have no way to contact, that I&#x27;ve found, to report or make a complaint about or to ask for a refund of the difference.</li>
            <li>I am very aengry to have to pay so much money for such a poor substitute in a similar packaging as the original product I had ordered.  </li>
            <li>Nearly sent it back but couldn&#x27;t be bothered with the online return hassle.</li>
            <li>My only real issue I have, is that the cost I was actually charged and the cost on the enclosed invoice are different.  </li>
            <li>This was quick, less expensive and easy.</li>
            <li>This item was so bad--cannot compare with real Opium by Yves Saint Laurent cologne--why do you deal with companies which hose down your customers?  </li>
            <li>I ordered it - after hunting far too long online - for the sleek flat shape shown in the picture above.</li>
            <li>This is a huge rip-off.  </li>

            <li> I shall stick with Kindle books and hope that I get what I pay for, although even that is questionable.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and it has a very faint scent that is not even a perfume smell!</li>
            <li> My bad I ordered the woman perfume instead of the man .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The wife loves this stuff, she makes a bottle last about a year and it&#x27;s the only one she can wear at the office.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell of it myself!</li>
            <li> The service and product was even more than I expected ! When I have ordered this product in the past I received EXACTLY what was shown...this time it came in a &#x27;new&#x27; BEAUTIFUL bottle that looks so glamourous on my bathroom vanity !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this perfume for years.  It has a slight musky scent, but not overpowering for day use.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my mom and she loves it.  I warned her that it might not smell the same as it use to, and she has no complaints with the way it smells.</li>
            <li> My favorite for many years and this is the best price around...thanx</li>
            <li> The image you see is not what you get.  \\&quot;FRAUD\\&quot;  I ordered what I saw in the image and what I received is the new junk that YSL is now calling Opium.  This company \\&quot;Sal&#x27;s\\&quot; knows the difference because they also offer the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Opium from YSL shown in the bottle that I was sent.  There is a vast difference in the scent.  I have used the original Opium since 1978 and know the difference.  I shopped on line because you can no longer buy the original in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that Amazon will not allow its service to be used in this manner.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000C21CW6 Opium By Yves Saint Laurent For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.6 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;This is what I thought I would receive not what they sent so go online and look at the two Opiums but know that if you order from \\&quot;Sal&#x27;s\\&quot; you will be sent the \\&quot;new\\&quot; one not this. \\&quot;Fraud\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this new bottle of Opium is the same as the old bottle of Opium because it is not.  The ingredients in the new bottle is even different than the old Opium.  It doesn&#x27;t even smell like the same perfume, because it isn&#x27;t.  The company should have given it a new name like Opium II, because when I bought it I thought it was the same as the old Opium only in a new bottle.  I had no idea that the ingredients were different.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a different package as shown in your photo or as previously ordered and received.  It is substandart and a poor imitation of the product I have previously received thru Amazon.  I am very aengry to have to pay so much money for such a poor substitute in a similar packaging as the original product I had ordered.  Someone seems to have imitaded  the \\&quot;Opium\\&quot; I am familiar with for over 30 years!!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never order perfume over the counter again.  This was quick, less expensive and easy.</li>
            <li> This is for my wife, it is her travel size, we also purchased her a larger size for home use.</li>
            <li> my mother in law had wanted it for her birthday, she got cash instead so this was a good thing to use her money on. She was very happy..</li>
            <li> Product as described. The price is reasonable.The perfume smells so good. Beautiful Bottle it came in.I will be buying again. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> If you like an exotic,  floral smelling perfume than Opium is for you! You can wear this day or night.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!! It&#x27;s not a fruity, floral scent...more of a warm spice scent. My favorite for years!</li>
            <li> This parfume is the BEST ever created, as far as I&#x27;m concerned!  I have been wearing this particular &#x27;scent&#x27; for twenty years.  (it drives men &#x27;nuts!&#x27;)  I get a LOT of comments on this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;When you wear this ... you wear the animal inside you!</li>
            <li> You have to be kidding - I have used Opium cologne/perfume, etc. for years and this is NOT Opium - not even close!  I don&#x27;t even think it is perfume of any kind.  I tried it a few times and it has a very faint scent that is not even a perfume smell! It says Yves Saint Lauren on the bottle also which is what I always buy.  This is a huge rip-off.  Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and was well received.  Fair value for the price. Not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for decades...Suddenly there&#x27;s a new bottle (not the one shown). Pretty as it is---I&#x27;m not sure I appreciate it! Keep trying to take the lid off &amp; it doesn&#x27;t always spray well!  Higher cost for this? If it weren&#x27;t &#x27;my scent&#x27;, I might try others. Guess I&#x27;m over a barrel.    Good experience with speed and customer service.    Thanks</li>
            <li> Every time I traveled overseas I would buy my wife a coming home gift. Many times it was a bottle of parfum or cologne. This fragrance was always my favorite of all the ones I purchased for her. The bottle is a spray bottle, with 1.6 ounces in it and you spray a little on your wrists and neck and it lasts a long time. Its fragrance to me is sexy, sultry and alluring and I still enjoy it when she wears it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my most favorite perfumes out of over a hundred I purchased her over the years. It is simply the fragrance that makes me crazy for my wife.  I have attached a photo of the product.  I recommend it to you</li>
            <li> I wPeople have asked me what fragrance I have on - that is a good time to tell them all about itould reccomend this product to anyone who liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Opium no longer smells the same. I have been buying it for over 20 years and I KNOW they changed the formula  Ugh</li>
            <li> I ordered the Opium in the clear glass container and instead got the Opium in the brown container.The brown container leaves about 1/2 in of perfume in it that you have to fight to get out.</li>
            <li> I ordered it - after hunting far too long online - for the sleek flat shape shown in the picture above. Instead, II received a short squat bottle. Nearly sent it back but couldn&#x27;t be bothered with the online return hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Opium since it was launched - I wouldn&#x27;t consider any other perfume.  My butcher is besotted with the scent and I always get a bargain.</li>
            <li> Exactally what I wanted</li>
            <li> calvin klein has a similar product that was introduced about the same time as opium called obsession... i find opium to be a more dense experience of fragrance... it is more sensual... it is more spicy...  having said that ... you know the drill a fragrance is different on every woman ... but for me... its channel number 5 in the day time and opium for after five engagements</li>
            <li> This product arrived in great shipping time and is the smell I love and remember from years ago.  My only real issue I have, is that the cost I was actually charged and the cost on the enclosed invoice are different.  The charged amout I actually paid is more that the invoice states and I have no way to contact, that I&#x27;ve found, to report or make a complaint about or to ask for a refund of the difference.</li>
            <li> The formula has been changed on Opium and I do not care for the new one as much as this. I was super excited to find this and the price was resonable. Will order it over and over as long as it doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my mother she loves it and wears it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> My bad I ordered the woman perfume instead of the man .</li>
            <li> From the picture I thought this would be the old formula of Opium, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the new one, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This item was so bad--cannot compare with real Opium by Yves Saint Laurent cologne--why do you deal with companies which hose down your customers?  I shall stick with Kindle books and hope that I get what I pay for, although even that is questionable.</li>
