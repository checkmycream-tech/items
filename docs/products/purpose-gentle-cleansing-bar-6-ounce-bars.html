            <li>Love this soap!  </li>
            <li>attractively and securely packaged.  </li>
            <li>Gentle Cleansing Bar is the best...</li>
            <li>This soap was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago so I have used it and loved it for over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric</li>
            <li>The liquid cleanser in the pump is nice too.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle and I have amazing skin for a woman in her 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and a great price!</li>
            <li>I have been using purpose soap for many years and appreciate its gentleness on my face and good lathering quality.  </li>
            <li>Nice Item as described</li>
            <li>and I tried it and found I really liked it,too.</li>
            <li>and although the scent is nice, I have copd and can&#x27;t handle any perfumes in any products.  </li>
            <li>and it is nice soap though.  </li>
            <li>He is pretty picky about what he uses for his face, but he has incredible skin...</li>
            <li>Johnson&amp; Johnson Purpose is the best Cleanser I have found for my Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>Greatest soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Purpose is the best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a GREAT soap for all types of skin, does not dry the skin out, and does a great job of removing dirt and sweat and even makeup.</li>
            <li>Great gentle face cleanser!</li>
            <li>but it is my favorite soap for acne EVER</li>
            <li>I love this soap and the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I also love it that I can get online and order from amazon.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is how I find most products that aren&#x27;t being sold anywhere in my area.  </li>
            <li>This is excellent facial cleanser</li>
            <li>BUT they claim the MSRP is $29 and by offering it for $19.99 you SAVE more than $8.50.</li>
            <li>and it gets rid of oil like magic; when I rinse my face, I can almost feel it \\&quot;squeaking\\&quot; from cleanliness.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap in the world.</li>
            <li>I would buy more often but would hope price got better.</li>
            <li>We really love this soap, but our stores either don&#x27;t stock it or are often out of the product.</li>
            <li>skin never felt cleaner - love the liquid version too</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like leaving my face sweaty, and Purpose never dries out my skin, while it still does a great job of getting it very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and LOVE IT, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Best facial soap ever.</li>
            <li>better prices than the stores...</li>
            <li>Works great, good for the entire family.  </li>
            <li>Been using for two years and love this cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I used it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>these many years.</li>
            <li>Great product, ship fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent product, I will buy more.</li>
            <li>The women in my family love this soap.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>They will love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Purpose soap in the bar form is the best facial soap on the planet.</li>
            <li>I have been using Purpose Soap for years just as many others.</li>
            <li>If something pops out , I just wash more than once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always gotten it at CVS, but they don&#x27;t have the bar soap any more.  </li>
            <li>This was the only place that I could find it, so it makes me very happy</li>
            <li>This is a great gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Great for being gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The local stores are often sold out or don&#x27;t carry it at all, so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon and I am pleased with the price.</li>
            <li>So excited that I can order this Purpose soap through Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident and comfortable now, and even my parents, who are the harshest critics of my skin, noticed a difference.     </li>
            <li>It works great at keeping your skin soft and</li>
            <li>Although it is not the cheapest soap by any means, it is the best and I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Like this as an all purpose soap, but note that it&#x27;s not fragrance free if you have a sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I found that it is available at our WalMart...</li>
            <li>Fantastic turnaround time for a fantastic product...</li>
            <li>It rinses off quickly and CLEANLY!</li>
            <li>but I am glad that it is available here at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this soap over 20 years ago and it has kept my skin clean and acne free.  </li>
            <li>This soap cleans exceptionally well, but is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed a significant difference in this product compared to others.</li>
            <li>My order arrived on time, appropriately packaged and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This product has no smell associated with it except clean and drastically reduces any blemishes caused by oily skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin but very effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>Better than any soap for gentle skin care.</li>
            <li>It is the most gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>The liquid is also ok, but I prefer the bar, as it will last for months and creates a better lather.</li>
            <li>Quality product and quick delivery</li>
            <li>I have often recommended this soap to friends over the years who have all become loyal users like me.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>good stuff that&#x27;s been around a long time</li>
            <li>My pores are small, my face is clean, my skin is smooth and healthy looking, and the acne has improved dramatically after just 3 weeks!!</li>
            <li>I go right back to the best facial soap there is, Purpose.  </li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I could no longer find these bars locally on a consistent basis, so delighted to find them on the net.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent soap for delicate and allergic skin types!</li>
            <li>Blemishes at my age is rare</li>
            <li>Purpose is the best kept secret in soapdom.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial soap, hands down.</li>
            <li>Great for my dry &amp; sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After I wash my face, my skin not only feels clean but it looks clean as well!  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soothed, smooth and balanced; not dry, just clean.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and never any issues with skin sensitivities, rashes and the like.</li>
            <li>It is also relatively cheap compared to most other brands.</li>
            <li>I have been using this bar of soap since I was a teen and love it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>decent price quick delivery</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get it at Walmart, but they don&#x27;t keep it regularly stocked anymore.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a cheap, somewhat natural face wash.</li>
            <li>It is gentle containing no heavy perfumes, grit, or strong ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and use this with a charcoal scrub to eliminate the blackheads and as long as this keeps doing it&#x27;s job on my skin for acne control, I&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>But my skin stays really clean and clear.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and soft after its use.</li>
            <li>Clean, poreless and young skin, even after 20+ yrs of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very simple wash, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of stuff in it and it leaves your skin feeling veryyyy clean!</li>
            <li>Nice soap really gets you clean and last a long time.</li>
            <li>But, its the only soap I have ever used that is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>There should be more products like purpose soap, but as long as there is purpose soap for a reasonable price, then I am going to buy it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The bar lathers up really well</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like tallowate in my products (google it).</li>
            <li>However, it can be very drying.</li>
            <li>He told me one thing would set everything straight-</li>
            <li>I ordered a 6-pack and much to my excitement</li>
            <li>No dry soap puckered feeling, and it leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>But this brand seems to be quite gentle on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t worsen my skin issues.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, scent-free face soap that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Though I really don&#x27;t like shopping at Walmart, these 6 oz bars are selling for $3.27.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll grin and bear it to save that much money.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like this face cleanser.</li>
            <li>and it goes away fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Love this soap and it has been harder to find.</li>
            <li>So, the selling point for me was gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li>Gentle non drying alternative</li>
            <li>better than any other soap.  </li>
            <li>My only critique is that the scent is a bit strong, which might not bother you unless you&#x27;re sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years, but it recently has become less available in local stores, so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is soap along with Garnier Skin Renew Dark Spot Corrector has made my skin look better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>There is no residue left behind with this bar and the smell is nice, not flowery or overwhelmingly manly or anything.</li>
            <li>It can be a little hard to find, and the price on here is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Buying in quantity is a little over the top</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s truly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; as my skin feels quite tight and dry after I wash with it, good for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I find that it cleans well while not irritating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this product for those of you who have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is very mild and gentle, but not available in all stores.</li>
            <li>You can probably find this cheaper at your local store, as I paid more than $2 but less then $3 for one large bar.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very sensitive I would try CearVe or VaniCream.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I take a medication that causes my skin to be very sensitive and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it is unavailable in so many drugstores</li>
            <li>By no means does it dry your skin, but unless I moisturize right away</li>
            <li>PURPOSE soap has virtually disappeared from retail shelves, especially the large bar that I ordered in quantity from this supplier.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves this product, hard to find...fortunately we were able to pick up a years supply here.</li>
            <li>I have a clear face.</li>
            <li>If you have any acne it will clear it up in 3 to 10 days.</li>
            <li>My husband has used these bars for years and swears by them keeping his face clear.</li>
            <li>I wear face makeup, so it is critical that I use a soap that is gentle and yet can remove the &#x27;paint&#x27; on my face.  </li>
            <li>so when I use anything else I start to breakout even though I&#x27;m getting old and wrinkley.  </li>
            <li>I have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Works well, both for my 15-year old and for me.</li>
            <li>and none of them comes close to the basic Gentle Cleansing Bar.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this must be universal soap for the whole family.</li>
            <li>It leaves my babies skin so soft and it never leaves residue on their skin.</li>
            <li>so far so</li>
            <li>Arrived almost a week early.  </li>
            <li>It is the only soap I have found that cleans well enough without drying too much.</li>
            <li>Will use no other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had oily and acne-prone skin, and I&#x27;ve tried TONS of drugstore facial cleansers to try to keep my skin clear and under control.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and everything (especially soaps with perfumes) makes it itch - except this product.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble with adult acne and have found that washing my face with this in addition to my normal cleansing routine has helped clear up my face some.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell but not the smell that I was used to with glycerin soap I have used in the past with same name.</li>
            <li>(dry one day, sensitive the next, breakouts, oily phases) and after trying a bunch of stuff</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this soap for my sensitive skin, but it is not easy to find where I live.  </li>
            <li>I found pricing to be high and needed bundled package to bring down price.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great soap, but Amazon package arrived with  the boxes of soap damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purpose Cleansing Bar for over 15 years and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> As you can see in my photo,it works great.</li>
            <li> Seriously,this is a great face cleanser.</li>

            <li> This face wash works really good.</li>
            <li> It is the best cleansing bar, we have been using it for years,  and it is no longer available in retail drug stores.</li>
            <li> Do not use the liquid version, it is not as good.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, good price.  </li>
            <li> Great soap - excellent price - fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and at the best price</li>
            <li> This was an excellent value when I ordered first time but have not found it since then</li>
            <li> I love this soap!</li>
            <li> We both love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am glad they have it on here!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  </li>
            <li> attractively and securely packaged.  </li>
            <li> Gentle Cleansing Bar is the best...</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago so I have used it and loved it for over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric</li>
            <li> The liquid cleanser in the pump is nice too.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle and I have amazing skin for a woman in her 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been using purpose soap for many years and appreciate its gentleness on my face and good lathering quality.  </li>
            <li> Nice Item as described</li>
            <li> and I tried it and found I really liked it,too.</li>
            <li> and although the scent is nice, I have copd and can&#x27;t handle any perfumes in any products.  </li>
            <li> and it is nice soap though.  </li>
            <li> He is pretty picky about what he uses for his face, but he has incredible skin...</li>
            <li> Johnson&amp; Johnson Purpose is the best Cleanser I have found for my Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> Greatest soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Purpose is the best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a GREAT soap for all types of skin, does not dry the skin out, and does a great job of removing dirt and sweat and even makeup.</li>
            <li> Great gentle face cleanser!</li>
            <li> but it is my favorite soap for acne EVER</li>
            <li> I love this soap and the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I also love it that I can get online and order from amazon.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is how I find most products that aren&#x27;t being sold anywhere in my area.  </li>
            <li> This is excellent facial cleanser</li>
            <li> BUT they claim the MSRP is $29 and by offering it for $19.99 you SAVE more than $8.50.</li>
            <li> and it gets rid of oil like magic; when I rinse my face, I can almost feel it \\&quot;squeaking\\&quot; from cleanliness.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap in the world.</li>
            <li> I would buy more often but would hope price got better.</li>
            <li> We really love this soap, but our stores either don&#x27;t stock it or are often out of the product.</li>
            <li> skin never felt cleaner - love the liquid version too</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like leaving my face sweaty, and Purpose never dries out my skin, while it still does a great job of getting it very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and LOVE IT, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Best facial soap ever.</li>
            <li> better prices than the stores...</li>
            <li> Works great, good for the entire family.  </li>
            <li> Been using for two years and love this cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I used it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> these many years.</li>
            <li> Great product, ship fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent product, I will buy more.</li>
            <li> The women in my family love this soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for many years, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> They will love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Purpose soap in the bar form is the best facial soap on the planet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Purpose Soap for years just as many others.</li>
            <li> If something pops out , I just wash more than once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gotten it at CVS, but they don&#x27;t have the bar soap any more.  </li>
            <li> This was the only place that I could find it, so it makes me very happy</li>
            <li> This is a great gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Great for being gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> The local stores are often sold out or don&#x27;t carry it at all, so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon and I am pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> So excited that I can order this Purpose soap through Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I feel more confident and comfortable now, and even my parents, who are the harshest critics of my skin, noticed a difference.     </li>
            <li> It works great at keeping your skin soft and</li>
            <li> Although it is not the cheapest soap by any means, it is the best and I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Like this as an all purpose soap, but note that it&#x27;s not fragrance free if you have a sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I found that it is available at our WalMart...</li>
            <li> Fantastic turnaround time for a fantastic product...</li>
            <li> It rinses off quickly and CLEANLY!</li>
            <li> but I am glad that it is available here at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap over 20 years ago and it has kept my skin clean and acne free.  </li>
            <li> This soap cleans exceptionally well, but is not harsh.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed a significant difference in this product compared to others.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, appropriately packaged and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product has no smell associated with it except clean and drastically reduces any blemishes caused by oily skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin but very effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> Better than any soap for gentle skin care.</li>
            <li> It is the most gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> The liquid is also ok, but I prefer the bar, as it will last for months and creates a better lather.</li>
            <li> Quality product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have often recommended this soap to friends over the years who have all become loyal users like me.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> good stuff that&#x27;s been around a long time</li>
            <li> My pores are small, my face is clean, my skin is smooth and healthy looking, and the acne has improved dramatically after just 3 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I go right back to the best facial soap there is, Purpose.  </li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I could no longer find these bars locally on a consistent basis, so delighted to find them on the net.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent soap for delicate and allergic skin types!</li>
            <li> Blemishes at my age is rare</li>
            <li> Purpose is the best kept secret in soapdom.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial soap, hands down.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry &amp; sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After I wash my face, my skin not only feels clean but it looks clean as well!  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soothed, smooth and balanced; not dry, just clean.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and never any issues with skin sensitivities, rashes and the like.</li>
            <li> It is also relatively cheap compared to most other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using this bar of soap since I was a teen and love it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> decent price quick delivery</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get it at Walmart, but they don&#x27;t keep it regularly stocked anymore.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a cheap, somewhat natural face wash.</li>
            <li> It is gentle containing no heavy perfumes, grit, or strong ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and use this with a charcoal scrub to eliminate the blackheads and as long as this keeps doing it&#x27;s job on my skin for acne control, I&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> But my skin stays really clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and soft after its use.</li>
            <li> Clean, poreless and young skin, even after 20+ yrs of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very simple wash, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of stuff in it and it leaves your skin feeling veryyyy clean!</li>
            <li> Nice soap really gets you clean and last a long time.</li>
            <li> But, its the only soap I have ever used that is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> There should be more products like purpose soap, but as long as there is purpose soap for a reasonable price, then I am going to buy it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The bar lathers up really well</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like tallowate in my products (google it).</li>
            <li> However, it can be very drying.</li>
            <li> He told me one thing would set everything straight-</li>
            <li> I ordered a 6-pack and much to my excitement</li>
            <li> No dry soap puckered feeling, and it leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> But this brand seems to be quite gentle on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t worsen my skin issues.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, scent-free face soap that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> Though I really don&#x27;t like shopping at Walmart, these 6 oz bars are selling for $3.27.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll grin and bear it to save that much money.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cleanser.</li>
            <li> and it goes away fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it has been harder to find.</li>
            <li> So, the selling point for me was gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> Gentle non drying alternative</li>
            <li> better than any other soap.  </li>
            <li> My only critique is that the scent is a bit strong, which might not bother you unless you&#x27;re sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, but it recently has become less available in local stores, so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is soap along with Garnier Skin Renew Dark Spot Corrector has made my skin look better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> There is no residue left behind with this bar and the smell is nice, not flowery or overwhelmingly manly or anything.</li>
            <li> It can be a little hard to find, and the price on here is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Buying in quantity is a little over the top</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s truly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; as my skin feels quite tight and dry after I wash with it, good for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I find that it cleans well while not irritating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this product for those of you who have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is very mild and gentle, but not available in all stores.</li>
            <li> You can probably find this cheaper at your local store, as I paid more than $2 but less then $3 for one large bar.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very sensitive I would try CearVe or VaniCream.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that causes my skin to be very sensitive and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it is unavailable in so many drugstores</li>
            <li> By no means does it dry your skin, but unless I moisturize right away</li>
            <li> PURPOSE soap has virtually disappeared from retail shelves, especially the large bar that I ordered in quantity from this supplier.  </li>
            <li> Wife loves this product, hard to find...fortunately we were able to pick up a years supply here.</li>
            <li> I have a clear face.</li>
            <li> If you have any acne it will clear it up in 3 to 10 days.</li>
            <li> My husband has used these bars for years and swears by them keeping his face clear.</li>
            <li> I wear face makeup, so it is critical that I use a soap that is gentle and yet can remove the &#x27;paint&#x27; on my face.  </li>
            <li> so when I use anything else I start to breakout even though I&#x27;m getting old and wrinkley.  </li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works well, both for my 15-year old and for me.</li>
            <li> and none of them comes close to the basic Gentle Cleansing Bar.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this must be universal soap for the whole family.</li>
            <li> It leaves my babies skin so soft and it never leaves residue on their skin.</li>
            <li> so far so</li>
            <li> Arrived almost a week early.  </li>
            <li> It is the only soap I have found that cleans well enough without drying too much.</li>
            <li> Will use no other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily and acne-prone skin, and I&#x27;ve tried TONS of drugstore facial cleansers to try to keep my skin clear and under control.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and everything (especially soaps with perfumes) makes it itch - except this product.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble with adult acne and have found that washing my face with this in addition to my normal cleansing routine has helped clear up my face some.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell but not the smell that I was used to with glycerin soap I have used in the past with same name.</li>
            <li> (dry one day, sensitive the next, breakouts, oily phases) and after trying a bunch of stuff</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this soap for my sensitive skin, but it is not easy to find where I live.  </li>
            <li> I found pricing to be high and needed bundled package to bring down price.</li>
            <li> I buy these in the six-pack to get bulk discount and they last a really long time.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have to use the medicine as much as long as he bathes with Purpose Soap.</li>
            <li> bar lasts a long time in the shower too.</li>
            <li> I thought it was my \\&quot;low-grade\\&quot; moisturizer (the generic \\&quot;pink beauty fluid\\&quot;</li>
            <li> All other soaps are second rate in comparison.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it ever since but only purchasing it from Stop &amp; Shop - other grocery stores did not carry the bar form of this product.</li>
            <li> Will try other brands with same name till I find the smell I had before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bought these as an alternative to soap as it doesn&#x27;t leave skin as dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin on my legs that will bleed if I scratch them.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find where I live, yet once again Amazon has what I need.</li>
            <li> I am over 65 and have very few wrinkles so far.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my face several times a day since I&#x27;m outside quite a bit</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with moderate acne for the past ten years.</li>
            <li> One of my family members gave me this soap because my little ones have skins issues such as eczema.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been getting bigger pores which has meant more noticeable blackheads which in turn as been driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> Words like &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; have no legal meaning, so I have no way to determine the quality of the bazillion brands of soap on the market.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this soap in all my local stores; the store shelves were always empty.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I found about this soap is that it does sting your eyes and it will leave your skin feeling a little tight.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found for closer to $3/bar on other websites.</li>
            <li> At one point, I was also using BenzaClin for my acne as well as other drugstore acne treatment products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how I can describe the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of cleanliness, but it is definitely there.</li>
            <li> not in with the other bath soaps, but with the items that teenagers use for their problem skin...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other soap on my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other versions of Purpose (the liquid, gel, cream, etc.)</li>
            <li> Although, the ingredients are not plant-based or organic or anything, I felt that there&#x27;s a lot of other face washes on the market that fare far worse.</li>
            <li> but you can find it if you look hard enough.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint is when we run out.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve found now, is finding it locally in our small town!</li>
            <li> This soap has helped my acne and slightly oily skin, but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for blackheads.</li>
            <li> and my husband has slight oily skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased on here for almost $2 less per bar.</li>
            <li> The 6 oz bars are double the size of the random few I&#x27;ve found here and cost the same!  </li>
            <li> Other than those two drawbacks, I definitely recommend this soap to anyone who suffers from problematic, oily, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be the only combination that will keep my annoying adult acne under control and not strip the moisture from the delicate skin on my cheeks and under eyes.  </li>
            <li> so no more over priced purchases every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Have used Purpose soap for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find oil-free soaps in retail shops.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these bars soap in stores.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Hard to find bars, tho, in the store.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the expensive cleansers, cheap soap, and other stuffs from the health food store, but they either leave a nasty film on my skin or make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything, including very expensive facial cleansers, nothing compares to Purpose.  </li>
            <li> If you have very bad acne wash your face with purpose soap morning and night, and anytime your face is oily, do not scrub to hard, and gently rinse your face.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before trying this product but after 6 months of continued use, I am a believer.</li>
            <li> The only bad side is Wal-mart does not sell it in a pack like amazon does.</li>
            <li> Wen I was a teenager, my skin started going a little crazy</li>
            <li> I get that uncomfortable tightness around my eyes and nose.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise difficult to locate.</li>
            <li> I was suffering with severe acne breakouts have used expensive products like Bioelements, Clinique, etc.</li>
            <li> As a teenager I had some acne, nothing crazy but being an insecure girl I begged to be taken to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointing with the smell.</li>
            <li> So to prevent my skin from drying out really bad</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, to bad they discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over 40 years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> hurts so bad!  </li>
            <li> It is an outrageous charge to ship a package than weighs 2.5 lbs.</li>

            <li> Hey, its just soap.  But, its the only soap I have ever used that is easy on my skin. This is a great soap.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent value when I ordered first time but have not found it since then but I love this soap!!!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea - the soap that you use on your face is critical in helping control this disease that can never be cured.  I had tried everything out there - Purpose Gentle Cleansing Bar is the best...I wear face makeup, so it is critical that I use a soap that is gentle and yet can remove the &#x27;paint&#x27; on my face.  This product does the trick.  I can highly recommend this product for those of you who have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore but it is my favorite soap for acne EVER</li>
            <li> I have been using this bar of soap since I was a teen and love it.  My face is very sensitive so when I use anything else I start to breakout even though I&#x27;m getting old and wrinkley.  Blemishes at my age is rare but anywho ... I love this soap and the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore.  I also love it that I can get online and order from amazon.  Amazon is how I find most products that aren&#x27;t being sold anywhere in my area.  Yahooooo!</li>
            <li> This is excellent facial cleanser BUT they claim the MSRP is $29 and by offering it for $19.99 you SAVE more than $8.50. BULL! They charge $10 to ship it. It is an outrageous charge to ship a package than weighs 2.5 lbs. NO SALE.</li>
            <li> Cleanser is great but I&#x27;ve found for closer to $3/bar on other websites.</li>
            <li> Like this as an all purpose soap, but note that it&#x27;s not fragrance free if you have a sensitivity. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s truly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; as my skin feels quite tight and dry after I wash with it, good for normal to oily skin. If you&#x27;re very sensitive I would try CearVe or VaniCream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily and acne-prone skin, and I&#x27;ve tried TONS of drugstore facial cleansers to try to keep my skin clear and under control.  At one point, I was also using BenzaClin for my acne as well as other drugstore acne treatment products.  However, no combination of products does for my skin what Purpose soap does!  Granted, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but I&#x27;ve only had 1 or 2 tiny pimples since.  Now for my face routine, I just use this bar and a moisturizer.  The bar lathers up really well and it gets rid of oil like magic; when I rinse my face, I can almost feel it \\&quot;squeaking\\&quot; from cleanliness. After I wash my face, my skin not only feels clean but it looks clean as well!  I&#x27;m not really sure how I can describe the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of cleanliness, but it is definitely there. I feel more confident and comfortable now, and even my parents, who are the harshest critics of my skin, noticed a difference.     The only downside I found about this soap is that it does sting your eyes and it will leave your skin feeling a little tight.  By no means does it dry your skin, but unless I moisturize right away I get that uncomfortable tightness around my eyes and nose.  Other than those two drawbacks, I definitely recommend this soap to anyone who suffers from problematic, oily, acne-prone skin.  Sometime&#x27;s its best to simplify your face routine, and Purpose soap does the job.</li>
            <li> Tallowate with glycerine to attempt to offset the dryness. I really don&#x27;t like tallowate in my products (google it). This is drying. I do like the liquid version in the pump.</li>
            <li> Johnson&amp; Johnson Purpose is the best Cleanser I have found for my Sensitive Skin. Amazon.com always has the Best Prices.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve tried the expensive cleansers, cheap soap, and other stuffs from the health food store, but they either leave a nasty film on my skin or make me break out.  I keep coming back to this plus my aveeno lotion.  It seems to be the only combination that will keep my annoying adult acne under control and not strip the moisture from the delicate skin on my cheeks and under eyes.  I&#x27;m almost to the point where I just set up a regular order of these cleansing bars to come to my house so I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about running out.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap in the world. Bought in bulk to avoid trips to Walgreens so no more over priced purchases every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used purpose for 10 years, even introduced my husband to it. He also loves it! As a teenager I had some acne, nothing crazy but being an insecure girl I begged to be taken to a dermatologist. He recommended this and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it. Lately I&#x27;ve been getting bigger pores which has meant more noticeable blackheads which in turn as been driving me crazy. This soap has helped my acne and slightly oily skin, but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for blackheads. I&#x27;m going to try and use this with a charcoal scrub to eliminate the blackheads and as long as this keeps doing it&#x27;s job on my skin for acne control, I&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, is a bit drying though.</li>
            <li> Bought these as an alternative to soap as it doesn&#x27;t leave skin as dry. Very good value for the money!</li>
            <li> Works well, both for my 15-year old and for me. It&#x27;s hard to find oil-free soaps in retail shops.</li>
            <li> Otherwise difficult to locate. I found pricing to be high and needed bundled package to bring down price. I would buy more often but would hope price got better.</li>
            <li> We really love this soap, but our stores either don&#x27;t stock it or are often out of the product. Buying in quantity is a little over the top but it&#x27;s a bit cheaper this way.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago so I have used it and loved it for over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Hasenbeck</li>
            <li> My husband uses this soap all the time and we can&#x27;t buy it at Safeway.  However, after I ordered it from Amazon I found that it is available at our WalMart...not in with the other bath soaps, but with the items that teenagers use for their problem skin...and it was only $3.27 there for the same bar.</li>
            <li> skin never felt cleaner - love the liquid version too</li>
            <li> This face wash works really good. It&#x27;s a very simple wash, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of stuff in it and it leaves your skin feeling veryyyy clean! However, it can be very drying. So to prevent my skin from drying out really bad I use the night cream by exuviance. It works great at keeping your skin soft and even though it&#x27;s for skin aging, it works great at clearing up my skin as well.</li>
            <li> Wen I was a teenager, my skin started going a little crazy (dry one day, sensitive the next, breakouts, oily phases) and after trying a bunch of stuff I finally went to a dermatologist. He told me one thing would set everything straight- Purpose Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And 20+ years, I&#x27;m STILL using it daily. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other soap on my face. Of course, now I use different lotions and potions to prevent wrinkles and signs of aging, as well as sunblock, etc. But my skin stays really clean and clear. I usually wash my face several times a day since I&#x27;m outside quite a bit and I don&#x27;t like leaving my face sweaty, and Purpose never dries out my skin, while it still does a great job of getting it very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Purpose on my back/upper arms in the shower, since I started having an issue with skin allergies several years ago and all the shower gels I was using (Philosophy and Bath &amp; Body Works) were causing irritation. It&#x27;s solved all my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT soap for all types of skin, does not dry the skin out, and does a great job of removing dirt and sweat and even makeup. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. I have tried the other versions of Purpose (the liquid, gel, cream, etc.) and none of them comes close to the basic Gentle Cleansing Bar.</li>
            <li> This is now our daily bath soap. I have oily, acne prone skin and so does my husband. The hospital where my husband previoulsy worked provided it for all  patients with skin problems so he decided to purchase a bar for us to try. We have been using it ever since - and we now buy it by the 6-pack.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, to bad they discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> All-time fave facial soap!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and LOVE IT, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  I bought the liquid Purpose Soap thinking it couldn&#x27;t be much different, but it was!  I started getting pimples all over my face.  When I started using the Purpose Bar Soap again after buying it on here they all went away.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  My doctor recommended this soap for my sensitive skin, but it is not easy to find where I live.  I ordered a 6-pack and much to my excitement the BIG bars came!!!  The 6 oz bars are double the size of the random few I&#x27;ve found here and cost the same!  Delivery was 2 days and I paid for standard.  Great all the way around!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a decade now and every time I try to use another brand I go right back to the best facial soap there is, Purpose.  I love this soap!</li>
            <li> Great gentle face cleanser! Hard to find these bars soap in stores. The liquid cleanser in the pump is nice too. Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes if you accidentally get it in your eyes like the bar soap. I have used this soap for 7 years (or longer) and now my husband does too. He actually asked for it if we don&#x27;t have a bar out. I would have to say this must be universal soap for the whole family. I have very sensitive skin and my husband has slight oily skin. We both love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap for facial cleansing.  I have used it for years, but it recently has become less available in local stores, so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before trying this product but after 6 months of continued use, I am a believer. I was suffering with severe acne breakouts have used expensive products like Bioelements, Clinique, etc. and using this instead gave me the same results without the extra spending. Paired with the Purpose moisturizer it cleared my face. Upkeep is key to an acne-clear face.</li>
            <li> have used Purpose soap for about 35yrs</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  Best facial soap ever.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic turnaround time for a fantastic product...better prices than the stores...attractively and securely packaged.  PURPOSE soap has virtually disappeared from retail shelves, especially the large bar that I ordered in quantity from this supplier.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> Great for my dry &amp; sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for everyone. No dry soap puckered feeling, and it leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Words like &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; have no legal meaning, so I have no way to determine the quality of the bazillion brands of soap on the market. But this brand seems to be quite gentle on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t worsen my skin issues. My only critique is that the scent is a bit strong, which might not bother you unless you&#x27;re sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with moderate acne for the past ten years. I have tried EVERYTHING!!! This is soap along with Garnier Skin Renew Dark Spot Corrector has made my skin look better than anything I have tried. My pores are small, my face is clean, my skin is smooth and healthy looking, and the acne has improved dramatically after just 3 weeks!! If you have tried everything, try this and maybe your search will finally be over too😀!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 30 years, maybe longer. Over the years I have tried many expensive cleaning products and I always come back to this. It is extremely gentle and I have amazing skin for a woman in her 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and a great price!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over 40 years and have never been disappointed.  You can use on your face or body and no worries about over drying your skin.  Very gentle and never any issues with skin sensitivities, rashes and the like.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this soap in all my local stores; the store shelves were always empty.  I got 6 bars from Amazon and it was cheaper than retail in a store (even if I could find it).  This is a gentle, scent-free face soap that I have used for years.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it feeling fresh and clean.  I have sensitive skin and everything (especially soaps with perfumes) makes it itch - except this product.  I love it and can&#x27;t live without it.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using purpose soap for many years and appreciate its gentleness on my face and good lathering quality.  I am over 65 and have very few wrinkles so far.  My skin feels clean and soft after its use.</li>
            <li> Works great, good for the entire family.  Been using for two years and love this cleansing bar.  Helps with skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> Have been using Purpose for years. Great product. Have noticed a significant difference in this product compared to others. I have even convinced my girlfriend to switch. Her only complaint is when we run out. Although it is not the cheapest soap by any means, it is the best and I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available. This product has no smell associated with it except clean and drastically reduces any blemishes caused by oily skin. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. Gentle on sensitive skin but very effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have used Purpose Soap exclusively on my face for 40 years, and my skin is flawless. It is gentle containing no heavy perfumes, grit, or strong ingredients. Purpose is the best kept secret in soapdom. All other soaps are second rate in comparison.  It can be a little hard to find, and the price on here is excellent.  Buy up!</li>
            <li> The only soap we use.</li>
            <li> My dermotolgist recommended this soap 15 years ago. I have been using it ever since but only purchasing it from Stop &amp; Shop - other grocery stores did not carry the bar form of this product. Purchased on here for almost $2 less per bar. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, including very expensive facial cleansers, nothing compares to Purpose.  Clean, poreless and young skin, even after 20+ yrs of use.  It is hard to find where I live, yet once again Amazon has what I need.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. One of my family members gave me this soap because my little ones have skins issues such as eczema. I used it and fell in love with it. It leaves my babies skin so soft and it never leaves residue on their skin. I have even turned my mother on to the idea of using this soap and she loves it.  It is sold in Wal-mart stores and CVS pharmacy. The only bad side is Wal-mart does not sell it in a pack like amazon does.</li>
            <li> Though I really don&#x27;t like shopping at Walmart, these 6 oz bars are selling for $3.27.  I&#x27;ll grin and bear it to save that much money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I can use on my body and face that I don&#x27;t break out from.</li>
            <li> Received the product promptly. It was well package, avoiding any damage to the soaps. This product was recommended to me years ago by a dermatologist. I find that it cleans well while not irritating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap over 20 years ago and it has kept my skin clean and acne free.  I recommend it to all my friends and family.  It works very well.  Everyone that visits and uses it at my house becomes a regular user.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It is the best cleansing bar, we have been using it for years,  and it is no longer available in retail drug stores.</li>
            <li> These products were recomended to me over 45 years ago by my Dermatologist.  They have been wonderful for my skin&lt;br /&gt;all these many years.</li>
            <li> Nice Item as described</li>
            <li> I almost despaired of finding it in the stores. CVS, Walmart etc. used to stock and now they have disappeared from the shelves. Better than any soap for gentle skin care.</li>
            <li> I have used Purpose for years because of multiple contact allergies. It is very mild and gentle, but not available in all stores. My order arrived on time, appropriately packaged and was exactly as described. I was please with the service and product.</li>
            <li> Soap arrived intact and on time.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Just what I wanted as store was not carrying it anymore</li>
            <li> This is the best bar soap on the market. It cleanses w/o drying. I have used it for 35 years and order it online b/c stores quit stocking it for some reason. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best shower and bath bar soap we have used.</li>
            <li> good stuff that&#x27;s been around a long time</li>
            <li> Have used Purpose soap for the past 15 years.  Will use no other. It is the most gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> decent price quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great product, ship fast</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this product on line, it has been difficult to find it in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Cleans without drying out my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for literally 15 years. I buy these in the six-pack to get bulk discount and they last a really long time. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The women in my family love this soap. They have all commented that it is great for removing makeup without drying the skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best. It leaves my face feeling squeaky clean. I have been using it for many years, it was recommended by my dermatologist. I think everyone should give it a try. They will love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It helps prevent breakouts and it doesn&#x27;t smell foul.</li>
            <li> I have been using Purpose Soap for over 30 years. There is nothing else like it.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s non-drying yet cleans off dirt, oil and make-up better than any other soap.  Shipped quickly and at the best price I could find on the internet.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap for delicate and allergic skin types!</li>
            <li> Great soap, but Amazon package arrived with  the boxes of soap damaged.</li>
            <li> So excited that I can order this Purpose soap through Amazon!  I used to be able to get it at Walmart, but they don&#x27;t keep it regularly stocked anymore.  I have been using Purpose per my Dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation for over 30 years.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purpose Cleansing Bar for over 15 years and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great soap - excellent price - fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really like this face cleanser. As you can see in my photo,it works great. Seriously,this is a great face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I never use anything but this soup.  I am allergic to every soap out there, so this was a wonderful relief.  Highly recommend this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap we use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 20 years! Both my husband and I use it. His doctor suggested he use it and I tried it and found I really liked it,too. It rinses off quickly and CLEANLY! There is no residue left behind with this bar and the smell is nice, not flowery or overwhelmingly manly or anything. The problem I&#x27;ve found now, is finding it locally in our small town!</li>
            <li> Purpose soap in the bar form is the best facial soap on the planet. Do not use the liquid version, it is not as good. I have been using Purpose Soap for years just as many others. I trust it, and it works great. Ever since I started using it I have a clear face. I wahs my face once per day with Purpose Soap. If something pops out , I just wash more than once and it goes away fast. It also works on your back. It is hard to find in stores but you can find it if you look hard enough. If a store does not have it such as your local pharmacy, simply ask them to order it and they will for no additional charge. I am always wanting to tell people that I see with acne about purpose soap, that it would help them, but it is an embarrassing conversation for them so I do not say anything, although I wish I could, and wish they would take my advice about purpose soap. Trust me that this works. If you have any acne it will clear it up in 3 to 10 days. If you have very bad acne wash your face with purpose soap morning and night, and anytime your face is oily, do not scrub to hard, and gently rinse your face. It is a simple wash with no harshful chemicals. There should be more products like purpose soap, but as long as there is purpose soap for a reasonable price, then I am going to buy it. If you don&#x27;t have it, get purpose soap.</li>
            <li> My husband has used these bars for years and swears by them keeping his face clear. I have trouble with adult acne and have found that washing my face with this in addition to my normal cleansing routine has helped clear up my face some. It leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was unscented.  I gave it away once I tried a bar of it and although the scent is nice, I have copd and can&#x27;t handle any perfumes in any products.  I washed my hands with it and it is nice soap though.  Just wish I had realized it had perfume in it, my fault for not knowing.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin on my legs that will bleed if I scratch them.  This is the only soap I can use.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use to wash his face with! I am glad they have it on here!</li>
            <li> I could no longer find these bars locally on a consistent basis, so delighted to find them on the net.</li>
            <li> Greatest soap for sensitive skin. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended for my son by his dermatologist and it works!!!! He has Keratosis Polaris and using this soap with a prescription medication has cleared his skin from the bumps. He doesn&#x27;t have to use the medicine as much as long as he bathes with Purpose Soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Purpose bar for about 15 years. My dermatologist recommended it. This is the best facial soap, hands down. I have tried the more expensive brands, to no avail. The liquid is also ok, but I prefer the bar, as it will last for months and creates a better lather.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been using it for years &amp; can&#x27;t seem to find it in any of the stores that always carried it.  Thank you for helping me to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Happy with product and delivery was great</li>
            <li> I have been using JNJ Purpose bar soap for several years. It is very gentle and does not dry out my skin. It is the only soap I have found that cleans well enough without drying too much. I take a medication that causes my skin to be very sensitive and this does the trick. The 6 oz. bar lasts a long time in the shower too. It is also relatively cheap compared to most other brands.</li>
            <li> Nice soap really gets you clean and last a long time. Slightly disappointing with the smell. Not a bad smell but not the smell that I was used to with glycerin soap I have used in the past with same name. Will try other brands with same name till I find the smell I had before.John Snuff</li>
            <li> Purpose is the best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; for sensitive skin.  It is the only brand we buy after years of experimenting with different products.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Quality product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> My doctor has told me to use this soap &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I&#x27;ve always gotten it at CVS, but they don&#x27;t have the bar soap any more.  This was the only place that I could find it, so it makes me very happy that I can still get my facial soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so very much!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  I have been using this soap since I was a teenager and it was recommended by my dermatologist.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your body and balances out your skin so it works for all skin types.  If you have oily skin, this soap is a must have!  I have often recommended this soap to friends over the years who have all become loyal users like me.  It is the only soap I will use and I consider it the best thing Johnson and Johnson has ever made.  I get compliments on how great my skin looks and I attribute it to three things.  This soap, loofa gloves, and Bath &amp; Body lotion daily.</li>
            <li> Our family uses Purpose routinely for facial cleansing. I&#x27;m not sure why it is unavailable in so many drugstores but I am glad that it is available here at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this soap for about 30 years.  Excellent.  Hard to find bars, tho, in the store.  They&lt;br /&gt;just sell the liquid, which is too costly.  Arrived on time, good price.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great gentle cleanser.  It also works well for those with oily skin.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The soap work out great.</li>
            <li> This is the only face soap my husband will use. He is pretty picky about what he uses for his face, but he has incredible skin... So it must be working.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product, hard to find...fortunately we were able to pick up a years supply here.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it has been harder to find.</li>
            <li> Great for being gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> My hubby uses this all the time (he has skin problems) and the soap&lt;br /&gt;does not agitate the skin.  it serves a Purpose - Like it&#x27;s name and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;plus got a great deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I actually got this at my local big box supermarket, not on Amazon. You can probably find this cheaper at your local store, as I paid more than $2 but less then $3 for one large bar. I wanted a cheap, somewhat natural face wash. Although, the ingredients are not plant-based or organic or anything, I felt that there&#x27;s a lot of other face washes on the market that fare far worse. I do have skin and my face is even drier. So, the selling point for me was gentle cleansing. That being said...I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week. My face is so red and it stings/hurts so bad!  I thought it was my \\&quot;low-grade\\&quot; moisturizer (the generic \\&quot;pink beauty fluid\\&quot;, it&#x27;s what I can afford), but not-so. This cleansing bar is going to the trash! I decided to spend the extra $$ and go back to Aveeno, which I never had problems with their products.</li>
            <li> Arrived almost a week early.  This is a great product for problem skin.  My dermatologist recommended it and I have used it for years.  No fragrance.  Leaves skin feeling soothed, smooth and balanced; not dry, just clean.  The local stores are often sold out or don&#x27;t carry it at all, so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon and I am pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> Gentle non drying alternative</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Great soap.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans exceptionally well, but is not harsh.  Recommend for showers as well as hands and face.  It is not a deodorant soap however.</li>
