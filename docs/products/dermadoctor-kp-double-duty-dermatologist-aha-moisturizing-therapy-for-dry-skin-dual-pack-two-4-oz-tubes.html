    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I am very happy with the combination of products.  </li>
            <li>I am happy that I am seeing improvement and will continue using them.  </li>
            <li>But still I was hopeful that it&#x27;d be as good as it claims.</li>
            <li>After doing a fair amount of research I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more?!</li>
            <li>But, I honestly can&#x27;t tell any difference.  </li>
            <li>(I thought I could take the cheap way out), and did see fairly good results, but not what I was hoping for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been touted as some miracle treatment, and seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great product.</li>
            <li>The bumps became way more prominent and then started to spread to my lower arms and chest.  </li>
            <li>I have been using both now for a month and a half, and am very happy with the job it is doing.  </li>
            <li>This cream worked so well, within 3 weeks a huge difference in the bumps and dryness on my legs.  </li>
            <li>But here recently, the bumps were becoming more prominent.  </li>
            <li>The lotion alone def makes your skin much softer, and somewhat minimizes the redness and bumps, but with the exfoliant cream, it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>I cannot remember how many dermatologists I have been to see and how many different creams/emolient/lotion/scrub and even pills (roaccatune)</li>
            <li>Mostly I just live with it and try not to be self-conscious about it.  </li>
            <li>Left arm is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>I find a regimen of vitamin A (I drink carrot juice), fish oil and a light scrub help more than this product and has lasting results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will take it completely away after time, but it is so much better than it was before.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny to me</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;d be good if the product description included the amount of the active ingredients in the products.</li>
            <li>Shortly after I started using it, a couple people commented that my arms looked better.  </li>
            <li>I have had issues more with the redness than actual bumps since puberty.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I would try a product for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did what he said and thought it would probably relieve it to a certain point</li>
            <li>Having tried numerous treatments for keratosis pilaris without success, I was sceptical despite the many glowing positive reviews of this product on the net.</li>
            <li>KP Duty really worked for us.  </li>
            <li>Used a whole tube, didn&#x27;t notice a bit of a difference.</li>
            <li>The back of my legs and arms are bump free.</li>
            <li>And at least I&#x27;m getting good nutrition.</li>
            <li>I think I may have developed a tolerance to it on my right arm though.</li>
            <li>but now my arms have only one or two bumps left and they arent prominent.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it is not going to work well with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry, but its worth a try at least once.</li>
            <li>Though I had put up with it for a long time on my upper arms, this was too much to take - it suddenly seemed much more noticeable!  </li>
            <li>Its worth it to me, especially when I wear sleeveless.</li>
            <li>About 8 months after the birth of my first child, all of a sudden I noticed it on my forearms as well.  </li>
            <li>I got red bumps for the first time after I had my kids and its bothered me ever since.</li>
            <li>For the first 3-4 days, my arms seem to feel and look better, then it all took a turn for the worse.  </li>
            <li>and I am now in my early forties.</li>
            <li>Thanks KP double duty.</li>
            <li>but if you want to get rid of those KP bumps nearly immediately, this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li>Get both products and you will see a vast improvement - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Glad to report that, these products DO work albeit slowly, understandably.  </li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using the product after about 2 weeks of usage and everything seemed to go back to normal.  </li>

            <li> My arms are continuously getting smoother and less red.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and after about a week you will notice that the chicken skin is smoother and less noticeable,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>

            <li> My arms are not perfect, but there is a definite marked improvement.</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve had Kp since late teen</li>
            <li> This usually clears up my dry skin and/or KP within a week.</li>

            <li> My upper arms have plagued me since puberty with red unsightly bumps so bad that sleeveless and even short</li>
            <li> My brother has a skin problem where his hairs do not grow out of the skin causing little bumps all over his shoulder area and it would look reddish all the time.</li>
            <li> Disappointing considering how much it cost.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of continuous use, the bumps were gone.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a few times.</li>

            <li> His shoulder is still a little discolored but he no longer has this ingrown hair problem!!!</li>
            <li> The redness became worse as well.  </li>
            <li> For example, what is the concentration of glycolic acid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve used two tubes now, and am sorry to say it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> The product is too expensive to use the rest of my life</li>
            <li> Ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> My son loves to use this to help quell his &amp;#34; chicken bump skin &amp;#34;!</li>

            <li> Having tried numerous treatments for keratosis pilaris without success, I was sceptical despite the many glowing positive reviews of this product on the net. It&#x27;s been touted as some miracle treatment, and seemed too good to be true. But still I was hopeful that it&#x27;d be as good as it claims. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and can hardly notice any difference at all in the texture or colouring of the skin on my arms. Disappointing considering how much it cost. I&#x27;ll continue using what I&#x27;ve bought. Hopefully eventually it&#x27;ll show some benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;d be good if the product description included the amount of the active ingredients in the products. For example, what is the concentration of glycolic acid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve used two tubes now, and am sorry to say it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing products from DERMAdoctor through Amazon for years and I have never been disappointed. Fast shipping and a great product. KP Duty is the only product that I have tried that works wonders on my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone with KP!</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve had Kp since late teen and I am now in my early forties. I cannot remember how many dermatologists I have been to see and how many different creams/emolient/lotion/scrub and even pills (roaccatune) I have tried...Have to say that I was skeptical when reading the reviews especially the glowing ones but then thought what have I got to lose... so I did try the scrub and the moisturiser. Glad to report that, these products DO work albeit slowly, understandably.  I am happy that I am seeing improvement and will continue using them.  Thank you Dermadoctor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had KP on my upper arms almost my entire life. I tried KP Duty and it did help somewhat but did not completely clear my skin. The product is too expensive to use the rest of my life so I had to keep trying other things. I find a regimen of vitamin A (I drink carrot juice), fish oil and a light scrub help more than this product and has lasting results. And at least I&#x27;m getting good nutrition.</li>
            <li> Have you ever felt the back of my arms? Need I say more?!</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be another overated product advertisement....My brother has a skin problem where his hairs do not grow out of the skin causing little bumps all over his shoulder area and it would look reddish all the time. He asked me to order this for him from amazon and ship it to him in Singapore....I did what he said and thought it would probably relieve it to a certain point but I didnt&#x27; expect it to actually work all over.....His shoulder is still a little discolored but he no longer has this ingrown hair problem!!! its actually smoothed out!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had red bumps on my arms all my life, and I&#x27;ve tried a handful of remedies for it.  Mostly I just live with it and try not to be self-conscious about it.  But, I decided to give this one a shot after purchasing a strapless wedding gown.  Shortly after I started using it, a couple people commented that my arms looked better.  But, I honestly can&#x27;t tell any difference.  After using it every day for 4 months, my supply has run out, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again.  I&#x27;ll just get some make-up for my arms on my big day.</li>
            <li> KP Duty really worked for us.  My dd had KP all over her cheeks.  We literally tried dozens of products (both over-the-counter and prescription), but nothing worked.  It was heartbreaking because you can&#x27;t \\&quot;hide\\&quot; KP when it&#x27;s on your face.  I came across KP Duty during an online search.  Though a bit costly for us, we decided to try it.  For us, it was like a miracle cream.  After a few weeks of continuous use, the bumps were gone.  I know the reviews are mixed for KP Duty, but I think each person&#x27;s biology is different.  You just have to find what works for you.  For us, it is KP Duty.</li>
            <li> My upper arms have plagued me since puberty with red unsightly bumps so bad that sleeveless and even short sleeve shirts were a problem but now my arms have only one or two bumps left and they arent prominent.  I can wear sleeveless now with confidence.  I also started using it on my husbands sided where he has problems and it has started clearing him up in only a week.  I too would have given 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the price.  Thanks KP double duty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the red bumpy skin. Used a whole tube, didn&#x27;t notice a bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously expensive but if you want to get rid of those KP bumps nearly immediately, this is the ticket.  I combine it with the scrub used once per week and the results are immediate and terrific.  Wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have had KP since I can remember on my upper arms.  About 8 months after the birth of my first child, all of a sudden I noticed it on my forearms as well.  Though I had put up with it for a long time on my upper arms, this was too much to take - it suddenly seemed much more noticeable!  After doing a fair amount of research I ordered this product.  I used it alone for two months (I thought I could take the cheap way out), and did see fairly good results, but not what I was hoping for so I ordered the Body Scrub Chemical and Medi-exfoliant cream as well and I am very happy with the combination of products.  The lotion alone def makes your skin much softer, and somewhat minimizes the redness and bumps, but with the exfoliant cream, it does a much better job.  I have been using both now for a month and a half, and am very happy with the job it is doing.  My arms are continuously getting smoother and less red.  I don&#x27;t know if it will take it completely away after time, but it is so much better than it was before.  Get both products and you will see a vast improvement - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Never a problem with ordering and getting this product as promised.  I think I may have developed a tolerance to it on my right arm though. Left arm is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it says (as long as you use it everyday). The back of my legs and arms are bump free.</li>
            <li> My son loves to use this to help quell his &amp;#34; chicken bump skin &amp;#34;! It provides moisture  and helps to hydrate the epidermis to protect it from forming the roughness that characterizes the dermatological condition Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li> I have had issues more with the redness than actual bumps since puberty.  But here recently, the bumps were becoming more prominent.  So I thought I would try a product for the first time.  For the first 3-4 days, my arms seem to feel and look better, then it all took a turn for the worse.  The bumps became way more prominent and then started to spread to my lower arms and chest.  The redness became worse as well.  I immediately stopped using the product after about 2 weeks of usage and everything seemed to go back to normal.  I might have just had a bad reaction but thought I would give some warning to those looking to spend this much money on a product.</li>
            <li> This cream worked so well, within 3 weeks a huge difference in the bumps and dryness on my legs.  The within 1 months considerable amount of fading with the brown marks left behind and overall smoothness.</li>
            <li> I got red bumps for the first time after I had my kids and its bothered me ever since. I have used this a few times. Finally bit the bullet and bought the two tubes, even though it is expensive, because it actually works for me. My arms are not perfect, but there is a definite marked improvement. Its worth it to me, especially when I wear sleeveless. I am sure it is not going to work well with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry, but its worth a try at least once. I noticed a difference within the firt week or so.</li>
            <li> This usually clears up my dry skin and/or KP within a week. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Worth every penny to me</li>
            <li> Pros: It works! Easy to apply, and after about a week you will notice that the chicken skin is smoother and less noticeable,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Cost!</li>
