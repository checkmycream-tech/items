            <li>It works beautifully every time, and can also be used to add texture for clean hair to aid in manageability.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If they had sent me a corrected bottle after the defective one I purchased, then I would continue to purchase this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice though.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, it worked well</li>
            <li>The product dissolves nicely and blends in with your hair.</li>
            <li>It also helps lend some nice body to my hair making it a bit easier to style.</li>
            <li>When I tried to return it, I was told it can not be returned because it is considered hazardous because the can is under pressure.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job, I thought, but for as many oz that were in there, I felt it should have lasted longer?</li>
            <li>When I do use it, it doesn&#x27;t really effectively remove the greasy-ness from my hair.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that soaks up the oil and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>It comes out perfectly foamy, yet it&#x27;s not hard to brush it into my hair.    </li>
            <li>It is a great product for a quick pick up for your hair on an in-between day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries the oils quickly, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>It is probably the most amazing product I have ever purchased for my hair.  </li>
            <li>then that the product was great.. not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>it works really great and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It was awesome for camping trips when you can&#x27;t shower every day, and for summer in general when I tend to get oily faster in the humidity.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair look waxy like some can do, it honestly makes my hair look just as good or better than freshly shampooed hair.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product and good for the days when u r in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of absorbing oil and keeping volume in your hair while leaving it smelling clean.</li>
            <li>It soaks up oil, gives amazing volume and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is ideal for keeping colors vivid longer.    </li>
            <li>It nice to have to touch up my hair at the end of the day when I have a meeting as I have fine hair and</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I hope they are able to fix the packaging at some point.</li>
            <li>They sent me two more replacements.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many defective bottles they will send me until I get a corrected bottle.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a product that a lot of hospitals use that works much better, but they didn&#x27;t have it at the beauty supply shop</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>LOVE this Tigi product.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I have a bottle in the house.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You can just spray it in your hair, unlike most where you tap a powder on your head.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>Ok so here is the deal with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it for coverage too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic I&#x27;m telling you.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>(if the product is not SOLD and shipped by Amazon) to be sure you&#x27;re buying from a quality vendor.</li>
            <li>I do keep mine on top of the cabinet and not in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to shake the bottle well before use.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product tends to work better if you comb it through your hair rather than just spaying and letting it set.      </li>
            <li>One of my best friends runs a local salon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for more than a month now</li>
            <li>My hair has become healthier, shinier, and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>There ARE better products out there.</li>
            <li>so I should be safe to exchange.</li>
            <li>Also, it will leave your hair feeling powdery, of course, but that&#x27;s way better than clumpy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but I&#x27;m iffy on the packaging.      </li>
            <li>this morning I went to use it, relying on it to get my hair work appropriate...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and recommend it to people often.</li>
            <li>But I find this is great for making my hair look good when I do pull it back on non-wash days and makes it easier to control.  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair good body when I use it on freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>Okay so the first time I used it, it was AMAZING!</li>
            <li>but it should have more than one use out of it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the volume it gives my hair too.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and the performance so much better than the Biosilk.  </li>
            <li>Always has been my favorite-</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product rocks :) It keeps her hair in place and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But overall I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this online for $13 vs $20 in the store.  </li>
            <li>Think it may be better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>so that is what I have always done since and have never had any more problems with losing the spray out it.  </li>
            <li>This is for sure my favorite one because it left my hair looking and feeling the best.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it one more time.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the packaging has to change.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>It felt as though there was more in there, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to come out.</li>
            <li>When that ran out, I considered buying more, but also kept thinking of this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy, it really extends the time I can go without washing my hair, which saves me time and reduces color fade.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the Redken one</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>but still it seems like this products is not meant to be used more that a couple of times.</li>
            <li>It works great, smells good, lasts long and adds volume.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>normally their products smell great</li>
            <li>First I will start with the good.  </li>
            <li>Bummed and still searching for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>Is the best dry shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li>One of the best dry shampoos IMO is KMS.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I  sure you will find far more pleasant reviews than this scam-a-holic spray.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have used!</li>
            <li>Have to shake the bottle well before use, great smell (my husband is sensitive to scents), volume and hold.</li>
            <li>It actually has a very pleasant and clean smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day and this is the perfect product for day two.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, it makes my hair feel and look clean and not oily</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to justify the purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I can easily go about 4 days without washing my hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t and it has this clean citrusy scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Rockaholic is a beauty product that since I&#x27;ve been using I can honestly say I will not be able to live without!  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than salons, nice unique fruity smell!</li>
            <li>I love it, it lasts most of the day and makes my hair smell fresh and clean again.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work with my fine hair even though i read that&#x27;s who it should work well for.  </li>
            <li>mine works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine, uncolored hair and any oil on my scalp shows.</li>
            <li>Nice to not have to wash every day and keep the oils down keeping your hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>As all the others who mentioned it, this product has a huge problem with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Wish they&#x27;d fix this problem because I would be a huge fan and would always keep a bottle in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It adds huge amounts of volume if you flip your head over when your working the product in with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>So I although I love the product is it worth replacing the can after a couple uses?</li>
            <li>but the bottle was so light and is already finishing like if it had already been used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter, and acts as a light hair spray as well, allowing your hair to hold its style.    </li>
            <li>I did that because what&#x27;s in the bottle is absolutely fantastic...</li>
            <li>I was able to get 7 uses out of the can but considering the price you pay that is hardly worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is by no means cheap.</li>
            <li>There are some people who have been refunded or sent free product to make up for it, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there is a chance that after spending [...] bucks, you may be SOL.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you color your hair and are trying to prevent fading from using regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works great but totally over priced.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the best hair product I had purchased in a long time - I sang its praises for the first 2 uses ...</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Dove dry shampoo which smells great and works just as good for half the price.</li>
            <li>Although I was initially interested in the product because I knew that, if it worked, it&#x27;d save me a lot of time in drying and styling my hair, I have since found out that it has an even more important advantage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Big Sexy Hair and have been very satisfied with that product.</li>
            <li>It really is the best dry shampoo available.</li>
            <li>The light citrus scent is fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell like a product (I found the tresseme had a citrus scent AND a strong smell of cheap hairspray)</li>
            <li>I used this product years ago, and loved the fresh clean scent and how it works very well to quickly absorb oil without any trace of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair looks fresh and feels and smells clean!      </li>
            <li>I was SO excited after I used it.</li>
            <li>I originally used baby powder on days</li>
            <li>My hair is so much more willing to &#x27;do&#x27; when I use this for a couple days instead of washing my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>First, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Used it, the scent was a bit strong but citrusy and it made my hair feel fresh and clean and gave it fantastic body.    </li>
            <li>I have 2 boys under the age of 3, so maybe I skipped a couple more showers than I thought I did ;)</li>
            <li>great for people with long hair to give your hair a break&lt;br</li>
            <li>The white powder-like substance on my roots completely disappears and my hair looks and smells great!  </li>
            <li>The light scent isn&#x27;t over-powering and and fades quickly after product is applied.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this one better, and the visual packaging.  </li>
            <li>Although my  hair looks clean</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look completely clean without making the hair &#x27;stick together&#x27; or powdery.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and hassle free.</li>
            <li>You will find your hair looks as if you just washed it and your hair will stay clean looking all day.</li>
            <li>and you need to clean the excess from hair or will be whitish.</li>
            <li>I like my hair feeling clean and silky but</li>
            <li>I have been fortunate enough to find some good sales on it and will pick it up when it is about 1/2 price, but would never pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overwhelming at first but dissipates quickly</li>
            <li>it works great, by far the best that I have tried, but the can was empty the next day!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different dry shampoos and found this to be the best!  </li>
            <li>and I would compare it most closely to the Rockaholic brand, except that I am more satisfied with this dry shampoo in price and performance.</li>
            <li>The product dries quickly and easily rubs in leaving hair looking freshly washed and with added volume.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, no build up, feels clean and fresh, and</li>
            <li>I used it twice, both times on pretty greasy hair and it turned my greased locks into clean locks!</li>
            <li>This product is ok; it does remove some of the oily moisture but only really suitable for one day in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The product itself works great however after 3 uses the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>This really does get me through one more day without washing my hair.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my hair stylist and I loved the product; HOWEVER, I only got 4 uses out of it</li>
            <li>Everything everyone else wrote is true.</li>
            <li>I bought this for those days where I just didn&#x27;t have time to go through my full routine..</li>
            <li>Pay full price</li>
            <li>I am a brunette and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gray or white and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I used it one time and all the pressure escaped, but I called and they took full responsibility and admitted the problem.</li>
            <li>If you do get a full one, my wife appears to be getting about 12-13 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>The best way to use this product I found is to spray it on as you would a root pump on dry hair (dries pretty fast)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried plenty of dry shampoo products over the years, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, brownish-blonde hair that gets oily pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I am super outdoorsy too...</li>
            <li>, I just know it&#x27;s better than Rockaholic because it only cost $5 more and has outlast Rockaholic by miles.    </li>
            <li>My hair stylist said that that brand tends to evaporate quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a lot in the air to inhale (i&#x27;m pregnant and anal about fumes)</li>
            <li>Great also for adding volume without having to back comb so much.</li>
            <li>Right now yes, because I haven&#x27;t found anything good enough to replace it.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, the white powder is easily brushed out, and it does not go greasy midday like the Tresemme Fresh Start does.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, if you put too much it, it comes out easily with a bit of water.</li>
            <li>I was given this product by my mom, who always knows I&#x27;m on the look out for a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell sticks, by the way, but isn&#x27;t so strong those around you can smell it unless they&#x27;re really close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the first one lasted a good 3 months using it about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still on the look out for a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I was thoroughly amazed!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, you don&#x27;t even need to use much for you hair to look as if you&#x27;d washed it that very day, my hair tends to get super greasy super fast so discovering this product was like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Residue?</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the product itself - after trying every single dry shampoo on the market, I still haven&#x27;t found a good replacement!</li>
            <li>This product works very well for my fine, grease-prone hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight shoulder length fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty sweet.  </li>
            <li>After just one more night in the cabinet, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Also it makes my hair smell really fresh.  </li>
            <li>and it looks freshly washed.</li>
            <li>My favorite thus far is found in Got 2</li>
            <li>but mine have all lasted to where I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Baby powder works exactly the same and at a fraction of the cost... and lasts more than one use!  </li>
            <li>Stylist told me not to use too much other wise</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using the got2be brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure TIGI has fixed that issue now, but the product itself didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>With this product I can go 3 days and it looks and smells clean the whole time.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I&#x27;ve always had the lid on the bottle inbetween uses and have been able to get a lot of dry shampoos out of the product.  </li>
            <li>but after you get the right amount down hair looks good.</li>
            <li>Since I loved the product SO much, I bought another can, and much to my dismay, the same thing</li>
            <li>Not only is it a huge time saver for those of us with kids, jobs, workouts, and ball games, but it allows time for your \\&quot;natural oils\\&quot; to build up, which is EXTREMELY healthy for your hair, without looking or feeling like you don&#x27;t have clean hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it because I love dry shampoos</li>
            <li>I have light blonde fine hair and have used several dry shampoo products, this is by far the best for coverage and body.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much for it to work .</li>
            <li>Rockaholic is definitely the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot so far).  </li>
            <li>I had to be VERY careful with the Rockaholic brand to make sure the nozzle didn&#x27;t stick and continue to spray lightly after each use.</li>
            <li>The Bed Head product is good, you can use a lot or a little</li>
            <li>If that is the problem you&#x27;re experiencing, then I highly recommend you pay the full salon price.</li>
            <li>, they had a huge batch go out like that, but they have fixed the problem and it shouldnt happen</li>
            <li>That said, I love this product, and I&#x27;m now ordering my second can from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the first bottle at it leaked.  </li>
            <li>the first use.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertized-</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this products for brunettes because it is a white powder and even when combed in it lightens your roots which is great if your blonde not so much if your not.</li>
            <li>I love to use this stuff when I straighten my hair and don&#x27;t want to wash it the next day.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and the bottle feels/</li>
            <li>The gas somehow releases after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased, just shake it well, and spray until you can see the white substance come out.</li>
            <li>first time I used the product I was told at point of purchase not to allow the bottle to tip</li>
            <li>The first bottle I had of this product-</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how there are so many reviews saying this only lasts for three or so uses.</li>
            <li>I have had a bottle of this for over two months, and I use it regularly, and have used it way more than three times.</li>
            <li>it immediately and returns it to soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many others and they either do not work, leave white stuff, or make your hair sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to accept.  </li>
            <li>I use this at least once a week, and when I do use it I always get compliments on how great I smell.</li>
            <li>I just laugh and say &#x27;thanks&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I use it whenever I want to extend my style an extra day, since I can&#x27;t go more than a day without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have even been able to occasionally stretch my shampooing to every third day with this brand and have been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I thought I just got a dud, but after reading the reviews it seems like this is a consistent problem.  </li>
            <li>When I used it, it worked pretty well</li>
            <li>Well, sure enough, I used it once</li>
            <li>and you can literally hear the air coming out, haha!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it daily, more like 5 times per month.</li>
            <li>Seeing as the price has come down, I decided to give it a shot, and am very glad I did!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos and this is by far the most superior of all I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos and this is the very best one.  </li>
            <li>but at least it&#x27;s good for quick morning ponytails that do not look greasy</li>
            <li>My hairstylist suggested dry shampoo to add body to my baby fine hair even when it is clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others (cheap &amp; expensive) and was never as happy with them as I am with this one.</li>
            <li>TIGI is aware that a large percentage of the canisters and spray tops are malfunctioning and leaking product.</li>
            <li>With all that positive feedback expressed, I cannot endorse this product.</li>
            <li>So happy with this dry shampoo, can&#x27;t believe how long I suffered without it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The most deciding factor in this dry shampoo:  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so you were getting more uses out of a can, this would be my go to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is fabulous while it lasts!</li>
            <li>My wife is very particular with her hair.</li>
            <li>because it is easy - with issues like this, I might as well just go to a local store and pick it up.  </li>
            <li>It just makes the top layer of hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li>I love TIGI products and am rarely ever let down.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased it only lasted a few sprays like some of the others here have experienced</li>
            <li>The Suave brand is $2.77 and lasts forever, but is far less superior than TIGI.</li>
            <li>I have natural blonde hair that is very fine and prone to being VERY oily.</li>
            <li>This amazing product allows me to refresh my hairstyle and avoid daily hair washing, which ultimately leads to healthier hair.</li>
            <li>I use it very liberally and probably get about 60-100 sprays from each can.  </li>
            <li>(you have to work it in really well</li>
            <li>I really wish they would fix the issues with the can.</li>
            <li>Brushing helps this as well- and learning not to use too much of the spray.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really greasy around my forehead, and since I have bangs</li>
            <li>How much are you applying with each use?</li>
            <li>] dollars on a product that may or may not work, regardless of how much of a rockstar I look like after using it.</li>
            <li>will buy from again very soon</li>
            <li>and I dont really notice any odor after 5-10minutes.</li>
            <li>it looks as if you are going gray (very powdery).</li>
            <li>It works very well to soak up excess oil and add volume.</li>
            <li>Read some reviews that said you need to shake the can really well before applying and while applying</li>
            <li>If you use to much you will see flakes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this!</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T buy it unless you have a reason why you&#x27;ll use the whole can in a day or two.</li>
            <li>This product work really well</li>
            <li>I use it immediately before styling, and often it lasts 2 days, just a light spritz the second day.</li>
            <li>I hear a lot about product running out too fast</li>
            <li>That friend has recently switched to the Suave brand and liked it equally as well.   </li>
            <li>I mean it smells good</li>
            <li>, I will use Blow&#x27;s dry hair powder, or another brand (or even baby powder), as it is becoming an easier to find product.</li>
            <li>I have really oily roots and had to wash my hair each day, which is fine until it&#x27;s long.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to find it on Amazon for only 10 bucks!    </li>
            <li>I use it more before I&#x27;m due to get my highlights done</li>
            <li>however i wasnt able to use it since then due to the spray can not working.</li>
            <li>Like many other customers, I found that the can didn&#x27;t put out any product when I received it.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is naturally wavy, it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly straight past Monday, however, it stays relatively straight, clean, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>, you get it and its full and heavy and in a couple of days its light and its all gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually funny seeing people sniffing around trying to find the source of the smell, and ,when they finally figure out it&#x27;s my hair, I&#x27;m always told how I smell like fresh citrus.</li>
            <li>It must just depend how much you use, whether you cover your entire head or just the areas where your hair gets greasy quickly.</li>
            <li>Tried many dry shampoos... by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts long and rubs in smooth.</li>
            <li>and I can do a full up do or curl it back out.  </li>
            <li>So basically I bought a full 6.3 oz bottle and only used 1/50th of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have to start work pretty early in the morning - I have to leave my house by 5:30</li>
            <li>Anyone with fine, thin hair would love this.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I tried, and I since using this I have also tried Tresemme&#x27;s and Big Sexy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel like new!</li>
            <li>When it comes out of the aerosol can, it does leave a fine white powder on your hair, but if you follow the instructions and massage it in slightly, wait a few minutes and brush the excess out, it looks great.</li>
            <li>I had been using cheap drugstore brand dry shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>but I never believed it was any better than any of the others that were $5 or less.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s color less or undetectable anyway AND touching my hair</li>
            <li>The customer rep told me to use the second bottle and if it did the same thing, call them again and they would send out more replacements.  </li>
            <li>So I bought another bottle, and sure enough, it lasted MONTHS with regular use.</li>
            <li>but they have been resolved (the quantity issue came up with older reviews, from what I remember).  </li>
            <li>I can usually get 2 more days out of my hair before washing thanks to this!</li>
            <li>The others only seem to make my hair smell better, but with the same greasy look.  </li>
            <li>So I used it the next day and the sad thing is, the product itself is awesome</li>
            <li>and you want to calm it down a bit without doing a full scrub?  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the product, but caution as to who you buy it from.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had this experience with my second bottle, which luckily my hairdresser replaced free of charge after I found it empty the day after purchasing it.    </li>
            <li>Same thing as the first bottle!  </li>
            <li>I have really long fine blond hair that gets greasy pretty quick, but I can go for a few days without washing my hair with this product.</li>
            <li>This is normal.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look fresh without leaving the white that the baby powder does (that&#x27;s what I used to do)</li>
            <li>and it looks normal after that.  </li>
            <li>The last two bottles i bought did not spray white, I was able to spray directly into my hair.</li>
            <li>but normally this \\&quot;crap\\&quot; is $20</li>
            <li>to be able not to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li>I twist it a little left and right and place it by my ear to make sure I don&#x27;t hear anything</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely helpful in getting myself ready when i dont have time to wash my hair, it really helps my hair look less greasy, love it!</li>
            <li>My roommate used it and she has very dark brown, almost black hair, and it worked great on hers too.     </li>
            <li>I have used many brands of dry shampoo and use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>I have kind of oily hair, so I can&#x27;t really keep my hair down on days I don&#x27;t wash it, dry shampoo or not.  </li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t suggest letting it get near the tips of your hair, either, because it&#x27;s basically pure alcohol, and can, in so many words, &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li>You must place the can in a cool, dry place that doesn&#x27;t have any moisture, as when you take a shower the moisture in the air will cause it to evaporate.  </li>
            <li>I am a true believer in dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I popped into the store and figured \\&quot;I like other TIGI products so this will be just as reliable and the price is based on the fantastic quality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Nice for days after work when I need a little help because time is short.</li>
            <li>Why would I ever spend $20 on a new bottle of this product and go through this again.  </li>
            <li>Good - I typically wash my hair every other day to avoid drying it out.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m sure the product was actually shipped empty.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and hated always having to wash every day, it really does work great.</li>
            <li>If I use too much the white powder will show up a little, but I think I&#x27;ve gotten better at applying it and avoid that problem.  </li>
            <li>I used the first of my two replacement bottles and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>erasing the greasy spots like magic and giving lifeless 2nd or 3rd day hair that extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; of body and freshness.    </li>
            <li>and the exact same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>and I tousled my hair to work the product in, but it looked EXACTLY the same and my hair stayed oily until I took a shower.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Product, I use it all the time when not able to  shampoo hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>No white residue and no weird odor.</li>
            <li>So I called up Ulta today and the girl I talked to said she bought 2 bottles last year and just finished up her first bottle no problem</li>
            <li>but you only get two uses out of it, its pretty wierd to get a can</li>
            <li>/&gt;Years ago, the first bottle I bought, for ~$20, I only got about 5 uses and it stopped working.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, I have been able to take a shower, add a little argon oil, let my hair air dry, and go about my day without feeling like I looked like a psuedo troll doll.  </li>
            <li>the bottle which seems to be be why everyone hates this product: All you people need to do is check your nozzle every time you use it, take it to your ear and hear if there&#x27;s any hissing sound, if there is just play around with the nozzle moving it from side to side, moving the bottle upside down or spray a bit and then check again, it should stop.</li>
            <li>they tell they difference between the old and new bottles?\\</li>
            <li>If they are sending it to me as a replacement because they can&#x27;t tell the difference between the old and new bottles, then they are still sending it to stores to sell.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve tried many) that actually works to make your hair less oily and fuller.  </li>
            <li>I have used this products for many months but typically purchase from my local salon.</li>
            <li>This prevents my hair from being weighed down or greasy feeling, and has a pleasant, but not overwhelming, smell.</li>
            <li>I just pin up my bangs and spray a bit underneath my hair, close to my roots, wait a few seconds, and then comb it out with a fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if these reviewers attempted to apply the dry shampoo to their entire head and went through it much more quickly than they needed to, or, if there is a problem with the product leaking out when the lid isn&#x27;t on.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many other drug store dry shampoos but this one was recommended by my hair stylist, who stated, &amp;</li>
            <li>This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve read several reviews for other products, and it&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>Clearly a majority of this product  was used.</li>
            <li>and they promised that the bottles had been fixed</li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>I payed $20 for this, and its a complete scam that it lasted two uses.     </li>
            <li>I recieved my product fast - but I only used it twice</li>
            <li>Let me assure you that it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my 7 year old son&#x27;s hair (who didn&#x27;t take his shower like he was supposed to one night and didn&#x27;t have time before school to do so).  </li>
            <li>I looked for this product everywhere, and this one was by far the cheapest place to get it.</li>
            <li>When the can gets low it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out very well.  </li>
            <li>I think they fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>I saw comments about the bottle being faulty, but I also saw that problem was fixed...</li>
            <li>Mine has lasted a couple months now because I don&#x27;t use it too frequently.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this seller is selling old bottles.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product based on my experience, and I hope people give it another try bought professionally.</li>
            <li>I have used mine at least 8 times and I can still feel that the can is pretty full.</li>
            <li>but I have found that if  I keep it in my bathroom under the sink where it is dark and cool it does not.</li>
            <li>I know that there are a lot of people who said they wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because they were only able to get a few uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair but ALOT of it and have had trouble in the past with it feeling greasy if I went more than a day washing my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used dry shampoo; got the idea from my niece.</li>
            <li>It does takes some practice using at first if you&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before-</li>
            <li>Also, the can always comes half full.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why so many people have complained about the product not lasting more than 3 or 4 uses.  </li>
            <li>I have SUPER dry hair, so shampooing every day is a big &#x27;no no&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I originally passed it up at the beauty salon because of it but the only other alternative turned my hair into a clay pot.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark so this is extra important to me.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I was mistaken, but after I purchased this a second time from another seller, it had the SAME result:  </li>
            <li>This particular can is spraying white, so i have to spray it on my hand and rub into my hair.</li>
            <li>I have bought from different vendors and found most to be quality; however this last product arrived partially damaged (not related to packaging) - nothing that impacted the performance of the product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine shoulder-length hair which tends to look very limp unless I shampoo every day.</li>
            <li>All of the dry shampoos take away the  natural shine as they are absorbing oil and</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s usually a \\&quot;fissing\\&quot; sound).  </li>
            <li>and it would last like a normal aerosol</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works to a certain extent.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a local store, and when I did, the sales person warned me that you CANNOT tilt this can or lay it down on its side while storing it or all of the product will evaporate out -- which, I would assume, would be the reason that so many are unsatisfied by how long it lasts.      </li>
            <li>it did not make my hair look clean as expected, it looks frizzy and overly dry</li>
            <li>I have not ran into the issue of packaging, I shake the can really well before and after each use, I have found shaking AFTER each use has helped with a lot of the dry shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li>They offered me a \\&quot;one time\\&quot; free replacement, so I accepted and it showed up on my doorstep a few days later.  </li>
            <li>sounds like it&#x27;ll last at least a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t spray enough your hair will obviously not look like it has been shampooed, but if you spray too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already used it at least 15 times and there&#x27;s still more left.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Dry shampoo that I have tried and I would definitely recommend purchasing this!</li>
            <li>You just spray it from mid strand down and it leaves your hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair, but my actual strand width is not very thick.</li>
            <li>I see other reviewers posted the same complaint over 6 months ago, but it is clear it has not been effectively addressed.</li>
            <li>I really like how this dry shampoo really soaks up the oils from your scalp for people that wash their hair every other day.</li>
            <li>but overall was a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li>no get discouraged by the negative reviews, it&#x27;s a fantastic product with a somewhat defective package that can be dealt with.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally use too much it can leave a strange white residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>So they corrected the bottles, but they did not recall the old product, nor did they mark them differently so that they could identify the corrected bottles from the faulty ones.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this company is content to keep a defective product instead of recalling it.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;ve been using Rockaholic 2 to 3 times a week since I initially bought it in early October</li>
            <li>This was the third time I went to use it, and it was completely gone.     </li>
            <li>Especially considering I buy this product quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I was surprised to see such low ratings.  </li>
            <li>Also, kind of a silly thing, but</li>
            <li>this one is kind of weird.</li>
            <li>As I said, I have been using this product approximately 5 days a week for more than a month</li>
            <li>I am down to the end of my first can and did not have any problems that others have reported.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using Tigi Dry Shampoo for awhile and highly recommends it to clients.  </li>
            <li>and since I only use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my hair, It&#x27;s lasted me a significant amount of time</li>
            <li>as that sounds, I like my stuff in a nicer package and am willing to pay an extra buck or two, so long as I&#x27;m getting similar total usage.</li>
            <li>Super easy - just pop it off after each use and pop it back on when you want to use it again and this stuff should last 3 months if you don&#x27;t go crazy and use it all over your head every time you use it.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t even use what was left because the spray top was broken</li>
            <li>Having your hair sprayed and look grey was a bit alarming at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a slight spray that you have to put the bottle right up next to your ear to hear it.</li>
            <li>Despite what a previous user said - I did keep this product in my bedroom - in a cool, dry place and both bottles - I only got 2 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot with my naturally dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never expected such a thing from an Amazon seller.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I am a faux red-head, so the first few weeks after dyeing my hair</li>
            <li>It just had some serious scratches - I expected better.  </li>
            <li>So keep the can in your bedroom instead, and disregard the other negative reviews that say \\&quot;I love the product but only got 1 or 2 uses out of it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was extremely busy with college, and I had to use this dry shampoo two days in a row with no shower-shampoo..  </li>
            <li>I used to use baby powder and that is so messy and being able to spray this stuff on is so much easier and so much less messy!</li>
            <li>I would love it if TIGI could just fix the product packaging so that people like me would actually get our money&#x27;s worth of product :(</li>
            <li>So I called the company to complain and they apologized saying that there was a problem that had been fixed and mailed me a new bottle within a few days.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how your biggest focus when using dry shampoo should be your roots, and you should always use a natural brush to brush it through your hair to get rid of that powdery look</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair, it has to be washed daily, if not, by a day and a half</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I chose  the Rockaholic, hoping it might be half as good...</li>
            <li>No visible one, it only feels a little bit like hairspray residue if  you scrunch it, but not something anyone will notice, my boyfriend who loves playing with my hair certainly hasn&#x27;t noticed anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured there had been a leak or something but didn&#x27;t take it back because I was so busy and didn&#x27;t keep the receipt (not thinking I would need to keep a receipt for dry shampoo)!</li>
            <li>It works well when it does spray but HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Some dry shampoos have a bad odor, but this one is very nice.</li>
            <li>: If you get too much in one area, it can turn the hair a little white.</li>
            <li>For those who have complained that it doesn&#x27;t last a long time, this stuff actually lasts much longer than most, you just have to pop the sprayer off after each use so that you don&#x27;t waste the gas (just like any other aerosol spray).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t get the SuperCut special and therefore has relatively long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I always try to rate a product from both sides so here is the good and the bad about this product.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully every time, and can also be used to add texture for clean hair to aid in manageability.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> If they had sent me a corrected bottle after the defective one I purchased, then I would continue to purchase this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice though.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, it worked well</li>
            <li> The product dissolves nicely and blends in with your hair.</li>
            <li> It also helps lend some nice body to my hair making it a bit easier to style.</li>
            <li> When I tried to return it, I was told it can not be returned because it is considered hazardous because the can is under pressure.  </li>
            <li> It did a good job, I thought, but for as many oz that were in there, I felt it should have lasted longer?</li>
            <li> When I do use it, it doesn&#x27;t really effectively remove the greasy-ness from my hair.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that soaks up the oil and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li> It comes out perfectly foamy, yet it&#x27;s not hard to brush it into my hair.    </li>
            <li> It is a great product for a quick pick up for your hair on an in-between day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries the oils quickly, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> It is probably the most amazing product I have ever purchased for my hair.  </li>
            <li> then that the product was great.. not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> it works really great and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It was awesome for camping trips when you can&#x27;t shower every day, and for summer in general when I tend to get oily faster in the humidity.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair look waxy like some can do, it honestly makes my hair look just as good or better than freshly shampooed hair.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product and good for the days when u r in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job of absorbing oil and keeping volume in your hair while leaving it smelling clean.</li>
            <li> It soaks up oil, gives amazing volume and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is ideal for keeping colors vivid longer.    </li>
            <li> It nice to have to touch up my hair at the end of the day when I have a meeting as I have fine hair and</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I hope they are able to fix the packaging at some point.</li>
            <li> They sent me two more replacements.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many defective bottles they will send me until I get a corrected bottle.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a product that a lot of hospitals use that works much better, but they didn&#x27;t have it at the beauty supply shop</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> LOVE this Tigi product.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I have a bottle in the house.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You can just spray it in your hair, unlike most where you tap a powder on your head.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff-</li>
            <li> Ok so here is the deal with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it for coverage too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic I&#x27;m telling you.</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> (if the product is not SOLD and shipped by Amazon) to be sure you&#x27;re buying from a quality vendor.</li>
            <li> I do keep mine on top of the cabinet and not in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to shake the bottle well before use.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product tends to work better if you comb it through your hair rather than just spaying and letting it set.      </li>
            <li> One of my best friends runs a local salon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for more than a month now</li>
            <li> My hair has become healthier, shinier, and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> There ARE better products out there.</li>
            <li> so I should be safe to exchange.</li>
            <li> Also, it will leave your hair feeling powdery, of course, but that&#x27;s way better than clumpy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I&#x27;m iffy on the packaging.      </li>
            <li> this morning I went to use it, relying on it to get my hair work appropriate...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and recommend it to people often.</li>
            <li> But I find this is great for making my hair look good when I do pull it back on non-wash days and makes it easier to control.  </li>
            <li> Gives my hair good body when I use it on freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> Okay so the first time I used it, it was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> but it should have more than one use out of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the volume it gives my hair too.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the performance so much better than the Biosilk.  </li>
            <li> Always has been my favorite-</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product rocks :) It keeps her hair in place and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But overall I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this online for $13 vs $20 in the store.  </li>
            <li> Think it may be better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> so that is what I have always done since and have never had any more problems with losing the spray out it.  </li>
            <li> This is for sure my favorite one because it left my hair looking and feeling the best.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it one more time.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the packaging has to change.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> It felt as though there was more in there, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to come out.</li>
            <li> When that ran out, I considered buying more, but also kept thinking of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy, it really extends the time I can go without washing my hair, which saves me time and reduces color fade.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the Redken one</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> but still it seems like this products is not meant to be used more that a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It works great, smells good, lasts long and adds volume.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> normally their products smell great</li>
            <li> First I will start with the good.  </li>
            <li> Bummed and still searching for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Is the best dry shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li> One of the best dry shampoos IMO is KMS.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I  sure you will find far more pleasant reviews than this scam-a-holic spray.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have used!</li>
            <li> Have to shake the bottle well before use, great smell (my husband is sensitive to scents), volume and hold.</li>
            <li> It actually has a very pleasant and clean smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and this is the perfect product for day two.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, it makes my hair feel and look clean and not oily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to justify the purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I can easily go about 4 days without washing my hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t and it has this clean citrusy scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Rockaholic is a beauty product that since I&#x27;ve been using I can honestly say I will not be able to live without!  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than salons, nice unique fruity smell!</li>
            <li> I love it, it lasts most of the day and makes my hair smell fresh and clean again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work with my fine hair even though i read that&#x27;s who it should work well for.  </li>
            <li> mine works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine, uncolored hair and any oil on my scalp shows.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have to wash every day and keep the oils down keeping your hair looking great.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> As all the others who mentioned it, this product has a huge problem with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Wish they&#x27;d fix this problem because I would be a huge fan and would always keep a bottle in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It adds huge amounts of volume if you flip your head over when your working the product in with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> So I although I love the product is it worth replacing the can after a couple uses?</li>
            <li> but the bottle was so light and is already finishing like if it had already been used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter, and acts as a light hair spray as well, allowing your hair to hold its style.    </li>
            <li> I did that because what&#x27;s in the bottle is absolutely fantastic...</li>
            <li> I was able to get 7 uses out of the can but considering the price you pay that is hardly worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is by no means cheap.</li>
            <li> There are some people who have been refunded or sent free product to make up for it, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there is a chance that after spending [...] bucks, you may be SOL.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you color your hair and are trying to prevent fading from using regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great but totally over priced.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the best hair product I had purchased in a long time - I sang its praises for the first 2 uses ...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Dove dry shampoo which smells great and works just as good for half the price.</li>
            <li> Although I was initially interested in the product because I knew that, if it worked, it&#x27;d save me a lot of time in drying and styling my hair, I have since found out that it has an even more important advantage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Big Sexy Hair and have been very satisfied with that product.</li>
            <li> It really is the best dry shampoo available.</li>
            <li> The light citrus scent is fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell like a product (I found the tresseme had a citrus scent AND a strong smell of cheap hairspray)</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, and loved the fresh clean scent and how it works very well to quickly absorb oil without any trace of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair looks fresh and feels and smells clean!      </li>
            <li> I was SO excited after I used it.</li>
            <li> I originally used baby powder on days</li>
            <li> My hair is so much more willing to &#x27;do&#x27; when I use this for a couple days instead of washing my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> First, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Used it, the scent was a bit strong but citrusy and it made my hair feel fresh and clean and gave it fantastic body.    </li>
            <li> I have 2 boys under the age of 3, so maybe I skipped a couple more showers than I thought I did ;)</li>
            <li> great for people with long hair to give your hair a break&lt;br</li>
            <li> The white powder-like substance on my roots completely disappears and my hair looks and smells great!  </li>
            <li> The light scent isn&#x27;t over-powering and and fades quickly after product is applied.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this one better, and the visual packaging.  </li>
            <li> Although my  hair looks clean</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look completely clean without making the hair &#x27;stick together&#x27; or powdery.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and hassle free.</li>
            <li> You will find your hair looks as if you just washed it and your hair will stay clean looking all day.</li>
            <li> and you need to clean the excess from hair or will be whitish.</li>
            <li> I like my hair feeling clean and silky but</li>
            <li> I have been fortunate enough to find some good sales on it and will pick it up when it is about 1/2 price, but would never pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overwhelming at first but dissipates quickly</li>
            <li> it works great, by far the best that I have tried, but the can was empty the next day!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos and found this to be the best!  </li>
            <li> and I would compare it most closely to the Rockaholic brand, except that I am more satisfied with this dry shampoo in price and performance.</li>
            <li> The product dries quickly and easily rubs in leaving hair looking freshly washed and with added volume.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, no build up, feels clean and fresh, and</li>
            <li> I used it twice, both times on pretty greasy hair and it turned my greased locks into clean locks!</li>
            <li> This product is ok; it does remove some of the oily moisture but only really suitable for one day in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great however after 3 uses the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This really does get me through one more day without washing my hair.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist and I loved the product; HOWEVER, I only got 4 uses out of it</li>
            <li> Everything everyone else wrote is true.</li>
            <li> I bought this for those days where I just didn&#x27;t have time to go through my full routine..</li>
            <li> Pay full price</li>
            <li> I am a brunette and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gray or white and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and all the pressure escaped, but I called and they took full responsibility and admitted the problem.</li>
            <li> If you do get a full one, my wife appears to be getting about 12-13 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> The best way to use this product I found is to spray it on as you would a root pump on dry hair (dries pretty fast)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of dry shampoo products over the years, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, brownish-blonde hair that gets oily pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I am super outdoorsy too...</li>
            <li> , I just know it&#x27;s better than Rockaholic because it only cost $5 more and has outlast Rockaholic by miles.    </li>
            <li> My hair stylist said that that brand tends to evaporate quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a lot in the air to inhale (i&#x27;m pregnant and anal about fumes)</li>
            <li> Great also for adding volume without having to back comb so much.</li>
            <li> Right now yes, because I haven&#x27;t found anything good enough to replace it.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, the white powder is easily brushed out, and it does not go greasy midday like the Tresemme Fresh Start does.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, if you put too much it, it comes out easily with a bit of water.</li>
            <li> I was given this product by my mom, who always knows I&#x27;m on the look out for a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell sticks, by the way, but isn&#x27;t so strong those around you can smell it unless they&#x27;re really close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the first one lasted a good 3 months using it about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still on the look out for a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I was thoroughly amazed!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, you don&#x27;t even need to use much for you hair to look as if you&#x27;d washed it that very day, my hair tends to get super greasy super fast so discovering this product was like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Residue?</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the product itself - after trying every single dry shampoo on the market, I still haven&#x27;t found a good replacement!</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my fine, grease-prone hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight shoulder length fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty sweet.  </li>
            <li> After just one more night in the cabinet, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Also it makes my hair smell really fresh.  </li>
            <li> and it looks freshly washed.</li>
            <li> My favorite thus far is found in Got 2</li>
            <li> but mine have all lasted to where I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Baby powder works exactly the same and at a fraction of the cost... and lasts more than one use!  </li>
            <li> Stylist told me not to use too much other wise</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using the got2be brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure TIGI has fixed that issue now, but the product itself didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> With this product I can go 3 days and it looks and smells clean the whole time.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;ve always had the lid on the bottle inbetween uses and have been able to get a lot of dry shampoos out of the product.  </li>
            <li> but after you get the right amount down hair looks good.</li>
            <li> Since I loved the product SO much, I bought another can, and much to my dismay, the same thing</li>
            <li> Not only is it a huge time saver for those of us with kids, jobs, workouts, and ball games, but it allows time for your \\&quot;natural oils\\&quot; to build up, which is EXTREMELY healthy for your hair, without looking or feeling like you don&#x27;t have clean hair.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it because I love dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I have light blonde fine hair and have used several dry shampoo products, this is by far the best for coverage and body.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much for it to work .</li>
            <li> Rockaholic is definitely the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot so far).  </li>
            <li> I had to be VERY careful with the Rockaholic brand to make sure the nozzle didn&#x27;t stick and continue to spray lightly after each use.</li>
            <li> The Bed Head product is good, you can use a lot or a little</li>
            <li> If that is the problem you&#x27;re experiencing, then I highly recommend you pay the full salon price.</li>
            <li> , they had a huge batch go out like that, but they have fixed the problem and it shouldnt happen</li>
            <li> That said, I love this product, and I&#x27;m now ordering my second can from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the first bottle at it leaked.  </li>
            <li> the first use.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertized-</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this products for brunettes because it is a white powder and even when combed in it lightens your roots which is great if your blonde not so much if your not.</li>
            <li> I love to use this stuff when I straighten my hair and don&#x27;t want to wash it the next day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and the bottle feels/</li>
            <li> The gas somehow releases after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased, just shake it well, and spray until you can see the white substance come out.</li>
            <li> first time I used the product I was told at point of purchase not to allow the bottle to tip</li>
            <li> The first bottle I had of this product-</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how there are so many reviews saying this only lasts for three or so uses.</li>
            <li> I have had a bottle of this for over two months, and I use it regularly, and have used it way more than three times.</li>
            <li> it immediately and returns it to soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many others and they either do not work, leave white stuff, or make your hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to accept.  </li>
            <li> I use this at least once a week, and when I do use it I always get compliments on how great I smell.</li>
            <li> I just laugh and say &#x27;thanks&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I want to extend my style an extra day, since I can&#x27;t go more than a day without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have even been able to occasionally stretch my shampooing to every third day with this brand and have been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought I just got a dud, but after reading the reviews it seems like this is a consistent problem.  </li>
            <li> When I used it, it worked pretty well</li>
            <li> Well, sure enough, I used it once</li>
            <li> and you can literally hear the air coming out, haha!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it daily, more like 5 times per month.</li>
            <li> Seeing as the price has come down, I decided to give it a shot, and am very glad I did!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and this is by far the most superior of all I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos and this is the very best one.  </li>
            <li> but at least it&#x27;s good for quick morning ponytails that do not look greasy</li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested dry shampoo to add body to my baby fine hair even when it is clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others (cheap &amp; expensive) and was never as happy with them as I am with this one.</li>
            <li> TIGI is aware that a large percentage of the canisters and spray tops are malfunctioning and leaking product.</li>
            <li> With all that positive feedback expressed, I cannot endorse this product.</li>
            <li> So happy with this dry shampoo, can&#x27;t believe how long I suffered without it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The most deciding factor in this dry shampoo:  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so you were getting more uses out of a can, this would be my go to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is fabulous while it lasts!</li>
            <li> My wife is very particular with her hair.</li>
            <li> because it is easy - with issues like this, I might as well just go to a local store and pick it up.  </li>
            <li> It just makes the top layer of hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I love TIGI products and am rarely ever let down.</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased it only lasted a few sprays like some of the others here have experienced</li>
            <li> The Suave brand is $2.77 and lasts forever, but is far less superior than TIGI.</li>
            <li> I have natural blonde hair that is very fine and prone to being VERY oily.</li>
            <li> This amazing product allows me to refresh my hairstyle and avoid daily hair washing, which ultimately leads to healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I use it very liberally and probably get about 60-100 sprays from each can.  </li>
            <li> (you have to work it in really well</li>
            <li> I really wish they would fix the issues with the can.</li>
            <li> Brushing helps this as well- and learning not to use too much of the spray.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really greasy around my forehead, and since I have bangs</li>
            <li> How much are you applying with each use?</li>
            <li> ] dollars on a product that may or may not work, regardless of how much of a rockstar I look like after using it.</li>
            <li> will buy from again very soon</li>
            <li> and I dont really notice any odor after 5-10minutes.</li>
            <li> it looks as if you are going gray (very powdery).</li>
            <li> It works very well to soak up excess oil and add volume.</li>
            <li> Read some reviews that said you need to shake the can really well before applying and while applying</li>
            <li> If you use to much you will see flakes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T buy it unless you have a reason why you&#x27;ll use the whole can in a day or two.</li>
            <li> This product work really well</li>
            <li> I use it immediately before styling, and often it lasts 2 days, just a light spritz the second day.</li>
            <li> I hear a lot about product running out too fast</li>
            <li> That friend has recently switched to the Suave brand and liked it equally as well.   </li>
            <li> I mean it smells good</li>
            <li> , I will use Blow&#x27;s dry hair powder, or another brand (or even baby powder), as it is becoming an easier to find product.</li>
            <li> I have really oily roots and had to wash my hair each day, which is fine until it&#x27;s long.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to find it on Amazon for only 10 bucks!    </li>
            <li> I use it more before I&#x27;m due to get my highlights done</li>
            <li> however i wasnt able to use it since then due to the spray can not working.</li>
            <li> Like many other customers, I found that the can didn&#x27;t put out any product when I received it.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is naturally wavy, it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly straight past Monday, however, it stays relatively straight, clean, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> , you get it and its full and heavy and in a couple of days its light and its all gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually funny seeing people sniffing around trying to find the source of the smell, and ,when they finally figure out it&#x27;s my hair, I&#x27;m always told how I smell like fresh citrus.</li>
            <li> It must just depend how much you use, whether you cover your entire head or just the areas where your hair gets greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> Tried many dry shampoos... by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts long and rubs in smooth.</li>
            <li> and I can do a full up do or curl it back out.  </li>
            <li> So basically I bought a full 6.3 oz bottle and only used 1/50th of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have to start work pretty early in the morning - I have to leave my house by 5:30</li>
            <li> Anyone with fine, thin hair would love this.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I tried, and I since using this I have also tried Tresemme&#x27;s and Big Sexy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel like new!</li>
            <li> When it comes out of the aerosol can, it does leave a fine white powder on your hair, but if you follow the instructions and massage it in slightly, wait a few minutes and brush the excess out, it looks great.</li>
            <li> I had been using cheap drugstore brand dry shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I never believed it was any better than any of the others that were $5 or less.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s color less or undetectable anyway AND touching my hair</li>
            <li> The customer rep told me to use the second bottle and if it did the same thing, call them again and they would send out more replacements.  </li>
            <li> So I bought another bottle, and sure enough, it lasted MONTHS with regular use.</li>
            <li> but they have been resolved (the quantity issue came up with older reviews, from what I remember).  </li>
            <li> I can usually get 2 more days out of my hair before washing thanks to this!</li>
            <li> The others only seem to make my hair smell better, but with the same greasy look.  </li>
            <li> So I used it the next day and the sad thing is, the product itself is awesome</li>
            <li> and you want to calm it down a bit without doing a full scrub?  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the product, but caution as to who you buy it from.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had this experience with my second bottle, which luckily my hairdresser replaced free of charge after I found it empty the day after purchasing it.    </li>
            <li> Same thing as the first bottle!  </li>
            <li> I have really long fine blond hair that gets greasy pretty quick, but I can go for a few days without washing my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> This is normal.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look fresh without leaving the white that the baby powder does (that&#x27;s what I used to do)</li>
            <li> and it looks normal after that.  </li>
            <li> The last two bottles i bought did not spray white, I was able to spray directly into my hair.</li>
            <li> but normally this \\&quot;crap\\&quot; is $20</li>
            <li> to be able not to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I twist it a little left and right and place it by my ear to make sure I don&#x27;t hear anything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely helpful in getting myself ready when i dont have time to wash my hair, it really helps my hair look less greasy, love it!</li>
            <li> My roommate used it and she has very dark brown, almost black hair, and it worked great on hers too.     </li>
            <li> I have used many brands of dry shampoo and use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> I have kind of oily hair, so I can&#x27;t really keep my hair down on days I don&#x27;t wash it, dry shampoo or not.  </li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t suggest letting it get near the tips of your hair, either, because it&#x27;s basically pure alcohol, and can, in so many words, &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> You must place the can in a cool, dry place that doesn&#x27;t have any moisture, as when you take a shower the moisture in the air will cause it to evaporate.  </li>
            <li> I am a true believer in dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I popped into the store and figured \\&quot;I like other TIGI products so this will be just as reliable and the price is based on the fantastic quality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Nice for days after work when I need a little help because time is short.</li>
            <li> Why would I ever spend $20 on a new bottle of this product and go through this again.  </li>
            <li> Good - I typically wash my hair every other day to avoid drying it out.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m sure the product was actually shipped empty.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and hated always having to wash every day, it really does work great.</li>
            <li> If I use too much the white powder will show up a little, but I think I&#x27;ve gotten better at applying it and avoid that problem.  </li>
            <li> I used the first of my two replacement bottles and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> erasing the greasy spots like magic and giving lifeless 2nd or 3rd day hair that extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; of body and freshness.    </li>
            <li> and the exact same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> and I tousled my hair to work the product in, but it looked EXACTLY the same and my hair stayed oily until I took a shower.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Product, I use it all the time when not able to  shampoo hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> No white residue and no weird odor.</li>
            <li> So I called up Ulta today and the girl I talked to said she bought 2 bottles last year and just finished up her first bottle no problem</li>
            <li> but you only get two uses out of it, its pretty wierd to get a can</li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago, the first bottle I bought, for ~$20, I only got about 5 uses and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I have been able to take a shower, add a little argon oil, let my hair air dry, and go about my day without feeling like I looked like a psuedo troll doll.  </li>
            <li> the bottle which seems to be be why everyone hates this product: All you people need to do is check your nozzle every time you use it, take it to your ear and hear if there&#x27;s any hissing sound, if there is just play around with the nozzle moving it from side to side, moving the bottle upside down or spray a bit and then check again, it should stop.</li>
            <li> they tell they difference between the old and new bottles?\\</li>
            <li> If they are sending it to me as a replacement because they can&#x27;t tell the difference between the old and new bottles, then they are still sending it to stores to sell.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve tried many) that actually works to make your hair less oily and fuller.  </li>
            <li> I have used this products for many months but typically purchase from my local salon.</li>
            <li> This prevents my hair from being weighed down or greasy feeling, and has a pleasant, but not overwhelming, smell.</li>
            <li> I just pin up my bangs and spray a bit underneath my hair, close to my roots, wait a few seconds, and then comb it out with a fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these reviewers attempted to apply the dry shampoo to their entire head and went through it much more quickly than they needed to, or, if there is a problem with the product leaking out when the lid isn&#x27;t on.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many other drug store dry shampoos but this one was recommended by my hair stylist, who stated, &amp;</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve read several reviews for other products, and it&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> Clearly a majority of this product  was used.</li>
            <li> and they promised that the bottles had been fixed</li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I payed $20 for this, and its a complete scam that it lasted two uses.     </li>
            <li> I recieved my product fast - but I only used it twice</li>
            <li> Let me assure you that it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my 7 year old son&#x27;s hair (who didn&#x27;t take his shower like he was supposed to one night and didn&#x27;t have time before school to do so).  </li>
            <li> I looked for this product everywhere, and this one was by far the cheapest place to get it.</li>
            <li> When the can gets low it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out very well.  </li>
            <li> I think they fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> I saw comments about the bottle being faulty, but I also saw that problem was fixed...</li>
            <li> Mine has lasted a couple months now because I don&#x27;t use it too frequently.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this seller is selling old bottles.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product based on my experience, and I hope people give it another try bought professionally.</li>
            <li> I have used mine at least 8 times and I can still feel that the can is pretty full.</li>
            <li> but I have found that if  I keep it in my bathroom under the sink where it is dark and cool it does not.</li>
            <li> I know that there are a lot of people who said they wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because they were only able to get a few uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair but ALOT of it and have had trouble in the past with it feeling greasy if I went more than a day washing my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used dry shampoo; got the idea from my niece.</li>
            <li> It does takes some practice using at first if you&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before-</li>
            <li> Also, the can always comes half full.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why so many people have complained about the product not lasting more than 3 or 4 uses.  </li>
            <li> I have SUPER dry hair, so shampooing every day is a big &#x27;no no&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I originally passed it up at the beauty salon because of it but the only other alternative turned my hair into a clay pot.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark so this is extra important to me.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I was mistaken, but after I purchased this a second time from another seller, it had the SAME result:  </li>
            <li> This particular can is spraying white, so i have to spray it on my hand and rub into my hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought from different vendors and found most to be quality; however this last product arrived partially damaged (not related to packaging) - nothing that impacted the performance of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine shoulder-length hair which tends to look very limp unless I shampoo every day.</li>
            <li> All of the dry shampoos take away the  natural shine as they are absorbing oil and</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s usually a \\&quot;fissing\\&quot; sound).  </li>
            <li> and it would last like a normal aerosol</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works to a certain extent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store, and when I did, the sales person warned me that you CANNOT tilt this can or lay it down on its side while storing it or all of the product will evaporate out -- which, I would assume, would be the reason that so many are unsatisfied by how long it lasts.      </li>
            <li> it did not make my hair look clean as expected, it looks frizzy and overly dry</li>
            <li> I have not ran into the issue of packaging, I shake the can really well before and after each use, I have found shaking AFTER each use has helped with a lot of the dry shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li> They offered me a \\&quot;one time\\&quot; free replacement, so I accepted and it showed up on my doorstep a few days later.  </li>
            <li> sounds like it&#x27;ll last at least a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t spray enough your hair will obviously not look like it has been shampooed, but if you spray too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used it at least 15 times and there&#x27;s still more left.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Dry shampoo that I have tried and I would definitely recommend purchasing this!</li>
            <li> You just spray it from mid strand down and it leaves your hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair, but my actual strand width is not very thick.</li>
            <li> I see other reviewers posted the same complaint over 6 months ago, but it is clear it has not been effectively addressed.</li>
            <li> I really like how this dry shampoo really soaks up the oils from your scalp for people that wash their hair every other day.</li>
            <li> but overall was a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> no get discouraged by the negative reviews, it&#x27;s a fantastic product with a somewhat defective package that can be dealt with.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally use too much it can leave a strange white residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> So they corrected the bottles, but they did not recall the old product, nor did they mark them differently so that they could identify the corrected bottles from the faulty ones.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this company is content to keep a defective product instead of recalling it.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;ve been using Rockaholic 2 to 3 times a week since I initially bought it in early October</li>
            <li> This was the third time I went to use it, and it was completely gone.     </li>
            <li> Especially considering I buy this product quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I was surprised to see such low ratings.  </li>
            <li> Also, kind of a silly thing, but</li>
            <li> this one is kind of weird.</li>
            <li> As I said, I have been using this product approximately 5 days a week for more than a month</li>
            <li> I am down to the end of my first can and did not have any problems that others have reported.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using Tigi Dry Shampoo for awhile and highly recommends it to clients.  </li>
            <li> and since I only use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my hair, It&#x27;s lasted me a significant amount of time</li>
            <li> as that sounds, I like my stuff in a nicer package and am willing to pay an extra buck or two, so long as I&#x27;m getting similar total usage.</li>
            <li> Super easy - just pop it off after each use and pop it back on when you want to use it again and this stuff should last 3 months if you don&#x27;t go crazy and use it all over your head every time you use it.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even use what was left because the spray top was broken</li>
            <li> Having your hair sprayed and look grey was a bit alarming at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a slight spray that you have to put the bottle right up next to your ear to hear it.</li>
            <li> Despite what a previous user said - I did keep this product in my bedroom - in a cool, dry place and both bottles - I only got 2 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> I find it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot with my naturally dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never expected such a thing from an Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I am a faux red-head, so the first few weeks after dyeing my hair</li>
            <li> It just had some serious scratches - I expected better.  </li>
            <li> So keep the can in your bedroom instead, and disregard the other negative reviews that say \\&quot;I love the product but only got 1 or 2 uses out of it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was extremely busy with college, and I had to use this dry shampoo two days in a row with no shower-shampoo..  </li>
            <li> I used to use baby powder and that is so messy and being able to spray this stuff on is so much easier and so much less messy!</li>
            <li> I would love it if TIGI could just fix the product packaging so that people like me would actually get our money&#x27;s worth of product :(</li>
            <li> So I called the company to complain and they apologized saying that there was a problem that had been fixed and mailed me a new bottle within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how your biggest focus when using dry shampoo should be your roots, and you should always use a natural brush to brush it through your hair to get rid of that powdery look</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair, it has to be washed daily, if not, by a day and a half</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I chose  the Rockaholic, hoping it might be half as good...</li>
            <li> No visible one, it only feels a little bit like hairspray residue if  you scrunch it, but not something anyone will notice, my boyfriend who loves playing with my hair certainly hasn&#x27;t noticed anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured there had been a leak or something but didn&#x27;t take it back because I was so busy and didn&#x27;t keep the receipt (not thinking I would need to keep a receipt for dry shampoo)!</li>
            <li> It works well when it does spray but HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Some dry shampoos have a bad odor, but this one is very nice.</li>
            <li> : If you get too much in one area, it can turn the hair a little white.</li>
            <li> For those who have complained that it doesn&#x27;t last a long time, this stuff actually lasts much longer than most, you just have to pop the sprayer off after each use so that you don&#x27;t waste the gas (just like any other aerosol spray).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t get the SuperCut special and therefore has relatively long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I always try to rate a product from both sides so here is the good and the bad about this product.</li>
            <li> On an average summer day I have about 6 hours before my bangs start to separate and look greasy, this dry shampoo has worked very well.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for people like me who need to wash their hair everyday if they are planning on wearing it down because of the areas that become greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, they were on sell at Ulta for half the price of normal bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a life saver for me so far because I can only wash my hair every other day and</li>
            <li> However, after three times of use, I woke up in the morning to find my new bottle EMPTY!!</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with my cans leaking and seriously recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> So, a quick spray with this along any slightly greasy or limp hair will re-establish lift and volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> which I wasn&#x27;t extremely surprised because other reviews I read before had warned about that)</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy, very easily oiled hair, and not one single brand of dry shampoo worked until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> I did run into the same problem as other reviewers, however- my first can ran out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> but.... its pretty expensive for how fast it runs out...</li>
            <li> I have been told by a co-worker NEVER TO LEAVE THIS IN YOUR BATHROOM as it will evaporate, she used this product and another brand and said ALL DRY SHAMPOOS EVAPORATE if left in the bathroom (of the multiple brands she has tried).  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this dry shampoo and definitely wish I hadn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I use this dry shampoo occasionally, to get one or two extra days before having to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found less expensive items that also do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> I later discussed this strange event with a hair stylist at the tanning salon where I work, she said that this product is notorious for doing this, it cannot be stored on its side or it all leaks out.</li>
            <li> Now, this is not to say this product is comparable to how long a hairspray might last</li>
            <li> /&gt;However,  I just went back to use it a second time, about 4 days later, and it is EMPTY!  </li>
            <li> actually it feels complexity dry.  </li>
            <li> I know no one else is using it, but the product always seems to dry up or something after only 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and this one is my favourite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because this is the only dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I use hair spay on my bangs and after using hairspray and then dry shampoo again the next morning, it doesn&#x27;t brush out as well and looks kinda white and has some dry shampoo flakes/powder that I can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> Allows me to get an extra day out of my blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different dry shampoos and this one works</li>
            <li> Perhaps, it is the seller -- there are so many fake, knock-off products out there that we all have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Went back to use it a week later and the bottle felt empty</li>
            <li> I have sampled a few different brands and by far this is my fav.  </li>
            <li> and then if you hate it and have a good hairdresser they will take it back for a refund for you.</li>
            <li> Dirty secret is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> Too bad because it really was a fantastic dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also, like with all dry shampoos, it makes hair feel coarse and dry</li>
            <li> I have come to consider myself a dry shampoo expert over the years, I have tried probably 50 different brands of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I only bought it because I left my other stuff at home \\&quot;Ojon Hair: rub-out dry cleanser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have red hair, so a lot of other dry shampoos leave a really obvious powdery residue when you use them.</li>
            <li> no matter how long I shake</li>
            <li> all the time (mine is fairly long).</li>
            <li> The next time I went to use it, the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was empty, even though I had only used it two times.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> and when I went back to it - it was empty.  </li>
            <li> I thought something was strange</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to see if the can would become empty.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thick brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with dry shampoos running out fast b/c of leaking or not really absorbing the oils in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the less expensive, drug store counterparts.  </li>
            <li> If I take a shower Monday morning, I style may hair as normal (heat protectant, argon oil, and a straightner), and then apply a SMALL amount of the dry shampoo to my roots and hairline (around my face) every morning and every night Tuesday through Thursday.  </li>
            <li> I bought it at sephora one day because I had no idea that there was such a wide selection of dry shampoos on the market.     </li>
            <li> Um, really annoyed with this seller right now.  </li>
            <li> Same as the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used other products that were similar.  </li>
            <li> As with the other reviews I only got one use out of the Rockaholic Dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is my go-to dry shampoo, and I have tried over 20 brands.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this after my hair stylist recommended I try dry shampoo for my greasy hair in between washes.  </li>
            <li> I am so shocked to read that so many people have had the same problem with this product as me</li>
            <li> I have tried Suave, and both types of Tresemee dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wanted a dry shampoo to get rid of my oily roots</li>
            <li> If you just want to buy it online google reviews of the Ojon dry cleanser.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been searching for years for either a shampoo that will normalize the oil in my hair, or for a dry shampoo that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried Tre Semme dry shampoo</li>
            <li> The dry conditioner de-poofs</li>
            <li> Ive tried tons of dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I had never tried dry shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> I use it as dry shampoo, and also as a root lifter, when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo for myself after having a conversation with my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Dry oiliness of hair ...</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo after watching a review by Elle Fowler on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> so if you have a darker hair apply in small amounts (a few inches away) at first and work in it some until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I use the product and have not found the uses to be limited or any problems with the cans at all.  </li>
            <li> In fact, mine has traveled with me on planes and in cars through drastic changes in elevation and I have never had a single problem.  </li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the low down on dry shampoos-</li>
            <li> Also, I am blonde, so it works for me, but if you have dark hair, it will show up with a whitish color.    </li>
            <li> Occasionally, if I&#x27;m really needing to lay the product on thick due to being way overdue for washing my hair I will need to hold my breath and then run out of the room to breath in between sprays.</li>
            <li> I had to turn my head upside down and brush the heck out of my hair from root to end to distribute the white powdery substance.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that the product does evaporate</li>
            <li> only down fall was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; available because I know it&#x27;s very hard on your hair to wash it and subject it to all the heated styling products every day, and this product ROCKS!!</li>
            <li> Other dry shampoos failed at making my hair feel/look really clean</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tends to be very dry on the ends, but I get oily at the scalp.  </li>
            <li> all summer long due to the humidity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the dry shampoo several times, and they are still heavy with product.  </li>
            <li> The poofing is even worse now that I put my hair through quite a bit of trauma trying to remove some hair colour, so now it&#x27;s dry all over while still being very oily at the roots.  </li>
            <li> The reason I give this product two stars is because when I tried to travel with it, I left with over half a bottle, and when I returned it was empty.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried either leave a white residue (making my dark brown hair look gray) or just don&#x27;t remove the oil.  </li>
            <li> Just a little is all you need, otherwise it will make your hair very sticky and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> I have used Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo for over a year now, and I can assure you that I have gotten far more than 3</li>
            <li> Helps absorb the extra oil between washes and even gives a little body to my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a tiny little bottle</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve used less shampoo (which dries hair) and less heat from straightening over the past month, my hair has become much, much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel or look greasy compared to other dry shampoos I have used.  </li>
            <li> To save my hair color and time in the mornings I&#x27;ve been using a dry shampoo every other day for over a year.</li>
            <li> I can go three days in between shampoos, which used to be unheard of for me, even with other brands of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> A few months later I went to a beauty store and asked if they had other brands of dry shampoo-</li>
            <li> Now it looks great but just feels awful.  </li>
            <li> They were sending me an extra bottle for my trouble, I guessed.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t spray, and was literally empty.  </li>
            <li> When I told her about the empty can problem, she said, \\&quot;yeah</li>
            <li> I take showers inbetween but wear a shower cap so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet or curly from the humidity.  </li>
            <li> Before I used this product, my hair was always very coarse and frizzy after I took a shower and blow dried it.  </li>
            <li> When I contacted TIGI aout the defective cans they \\&quot;replaced\\&quot; the product (after I had to pay shipping on the empty bottle) with shampoo for color treated hair....</li>
            <li> the can was empty.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with wet hair</li>
            <li> or it could empty out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the bottle - I bought two of the Breast Cancer Awareness pink bottles on 10/08/10, and today is 10/17/10...  </li>
            <li> Seems like these pink bottles aren&#x27;t defective.  </li>
            <li> and when I went to use it again it was totally empty.</li>
            <li> When I went to use it again today it was almost empty</li>
            <li> and it was empty.</li>
            <li> im pissed I spent the money</li>
            <li> I only seem to get a few uses out of this product before the pressure is gone and it no longer sprays.</li>
            <li> and it is empty.</li>
            <li> I have tested 4 cans and all are empty after 1 or 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> It is everything I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4/5 stars because I&#x27;m not real fond of the scent when it&#x27;s sprayed out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this and has not had the issues with it arriving empty as others have, but it appears that its hit or miss.  </li>
            <li> She told me that she (a professional hairdresser) and some of her coworkers had a few bottles wasted because of this issue.</li>
            <li> FYI - I&#x27;ve used plenty of other dry shampoos and NEVER evaporated!  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair that poofs up to ridiculous bird&#x27;s nest levels</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel super dirty.</li>
            <li> so that all the white is gone) it doesn&#x27;t leave a gunky or stiff feeling in your hair like all the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair white-ish like other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Writing my first review because I am prompted by my enormous disappointment.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a slight white powder looking residue on your hair immediately after spraying it on, but just ruffle it around a little and the powder will spread out and soak in.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair which makes for a project to wash/dry/straighten on a a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> The only negative it that it does leave hair and scalp feeling a bit dry and sometimes itchy.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, barely works and leaves huge amounts of stains which you can barely get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe they have listened to the other reviews and improved the product?  </li>
            <li> It was nearly empty!</li>
            <li> and the can was nearly empty!  </li>
            <li> , I used it twice at home to test it out and then after labor, c-section, etc trying to get cleaned up for visitors, went to use this and NOTHING - empty!</li>
            <li> Also if you use alot of other product in your hair (like me) it can all sort of clump together with the powder by the end of the day and give a flaky look.</li>
            <li> the can was suddenly empty!</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I used it every other day</li>
            <li> So in all, it lasted about a month with me using it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Based on those bottles you can go to other salons and compare.</li>
            <li> No high hopes on getting a response, but we&#x27;ll see what happens!!</li>
            <li> I feel extremely cheated.</li>
            <li> like other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on this product, I will not be buying another can of this.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> - my hair always felt like it was oily after using other inferior products.  </li>
            <li> i saw other reviews saying they dont think this works, something about packaging?</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it every other day and you cannot tell&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it once every other day since I wash my hair once every other day.</li>
            <li> so I used the other bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because the product worked wonderful, but not worth the money to only get 3 uses out of it :(</li>
            <li> girlfriend is a dry-shampoo aficionado (if there ever was one), and although she resorts to the remainder of my bottle when she&#x27;s in town and times get desperate, she much prefers the el-cheapo Suave counterpart, especially when it comes to the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously purchased when it was in the pink</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and it did leave my hair a little grey looking, but after rubbing it in, it was hardly noticeable and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t washed, but TIGI&#x27;s Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo is so much better.</li>
            <li> It leaves a white film on your hair thats hard to get off as well.</li>
            <li> At $19 a bottle, this was definitely NOT worth the money.  </li>
            <li> which is not worth the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> My only negative is it builds up on your scalp at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would feel good about it as I was leaving the door but by the end of the day it would be disgusting again.     </li>
            <li> and I was forced to try something different.</li>
            <li> I use it probably twice a week to cut down on the number of times I have to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either</li>
            <li> Compared to other products I have used that either leave a residue or make it look like I have dandruff I will deal with a little evaporation.</li>
            <li> I have extremely greasy hair that needs to be washed everyday.</li>
            <li> I only used a very small amount because I was just testing it</li>
            <li> I would use VERY little, only small sprays at my roots.  </li>
            <li> and my bottle is even slightly dented on the bottom.</li>
            <li> After a year of still looking for an equal to this product I purchased one yet again hoping just maybe I had received a 2nd bad bottle last time.</li>
            <li> Just a few downsides (not worth taking a star away for, though)</li>
            <li> you get this filmy mess.</li>
            <li> Then I found Rockaholic Dry Secret Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Just a little spray and</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of shine out of your hair.</li>
            <li> The scent does go away after a little while though.</li>
            <li> So start with a little and build up.</li>
            <li> It also has a very slight hair spray like property where it will make your hair slightly rigid for easier styling.  </li>
            <li> AGAIN it came up empty!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s empty!!!  </li>
            <li> the bottle was EMPTY!!!</li>
            <li> This product loses pressure after a few uses and was rendered unusable after a few weeks of very limited use...</li>
            <li> I was very sad when this happened, but I guess the hunt is on for a new dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this has such bad reviews from people and the problems they are having I have not had.  </li>
            <li> Just a few shots of this</li>
            <li> One to two uses before the can was dead.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in for a few minutes and then comb my hair.  </li>
            <li> Until TIGI fixes the faulty packaging, no one should waste their money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> hair is often limp at the roots.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily hair, but wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo and it gives me a lot of volume and texture to what would otherwise have been limp, oily hair.</li>
            <li> I like not having to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> it - wait for a few seconds and comb/style.</li>
            <li> for those of you that feel you need to wash your hair everyday but don&#x27;t want your ends to suffer-</li>
            <li> Works well when you want to keep a look for a few hours longer.  </li>
            <li> I did not fly anywhere, it was a simple hour drive.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken but taped back together, and, as the seller explained, if the bottle had emptied in transit there would&#x27;ve been powdery shampoo in the packaging.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> She also said it would help me to maintain the color if I wasn&#x27;t washing everyday.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to save a few bucks</li>
            <li> The can I bought lasted me a few months, using it 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy person and hate how long it takes to dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bad - as other reviews have reported the product does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Typically, you can not go wrong with TIGI products and this is no different.  </li>
            <li> :/ Still a few kinks to work out of the design</li>
            <li> I have very long and very, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried other dry shampoos they all were so powdery or just felt weird.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and rejoiced after learning that it&#x27;s healthier to wash your hair less, meaning way less time under the blow dryer.    </li>
            <li> I know dry shampoo always gets a bad rap because people tend to use too much some times, and they get that sort of dusty look.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy this product again, and what a waste of raw materials for this company and the environment!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not healthy for your hair,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I couldnt wait to use it again until when I went to use it, it was completely dried up!</li>
            <li> so I usually don&#x27;t get it, I just go through it too often.  </li>
            <li> weird, strong, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one day, half the product seemed to vanish out of thin air for no reason, and 2 weeks later, the rest disappeared too.  </li>
            <li> Just a few wet drops plopped sadly out</li>
            <li> I ordered the Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo, but they sent me a different product altogether.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definitely not a problem when using the TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> That is exactly what I&#x27;ve tried to do, and the product does not seem to remove or dry up any oil from my hair, leaves a nasty film on my hair, and four hours after applying the product my hair looks greasier than it was to begin with.</li>
            <li> After trying out 5 or 6 other dry shampoos that either didn&#x27;t work, left my hair feeling and looking disgusting or were so heavily scented that I choked and got nauseous every time I used them, I ran across this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about it (and dry shampoo&#x27;s in general) is the dirty feeling that comes along with using it.  </li>
            <li> it looks a bit drab and dull, but I have noticed that with all of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Amazon marketplace sellers for years and hardly had a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was SHOCKED to see so many bad reviews complaining of 1-3 uses per can.</li>
            <li> Seems like it is a common complaint.  </li>
            <li> Any negative review regarding this problem should be discarded.</li>
            <li> I think there was a slow leak overnight.</li>
            <li> The product has a slow leak and when you aren&#x27;t using it continues to drain out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> You mean they corrected the bottles, but they didn&#x27;t get rid of the defective products???\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Just because I can&#x27;t smell anything, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not there.</li>
            <li> That claim is ridiculous - probably an issue with the aerosole type can.</li>
            <li> I have tried less expensive versions and been unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> and this is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was confused, to say the least.</li>
            <li> Are they incompetent</li>
            <li> Lousy waste of $20</li>
            <li> I was totally unable to use it and wasted $20 for one use.</li>
            <li> B0041T7A4U TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Conditioner Unisex, 8 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> after one use there was nothing left in the bottle! :(</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this product to anyone and am disappointed in the company for wasting these large aerosol cans on such a pathetic amount of product.</li>
            <li> I sometimes spray a little of this even if my hair isn&#x27;t dirty just to get that volume bump in my pony tails.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty residue as other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off.</li>
            <li> feel even worse...  </li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> the cap was broken when i got it</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I just finished another can of TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret and it lasted for probably at least 18 or so uses.  </li>
            <li> but i had a hard time finding it until i found it on amazon!!</li>
            <li> They got a bad rap awhile back when they had a bad batch</li>
            <li> and I thought I grabbed the wrong can.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, not a happy mummy!</li>
            <li> I thought something happened where I got a defective can, or there was something wrong and it sprayed overnight because it got stuck or something.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it also stopped working the fastest because the nozzle got clogged (</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling coarse and nasty!  </li>
            <li> This was disappointing, of course; my wife wanted to wash her hair using it.</li>
            <li> when you use this, your hair feels really really dirty.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was disappointed and havent re-ordered yet because I&#x27;m now feeling a bit cautious about getting something like this online</li>
            <li> That makes it waaaaay to expensive of a product if it just keeps evaporating!    </li>
            <li> Sad day!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like either, and I thought they were overpriced for being so awful and not a good brand.</li>
            <li> The gal that sold it to me said there had been an issue at the manufacturer and the bad bottles were gone</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad; it smells sort of like grapefruits...  </li>
            <li> In a pinch it will work and for the money it isn&#x27;t bad to keep on hand.   </li>
            <li> but I must have gotten a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> actually shocked to come to this conclusion.</li>
            <li> and you will surely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was really disappointed with that</li>
            <li> How incredibly frustrating!!!  </li>
            <li> I like to leave my products out, so as vain and stupid</li>
            <li> Felt like an idiot and returned the bottle never to purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> WTF?!?!?!?</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated with this product!!!  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> The oder is horrible though.</li>
            <li> I hate washing out all that color!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> it is disgusting.</li>
            <li> This product is the worst rip off I have ever encountered.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This really does get me through one more day without washing my hair. Sometimes you get in a hurry and this is a life saver!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have really oily roots and had to wash my hair each day, which is fine until it&#x27;s long.  Just a few shots of this and I can do a full up do or curl it back out.  Great stuff.  As a rule doesn&#x27;t shoot out white but if it does just use your nails and rub it in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty sweet.  Got some greasy ass hair and you want to calm it down a bit without doing a full scrub?  This is the stuff for you.  You&#x27;ll get a slight white powder looking residue on your hair immediately after spraying it on, but just ruffle it around a little and the powder will spread out and soak in.  It also has a very slight hair spray like property where it will make your hair slightly rigid for easier styling.  It is not sticky, the opposite actually it feels complexity dry.  I did notice though some of the chemicals caused my scalp to itch a bit to don&#x27;t over use.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I really like how this dry shampoo really soaks up the oils from your scalp for people that wash their hair every other day. However I do not like the sent of this product. Since I am all about having my hair smell good. I will try another product next time.</li>
            <li> I have been told by a co-worker NEVER TO LEAVE THIS IN YOUR BATHROOM as it will evaporate, she used this product and another brand and said ALL DRY SHAMPOOS EVAPORATE if left in the bathroom (of the multiple brands she has tried).  You must place the can in a cool, dry place that doesn&#x27;t have any moisture, as when you take a shower the moisture in the air will cause it to evaporate.  So keep the can in your bedroom instead, and disregard the other negative reviews that say \\&quot;I love the product but only got 1 or 2 uses out of it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Sometimes I will wash my hair at night and my hair will be oily again the next day. Just a little spray and it looks great again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second can, and each one has lasted me for about a month.  I use it very liberally and probably get about 60-100 sprays from each can.  Maybe they have listened to the other reviews and improved the product?  I bought a can for a friend at Christmas, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store, and when I did, the sales person warned me that you CANNOT tilt this can or lay it down on its side while storing it or all of the product will evaporate out -- which, I would assume, would be the reason that so many are unsatisfied by how long it lasts.      That said, I love this product, and I&#x27;m now ordering my second can from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper.  Hopefully it&#x27;s not shipped on it&#x27;s side!      Good product, smells nice and works well.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it makes my hair feel and look clean and not oily (you have to work it in really well so that all the white is gone) it doesn&#x27;t leave a gunky or stiff feeling in your hair like all the other products I have tried. The problem is the can, it&#x27;s almost like it leaks, you get it and its full and heavy and in a couple of days its light and its all gone. And this is not a one time thing I have bought over 10 bottles and got the same result. I packed it in a bag one time so it wouldn&#x27;t leak in my suitcase, and within minutes the bag was poofed up like a balloon, case and point, it leaks. So I although I love the product is it worth replacing the can after a couple uses? Right now yes, because I haven&#x27;t found anything good enough to replace it. I really wish they would fix the issues with the can.</li>
            <li> I was given this product by my mom, who always knows I&#x27;m on the look out for a good dry shampoo. I was SO excited after I used it. I was just praying that it didn&#x27;t clog in a couple weeks, like all the others have. Well, it didn&#x27;t clog...I used it one day and placed it in my cabinet, then pulled it out 2 days later and I thought I grabbed the wrong can. It was nearly empty! After just one more night in the cabinet, it was completely gone. I was confused, to say the least. I really wanted to like this, but it is simply a waste of money. I hope they are able to fix the packaging at some point.</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated with this product!!!  It is probably the most amazing product I have ever purchased for my hair.  I would never be without it, except I can&#x27;t seem to get a bottle that isn&#x27;t defective.  I, too, purchased a bottle that was gone in 2 uses.  I called the company and they promised that the bottles had been fixed and they promptly sent me two replacement bottles.  I was surprised.  Why two bottles?  I thought that was great.  They were sending me an extra bottle for my trouble, I guessed.  I used the first of my two replacement bottles and the same thing happened.  It leaked.  I called the company and they said, \\&quot;That is why we sent you two replacement bottles.  In case one of them leaks.\\&quot;  I said, \\&quot;Wait a second!  You mean they corrected the bottles, but they didn&#x27;t get rid of the defective products???\\&quot;  Yep!  That is what they did.  So I asked the customer rep, \\&quot;Can&#x27;t they tell they difference between the old and new bottles?\\&quot;  She said no.  So they corrected the bottles, but they did not recall the old product, nor did they mark them differently so that they could identify the corrected bottles from the faulty ones.  What is going on here???  Are they incompetent are just trying to unload these faulty bottles and hope that people won&#x27;t notice?  The customer rep told me to use the second bottle and if it did the same thing, call them again and they would send out more replacements.  So I used the second replacement bottle, and no big surprise, it leaked as well.  They sent me two more replacements.  I&#x27;ve used the first bottle at it leaked.  Haven&#x27;t used the second one yet, but I know what it is going to do.  Apparently this company is content to keep a defective product instead of recalling it.  If they are sending it to me as a replacement because they can&#x27;t tell the difference between the old and new bottles, then they are still sending it to stores to sell. Why would I ever spend $20 on a new bottle of this product and go through this again.  I never know if I&#x27;m going to have the product when I need it.  I don&#x27;t know how many defective bottles they will send me until I get a corrected bottle.  If they had sent me a corrected bottle after the defective one I purchased, then I would continue to purchase this amazing product.  But I don&#x27;t trust them anymore.  I&#x27;ll be spending my money on one of their competitors next time.</li>
            <li> This does work well and smells great...the first use.  But two days later I went to use it again and the can was nearly empty!  It sprayed in spurts and clots and came out white.  I had to turn my head upside down and brush the heck out of my hair from root to end to distribute the white powdery substance.  At $19 a bottle, this was definitely NOT worth the money.  Baby powder works exactly the same and at a fraction of the cost... and lasts more than one use!  Personally, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well, and the nozzle clogged after using it twice and I could do nothing to get it unclogged. There&#x27;s a product that a lot of hospitals use that works much better, but they didn&#x27;t have it at the beauty supply shop I went to.</li>
            <li> I love this but the bottle was so light and is already finishing like if it had already been used</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of reviews saying the product lasted only a couple uses. It must just depend how much you use, whether you cover your entire head or just the areas where your hair gets greasy quickly. I have used mine at least 8 times and I can still feel that the can is pretty full. I use it just in the couple areas that get greasy on my second day hair. I love it, it lasts most of the day and makes my hair smell fresh and clean again. I definitely recommend this product for people like me who need to wash their hair everyday if they are planning on wearing it down because of the areas that become greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Tigi product. I have very thick hair, and rejoiced after learning that it&#x27;s healthier to wash your hair less, meaning way less time under the blow dryer.    I originally used baby powder on days I hadn&#x27;t washed, but TIGI&#x27;s Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo is so much better. It&#x27;s lighter, and acts as a light hair spray as well, allowing your hair to hold its style.    HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel or look greasy compared to other dry shampoos I have used.  Also gives it a boost of volume.</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy, very easily oiled hair, and not one single brand of dry shampoo worked until I tried this.  It was a gift to me while I was stuck in the hospital and I now tell every girl I meet to try this product.  I used to have to wash my hair once a day, if not twice - Nothing helped, and I couldn&#x27;t even try to go without washing it because of how greasy it looked.  Now I wash my hair once every three-four days because of this product!  The only &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; is that it does spray out white, but I&#x27;m blonde so it doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.  Helps my roots look lighter if anything.  So happy with this dry shampoo, can&#x27;t believe how long I suffered without it!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to dry shampoo, and I have tried over 20 brands. I have a ton of hair, but my actual strand width is not very thick. This prevents my hair from being weighed down or greasy feeling, and has a pleasant, but not overwhelming, smell. I always make sure I have a bottle in the house.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used to date.  Helps absorb the extra oil between washes and even gives a little body to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product numerous times. Love it. I have ordered for my daughter as well. It nice to have to touch up my hair at the end of the day when I have a meeting as I have fine hair and sometimes it looks oily by then.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s extremely helpful in getting myself ready when i dont have time to wash my hair, it really helps my hair look less greasy, love it!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this after my hair stylist recommended I try dry shampoo for my greasy hair in between washes.  So, I bought Rockaholic.  The product itself was wonderful.  It sprays on white but brushes into your hair so that you don&#x27;t see any residue.  It added texture and took away all the unwanted greasyness.  However, after three times of use, I woke up in the morning to find my new bottle EMPTY!! It wouldn&#x27;t spray, and was literally empty.  Then I got online to see if anyone else had the same issue and if so what they did.  I found people with the same problem on Amazon!  So, I emailed TIGI customer service to tell them my plight.  They offered me a \\&quot;one time\\&quot; free replacement, so I accepted and it showed up on my doorstep a few days later.  Well what do you know I used it three times and AGAIN it came up empty!!! Same thing as the first bottle!  Keep in mind each time I used the bottle I would use VERY little, only small sprays at my roots.  I will NEVER buy this product again, and what a waste of raw materials for this company and the environment!  Too bad because it really was a fantastic dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Despite what a previous user said - I did keep this product in my bedroom - in a cool, dry place and both bottles - I only got 2 uses out of it.  I agree with everyone - stay away from this product until TIGI fixes the packaging.  What they don&#x27;t realize is they have a SUPERB product - it&#x27;s amazing, smells great but why pay $20 to get 2 uses out of it?  TIGI - fix the bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And FYI - I&#x27;ve used plenty of other dry shampoos and NEVER evaporated!  That claim is ridiculous - probably an issue with the aerosole type can.</li>
            <li> Rockaholic is definitely the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot so far).  You can just spray it in your hair, unlike most where you tap a powder on your head.  Also it makes my hair smell really fresh.  I have really long fine blond hair that gets greasy pretty quick, but I can go for a few days without washing my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> Believe what these reviews say - you use this product 2 - 3 times and then is evaporates.  If you don&#x27;t mind the +/- $4 per use, then this is your product.  I bought this to use in the hospital when I had my c-section with my twins, I used it twice at home to test it out and then after labor, c-section, etc trying to get cleaned up for visitors, went to use this and NOTHING - empty! Needless to say, not a happy mummy!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I was thoroughly amazed! It works exactly as advertized- erasing the greasy spots like magic and giving lifeless 2nd or 3rd day hair that extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; of body and freshness.    I did run into the same problem as other reviewers, however- my first can ran out after only a few uses. I was so sad! I loved the product and could not afford to purchase it that often. A few months later I went to a beauty store and asked if they had other brands of dry shampoo- and the lady explained that this was the very best. When I told her about the empty can problem, she said, \\&quot;yeah, they had a huge batch go out like that, but they have fixed the problem and it shouldnt happen anymore.\\&quot;     So I bought another bottle, and sure enough, it lasted MONTHS with regular use. (About 2-3 times a week, and I have medium/short hair) I love this stuff- and I&#x27;m excited to find it on Amazon for only 10 bucks!    Just a few downsides (not worth taking a star away for, though): If you get too much in one area, it can turn the hair a little white. Takes a good amount of brushing to work it through. Also if you use alot of other product in your hair (like me) it can all sort of clump together with the powder by the end of the day and give a flaky look. Brushing helps this as well- and learning not to use too much of the spray. You get used to what works for you.</li>
            <li> Ok so here is the deal with this product. I have light blonde fine hair and have used several dry shampoo products, this is by far the best for coverage and body. I can go 3-4+ days if I wanted to and it looks freshly washed. I love it for coverage too I use it more before I&#x27;m due to get my highlights done and it looks like I just went to the salon. The only down side is that the product does evaporate but I have found that if  I keep it in my bathroom under the sink where it is dark and cool it does not. Compared to other products I have used that either leave a residue or make it look like I have dandruff I will deal with a little evaporation. I would not recommend this products for brunettes because it is a white powder and even when combed in it lightens your roots which is great if your blonde not so much if your not. The best way to use this product I found is to spray it on as you would a root pump on dry hair (dries pretty fast) and then with a fine tooth comb, blend in through the roots!! It&#x27;s magic I&#x27;m telling you. It is rather pricey so if you can get a discount by purchasing it through your hairdresser I would and then if you hate it and have a good hairdresser they will take it back for a refund for you.</li>
            <li> Same as the other reviewers.  One to two uses before the can was dead.  It worked great while it lasted but overall was a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love TIGI products and am rarely ever let down. This product is ok; it does remove some of the oily moisture but only really suitable for one day in my opinion. Also, kind of a silly thing, but normally their products smell great this one is kind of weird.</li>
            <li> IT RUNS OUT AFTER ONE USE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. PLUS IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> I am so shocked to read that so many people have had the same problem with this product as me, I thought it was an isolated incident. I too used it for 2-3 uses and then POOF the can was suddenly empty! there is definately some sort of defect with this product!</li>
            <li> I only got to use this product once! I was so excited to get it because I love dry shampoos and I heard great things about this product.. only down fall was I was sent a defective product.. I used it once just to check it out, went to use it the next day and the bottle was damp and all of the product was gone, I did not drop it and it was sitting in my closet where I had left it the day before. Needless to say I was disappointed and havent re-ordered yet because I&#x27;m now feeling a bit cautious about getting something like this online (mine did not have any type of seal on it when i received it, dont know if they are suposed to or not) Other then that the product was great.. not crazy about the smell but it did work nicely the one time I used it!</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as others here. Used about 3x, then the spray didn&#x27;t work. I could still hear some product in there when I shook it, but no way to get it out. Lousy waste of $20</li>
            <li> I have used Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo for over a year now, and I can assure you that I have gotten far more than 3 uses out of every can I have bought.  It is a great product for a quick pick up for your hair on an in-between day.  Typically, you can not go wrong with TIGI products and this is no different.  I would highly recommend the product, but caution as to who you buy it from.  I have bought from different vendors and found most to be quality; however this last product arrived partially damaged (not related to packaging) - nothing that impacted the performance of the product.  It just had some serious scratches - I expected better.  Check the reviews of the vendor before buying. That includes when Amazon is the fulfiller of the order.  Hope this was helpful. :)    Update:  I just finished another can of TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret and it lasted for probably at least 18 or so uses.  I am not sure why so many people have complained about the product not lasting more than 3 or 4 uses.  Both my daughter and I use the product and have not found the uses to be limited or any problems with the cans at all.  In fact, mine has traveled with me on planes and in cars through drastic changes in elevation and I have never had a single problem.  Perhaps, it is the seller -- there are so many fake, knock-off products out there that we all have to be careful.  It is probably wise to look at the seller review (if the product is not SOLD and shipped by Amazon) to be sure you&#x27;re buying from a quality vendor.</li>
            <li> I love to use this stuff when I straighten my hair and don&#x27;t want to wash it the next day.  It&#x27;s a great product that soaks up the oil and smells pretty good.  I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and have not had the can run out.  I do keep mine on top of the cabinet and not in a drawer.  I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for over three months and use it weekly and have no problems at all.  The best part is getting it when it goes on sale at Ulta for 7!</li>
            <li> Rockaholic is a beauty product that since I&#x27;ve been using I can honestly say I will not be able to live without!  I have very long and thick hair which makes for a project to wash/dry/straighten on a a daily basis.  My roots tend to get greesy on day 2 and once I use Rockaholic my hair looks fresh and feels and smells clean!      Make sure to shake the bottle well before use.  Also, the product tends to work better if you comb it through your hair rather than just spaying and letting it set.      I purchased this product on a whim at Ulta when it was promotionally priced in October at $6.50 for breast cancer awareness.  The only drawback of this product is the actual retail price (which I believe is $18/$19)- a bit pricey.  But since it is such a timesaver it&#x27;s easy to justify the purchase.  Plus, I&#x27;ve been using Rockaholic 2 to 3 times a week since I initially bought it in early October and I still have plenty left.      If you want to save time and prolong your color deftinately invest in a bottle of Rockaholic!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo! I wish it were cheaper though •.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair is so much more willing to &#x27;do&#x27; when I use this for a couple days instead of washing my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the product itself - after trying every single dry shampoo on the market, I still haven&#x27;t found a good replacement! It comes out perfectly foamy, yet it&#x27;s not hard to brush it into my hair.    HOWEVER - It seems as if it evaporates after only a couple uses! I know no one else is using it, but the product always seems to dry up or something after only 2 weeks... That makes it waaaaay to expensive of a product if it just keeps evaporating!    I would love it if TIGI could just fix the product packaging so that people like me would actually get our money&#x27;s worth of product :(</li>
            <li> First, I love this product.  One of my best friends runs a local salon.  She&#x27;s been using Tigi Dry Shampoo for awhile and highly recommends it to clients.  Her hair is wavy-curly and she can go 4 to 5 days without washing her hair in the shower when using this stuff.  I have very long and very, very thick hair.  I&#x27;m a busy person and hate how long it takes to dry and style my hair.  So, when she told me about this stuff, I ran to Ulta and bought three bottles (they were on sale).  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for more than a month now and I can easily go about 4 days without washing my hair in the shower.  If I take a shower Monday morning, I style may hair as normal (heat protectant, argon oil, and a straightner), and then apply a SMALL amount of the dry shampoo to my roots and hairline (around my face) every morning and every night Tuesday through Thursday.  Then, I wash my hair again on Friday and repeat the same process.  I take showers inbetween but wear a shower cap so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet or curly from the humidity.  Because my hair is naturally wavy, it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly straight past Monday, however, it stays relatively straight, clean, and healthy.  Although I was initially interested in the product because I knew that, if it worked, it&#x27;d save me a lot of time in drying and styling my hair, I have since found out that it has an even more important advantage.  Before I used this product, my hair was always very coarse and frizzy after I took a shower and blow dried it.  Because I&#x27;ve used less shampoo (which dries hair) and less heat from straightening over the past month, my hair has become much, much healthier.  For the first time in years, I have been able to take a shower, add a little argon oil, let my hair air dry, and go about my day without feeling like I looked like a psuedo troll doll.  My hair has become healthier, shinier, and much more manageable.  Even co-workers have noticed a difference!  I know that there are a lot of people who said they wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because they were only able to get a few uses out of it.  As I said, I have been using this product approximately 5 days a week for more than a month and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and the bottle feels/sounds like it&#x27;ll last at least a couple more weeks.  I&#x27;m not sure if these reviewers attempted to apply the dry shampoo to their entire head and went through it much more quickly than they needed to, or, if there is a problem with the product leaking out when the lid isn&#x27;t on.  Fortunately, I&#x27;ve always had the lid on the bottle inbetween uses and have been able to get a lot of dry shampoos out of the product.  Or, maybe there were problems with the bottles but they have been resolved (the quantity issue came up with older reviews, from what I remember).  I will note, however, that the product leaves your hair/roots white after you&#x27;ve applied it.  This is normal.  I leave it in for a few minutes and then comb my hair.  The white powder-like substance on my roots completely disappears and my hair looks and smells great!  I&#x27;d definitely give this product 5 out of 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work with my fine hair even though i read that&#x27;s who it should work well for.  the smell is nice though.</li>
            <li> I paid $20 in a beauty store for this product. I used it one time, then stored it upright on my bathroom counter. When I went to use it the next time a day later, all the aerosol was gone and nothing would come out. I think there was a slow leak overnight. I was totally unable to use it and wasted $20 for one use. Until TIGI fixes the faulty packaging, no one should waste their money on this.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist and I loved the product; HOWEVER, I only got 4 uses out of it and it was gone.  I took it back and got a replacement...same thing happened.  After thinking maybe it was a defective batch that my salon got, I wrote the company.  They sent a replacement, and the SAME thing happened!  I went through 4 cans and each and every one was gone within 3 to 8 uses.  Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one! It works moderatley well....once....then nothing else will come out of the can. It leaves a white film on your hair thats hard to get off as well. When I contacted TIGI aout the defective cans they \\&quot;replaced\\&quot; the product (after I had to pay shipping on the empty bottle) with shampoo for color treated hair....how in thw world did they decided that was an equal replacement....or that I had colored hair?? Not please  AT ALL ....go with ig sexy brand instead!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I can now wash my hair every-other day instead of every day... I get super-greasy roots otherwise. I only use it on my roots and get about a months use out of a bottle. I never have problems with the container leaking either. I am super outdoorsy too... so it is great to have camping when I won&#x27;t be shampooing for days at a time.</li>
            <li> I got this and used it twice...LOVED IT.  When I went to use it again- the can was empty.  I thought something happened where I got a defective can, or there was something wrong and it sprayed overnight because it got stuck or something.  So I got another can...and the exact same thing happened.  I will not buy this product again, I will use Blow&#x27;s dry hair powder, or another brand (or even baby powder), as it is becoming an easier to find product.</li>
            <li> I used the product once and thought it was great. Went back to use it a week later and the bottle felt empty and I could no longer use it! Seems like it is a common complaint.  The gas somehow releases after the first use.  What a rip-off. Tigi obviously missed the boat on product testing.</li>
            <li> I bougth it from Ulta. This is the first time I used dry shampoo; got the idea from my niece. I used it 2 times and the third time I used it nothing coming out, shake it I can hear liquid inside the bottle and no matter how long I shake I can not spray. I try it again a couple day later I hope it works but no luck. Then I decide to throw it away</li>
            <li> I had been using cheap drugstore brand dry shampoo for my hair. I have tried Suave, and both types of Tresemee dry shampoos. I didn&#x27;t like either, and I thought they were overpriced for being so awful and not a good brand. I went out on a limb and tried Bed Head&#x27;s. It has worked great for me. I wash my hair every 2-3 days, and this stuff works great even after the gym! I have medium length brown hair, and it&#x27;s normal/thick. My hair gets really greasy around my forehead, and since I have bangs it&#x27;s a problem. I just pin up my bangs and spray a bit underneath my hair, close to my roots, wait a few seconds, and then comb it out with a fine tooth comb. If I used a lot, I massage it in with my fingers. It can leave a white powder, but it goes away if you massage it and comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells awesome too! 5/5</li>
            <li> After trying out 5 or 6 other dry shampoos that either didn&#x27;t work, left my hair feeling and looking disgusting or were so heavily scented that I choked and got nauseous every time I used them, I ran across this product. The light scent isn&#x27;t over-powering and and fades quickly after product is applied. The product dries quickly and easily rubs in leaving hair looking freshly washed and with added volume. I can usually get 2 more days out of my hair before washing thanks to this! The only negative it that it does leave hair and scalp feeling a bit dry and sometimes itchy. Occasionally, if I&#x27;m really needing to lay the product on thick due to being way overdue for washing my hair I will need to hold my breath and then run out of the room to breath in between sprays. However, the air clears within 30 seconds to a minute and 90% of the time this isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> So I got a bottle of this from Ulta about a month ago for 20 bucks. I&#x27;m a firm believer that you get what you pay for so I bought it. Immediately, I went home to see what people thought of it and of course, ran into all the problems people had with the faulty container. I was worried and decided that If it ran out in a week, I would take it back for a refund. I used it every other day and it didn&#x27;t seem like the product was diminishing at all. I was pleased, just shake it well, and spray until you can see the white substance come out. Just a little is all you need, otherwise it will make your hair very sticky and hard to comb through. Luckily, if you put too much it, it comes out easily with a bit of water. Nice! Unfortunately, one day, half the product seemed to vanish out of thin air for no reason, and 2 weeks later, the rest disappeared too.  So in all, it lasted about a month with me using it every other day or so. I know it could have lasted longer if the container wasn&#x27;t faulty :/ Still a few kinks to work out of the design it seems, oh well. Also, I never tipped it on its side, and kept it in my room.</li>
            <li> I have extremely greasy hair that needs to be washed everyday. I wanted a dry shampoo to get rid of my oily roots so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with wet hair all the time (mine is fairly long). The shampoo worked fairly well. I would feel good about it as I was leaving the door but by the end of the day it would be disgusting again.     The oder is horrible though. I originally passed it up at the beauty salon because of it but the only other alternative turned my hair into a clay pot. I just ran out and won&#x27;t be getting it again.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my tale:    As with the other reviews I only got one use out of the Rockaholic Dry shampoo.  I realized, when on my way to visit relatives, that my hair needed to be \\&quot;freshened\\&quot;. I popped into the store and figured \\&quot;I like other TIGI products so this will be just as reliable and the price is based on the fantastic quality\\&quot;. Used it, the scent was a bit strong but citrusy and it made my hair feel fresh and clean and gave it fantastic body.    I only bought it because I left my other stuff at home \\&quot;Ojon Hair: rub-out dry cleanser\\&quot;. I bought it at sephora one day because I had no idea that there was such a wide selection of dry shampoos on the market.     I was in a massive rush this morning so I thought I would toss my &#x27;back-up&#x27; spray into my purse and realized nothing was in it! I had only used it once!     My Ojon spray has lasted me over 5 uses and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of drying out.     There ARE better products out there. Go to Sephora and get them to show you some. Based on those bottles you can go to other salons and compare. I am not saying Ojon is the best, I wouldn&#x27;t know, I just know it&#x27;s better than Rockaholic because it only cost $5 more and has outlast Rockaholic by miles.    If you just want to buy it online google reviews of the Ojon dry cleanser. I  sure you will find far more pleasant reviews than this scam-a-holic spray.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product 3 times. I did that because what&#x27;s in the bottle is absolutely fantastic...when it&#x27;s in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the product I was told at point of purchase not to allow the bottle to tip or it could empty out.  I followed the rules and the bottle emptied out within 2 weeks.  I took it back and got another. The gal that sold it to me said there had been an issue at the manufacturer and the bad bottles were gone so I should be safe to exchange. 2nd time the same thing happened. I returned it for my money.  After a year of still looking for an equal to this product I purchased one yet again hoping just maybe I had received a 2nd bad bottle last time. Nope. Felt like an idiot and returned the bottle never to purchase this again.  I wish they would figure out the problem because this shampoo works.  It soaks up oil, gives amazing volume and is easy to use.  Bummed and still searching for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of dry shampoo and use it regularly.  This is one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.  For those who have complained that it doesn&#x27;t last a long time, this stuff actually lasts much longer than most, you just have to pop the sprayer off after each use so that you don&#x27;t waste the gas (just like any other aerosol spray).  Super easy - just pop it off after each use and pop it back on when you want to use it again and this stuff should last 3 months if you don&#x27;t go crazy and use it all over your head every time you use it.  This stuff is really great.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thick brown hair.  I&#x27;ll wash my hair in the morning, and by the end of the day, it&#x27;s already starting to get oily.  The following morning, it&#x27;s so oily that I have to either wear it up or wash it again.  I know it&#x27;s not healthy for your hair, so I&#x27;ve been searching for years for either a shampoo that will normalize the oil in my hair, or for a dry shampoo that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several normalizing shampoos and sprays -- nothing.  I tried Tre Semme dry shampoo -- ugh, felt like clay and clumped my hair today, and made it look/feel even worse...  Then I found Rockaholic Dry Secret Dry Shampoo.  Amazing.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad; it smells sort of like grapefruits...  weird, strong, but not too bad.  The smell sticks, by the way, but isn&#x27;t so strong those around you can smell it unless they&#x27;re really close.  Also, it will leave your hair feeling powdery, of course, but that&#x27;s way better than clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries the oils quickly, and it looks great.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair white-ish like other dry shampoos.  The most deciding factor in this dry shampoo:  I was extremely busy with college, and I had to use this dry shampoo two days in a row with no shower-shampoo..  My hair looked amazing.  This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the bottle - I bought two of the Breast Cancer Awareness pink bottles on 10/08/10, and today is 10/17/10...  I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with these bottles.  I&#x27;ve used the dry shampoo several times, and they are still heavy with product.  Seems like these pink bottles aren&#x27;t defective.  Also, they were on sell at Ulta for half the price of normal bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from amazon and used it once. The next time I went to use it, the bottle was empty.  So I called the company to complain and they apologized saying that there was a problem that had been fixed and mailed me a new bottle within a few days.  So.... I used that bottle once and guess what happened this morning when i went to use it?  The bottle&#x27;s empty!!!  Product works great, but ONE TIME.</li>
            <li> Everything everyone else wrote is true. Literally two uses TOPS in this can. I too, thought I bought a dud and then bought another can. Same thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The first bottle I had of this product- no leakage issues, I probably got 15 to 20 uses out of it.  The 2nd bottle, I probably got 3 uses.    I love the product, but I&#x27;m iffy on the packaging.      Pssst is a cheaper very similar product with no distingushable smell.  I&#x27;ve switched to that.      With any luck this product will get cheaper, and not leaking so I can switch back.  I liked the smell of this one better, and the visual packaging.  I like to leave my products out, so as vain and stupid as that sounds, I like my stuff in a nicer package and am willing to pay an extra buck or two, so long as I&#x27;m getting similar total usage.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this dry shampoo and definitely wish I hadn&#x27;t! The first time I bought it I used it once and when I went to use it again it was totally empty. I figured there had been a leak or something but didn&#x27;t take it back because I was so busy and didn&#x27;t keep the receipt (not thinking I would need to keep a receipt for dry shampoo)! I recently bought it again and have used it twice. When I went to use it again today it was almost empty and I couldn&#x27;t even use what was left because the spray top was broken and I couldn&#x27;t get it to spray! I can&#x27;t even believe this product is on the market! What a waste of money!! I emailed the company tigihaircare.com and emailed Ulta where I purchased the product with this same information. No high hopes on getting a response, but we&#x27;ll see what happens!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for those days where I just didn&#x27;t have time to go through my full routine.. I have blonde hair, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about it showing up or looking cakey. My roommate used it and she has very dark brown, almost black hair, and it worked great on hers too.     Good smell.    The only problem I had was when I traveled it leaked all over my cosmetics bag. It&#x27;s in an aerosol can, and that was a problem. I could still use it afterward though.</li>
            <li> Writing my first review because I am prompted by my enormous disappointment. I liked this product, it worked well, it did its job--this morning I went to use it, relying on it to get my hair work appropriate...and it was empty. I used it TWICE. No exaggeration, twice. This was the third time I went to use it, and it was completely gone.     I feel extremely cheated. I payed $20 for this, and its a complete scam that it lasted two uses.     Shame on you TIGI!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how there are so many reviews saying this only lasts for three or so uses. I have had a bottle of this for over two months, and I use it regularly, and have used it way more than three times. How much are you applying with each use? I find it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot with my naturally dark brown hair. Just a few sprays and I brush it through and my hair looks great. I love this stuff and recommend it to people often.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have tried many different dry shampoos and found this to be the best!  I have curly hair that tends to be very dry on the ends, but I get oily at the scalp.  This product removes the oil and doesn&#x27;t have to be brushed out so it leaves my curls intact.  Other products that I have tried either leave a white residue (making my dark brown hair look gray) or just don&#x27;t remove the oil.  I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> This is pretty good dry shampoo.  I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with dry shampoos running out fast b/c of leaking or not really absorbing the oils in my hair.  This bottle has lasted me a while.  I have kind of oily hair, so I can&#x27;t really keep my hair down on days I don&#x27;t wash it, dry shampoo or not.  But I find this is great for making my hair look good when I do pull it back on non-wash days and makes it easier to control.  Gives my hair good body when I use it on freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist turned me on to this. I have red hair, so a lot of other dry shampoos leave a really obvious powdery residue when you use them. This doesn&#x27;t and it has this clean citrusy scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, you don&#x27;t even need to use much for you hair to look as if you&#x27;d washed it that very day, my hair tends to get super greasy super fast so discovering this product was like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Residue? No visible one, it only feels a little bit like hairspray residue if  you scrunch it, but not something anyone will notice, my boyfriend who loves playing with my hair certainly hasn&#x27;t noticed anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the bottle which seems to be be why everyone hates this product: All you people need to do is check your nozzle every time you use it, take it to your ear and hear if there&#x27;s any hissing sound, if there is just play around with the nozzle moving it from side to side, moving the bottle upside down or spray a bit and then check again, it should stop. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the first one lasted a good 3 months using it about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t mind checking the nozzle everytime you use it, then by all means no get discouraged by the negative reviews, it&#x27;s a fantastic product with a somewhat defective package that can be dealt with.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Ulta and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the can like other people have mentioned. I&#x27;m pretty sure TIGI has fixed that issue now, but the product itself didn&#x27;t work for me. I have medium length, brownish-blonde hair that gets oily pretty easily. I intentionally skipped taking a shower one day so that I could try this the next day when my hair was oilier. IT DID NOTHING to change the oiliness! I sprayed my hair at the roots several times like it says to do and I tousled my hair to work the product in, but it looked EXACTLY the same and my hair stayed oily until I took a shower. No miracles, or anything here.</li>
            <li> I recieved my product fast - but I only used it twice and then there was none left...wierd- im pissed I spent the money and I only got to use it twice.....</li>
            <li> I have no idea where all the complaints are coming from. I just bought myself a bottle of this, as well as the conditioner in April. I still have both bottles and they are working great. I use it probably twice a week to cut down on the number of times I have to shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and this one is my favourite.  The smell is wonderful, the white powder is easily brushed out, and it does not go greasy midday like the Tresemme Fresh Start does.  The conditioner is wonderful too.  I have fine, thin hair that poofs up to ridiculous bird&#x27;s nest levels all summer long due to the humidity.  The poofing is even worse now that I put my hair through quite a bit of trauma trying to remove some hair colour, so now it&#x27;s dry all over while still being very oily at the roots.  The dry conditioner de-poofs it immediately and returns it to soft and tangle free.  Can&#x27;t rave about this stuff enough.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dry shampoo.  I have purchased many others and they either do not work, leave white stuff, or make your hair sticky.  I have had bottles that are defective but all you need to do after you&#x27;re done spraying your hair is play with the nozzle.  I twist it a little left and right and place it by my ear to make sure I don&#x27;t hear anything (it&#x27;s usually a \\&quot;fissing\\&quot; sound).  I&#x27;ve done this and the stuff lasts me months!</li>
            <li> I thought this was the best hair product I had purchased in a long time - I sang its praises for the first 2 uses ... and then it was gone. Literally, about 8 short sprays and the product is gone. I thought it had somehow spilled or that my sister had used it, but neither had happened - the product literally seems to evaporate and you get about 2 days of use out of it. That&#x27;s about a $10/day hairstyle ... which is not worth the purchase at all. I would never recommend this product to anyone and am disappointed in the company for wasting these large aerosol cans on such a pathetic amount of product.</li>
            <li> I always try to rate a product from both sides so here is the good and the bad about this product. First I will start with the good.  Good - I typically wash my hair every other day to avoid drying it out. With this product I can go 3 days and it looks and smells clean the whole time. I have tried several dry shampoos and this is by far the most superior of all I have tried. It does a wonderful job of absorbing oil and keeping volume in your hair while leaving it smelling clean. The product dissolves nicely and blends in with your hair. My hair is dark so this is extra important to me.  Bad - as other reviews have reported the product does not last long at all. I was able to get 7 uses out of the can but considering the price you pay that is hardly worth the money. All of the dry shampoos take away the  natural shine as they are absorbing oil and this one is no different. Although my  hair looks clean it looks a bit drab and dull, but I have noticed that with all of them. That is a trade off I am willing to accept.  If TIGI could figure out the packaging so you were getting more uses out of a can, this would be my go to dry shampoo. I have been fortunate enough to find some good sales on it and will pick it up when it is about 1/2 price, but would never pay full price for it. The Suave brand is $2.77 and lasts forever, but is far less superior than TIGI. In a pinch it will work and for the money it isn&#x27;t bad to keep on hand.   The bottom line, find a good sale and you will be thrilled. Pay full price and you will surely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product works great, easy to use! This is the first Dry shampoo that I have tried and I would definitely recommend purchasing this! You don&#x27;t need to use very much for it to work .</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. But makes my hair very static. Also, like with all dry shampoos, it makes hair feel coarse and dry but at least it&#x27;s good for quick morning ponytails that do not look greasy</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was mistaken, but after I purchased this a second time from another seller, it had the SAME result:  This product loses pressure after a few uses and was rendered unusable after a few weeks of very limited use...it was simply sitting in my medicine cabinet.  My attempt to get a refund/replacement from this seller was REFUSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT order again.</li>
            <li> I only seem to get a few uses out of this product before the pressure is gone and it no longer sprays. It works well when it does spray but HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my fine, grease-prone hair. On an average summer day I have about 6 hours before my bangs start to separate and look greasy, this dry shampoo has worked very well. Not to mention that I am a faux red-head, so the first few weeks after dyeing my hair I hate washing out all that color! It is ideal for keeping colors vivid longer.    When it comes out of the aerosol can, it does leave a fine white powder on your hair, but if you follow the instructions and massage it in slightly, wait a few minutes and brush the excess out, it looks great. It soaks up the grease and moisture, adds volume and texture, and smells great.    With all that positive feedback expressed, I cannot endorse this product. You use the product once or twice, maybe 5 times, and then go to use it again and it is empty. I had this experience with my second bottle, which luckily my hairdresser replaced free of charge after I found it empty the day after purchasing it.    TIGI is aware that a large percentage of the canisters and spray tops are malfunctioning and leaking product. This product is by no means cheap. There are some people who have been refunded or sent free product to make up for it, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there is a chance that after spending [...] bucks, you may be SOL. In an ideal world... They should have pulled the product until they could figure it out. I guess a girl can dream.    Until the packaging issues are sorted, I cannot justify spending [...] dollars on a product that may or may not work, regardless of how much of a rockstar I look like after using it.</li>
            <li> Okay so the first time I used it, it was AMAZING! I absoloutely loved it.. but I went to use it for a second time (maybe three days after buying it) it was practically gone! No one had used it, I know that I bought the travel size but it should have more than one use out of it. Its like the product ate itself or something. After reading the other reviews on this product, I will not be buying another can of this. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried others (cheap &amp; expensive) and was never as happy with them as I am with this one. It does takes some practice using at first if you&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before- so if you have a darker hair apply in small amounts (a few inches away) at first and work in it some until you get used to it. I absolutely love the volume it gives my hair too.</li>
            <li> great for toughs morning I didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and smells great will buy from again very soon</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have SUPER dry hair, so shampooing every day is a big &#x27;no no&#x27;. I use this at least once a week, and when I do use it I always get compliments on how great I smell. It&#x27;s actually funny seeing people sniffing around trying to find the source of the smell, and ,when they finally figure out it&#x27;s my hair, I&#x27;m always told how I smell like fresh citrus. I just laugh and say &#x27;thanks&#x27;. I know dry shampoo always gets a bad rap because people tend to use too much some times, and they get that sort of dusty look. I can&#x27;t stress enough how your biggest focus when using dry shampoo should be your roots, and you should always use a natural brush to brush it through your hair to get rid of that powdery look it can leave. I also know from reading these reviews that there used to be a packaging problem with this product. Let me assure you that it&#x27;s fixed. Any negative review regarding this problem should be discarded. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of dry shampoo products over the years, and this is by far the best. I love it! Oh, and when using this, you should definitely get [[ASIN:B0041T7A4U TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Conditioner Unisex, 8 Ounce]]. You just spray it from mid strand down and it leaves your hair super shiny. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> As all the others who mentioned it, this product has a huge problem with the packaging.  I have tested 4 cans and all are empty after 1 or 2 uses.  Also, I am blonde, so it works for me, but if you have dark hair, it will show up with a whitish color.    Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It&#x27;s a shame, because this is the only dry shampoo (and I&#x27;ve tried many) that actually works to make your hair less oily and fuller.  The others only seem to make my hair smell better, but with the same greasy look.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve read several reviews for other products, and it&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the money.  I have naturally wavy, greasy hair.  I use it whenever I want to extend my style an extra day, since I can&#x27;t go more than a day without washing my hair.  I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have the same problem.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great however after 3 uses the bottle is empty. Thinking I had gotten a defective product I did some research to find that it&#x27;s the way the product is packaged. The product has a slow leak and when you aren&#x27;t using it continues to drain out of the bottle. I&#x27;m really disappointed because the product worked wonderful, but not worth the money to only get 3 uses out of it :(</li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested dry shampoo to add body to my baby fine hair even when it is clean.  She ordered me a can from Biosilk, but I picked up a can of this on the way home from the salon.  I like the smell and the performance so much better than the Biosilk.  If I use too much the white powder will show up a little, but I think I&#x27;ve gotten better at applying it and avoid that problem.  My hair actually has some volume now.  And it smells good.  I am down to the end of my first can and did not have any problems that others have reported.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every product out there so this is not an expert opinion by any stretch. These are the 4 I&#x27;ve tried: Rockaholic, Suave, Tresemme, and got2be. Rockaholic is the highest priced one I have used (on sale $14) but I never believed it was any better than any of the others that were $5 or less.  I had to be VERY careful with the Rockaholic brand to make sure the nozzle didn&#x27;t stick and continue to spray lightly after each use. A friend of mine thankfully warned me about that. She told me that she (a professional hairdresser) and some of her coworkers had a few bottles wasted because of this issue. It&#x27;s such a slight spray that you have to put the bottle right up next to your ear to hear it. That friend has recently switched to the Suave brand and liked it equally as well.   I have fine shoulder-length hair which tends to look very limp unless I shampoo every day. To save my hair color and time in the mornings I&#x27;ve been using a dry shampoo every other day for over a year. Right now I&#x27;m using the got2be brand and I would compare it most closely to the Rockaholic brand, except that I am more satisfied with this dry shampoo in price and performance. I have even been able to occasionally stretch my shampooing to every third day with this brand and have been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This is great if you are going to have an updo and you made the mistake of washing your hair.  This will help give your hair the texture you need for a great styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also perfect for freshening up any area that your body has hair.  It dries up sweaty areas and gives your body a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is often limp at the roots.  So, a quick spray with this along any slightly greasy or limp hair will re-establish lift and volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Never had the problem with it not lasting like others.  I use it to give a boost of thickness.  Anyone with fine, thin hair would love this.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is fabulous while it lasts! I used it twice, both times on pretty greasy hair and it turned my greased locks into clean locks! I couldnt wait to use it again until when I went to use it, it was completely dried up! The bottle was empty, even though I had only used it two times. My hair stylist said that that brand tends to evaporate quickly. So basically I bought a full 6.3 oz bottle and only used 1/50th of the bottle. Bummer! Wish they&#x27;d fix this problem because I would be a huge fan and would always keep a bottle in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have used! I have been using it for over a year and it still does the trick everytime.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair but ALOT of it and have had trouble in the past with it feeling greasy if I went more than a day washing my hair. I tried other dry shampoos they all were so powdery or just felt weird. I bought this stuff on a whim and love it! I now go about 4 days without washing. I use this stuff usually day 3 &amp; 4 on the roots in the front and on the sides it does look kinda powdery at first but just running a comb or brush through it and it disappears. It also helps lend some nice body to my hair making it a bit easier to style. I am on my third can and each one lasts me about 8-10 uses. The smell is a bit overwhelming at first but dissipates quickly and I dont really notice any odor after 5-10minutes. I have not had any trouble with my cans leaking and seriously recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Big Sexy Hair and have been very satisfied with that product. It was once out of stock and I was forced to try something different. Unfortunately I chose  the Rockaholic, hoping it might be half as good... Not even! Terrible product, barely works and leaves huge amounts of stains which you can barely get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have to start work pretty early in the morning - I have to leave my house by 5:30 am so some mornings I can&#x27;t get my hair washed and still get to work on time. But I don&#x27;t want to all gross looking.  This stuff is great.  It makes my hair look fresh without leaving the white that the baby powder does (that&#x27;s what I used to do)</li>
            <li> I have natural blonde hair that is very fine and prone to being VERY oily. I have come to consider myself a dry shampoo expert over the years, I have tried probably 50 different brands of dry shampoo. Dirty secret is hands down the best! It makes my hair look completely clean without making the hair &#x27;stick together&#x27; or powdery. It does not make my hair look waxy like some can do, it honestly makes my hair look just as good or better than freshly shampooed hair. I can go three days in between shampoos, which used to be unheard of for me, even with other brands of dry shampoo I could not go three days!  I have not ran into the issue of packaging, I shake the can really well before and after each use, I have found shaking AFTER each use has helped with a lot of the dry shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Always has been my favorite- but i had a hard time finding it until i found it on amazon!! Ive tried tons of dry shampoos n this one still ranks #1!! Great smell, not filmy, can go an xtra two days not washing my hair with it!!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works to a certain extent. If you don&#x27;t spray enough your hair will obviously not look like it has been shampooed, but if you spray too much it looks as if you are going gray (very powdery).</li>
            <li> I have sampled a few different brands and by far this is my fav.  I am a brunette and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gray or white and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I bought it from a grocery store, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.. reminds me of mosquito repellant. Back it went..</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells good, doesnt leave hair greasy, lasts all day. Totally beats the tresseme or suave brand.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to see if the can would become empty. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. By the end of the day my hair was greasy. I don&#x27;t have oily hair, but wash my hair everyday. I am still on the look out for a good dry shampoo. I might try the Rene Furterer brand -that has gotten good reviews.</li>
            <li> My wife is very particular with her hair. This product rocks :) It keeps her hair in place and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. love it.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. It doesn&#x27;t leave a lot in the air to inhale (i&#x27;m pregnant and anal about fumes), it&#x27;s gives your hair a nice hold and doesn&#x27;t feel too dirty. I used to use this when i wore my extensions but now i just use it with my short hair. love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this from CVS pharmacy.  I had never tried dry shampoo before.  I have dark hair and it did leave my hair a little grey looking, but after rubbing it in, it was hardly noticeable and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  I only used a very small amount because I was just testing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,  I just went back to use it a second time, about 4 days later, and it is EMPTY!  Just a few wet drops plopped sadly out and there was NO spray.  How incredibly frustrating!!!  I thought I just got a dud, but after reading the reviews it seems like this is a consistent problem.  How is this product still on the market?!?</li>
            <li> I use this dry shampoo occasionally, to get one or two extra days before having to wash my hair. It makes hair smell fresher and cleaner. Some dry shampoos have a bad odor, but this one is very nice. It is expensive, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It is everything I expected for the price. It works great, smells good, lasts long and adds volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked this stuff!  I even used it on my 7 year old son&#x27;s hair (who didn&#x27;t take his shower like he was supposed to one night and didn&#x27;t have time before school to do so).  It worked AWESOME on his hair and it&#x27;s worked great on mine!  Having your hair sprayed and look grey was a bit alarming at first but I just brush through it and finger shake it and it looks normal after that.  It&#x27;s been a life saver for me so far because I can only wash my hair every other day and sometimes that second day my roots are looking oily so this has helped with that a lot.  I used to use baby powder and that is so messy and being able to spray this stuff on is so much easier and so much less messy!</li>
            <li> I have used the product only once. When I used it, it worked pretty well however i wasnt able to use it since then due to the spray can not working.</li>
            <li> I looked for this product everywhere, and this one was by far the cheapest place to get it. It works great! I love this stuff. I use it as dry shampoo, and also as a root lifter, when needed. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li> This particular can is spraying white, so i have to spray it on my hand and rub into my hair. The last two bottles i bought did not spray white, I was able to spray directly into my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Product, I use it all the time when not able to  shampoo hair in the morning.  Saves time and hassel.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great to use everyother day when you dont wash your hair. It makes your hair feel like new!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading a recommendation by a NY Hair Stylist on Gwenyth Paltrow&#x27;s GOOP site.     I have very oily hair, it has to be washed daily, if not, by a day and a half it is disgusting. This is when I used TIGI&#x27;s Rockaholic, on days I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, it holds me over until that night or the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 cans of this product from a local beauty supply store and used each can only twice before the product ran out, for a total of $40.00.  I see other reviewers posted the same complaint over 6 months ago, but it is clear it has not been effectively addressed.</li>
            <li> Is the best dry shampoo I have tried.  Works well on oily hair.  When the can gets low it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out very well.  But overall I like this one the best.  I use it and buy it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this online for $13 vs $20 in the store.  Not a bad product and good for the days when u r in a hurry.  Think it may be better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It works very well to soak up excess oil and add volume. Have tried many other drug store dry shampoos but this one was recommended by my hair stylist, who stated, &amp;#34;this product has changed my life&amp;#34; - I agree!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and this is the perfect product for day two.  It helps a ton with oily areas of your hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product! The first one I purchased it only lasted a few sprays like some of the others here have experienced and I was really disappointed with that but it worked so well I thought I would try it again. Read some reviews that said you need to shake the can really well before applying and while applying and it would last like a normal aerosol can so that is what I have always done since and have never had any more problems with losing the spray out it.  I have bleached blond hair and it is oily if not washed daily but with this product I can put it on the roots and underneath on the day I don&#x27;t shampoo and it gives me a lot of volume and texture to what would otherwise have been limp, oily hair.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Smells good.  I like it better than the less expensive, drug store counterparts.  I have had no issues with the sprayer on the bottle not working and I&#x27;ve had mine for over 6 months, so I think they fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> Um, really annoyed with this seller right now.  I ordered the Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo, but they sent me a different product altogether.  When I tried to return it, I was told it can not be returned because it is considered hazardous because the can is under pressure.  I order online because it is easy - with issues like this, I might as well just go to a local store and pick it up.  NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my friend suggested I try it. It sprays on white, but don&#x27;t be alarmed. If you run a brush through your hair the white disappears as it soaks up any oils. It does take a little bit of shine out of your hair. I use it on my roots to limit getting too oily in between shampoos. I gave it 4/5 stars because I&#x27;m not real fond of the scent when it&#x27;s sprayed out of the bottle. The scent does go away after a little while though. This product is great if you color your hair and are trying to prevent fading from using regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I tried, and I since using this I have also tried Tresemme&#x27;s and Big Sexy&#x27;s. This is for sure my favorite one because it left my hair looking and feeling the best. Sadly, it also stopped working the fastest because the nozzle got clogged (which I wasn&#x27;t extremely surprised because other reviews I read before had warned about that) but I still got probably 6 or 7 uses out of it so it wasn&#x27;t too shabby!</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in dry shampoos.  Not only is it a huge time saver for those of us with kids, jobs, workouts, and ball games, but it allows time for your \\&quot;natural oils\\&quot; to build up, which is EXTREMELY healthy for your hair, without looking or feeling like you don&#x27;t have clean hair.  This product gets the job done.  It has a lemon-y scent and when brushed out the white powdered look goes away.  My only negative is it builds up on your scalp at the end of the day.  **So here&#x27;s the low down on dry shampoos- I&#x27;ve used Suave&#x27;s and it smells almost identical, but without the buildup.  Tresemme&#x27;s Freshstart smells the best but I must have gotten a bad batch.  After 3 sprays it was gone. Fat Hair&#x27;s bottle did the same thing.  My favorite thus far is found in Got 2 Be Rockin It Forever Style Stay.  Smells fantastic, no build up, feels clean and fresh, and good price.  There ya have it.  Hopefully this helps someone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t get the SuperCut special and therefore has relatively long, thick hair. Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I&#x27;ve been known to skip a shower every once in a not-so-great while, so I was hoping to find a magic potion that prevented me from feeling guilty about the day-old scent of my scalp. Just because I can&#x27;t smell anything, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not there. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll have to risk it, because this stuff is stank incarnate. Turns my hair into a powdery, putrid, podunk poof-ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend is a dry-shampoo aficionado (if there ever was one), and although she resorts to the remainder of my bottle when she&#x27;s in town and times get desperate, she much prefers the el-cheapo Suave counterpart, especially when it comes to the smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling coarse and nasty!  Total waste of money!  I&#x27;d previously purchased when it was in the pink can and I loved it!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking clean and smelling great. If you use to much you will see flakes but after you get the right amount down hair looks good. I like not having to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker!! I love it! I had to hide it from my roommate because she used it more than I did! I highly recommend getting this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; available because I know it&#x27;s very hard on your hair to wash it and subject it to all the heated styling products every day, and this product ROCKS!! (lol). It really is the best dry shampoo available. It sprays on to the roots, then you rub it it - wait for a few seconds and comb/style. No white residue and no weird odor. It actually has a very pleasant and clean smell that lasts all day. Keeps my hair looking just-washed every time I use it. Other dry shampoos failed at making my hair feel/look really clean - my hair always felt like it was oily after using other inferior products.  That&#x27;s definitely not a problem when using the TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo.  And even though it&#x27;s only 6.3 ounces, don&#x27;t let that worry you - it lasts a long time.  I just bought 4 more cans of it because I never want to be without it!!</li>
            <li> It did a good job, I thought, but for as many oz that were in there, I felt it should have lasted longer? I saw comments about the bottle being faulty, but I also saw that problem was fixed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a chance I didn&#x27;t realize how often I was using it... I have 2 boys under the age of 3, so maybe I skipped a couple more showers than I thought I did ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m going to try a different brand for brunettes. I use hair spay on my bangs and after using hairspray and then dry shampoo again the next morning, it doesn&#x27;t brush out as well and looks kinda white and has some dry shampoo flakes/powder that I can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a hair salon for $19 without reading the reviews.  Well, sure enough, I used it once and when I went back to it - it was empty.  This product is the worst rip off I have ever encountered.  DON&#x27;T buy it unless you have a reason why you&#x27;ll use the whole can in a day or two.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. They got a bad rap awhile back when they had a bad batch (it happened to me too...). I used it one time and all the pressure escaped, but I called and they took full responsibility and admitted the problem. But its a great product and a great price, and I had never had a problem before or since.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this 5 times now...I purchased 2 times from Ulta,2 times from my local hair salon and once from Walmart at there salon. Let me tell you this is through out a one year span, to see if any changes were made...answer is NO! I just purchased my last and final bottle for the breast cancer awareness at Ulta, thinking I would give this product once last shot...it was $7.99 for the cause but normally this \\&quot;crap\\&quot; is $20+ so I figured what the heck...I&#x27;ll try it one more time. So I used it the next day and the sad thing is, the product itself is awesome I mean it smells good it works great, by far the best that I have tried, but the can was empty the next day! WTF?!?!?!? I held my ear up to the sprayer and you can literally hear the air coming out, haha! So I called up Ulta today and the girl I talked to said she bought 2 bottles last year and just finished up her first bottle no problem, are you kidding me? I&#x27;m thinking, I wonder if this is a line they have to remember to tell there customers, because my good friend works at a ***** five star salon and has had the same problem so they stopped carrying it. Bottom line, if you want to give it a try and see what happens go ahead, maybe you&#x27;ll get a miracle bottle. But 5 for me is enough. I love this product but the packaging has to change. And as you can see I am not the only one with problems!</li>
            <li> I did not like this..it did not make my hair look clean as expected, it looks frizzy and overly dry, i thrashed the second bottle without using it ..very dissapointed</li>
            <li> i just recently colored my hair red, so i cant wash my hair often. i was recommended this product and i am so glad she told me about it! i just shake it spray it style it and go. i love it. i saw other reviews saying they dont think this works, something about packaging? mine works just fine. every time i use it i get product. and my bottle is even slightly dented on the bottom. im ordering more of these as soon as i get paid!</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this has such bad reviews from people and the problems they are having I have not had.  Especially considering I buy this product quite frequently.  One of the best dry shampoos IMO is KMS.  It&#x27;s in a tiny little bottle so I usually don&#x27;t get it, I just go through it too often.  The Bed Head product is good, you can use a lot or a little but you don&#x27;t have to worry about it, as there is a lot of product in the bottle.  Perks up your hair and has a citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> The nozzle was cracked but I could still make it work.  I used it about 5 times before it was all gone.  Clearly a majority of this product  was used.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was surprised to see such low ratings.  I love this stuff.  It works great and smells amazing.  Anytime I use it.  I get compliments on the smell.  Nice to not have to wash every day and keep the oils down keeping your hair looking great.  A bit pricy but works great.</li>
            <li> for those of you that feel you need to wash your hair everyday but don&#x27;t want your ends to suffer- this is for you. Now I wash my hair every 2-3 days and my ends are healthier for it. Also great for styling and volumizing your hair..</li>
            <li> Works well when you want to keep a look for a few hours longer.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it could withstand another day of not washing, but it does work well for when you need to extend a look.  Much cheaper than salons, nice unique fruity smell!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this a lot. When I do use it, it doesn&#x27;t really effectively remove the greasy-ness from my hair. It just makes the top layer of hair extremely dry. If you accidentally use too much it can leave a strange white residue on your hair. Mine has lasted a couple months now because I don&#x27;t use it too frequently. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t suggest letting it get near the tips of your hair, either, because it&#x27;s basically pure alcohol, and can, in so many words, &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, worth every penny. Can go 2 days without washing. Great also for adding volume without having to back comb so much.</li>
            <li> This amazing product allows me to refresh my hairstyle and avoid daily hair washing, which ultimately leads to healthier hair.I have straight shoulder length fine textured hair. It works beautifully every time, and can also be used to add texture for clean hair to aid in manageability.</li>
            <li> great smell&lt;br /&gt;love to be able not to wash my hair everyday&lt;br /&gt;works great for people with long hair to give your hair a break&lt;br /&gt;i use it every other day and you cannot tell&lt;br /&gt;hair always looks and feels like i washed it&lt;br /&gt;i love this product!</li>
            <li> Works great but totally over priced. Also, the can always comes half full.</li>
            <li> I love the volume this product gives and it works SO GOOD!!!! but.... its pretty expensive for how fast it runs out... Sad day!</li>
            <li> This lets me go a day or two withour washing since my hair stylist tells me not to wash too often</li>
            <li> Always there when I need them!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells wonderful.  I use it once every other day since I wash my hair once every other day.</li>
            <li> This product work really well but you only get two uses out of it, its pretty wierd to get a can that size and only get two uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and absolutely fell in love with it! I have fine hair and hated always having to wash every day, it really does work great. The reason I give this product two stars is because when I tried to travel with it, I left with over half a bottle, and when I returned it was empty. I did not fly anywhere, it was a simple hour drive. I later discussed this strange event with a hair stylist at the tanning salon where I work, she said that this product is notorious for doing this, it cannot be stored on its side or it all leaks out. So, unless you plan on never taking it anywhere or leaving it stored on its side it&#x27;s not worth the price. I was very sad when this happened, but I guess the hunt is on for a new dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Allows me to get an extra day out of my blow dry. I&#x27;ve used a lot of brands and this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the mornings that you just don&#x27;t have time to go through the process of styling your hair!</li>
            <li> Like many other customers, I found that the can didn&#x27;t put out any product when I received it. This was disappointing, of course; my wife wanted to wash her hair using it. I let the seller know, very nicely, and got the response that I was lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;m sure the product was actually shipped empty. The cap was broken but taped back together, and, as the seller explained, if the bottle had emptied in transit there would&#x27;ve been powdery shampoo in the packaging. Well, there was no powdery shampoo... so it was shipped empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually shocked to come to this conclusion. I&#x27;d never expected such a thing from an Amazon seller. I&#x27;ve used Amazon marketplace sellers for years and hardly had a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo for myself after having a conversation with my hair stylist. She encouraged me to purchase this so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday. She also said it would help me to maintain the color if I wasn&#x27;t washing everyday. This is not a shampoo replacement but does the job. It came in great condition and was delivered within the time frame it said it would be. The delivery was quick and hassle free.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this and has not had the issues with it arriving empty as others have, but it appears that its hit or miss.  If stored on its side, it can leak out and you have no control over how its being shipped.  If you do get a full one, my wife appears to be getting about 12-13 uses out of it.  That still comes out to about a buck a pop.  Pricey product either way in my view.</li>
            <li> I have used this products for many months but typically purchase from my local salon. I love this stuff. I was hoping to save a few bucks so I purchased two bottles from this vendor. I used it one time and the next time I went to use it the bottle was EMPTY!!! I thought something was strange so I used the other bottle and it did the same thing. Its like there is a leak in the bottle or something. Also the white powder didnt come out like it was supposed to. Perhaps this seller is selling old bottles. Won&#x27;t buy from again.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty residue as other dry shampoos. You will find your hair looks as if you just washed it and your hair will stay clean looking all day.</li>
            <li> Dry oiliness of hair ... even gets kinda parched and you need to clean the excess from hair or will be whitish. It smells like lemon ...</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I stalk the ULTA for sales and specials as it is pricey. I have used it over a year and have not had any of the problems people report with the bottle leaking. I have lots of fine, uncolored hair and any oil on my scalp shows. I use it immediately before styling, and often it lasts 2 days, just a light spritz the second day. Have to shake the bottle well before use, great smell (my husband is sensitive to scents), volume and hold. Also great to use before a workout! I have tried less expensive versions and been unsatisfied. My stylist recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos and this is the very best one.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve sprayed something on your hair.</li>
            <li> Got this product from a salon. Stylist told me not to use too much other wise you get this filmy mess. So start with a little and build up. That is exactly what I&#x27;ve tried to do, and the product does not seem to remove or dry up any oil from my hair, leaves a nasty film on my hair, and four hours after applying the product my hair looks greasier than it was to begin with. As for everyone else&#x27;s experience with it lasting 3 or so uses, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve only used it three times.</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo after watching a review by Elle Fowler on YouTube.  We both have the same hair type so If figured I&#x27;d check it out to see if it would work for me.  Overall I like it and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them.  I&#x27;ve gotten about seven uses out of my bottle and since I only use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my hair, It&#x27;s lasted me a significant amount of time (I still have about one use left in the bottle.)  The only thing I hate about it (and dry shampoo&#x27;s in general) is the dirty feeling that comes along with using it.  I like my hair feeling clean and silky but when you use this, your hair feels really really dirty.  Now it looks great but just feels awful.  It adds huge amounts of volume if you flip your head over when your working the product in with your fingers.  I sometimes spray a little of this even if my hair isn&#x27;t dirty just to get that volume bump in my pony tails.  I would repurchase this product again but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel super dirty.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it works really great and the price was very reasonable. I would definately order it again.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on tv.  i&#x27;ve used other products that were similar.  It does a nice job.  I&#x27;ve found less expensive items that also do a nice job.  I have blonde hair so I can use just about anything and if it shows some powdery substance I can blend it in.  This product would be really good for people with darker hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, and loved the fresh clean scent and how it works very well to quickly absorb oil without any trace of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, the first bottle I bought, for ~$20, I only got about 5 uses and it stopped working. It felt as though there was more in there, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to come out. Since I loved the product SO much, I bought another can, and much to my dismay, the same thing happened!!!&lt;br /&gt;So I gave up on it and started using another,  it worked well, but had no scent and was quite costly (blowpro).  When that ran out, I considered buying more, but also kept thinking of this. Seeing as the price has come down, I decided to give it a shot, and am very glad I did!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used it at least 15 times and there&#x27;s still more left.  I shake it well before using and often a lil shake between each spray. I&#x27;m so happy, it really extends the time I can go without washing my hair, which saves me time and reduces color fade.  The light citrus scent is fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell like a product (I found the tresseme had a citrus scent AND a strong smell of cheap hairspray), it&#x27;s color less or undetectable anyway AND touching my hair you can&#x27;t feel it.  I&#x27;ve had some where itll leave a residue on your hands if you stroke your hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered this 4 times now from different sources. I hear a lot about product running out too fast but mine have all lasted to where I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth. Now, this is not to say this product is comparable to how long a hairspray might last but I don&#x27;t use it daily, more like 5 times per month. This lasts me about 3-4 months if that helps consumers decide. Gives good texture and dries out the greasy roots well. Smells amazing. I like it better than the Redken one and this is less expensive.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Nice for days after work when I need a little help because time is short.</li>
            <li> Tried many dry shampoos... by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts long and rubs in smooth. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either</li>
            <li> I have been trying different dry shampoos and this one works but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Dove dry shampoo which smells great and works just as good for half the price.</li>
            <li> after one use there was nothing left in the bottle! :( the cap was broken when i got it so i got my money back from amazon but still it seems like this products is not meant to be used more that a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I got on here just to look at the price compared to CosmoProf, where I buy it from. I was SHOCKED to see so many bad reviews complaining of 1-3 uses per can. If that is the problem you&#x27;re experiencing, then I highly recommend you pay the full salon price. It can be pricey, but I felt it was worht it. The can I bought lasted me a few months, using it 1-2 times a week. It was awesome for camping trips when you can&#x27;t shower every day, and for summer in general when I tend to get oily faster in the humidity. I think in this case you get what you pay for. I would recommend this product based on my experience, and I hope people give it another try bought professionally.</li>
