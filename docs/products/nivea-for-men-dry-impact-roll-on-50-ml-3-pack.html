            <li>Best deodorant ever...</li>
            <li>Best men&#x27;s deodorant made!  </li>
            <li>Why oh why does Nivea not sell it&#x27;s best products in America???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And yes, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is the best deoderant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Brilliant.</li>
            <li>Very good roll-on antiperspirant, as good as the silver bullet Nivea which came from Brazil.</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy that I found someone on Amazon who sold them.  </li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It worked so good that I looked for it all over the US.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Nivea product I discovered in Europe.  </li>
            <li>Bought this stuff and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I think does a good job of getting rid of the stink.  </li>
            <li>I bought the silver bottles, will try those before I call it quits for good.    </li>
            <li>I wish they could do something as good as this one for woman.</li>
            <li>My Hubby loved this, he is soon out again</li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasant clean smell without being too overpowering.</li>
            <li>So we ordered more and it was just as great as he remembered.  </li>
            <li>There seem to be many many variations of this product and this one is not as good as some that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for those of us who have developed an allergic reaction to alcohol based deodorants.</li>
            <li>No irritation which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Works better than most.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this pack of 3; however, I like the stick better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brand and found I end up with irritation.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad that I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Ok, when I say I have tried every anti-perspirant / deodorant out there, I have.  </li>
            <li>fast service and great price.</li>
            <li>what more does one need?</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>and i have to order some more.</li>
            <li>but this one is the top one for him.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works great, I don&#x27;t smell like sweat for real 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Although it works for almost a day, but I can&#x27;t continue to buy it more.</li>
            <li>Truly 24 hour (or more) protection.  </li>
            <li>It had a great smell and was very appealing overall.      </li>
            <li>This product has a great, light smell which is a roll on &amp; protects against odor for 24 hours with high humidity.</li>
            <li>Works better than any deodorant available in US supermarkets.</li>
            <li>This is a great liquid deodorant, especially if you dislike greasy or flaky roll-ons or sprays.</li>
            <li>He liked it so much we ordered it when we got home.</li>
            <li>I first used this product bought in South Korea and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing works better than Certain Dri to stop swamp arm in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Nice size little bottles fit easily in an over night bag, good price, strong enough deodorant, light fragrance, smooth lotion, all in all</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in the stores, but thanks amazon for making my life a bit easier!</li>
            <li>I have been using it since 2001 since I first bought it in Europe!</li>
            <li>It also smells fresh all day.</li>
            <li>it is still worth shipping through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not crazy about roll-ons</li>
            <li>Not an overpowering perfume, just right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent was mild and pleasing as opposed to most western deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Once it dries it seems to be effective all day long.  </li>
            <li>So it arrives very fast.</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for many years and prefers this over any other product available.</li>
            <li>I first bought this stuff when I ran out of deodorant in Paris.</li>
            <li>I first tried this while staying in Geneva, Switzerland.  </li>
            <li>I happened upon this deodorant after months of trying many different things.  </li>
            <li>I bought this deodorant the first time when I was traveling on business in Europe and ran out of mine.  </li>
            <li>No perspiration, no irritating smell, just right.</li>
            <li>I love Nivea products &amp; usually use Nivea for Men Invisible for Black &amp; White Power Deodorant Roll-on 50ml which works perfect.</li>
            <li>It works really well, goes on easily and does not have the same issues with staining clothes.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works very well.</li>
            <li>On a trip to Italy during the summer, my deoderant was not working very well, and I needed some help.</li>
            <li>It dries fast too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>he is very set on DEO&#x27;s</li>
            <li>absolutely will not ever be buying it again</li>
            <li>Usually I spend $2-3 bucks for whatever is on sale, but liked this stuff so much</li>
            <li>(I have dry skin) and Strong.</li>
            <li>Those two facts are true, however I could as well have been applying tap water to my armpits as a deodorant because this thing simply doesn&#x27;t work as a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I Am new to this product, but I believe it&#x27;s going to change how I order deo!</li>
            <li>Goes on wet via a plastic roller, but dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the solid formula I bought while traveling in the Middle East but has replaced my go to antiperspirant from Old Spice clickable solid.</li>
            <li>For some reason my armpits revolted against my normal deodorant that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, in my experience you&#x27;ll smell worse with this product that if you don&#x27;t use any deodorant in the first place.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and only Deodorant that keeps me dry without odor..</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I can get it, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any white rings on your shirt like most other products.</li>
            <li>We usually stock up on this when we are out of the US, so when he ran out he ordered more from Amazon, and it has worked out quite well.</li>
            <li>It goes on wet but dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very masculine fragrance and keeps away body odor from early morning until night.</li>
            <li>Its kinda embarrassing to ask for such an odd thing, but I am glad I can buy it here instead.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more of a dry product but turns out that it is wet</li>
            <li>The smell is very smooth and does not intrude the smell of a cologne,but lasts for a day, at least.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle but decidedly masculine, the applicator feels durable and hefty, it&#x27;s not crazy expensive, it&#x27;s totally portable / dopp kit friendly... great deoderant.</li>
            <li>I got hooked on this type of deodorant while living in Europe and as far as I know, this type of Nivea deodorant is not sold in U.S. retail stores.</li>
            <li>Product protects against odor even after intense workouts or physical activity and does not stain garments.</li>
            <li>Soft on Skin</li>
            <li>This is my first Dry Impact Roll-on</li>
            <li>Small glass, but strong, &amp;#34;bullet&amp;#34; shaped container - never had any issues travelling with it.  </li>
            <li>The roll on idea is cool but it just becomes a sticky mess in my armpit.</li>
            <li>The three pack is really convenient and each bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Very light fragrance which I like a lot as nothing worse than having your deodorant competing with your after shave lotion.  </li>
            <li>My 15-yr old insisted he had to have this product, after he got in Frankfurt while stranded there on a stopover, with a lost suitcase...I did not understand why he insisted on getting it once back in the US after his run out, until I read the reviews.  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; I never had any burning or breaking out like some other products.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight or comfortable in the least!  </li>
            <li> I apologize for the 1 star,but Amazon wouldn&#x27;t allow me to award it a negative 5 stars which is what it really deserves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as Nivea is making this product, I will be buying it, and so should everyone...</li>
            <li> shipping takes long.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is how quickly it gets used up and how expensive it is for the volume.</li>
            <li> a thing!No other deoderant I have ever used has worked this well, and I bought the 3-pack for my dad, brother, and self as an extra.</li>
            <li> Even if I let it dry for 10 minutes, my shirts just stick to it.</li>
            <li> The wetness was a little reduced in the beginning, didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> Works with the entire Nivea for Men product line--don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not available in stores in the US.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is Nivea.</li>
            <li> I found US deodorants to be thick, not that effective and bad for staining clothing.</li>
            <li> Also, it helps me in the gym to be less wet under my arms.</li>
            <li> That is just not right.</li>
            <li> we not deserving enough for you?</li>
            <li> Gotta agree with the previous reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I got this product in Germany in an Aldi for less than 2 euro, and sometimes less than 1 euro each.</li>
            <li> As advertised...a little pricey, but can&#x27;t find anywhere else...</li>
            <li> Every roll-on I have ever used caused sticky-ness and the anti-perspirant only made matters worse.</li>
            <li> You just have to wait to put your shirt on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> If I let it sit for a few days, I find myself shaking it so the marble catches the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;meh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolute waste of hard earned $$ I bought a pack of 3</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit small, it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> They work, they&#x27;re small and portable.</li>
            <li> This stuff just plain works and doesn’t upset my, now, delicate underarm skin.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t buy it directly in the USA.</li>
            <li> Tends to irritate, and loses efficiency within 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Even tough</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why roll-ons are almost extinct in the U.S.and</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done with these roll-ons, I&#x27;d have to find the stick somewhere, as it is quite expensive here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it is expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy this from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores. I first bought this stuff when I ran out of deodorant in Paris. It worked so good that I looked for it all over the US. Amazon is the only place I can get it, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great.  Wish they sell in in US.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well. Even tough it&#x27;s a bit small, it lasts for awhile. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave a caked on armpit stains on shirts. It also smells fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Works better than most.</li>
            <li> My 15-yr old insisted he had to have this product, after he got in Frankfurt while stranded there on a stopover, with a lost suitcase...I did not understand why he insisted on getting it once back in the US after his run out, until I read the reviews.  Wish it was available in the stores, but thanks amazon for making my life a bit easier!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Very masculine fragrance and keeps away body odor from early morning until night. Too bad I can&#x27;t buy it directly in the USA. The international shipment took a while (IIRC about 2-3 weeks) but this was just replenishing my stock, so it was not an issue.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Nivea product I discovered in Europe.  Tends to irritate, and loses efficiency within 8 hours.</li>
            <li> This deoderant saved my life! On a trip to Italy during the summer, my deoderant was not working very well, and I needed some help. I found a bottle at a local market in Venice, and I could not smell a thing!No other deoderant I have ever used has worked this well, and I bought the 3-pack for my dad, brother, and self as an extra. The smell is very smooth and does not intrude the smell of a cologne,but lasts for a day, at least. As long as Nivea is making this product, I will be buying it, and so should everyone...so keep making it!</li>
            <li> I first used this product bought in South Korea and I fell in love with it.  It had a great smell and was very appealing overall.      I decided to get this pack of 3; however, I like the stick better.  After I&#x27;m done with these roll-ons, I&#x27;d have to find the stick somewhere, as it is quite expensive here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I Am new to this product, but I believe it&#x27;s going to change how I order deo!</li>
            <li> This is a great liquid deodorant, especially if you dislike greasy or flaky roll-ons or sprays. The liquid is applied through a design similar to a ball point pen. The scent is not over-powering. The only drawback is how quickly it gets used up and how expensive it is for the volume. I got hooked on this type of deodorant while living in Europe and as far as I know, this type of Nivea deodorant is not sold in U.S. retail stores. Until it is sold in the U.S. it is still worth shipping through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Roll on that is liquid, dries, is not sticky and does&#x27;nt stain your shirt!  Not an overpowering perfume, just right.</li>
            <li> I first tried this while staying in Geneva, Switzerland.  It&#x27;s scent was mild and pleasing as opposed to most western deodorants.  And the roll on was nifty.  When I got back, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in my local stores.  So I&#x27;m happy that I found someone on Amazon who sold them.  Identical except for maybe some localization language (french/german/etc..) but also English.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this when we were in Florence. He liked it so much we ordered it when we got home.</li>
            <li> i actually need this product cuz is the only one that doesnt givr an allergic reaction. It is a great product but i will never order from this seller again i had to wait for over a month to get it... That is just not right.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and only Deodorant that keeps me dry without odor.. I have been using it since 2001 since I first bought it in Europe!</li>
            <li> No irritation which is very important to me.  I have tried many brand and found I end up with irritation.  The scent is also great.</li>
            <li> This product has a great, light smell which is a roll on &amp; protects against odor for 24 hours with high humidity. It dries fast too. I have sensitive skin &amp; I never had any burning or breaking out like some other products. It does not leave any white rings on your shirt like most other products. I gave it a 5 star rating even if it was rated for only 24 hrs.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works better than any deodorant available in US supermarkets. I know this product from Europe and I am glad that I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for those of us who have developed an allergic reaction to alcohol based deodorants. Product protects against odor even after intense workouts or physical activity and does not stain garments.</li>
            <li> Gotta agree with the previous reviewer.  Had to scramble to get some deodorant on a recent trip to Europe.  Bought this stuff and loved it.  Usually I spend $2-3 bucks for whatever is on sale, but liked this stuff so much will pay the premium price for the premium product.</li>
            <li> I picked this up in Moscow, Russia during a recent trip and was amazed at how well it worked. No perspiration, no irritating smell, just right. Every roll-on I have ever used caused sticky-ness and the anti-perspirant only made matters worse. This is the only product that works for me. Now I ask all my freinds comming from Europe or Russia to bring some with them. Its kinda embarrassing to ask for such an odd thing, but I am glad I can buy it here instead. I don&#x27;t know why roll-ons are almost extinct in the U.S.and this product should be sold here. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the praise and learning of the miracles this stuff does, I ordered it immediately.  Ok, when I say I have tried every anti-perspirant / deodorant out there, I have.  Nothing works better than Certain Dri to stop swamp arm in my opinion.  Degree I think does a good job of getting rid of the stink.  Finally, here is something that does it all everyone else seems to say.    Didn&#x27;t work for me.  The wetness was a little reduced in the beginning, didn&#x27;t last.  My issue was the stink.  I would sniff and say what the heck is that smell, only to find out it was me.  This does not work on reducing / preventing stanky arm at all.  I bought the silver bottles, will try those before I call it quits for good.    Try it, see if it works for you.  It didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It does work for me I&#x27;m just not crazy about roll-ons and it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I am sold on Nivea products.  This is my first Dry Impact Roll-on and I am very happy with it.  It goes on wet but dries quickly.  I thought it was going to be more of a dry product but turns out that it is wet and that isn&#x27;t a problem.  You just have to wait to put your shirt on for a few minutes.  Once it dries it seems to be effective all day long.  Very light fragrance which I like a lot as nothing worse than having your deodorant competing with your after shave lotion.  Nice size little bottles fit easily in an over night bag, good price, strong enough deodorant, light fragrance, smooth lotion, all in all I am very happy with this purchase and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li> Irritates my underarm.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Thank you.</li>
            <li> its expensive but like it !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant out there. My husband got hooked on it when we went to Germany and was quite upset when his bottle ran out. So we ordered more and it was just as great as he remembered.  The three pack is really convenient and each bottle lasts a very long time. It also has a very pleasant clean smell without being too overpowering.</li>
            <li> fast service and great price. what more does one need?</li>
            <li> Coming from the U.K I found US deodorants to be thick, not that effective and bad for staining clothing. How happy was I to find this Nivea for men roll-on on Amazon. It works really well, goes on easily and does not have the same issues with staining clothes. I buy in bulk so that I never run out. Brilliant.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this deodorant after months of trying many different things.  For some reason my armpits revolted against my normal deodorant that I have used for years.  Not a pretty sight or comfortable in the least!  Before finding this I used a deodorant stone, some cream stuff and every version of ultrasensitive deodorants I could find.  Yes, I tried both just deodorants and antiperspirants.  This stuff just plain works and doesn’t upset my, now, delicate underarm skin.</li>
            <li> There seem to be many many variations of this product and this one is not as good as some that I&#x27;ve purchased.  It will protect you, but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love it.  smells great, works all day.  I&#x27;ve purchased for me and my son everytime we run out.  Try it.  Even my spoiled wife wears it when I&#x27;m not looking just to have my smell on her.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the solid formula I bought while traveling in the Middle East but has replaced my go to antiperspirant from Old Spice clickable solid.</li>
            <li> As advertised...a little pricey, but can&#x27;t find anywhere else...no issues</li>
            <li> My daughter came to visit from Sweden and was using this as her roll-on and asked if i might like it. It has been my only deodorant since and I buy from Amazon regularly</li>
            <li> Very good roll-on antiperspirant, as good as the silver bullet Nivea which came from Brazil. It is as good&lt;br /&gt;a product as the product from a vendor in the UK that supposedly now will not ship roll-on deodorants.</li>
            <li> I got this product in Germany in an Aldi for less than 2 euro, and sometimes less than 1 euro each. They are the perfect size to carry in a backpack or on a place as it is under the TSA limit. They work, they&#x27;re small and portable. I always keep one or two around.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever... My husband uses it. I love the smell. I wish they could do something as good as this one for woman.</li>
            <li> as expected. shipping takes long.</li>
            <li> My Hubby loved this, he is soon out again and i have to order some more. he is very set on DEO&#x27;s but this one is the top one for him.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great, I don&#x27;t smell like sweat for real 24 hours. Also, it helps me in the gym to be less wet under my arms. It is a german product and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores, I have to buy it online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and since moving from Europe to the USA I order it online. It works for me.</li>
            <li> If I let it sit for a few days, I find myself shaking it so the marble catches the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;meh.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea products &amp; usually use Nivea for Men Invisible for Black &amp; White Power Deodorant Roll-on 50ml which works perfect. this time I got this one. Although it works for almost a day, but I can&#x27;t continue to buy it more. As it has aluminum that I&#x27;m allergic to!</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s deodorant made!  Truly 24 hour (or more) protection.  Goes on wet via a plastic roller, but dries very quickly.  Small glass, but strong, &amp;#34;bullet&amp;#34; shaped container - never had any issues travelling with it.  Subtle smell that fades quickly and does not interfere with aftershaves or colognes.  Used to bring back from business trips to Europe, but now stock up from Amazon!  Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for many years and prefers this over any other product available. We usually stock up on this when we are out of the US, so when he ran out he ordered more from Amazon, and it has worked out quite well.</li>
            <li> I am in MA, it comes from NJ. So it arrives very fast. Other than that it is Nivea. If you like Nivea then you like Nivea.</li>
            <li> The roll on idea is cool but it just becomes a sticky mess in my armpit. Even if I let it dry for 10 minutes, my shirts just stick to it. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I apologize for the 1 star,but Amazon wouldn&#x27;t allow me to award it a negative 5 stars which is what it really deserves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drawn to this product because of reviews that stated it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or leave white marks in your armpit. Those two facts are true, however I could as well have been applying tap water to my armpits as a deodorant because this thing simply doesn&#x27;t work as a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely will not ever be buying it again and I recommend you stay away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like applying tap water as a deodorant after taking a shower,  it won&#x27;t stain your clothes, but it won&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolute waste of hard earned $$ I bought a pack of 3 and I&#x27;ve trashed them all. To be honest, in my experience you&#x27;ll smell worse with this product that if you don&#x27;t use any deodorant in the first place.</li>
            <li> Soft on Skin (I have dry skin) and Strong. Works just as well as a similar version I used to buy in Spain and Costa Rica. Why oh why does Nivea not sell it&#x27;s best products in America???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we not deserving enough for you?</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant the first time when I was traveling on business in Europe and ran out of mine.  I have been hooked on it ever since and buy it every time I see it in Europe or elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a girl, and yes, I use this. And yes, it works wonderfully. And for the life of me I cannot understand why it&#x27;s not sold in USA stores.</li>
            <li> Works with the entire Nivea for Men product line--don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not available in stores in the US.</li>
            <li> This is the best deoderant I&#x27;ve used. The scent is subtle but decidedly masculine, the applicator feels durable and hefty, it&#x27;s not crazy expensive, it&#x27;s totally portable / dopp kit friendly... great deoderant. Pul the trigger.</li>
