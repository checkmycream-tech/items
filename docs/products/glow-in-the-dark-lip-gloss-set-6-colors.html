    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is actually pretty awesome...</li>
            <li>sure it glows in the bottle but does NOTHING on your lips!</li>
            <li>People are complaining about this product that it doesn&#x27;t work, if you read the directions and put it under a light for a while and take it off it will glow, my dad got this for me and it works great because I followed directions.</li>
            <li>I did manage to get it to glow by taking the tube apart so more could be taken out</li>
            <li>but u kind have to let em get sunlight or some sorta light inorder for them to work</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I put it up to light n</li>
            <li>They have to be under light for too long and the glow does not last more than a minute!!!  </li>
            <li>I even went so far as to put a light on my LIPS to see if that worked!</li>
            <li>When I first tried them this morning I was really upset because none of them worked at all.</li>
            <li>Three reasons why this lip gloss is pure crap:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>The purple still doesn&#x27;t glow much but if they have made this much progress in a day I think they will all work just fine soon enough.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even show up as a color on your lips no matter how much you put on.</li>
            <li>the gloss color doesn&#x27;t show up that much</li>
            <li>The green kind of does, but the rest don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and they work a little better each time.</li>
            <li>Then I exposed them to supper bright LED light and the green clear and yellow sort of worked and the blue pink and purple</li>
            <li>put it on and go in the dark it Dont light up.</li>
            <li>You could not see the lip glosses in the dark or in the light.</li>
            <li>They were basically clear.</li>
            <li>; I tried multiple colors, put the gloss under light for a long time only to find out</li>
            <li>Not in the dark and most assuredly  NOT under black  lights, not at all.</li>
            <li>Worse still, right after putting it on, both my daughters screeched &amp;#34;it&#x27;s burning!&amp;#34; They quickly wiped it off, but their lips turned red and looked irritated,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesnt really glow as expected.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li>I think the problem was that they had been in complete darkness for so long that the pigments started to lose their charging capacity.</li>
            <li>I really think it should just be labeled &amp;#34;Lip Gloss&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Glow in the Dark Lip Gloss&amp;#34;, because it definitely doesn&#x27;t glow.</li>

            <li> They have to be under light for too long and the glow does not last more than a minute!!!  Horrible purchase for me!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really glow in the dark.  The green kind of does, but the rest don&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> they do not glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Have not seen the glow. Gritty.</li>
            <li> Does not glow unless you put it under a lamp which does not last at all.</li>
            <li> Negative  stars...  This product does not glow at all. Not in the dark and most assuredly  NOT under black  lights, not at all. They don&#x27;t even show up as a color on your lips no matter how much you put on. A total waste of money.  Completely  disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesnt really glow as expected. Service was prompt, however. Item was just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT glow in the dark was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend used em for a while they do glow in the dark but u kind have to let em get sunlight or some sorta light inorder for them to work</li>
            <li> I made a mistake reading that one fake review saying it &amp;#34;works.&amp;#34; I tried multiple colors, put the gloss under light for a long time only to find out sure it glows in the bottle but does NOTHING on your lips! This is a scam!!! I even went so far as to put a light on my LIPS to see if that worked! I promise you this made me so so angry and if you buy these they will do the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> If it was up to me, I wouldn&#x27;t even give this Lip Gloss one star. The only reason I gave it two stars, was because it was sufficient lip gloss. I really think it should just be labeled &amp;#34;Lip Gloss&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Glow in the Dark Lip Gloss&amp;#34;, because it definitely doesn&#x27;t glow.</li>
            <li> did NOT glow!  what a waste of money.  do NOT purchase this product!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t glow in the dark!!!</li>
            <li> does not glow in the dark</li>
            <li> This lip gloss doesn&#x27;t glow at all once you put it on.  It glows when it&#x27;s in the tube, but once you apply it, it&#x27;s too thin to produce any glow.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the gloss color doesn&#x27;t show up that much</li>

            <li> You could not see the lip glosses in the dark or in the light. They were basically clear. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Amazon prime and got it a day eairly. When I first tried them this morning I was really upset because none of them worked at all. Then I exposed them to supper bright LED light and the green clear and yellow sort of worked and the blue pink and purple still didn&#x27;t work. I keep going back and trying and they work a little better each time. The pink now glows orange and the blue can be seen faintly from across the room. I think the problem was that they had been in complete darkness for so long that the pigments started to lose their charging capacity. The purple still doesn&#x27;t glow much but if they have made this much progress in a day I think they will all work just fine soon enough. I absolutely love them. They faintly tint your lips but it isn&#x27;t too noticeable until the lights are off. I would defiantly recommend getting a set.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work. waste of money!</li>
            <li> Three reasons why this lip gloss is pure crap:&lt;br /&gt;1. The lip gloss tubes took forever to arrive, and then when they finally did, they didn&#x27;t  work. At all. Not one single color in the multi-pack glowed in the dark. Not even the tiniest hint of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;2. Worse, the lip gloss had a weird bad chemical/dirty diaper smell.&lt;br /&gt;3. Worse still, right after putting it on, both my daughters screeched &amp;#34;it&#x27;s burning!&amp;#34; They quickly wiped it off, but their lips turned red and looked irritated,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My younger daughter had saved up her allowance to get these and she was very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews... Doesnt glow at all once on. Just lip gloss and not even a little color</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t glow at all, total waste of money :/ really made me sad..</li>
            <li> Does not glow on lips</li>
