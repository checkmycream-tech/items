            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I would love this stuff even if I didn&#x27;t have dandruff.</li>

            <li>I love shea butter, but it is even better in a shampoo.</li>
            <li>However, this Suave shampoo is AS good as ANY other shampoo I tried, and it is super inexpensive and lathers great smells great and leaves my hair super shiny.  </li>
            <li>couldn’t believe that this product had made such a huge difference… very happy with the performance of this product and will order again</li>

            <li>Wish Suave still offered original anti-dandruff shampoo and combo conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells great too and is safe for everyday usage.</li>
            <li>From the super medicated ones to the fancy salon brands.  </li>
            <li>Have a great regular shampoo that makes your hair shiny and soft, but you have to deal with dandruff&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair feels light, clean, and soft &amp; the flaking has stopped.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair responded very quickly.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it is much better than Nizorel.</li>
            <li>I fell immedicately in love with the conditioner and went back for the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite shampoo ever, and it along with the conditioner, actually seemed to work!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I noticed fewer flakes after the first use.</li>
            <li>so my scalp does not get too used to the product, but this is my more regular product.</li>
            <li>I had to double check the bottle and make sure I was using shampoo and not conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and wish I had found it a long time ago.</li>
            <li>It also treats my hair pretty well, so I am no worse off than nature made me.  </li>
            <li>Fast shopping.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I first bought the conditioner equivalent to this product because using H&amp;S was leaving my hair dry and brittle and full of electricity.  </li>
            <li>This works well and with the conditioner keeps my hair pretty soft.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other shampoo!</li>
            <li>My preteen/teen daughters use it as well as myself and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>To say I have been pleasantly surprised by the scent and the way these two products leave my hair would be so very understated.  </li>
            <li>It really is mild enough to use frequently and isn&#x27;t an overly drying product.  </li>
            <li>great for thick curly long hair does not strip your natural oils.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that after all of the expensive and highly recommended shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this inexspensive Suave Shampoo is hands down the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;a)Have a good anti-dandruff that makes your hair dry and dull</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, straight hair with the occasional winter \\&quot;snow flakes\\&quot; and I have tried so many different shampoos to help smooth my hair and make it shiny</li>
            <li>Love the smell and dandruff control of this shampoo, hard to find one that works and doesnt smell like &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoo</li>
            <li>it took several tries with various shampoos to find a shampoo that didnt require a whole lot of effort (wash rinse repeat repeat repeat..) and also showed a HUGE difference in flaking in just one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a major dry scalp problem that was even creating bald spots that fortunately are on the lower back scalp and can not be seen.  </li>
            <li>The smell is gross, and they make my curly, frizzy hair extra frizzy, which isn&#x27;t particularly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it is way less expensive than other options.  </li>
            <li>Precisely as expected,  arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>Sigh, sorry, not that effective.  </li>
            <li>its a serious spoon saver and that makes a huge difference in my day.</li>
            <li>My review is higher since it&#x27;s based solely on my personal experience, and not a true test of quality or general comment regarding effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>The only negative I can see so far is that it is not sold in regular stores, so I really hope amazon never stops selling it.</li>

            <li> Do not waste your money on any other dandruff shampoo, get this!</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and lots of flakes, I tried H&amp;S and it left my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and straighten it, the flat iron literally glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have spent an obscene amount of money on hair products and it is always the same issue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes away dry scalp and cleans without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i now tell all my neuro doctors and fellow patients with a limited number of spoons all about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft and no static.  </li>
            <li> I do occassionally use other dandruff products with different active ingredients</li>
            <li> Myself and both my sons have very dry scalp ... worked for me</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of when I was a kid and spent summer afternoons at the beach (with sunscreen).  </li>
            <li> worked almost miraculously on both of them … regular gal who cut their hair and had complained about their need to do something to clear up their dry scalp in the past</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other products work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy this for reasons other than just dandruff (which it helps with also).</li>
            <li> zinc pyrithione based shampoos, shampoos with coal tar, ketoconazole, sulfur as active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not a single complaint here!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a single negative comment about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been desperately seeking something like this for what feels like my whole life.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dandruff for years and have had trouble finding shampoos that work to control dandruff without leaving my hair feeling like straw.  </li>
            <li> I just felt like after a few uses it was drying my hair out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this Shampoo (with accompanying Conditioner) made my hair dry and limp.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried very expensive prescription shampoos, and nothing ever worked completely.  </li>
            <li> I mean ever.  </li>
            <li> And I mean like \\&quot;Heck</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of other dandruff shampoos and hated them, I figured I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> Really bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad to the point where I have tried everything-</li>
            <li> so needless to say my scalp got nasty.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dandruff.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> Myself and both my sons have very dry scalp ... worked for me so I had them try ... worked almost miraculously on both of them … regular gal who cut their hair and had complained about their need to do something to clear up their dry scalp in the past couldn’t believe that this product had made such a huge difference… very happy with the performance of this product and will order again</li>
            <li> Works better than any other shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing.  The smell reminds me of when I was a kid and spent summer afternoons at the beach (with sunscreen).  It also worked wonderfully.  My hair feels light, clean, and soft &amp; the flaking has stopped.  The price is pretty great as well.  I can&#x27;t think of a single negative comment about this product.  I bought the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> after brain surgery i couldnt wash my hair for weeks. and even then i avoided doing it because of the amount of pain involved. so needless to say my scalp got nasty. it took several tries with various shampoos to find a shampoo that didnt require a whole lot of effort (wash rinse repeat repeat repeat..) and also showed a HUGE difference in flaking in just one use.&lt;br /&gt;i now tell all my neuro doctors and fellow patients with a limited number of spoons all about this shampoo. its a serious spoon saver and that makes a huge difference in my day. thank you to suave! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work any different than any shampoo I have bought in the store. It does smell good!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I had a major dry scalp problem that was even creating bald spots that fortunately are on the lower back scalp and can not be seen.  My hairstylist was amazed at the condition of my scalp, she immediately noticed.  I had also started vitamin D supplements as I heard that could help.  So I believe I now have the perfect solution for me.  Thank you Suave!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that after all of the expensive and highly recommended shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this inexspensive Suave Shampoo is hands down the best I have ever used. I have spent an obscene amount of money on hair products and it is always the same issue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a)Have a good anti-dandruff that makes your hair dry and dull&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;b) Have a great regular shampoo that makes your hair shiny and soft, but you have to deal with dandruff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to use 2 different shampoos in one shower either. I have been desperately seeking something like this for what feels like my whole life. This shampoo is a relief for me because it provides everything I need in 1 bottle! I bought it on a whim and now I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Suave, please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product or I will be lost!</li>
            <li> Precisely as expected,  arrived very promptly. Would very likely order again. Wish Suave still offered original anti-dandruff shampoo and combo conditioner.</li>
            <li> First...it smells good...second...it works!  It really is mild enough to use frequently and isn&#x27;t an overly drying product.  My preteen/teen daughters use it as well as myself and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo ever. I mean ever.  I have tried all of them.  From the super medicated ones to the fancy salon brands.  Nothing has worked like this one.  And as a bonus, it smells great, doesn&#x27;t stain my stone shower, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Now if they would only start making it again.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product for its effectiveness and it&#x27;s price. Smells great too and is safe for everyday usage. Double thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price as well. Smells good and feels very good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this product.  Smells great, works great, my wife even loves how it has been working for her.  We&#x27;re sold!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and wish I had found it a long time ago. I found it when I was looking for Nizorel shampoo which I could no longer find in the stores. It was in suggested recommendations and had good reviews. Personally I think it is much better than Nizorel. I just received my 2nd order of it . The only negative I can see so far is that it is not sold in regular stores, so I really hope amazon never stops selling it.</li>
            <li> Fast shopping. Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It takes away dry scalp and cleans without drying out your hair. And it smells so delicious!</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used in years. My natural hair responded very quickly. It was clean without being stripped and the coconut/shea butter combo made my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> I first bought the conditioner equivalent to this product because using H&amp;S was leaving my hair dry and brittle and full of electricity.  I fell immedicately in love with the conditioner and went back for the shampoo.  To say I have been pleasantly surprised by the scent and the way these two products leave my hair would be so very understated.  Love it.  As good or better than anything at triple the price.  My hair is shiny and soft and no static.  Good job Suave!</li>
            <li> If anything it seems like I have more dandruff. I don&#x27;t know if other products work but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and dandruff control of this shampoo, hard to find one that works and doesnt smell like &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoo</li>
            <li> This was my favorite shampoo ever, and it along with the conditioner, actually seemed to work!  So, of course they seem to have discontinued it!  WHY???  Bring it back!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, straight hair with the occasional winter \\&quot;snow flakes\\&quot; and I have tried so many different shampoos to help smooth my hair and make it shiny and this is the only one (as of recently) that has made a big difference.  My hair is more managagable, softer and just looks healthier. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this for reasons other than just dandruff (which it helps with also). Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This product puts the \\&quot;poo\\&quot; in shampoo.  And I mean like \\&quot;Heck yeah!!  This [[ASIN:B00604MUWG Suave Scalp Solution AntiDandruff Conditioner, Nourishing Coconut and Shea Butter, 14.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] is the POO!!!!!!\\&quot;  See what I did there??!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ಠ_ಠ</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and lots of flakes, I tried H&amp;S and it left my hair dry and frizzy. I tried a bunch of other dandruff shampoos and hated them, I figured I would give this a shot. I use the shampoo and conditioner and I LOVE it. It leaves your hair so silky smooth and soft. No frizz and it smells yummy. It works on the dandruff too. I noticed fewer flakes after the first use. I blow dry my hair and straighten it, the flat iron literally glides through my hair. I would love this stuff even if I didn&#x27;t have dandruff. The price can&#x27;t be beat. Do not waste your money on any other dandruff shampoo, get this! I hope they never stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> great for thick curly long hair does not strip your natural oils. has coconut and shea butter which is great. smells great and worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dandruff for years and have had trouble finding shampoos that work to control dandruff without leaving my hair feeling like straw.  I have even tried several prescription products. This works well and with the conditioner keeps my hair pretty soft.  I do occassionally use other dandruff products with different active ingredients so my scalp does not get too used to the product, but this is my more regular product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand most dandruff shampoos.  The smell is gross, and they make my curly, frizzy hair extra frizzy, which isn&#x27;t particularly appreciated.  This stuff smells delicious and not like dandruff shampoo at all.  It also treats my hair pretty well, so I am no worse off than nature made me.  Best of all, it is way less expensive than other options.  Not a single complaint here!</li>
            <li> I had to double check the bottle and make sure I was using shampoo and not conditioner.  I love shea butter, but it is even better in a shampoo. It smells good too...I just felt like after a few uses it was drying my hair out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this based on all the great reviews.  Unfortunately this Shampoo (with accompanying Conditioner) made my hair dry and limp.  The product smells great and may be just fine for most.  My review is higher since it&#x27;s based solely on my personal experience, and not a true test of quality or general comment regarding effectiveness.  I didn&#x27;t want to give the product 2 stars with such a subjective criterion.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dandruff. Really bad.  Bad to the point where I have tried everything- zinc pyrithione based shampoos, shampoos with coal tar, ketoconazole, sulfur as active ingredients.  Ive tried very expensive prescription shampoos, and nothing ever worked completely.  Now, I am not going to tell you that this Suave shampoo cured me for life where everything else didnt.  Sigh, sorry, not that effective.  However, this Suave shampoo is AS good as ANY other shampoo I tried, and it is super inexpensive and lathers great smells great and leaves my hair super shiny.  So its not the perfect dandruff shampoo, but it is great, and for the price I think it cant be beat.</li>
