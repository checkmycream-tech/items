            <li>This stuff really IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>And it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Applies beautifully and looks very believable.</li>
            <li>The most perfect tanning bronzer.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and more moisturizing with a gradual Tan just as product claims.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, too!  </li>
            <li>Though it smells good, even after a week there is no noticeable skin color change (or firming which it is also supposed to do.)  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your palms tan which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all this lotion smells really good when applying.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and smells good, but</li>
            <li>So, as a lotion it works good...makes my skin very smooth and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>love this lotion, works great, feels great on skin and is not greasy at all, visible firming  over time, love it</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and the prices on Amazon are great</li>
            <li>IAM VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Regardless, I love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and LOVE it!.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li>Definitely a better buy!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and it feels lovely on the skin.</li>
            <li>Love it, gives nice color with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using a gradual tanner AT ALL, just moisturizing with this amazing light-weight scented lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I do like to have a nice color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a nice tropical scent.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really nice after using it too.</li>
            <li>I got this a week before an event, thinking I could work up a nice glow by the date.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a product to maintain a glow.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY NICE.</li>
            <li>My skin is on the fairer side and this lotion is moisturizing and adds a nice, warm color.  </li>
            <li>Okay with this product I noticed it makes me smell good.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell going on</li>
            <li>The scent is also really nice - a kind of coconutty-beachy-hemp scent.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin which does not tan easily.</li>
            <li>Just  a light and pleasant  </li>
            <li>And the reason I love it is because it&#x27;s some of the best color I&#x27;ve gotten from any tanner, let alone a gradual, super easy tanner like this.</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells good, works good, but they didn&#x27;t pack it very well and the top broke.  </li>
            <li>This product should be propagated more cuz it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the nice tan</li>
            <li>I work inside most of my day, so this provides a nice hint of tan</li>
            <li>No streaks, real looking tan, and it SMELLS GOOD!</li>
            <li>Love it, bronzing, firming, moisturizing,  what more do you need?  </li>
            <li>This smells much better than Jergins</li>
            <li>and I think it works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>have been using self-tanning lotions for 24 years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I love thesmell, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>Love all of hemp lotion products.</li>
            <li>This product is much better...</li>
            <li>love this stuff, have been using it for 2 years.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Where I love it rains about 8 months out of the year</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work better than the Jergen&#x27;s in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>.... love it</li>
            <li>It moisturizes the skin, but takes many uses to see any tanning.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the smell of hemp lotions.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many brands, if not all, and in ALL formats, lotions, foam, oil, spray, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash your hands well after applying it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and how moisturized it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li>Buy it! :)</li>
            <li>I love the lotion.  </li>
            <li>2016- Going to buy more of this.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this to use and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>The smell is OK, better than Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice golden glow without turning u orange!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and gives me really fast, pretty color.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>However I do not think I will be able to use it because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice (not obnoxious) coconut/almond kind of smell that I really like, so I put this on after my shower before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>It gives a really nice colour and after 3 days it is dark, make sure you exfoliate before application and WASH YOUR HANDS really good because it stains those!</li>
            <li>Would be a better product if it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Great for early tanning season</li>
            <li>This does not turn you orange however make sure you wash your hands after applying and put on joints lightly.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice golden glow over about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and burn easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy.</li>
            <li>and the fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and was easy to rub in and did not leave any marks.</li>
            <li>I bought it from the raging reviews online and the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like fresh bananas and never gets that burnt smell like so many others.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m too cheap to go tanning.</li>
            <li>First it is a lot cheaper at wal mart and for the price you get more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I am on day 3 now, and true to the product claim, my skin is a very healthy NATURAL light-tanned shade!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in skin color after two uses, and haven&#x27;t had a good chance to use it every day to see how dark I can get, but as of right now, I have 4 uses (since I lost all my color from going on vacation and forgetting to bring it with me) and have a good golden glow.</li>
            <li>I felt like I would need 3-4 coats to get a good, even, nice color on my legs (which seem to take longer to get dark, probably because they are the whitest part of my body, never seeing the sun EVER), but for face, upper body and back, this color and application is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it gives a well blended color that is not too orangy and the smell is nice, well worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t wash my hands good enough,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fairly tan on my arms and white everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Not a total loss because it is a good moisturizer, but</li>
            <li>The color of my &amp;#34; tan &amp;#34; appears to be believable as a &amp;#34; real sun tan &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool because this is SO easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li>SO now I have to take the lid off to use it, which is just a mild inconvience</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t get the orange spots on my hands if I didn&#x27;t rinse them super well, just a quick rinse and no worries.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t a reddish tan, like a real tan would be--it&#x27;s more golden.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for quick color, I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a light golden tan, not orangey, very natural.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t appear to get as dark as advertised on the bottle (which I didn&#x27;t expect), it did seem to even out my farmer&#x27;s tan which I&#x27;m happy about.  </li>
            <li>The best color still comes from airbrush tanning, but for at home purposes, if I take a few days to layera few coats of self tanner, I get a really good result.</li>
            <li>That being said, I gladly suffer the dry skin when I find a product that gives me color that looks realistic and is fairly forgiving.</li>
            <li>This product gave me a pretty nice natural glow after three days.</li>
            <li>But I kept noticing this strong cinnamon smell that I didn&#x27;t really noticed while I put the lotion on.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this during the summer!</li>
            <li>This lotion helped moisturize my dry winter skin and build up a nice light to medium tan.  </li>
            <li>Worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>For about $6 I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; Golden Glow for years</li>
            <li>A lot like jergen&#x27;s natural glow but more product for your $$$.</li>
            <li>THEN AFTERWARDS I MOISTURIZED WITH THIS HEMP GOLDEN GLOW LOTION.</li>
            <li>they only have it in the warm months....</li>
            <li>, cuz right now, I really do look fabulous.</li>
            <li>but I have to put my nose right up to my skin to smell it.</li>
            <li>Wow, that&#x27;s a pretty crafty marketing technique!</li>
            <li>Has a great smell but does have a small &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell</li>
            <li>so we don&#x27;t get a nice long summer</li>
            <li>and I also think I may be allergic to DHA (every time I use a tan lotion, my skin gets extremely itchy for days after!), and also because I&#x27;ve always loved hemp oil for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how nice and thick the lotion is, the smell is tropical, and it gives just the right amount of color - not fake looking, and yet it shows.  </li>
            <li>I wear it for a total of 9 hours and after 9 hours the smell is still very light.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little coconut which is good.</li>
            <li>I use this to up keep my fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li>I wish I could rate this higher than five stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first self tanner and couldn&#x27;t afford tanning sessions</li>
            <li>It also turned very orange around the crease there!</li>
            <li>The one that was shipped separately arrive first</li>
            <li>Thanks Malibu Tan!</li>
            <li>My natural tone is on the light end of medium.</li>
            <li>Let me first tell you, I am not that into selftanners to begin with, let alone even moisturising my body</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to get suuuuper dark using it, but it gives a great natural looking &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>But, I do think it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>orange the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>hahaha!</li>
            <li>My faves now are Fake Bake Flawless and this.</li>
            <li>This is the first day I have used this product so I can not attest to how well it does as a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>WELL, let me first say, WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I am super white and after say four I start noticing me getting a light tan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a self tanner until way later, which is better than the whole time.</li>
            <li>have never used self-tanning lotion before, but after not getting a tan at all last summer, and the fact that it takes me literally every day outside in the sun to get to a good color</li>
            <li>Just one coat actually gives me a good baseline color, and two or three coats makes me feel like I can actually go out in tank tops and shorts, which I NEVER do.</li>
            <li>One good thing is the color is natural and it doesn&#x27;t stain the knees as easily as other brands.</li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve used will last several days, but this is an every day use or every other day at best.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy like a regular lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so fair, but the color was also very orange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with lotions and self tanners.</li>
            <li>AT ALL - really and truly</li>
            <li>And as farm as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; that&#x27;s an absolute NO lamp but just for the hydrating fact I&#x27;d buy it again and again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into the whole tanning thing, I never go to tanning beds or anything</li>
            <li>This is 4.97 at Walmart and it really works.</li>
            <li>AND NOW IAM SWIMSUIT READY.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that in areas I don&#x27;t rub it in as well, it gets darker quicker than areas that I really rub it</li>
            <li>I normally am very pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gonna be a real pain when I start getting to the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It dries on my skin really fast, literally in a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>Help keep my skin very moisturized as well.</li>
            <li>The lotion is much thinner</li>
            <li>I can usually see a difference after about 3 uses, but make sure you wash your hands because I notice the skin around my fingers gets dark if I don&#x27;t wash them good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is my new go-to for very very fast, convenient self-tanning.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer Fake Bake for my legs because I have found full-fledged self-tanners seem to give my chalky legs a more realistic tone than any gradual tanners.</li>
            <li>This product does not leave an orange residue or streaks and does not smell like most other gradual tanners.</li>
            <li>ALL I KNOW is that I look fabulous and about a hundred times better than with any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, high or low end.</li>
            <li>ALL I KNOW is that I look fabulous and about a hundred times better than with any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, high or low end.</li>
            <li>Imagine my pleasant surprise after finding this giant bottle of lotion w/ about 5 or 6 different essential oils in it!</li>
            <li>I am a pretty pale person and it builds gradual, believable color.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does - gradual, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I just rub it in really well like any normal lotion.</li>
            <li>I just love this hands down</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s the main reason why I purchased this from Walmart.</li>
            <li>firming part does not mean you can skip your diet and eat pizza 7 times a week.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, adding moisture to you skin and absolutely no streaking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time to sit in the sun to get a natural tan and sitting in the sun</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>but that is normal for all tanning lotions</li>
            <li>It really has helped my dry skin, which was pretty flaky, and the tan color looks real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind afraid to use it on my face because I break out easily, but it says it doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
            <li>My suggestion if you use this product, on a busy schedule where you end up working out rub a wet towel around lightly so that it won&#x27;t effect your output.</li>
            <li>but then looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact opposite for me!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as white as the day I first applied it.</li>
            <li>and my skin is SO LOOK soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>It actually smells exactly like the bombshell tingling tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would actually rather say that my facial skin has gotten BETTER if that&#x27;s possible?!</li>
            <li>THIS one is the shizzle!eakout (and I have REALLY sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to any type of scented lotion!)</li>
            <li>I would actually rather say that my facial skin has gotten BETTER if that&#x27;s possible?!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time just on my legs as I wanted to test it out before using it on my entire body.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor to it and also has a little tint to it</li>
            <li>Malibu Hemp is also very moisturizing and will not dry out your skin!</li>
            <li>MY TAN IS DEEP AND DARK WITH A HEALTHY GLOW.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it smells good, but within hours you get that gross fake tanner smell going.</li>
            <li>have never had a problem with the color being uneven or staining hands (and sometimes I just put the Hemp tanner on my legs and then go straight to my non-tanning hemp lotion for my arms and just a quick rinse of my hands and no problems)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And for some reason, it refuses to tan certain parts of my body such as my face, the folds of my knees and arms, and chest (my boobs and underneath them).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>My husband says it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>People are surprised when I tell them what I buy and the price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how naturally tanned I am.</li>
            <li>I was so overjoyed to have heard of this stuff, because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this in the stores and have been using it for a couple of years it gives an amazingly natural tan not orange or streaky</li>
            <li>I like this product so much that I (who purchase EVERYTHING from Amazon, but who never leave reviews) am giving it five stars and actually writing a review.</li>
            <li>Freckled and sensitive and prone to sunburns.</li>
            <li>But it works more slowly than that.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it&#x27;s a thick lotion that gradually does build a believable tan.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t tan I was looking for a good lotion to use along with my fake bake sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>/hands an ugly orange even after washing my hands good right after appliance.</li>
            <li>The only negative ive ever experienced is sometimes it makes my legs itch which ive read happens with other self tanner as well.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the new bottle had a different color label, but just figured the company was going for a new look.</li>
            <li>It is a subtle glow not over the top.</li>
            <li>so amazon is my only option,  even if it&#x27;s high priced.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day after a shower, and now finally after about 2 weeks I do have a nice golden color, just enough so it does not look fake.</li>
            <li>This self-tanner is like no other when it comes to the scent!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re already tan it will give you that golden dark Beyonc&amp;eacute; glow.</li>
            <li>I tend to just burn in the summer then the little tan I do get it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells good, like the consistency, did not seem to make my fake tan last any longer</li>
            <li>, I forgot to mention in my review that I use this daily on my face also, and have not had the slightest tendency towards a breakout (and I have REALLY sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to any type of scented lotion!)</li>
            <li>I got mine at Walmart for like $5, so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend so much on it.</li>
            <li>It gradually builds a tan, so you don&#x27;t really have to be extremely careful in putting it on because there&#x27;s no streaking.  </li>
            <li>simply the most common use of this is to simply avoid the tanning bed</li>
            <li>As far as the self tanning I have no idea because I tan daily</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, I actually like it.  </li>
            <li>I was rather irritated when I began to lose my tan that I had developed using the Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; I had purchased locally.</li>
            <li>It can get you pretty dark</li>
            <li>you accidentally put the wrong amount on, since the DHA reacts with the skin its very easy to grab a towel at the store and just rub off on your neckline or arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so first of all I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time ordering it online, unless you have no access to a Walmart in your neighborhood.  </li>
            <li>I used it several times to cut down the time needed overall in the tanning bed when I just wish to be a certain shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this at a certain department store a few years ago and have been using it ever since.  </li>

            <li> Smells wonderful and more moisturizing with a gradual Tan just as product claims.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, too!  </li>
            <li> Though it smells good, even after a week there is no noticeable skin color change (or firming which it is also supposed to do.)  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your palms tan which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all this lotion smells really good when applying.</li>

            <li> IAM VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Regardless, I love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and LOVE it!.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li> Definitely a better buy!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, and it feels lovely on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it, gives nice color with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using a gradual tanner AT ALL, just moisturizing with this amazing light-weight scented lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> but I do like to have a nice color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a nice tropical scent.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really nice after using it too.</li>
            <li> I got this a week before an event, thinking I could work up a nice glow by the date.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have a product to maintain a glow.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY NICE.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the fairer side and this lotion is moisturizing and adds a nice, warm color.  </li>
            <li> Okay with this product I noticed it makes me smell good.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell going on</li>
            <li> The scent is also really nice - a kind of coconutty-beachy-hemp scent.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin which does not tan easily.</li>
            <li> Just  a light and pleasant  </li>
            <li> And the reason I love it is because it&#x27;s some of the best color I&#x27;ve gotten from any tanner, let alone a gradual, super easy tanner like this.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, works good, but they didn&#x27;t pack it very well and the top broke.  </li>
            <li> This product should be propagated more cuz it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the nice tan</li>
            <li> I work inside most of my day, so this provides a nice hint of tan</li>
            <li> No streaks, real looking tan, and it SMELLS GOOD!</li>
            <li> Love it, bronzing, firming, moisturizing,  what more do you need?  </li>
            <li> This smells much better than Jergins</li>
            <li> and I think it works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> have been using self-tanning lotions for 24 years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I love thesmell, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Love all of hemp lotion products.</li>
            <li> This product is much better...</li>
            <li> love this stuff, have been using it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Where I love it rains about 8 months out of the year</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work better than the Jergen&#x27;s in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> .... love it</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the skin, but takes many uses to see any tanning.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the smell of hemp lotions.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many brands, if not all, and in ALL formats, lotions, foam, oil, spray, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash your hands well after applying it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how moisturized it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li> Buy it! :)</li>
            <li> I love the lotion.  </li>
            <li> 2016- Going to buy more of this.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this to use and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> The smell is OK, better than Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice golden glow without turning u orange!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and gives me really fast, pretty color.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> However I do not think I will be able to use it because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice (not obnoxious) coconut/almond kind of smell that I really like, so I put this on after my shower before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> It gives a really nice colour and after 3 days it is dark, make sure you exfoliate before application and WASH YOUR HANDS really good because it stains those!</li>
            <li> Would be a better product if it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Great for early tanning season</li>
            <li> This does not turn you orange however make sure you wash your hands after applying and put on joints lightly.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice golden glow over about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and burn easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy.</li>
            <li> and the fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and was easy to rub in and did not leave any marks.</li>
            <li> I bought it from the raging reviews online and the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like fresh bananas and never gets that burnt smell like so many others.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m too cheap to go tanning.</li>
            <li> First it is a lot cheaper at wal mart and for the price you get more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am on day 3 now, and true to the product claim, my skin is a very healthy NATURAL light-tanned shade!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in skin color after two uses, and haven&#x27;t had a good chance to use it every day to see how dark I can get, but as of right now, I have 4 uses (since I lost all my color from going on vacation and forgetting to bring it with me) and have a good golden glow.</li>
            <li> I felt like I would need 3-4 coats to get a good, even, nice color on my legs (which seem to take longer to get dark, probably because they are the whitest part of my body, never seeing the sun EVER), but for face, upper body and back, this color and application is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it gives a well blended color that is not too orangy and the smell is nice, well worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t wash my hands good enough,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly tan on my arms and white everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Not a total loss because it is a good moisturizer, but</li>
            <li> The color of my &amp;#34; tan &amp;#34; appears to be believable as a &amp;#34; real sun tan &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool because this is SO easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li> SO now I have to take the lid off to use it, which is just a mild inconvience</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t get the orange spots on my hands if I didn&#x27;t rinse them super well, just a quick rinse and no worries.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t a reddish tan, like a real tan would be--it&#x27;s more golden.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for quick color, I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a light golden tan, not orangey, very natural.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t appear to get as dark as advertised on the bottle (which I didn&#x27;t expect), it did seem to even out my farmer&#x27;s tan which I&#x27;m happy about.  </li>
            <li> The best color still comes from airbrush tanning, but for at home purposes, if I take a few days to layera few coats of self tanner, I get a really good result.</li>
            <li> That being said, I gladly suffer the dry skin when I find a product that gives me color that looks realistic and is fairly forgiving.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a pretty nice natural glow after three days.</li>
            <li> But I kept noticing this strong cinnamon smell that I didn&#x27;t really noticed while I put the lotion on.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this during the summer!</li>
            <li> This lotion helped moisturize my dry winter skin and build up a nice light to medium tan.  </li>
            <li> Worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> For about $6 I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; Golden Glow for years</li>
            <li> A lot like jergen&#x27;s natural glow but more product for your $$$.</li>
            <li> THEN AFTERWARDS I MOISTURIZED WITH THIS HEMP GOLDEN GLOW LOTION.</li>
            <li> they only have it in the warm months....</li>
            <li> , cuz right now, I really do look fabulous.</li>
            <li> but I have to put my nose right up to my skin to smell it.</li>
            <li> Wow, that&#x27;s a pretty crafty marketing technique!</li>
            <li> Has a great smell but does have a small &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell</li>
            <li> so we don&#x27;t get a nice long summer</li>
            <li> and I also think I may be allergic to DHA (every time I use a tan lotion, my skin gets extremely itchy for days after!), and also because I&#x27;ve always loved hemp oil for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love how nice and thick the lotion is, the smell is tropical, and it gives just the right amount of color - not fake looking, and yet it shows.  </li>
            <li> I wear it for a total of 9 hours and after 9 hours the smell is still very light.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little coconut which is good.</li>
            <li> I use this to up keep my fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this higher than five stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first self tanner and couldn&#x27;t afford tanning sessions</li>
            <li> It also turned very orange around the crease there!</li>
            <li> The one that was shipped separately arrive first</li>
            <li> Thanks Malibu Tan!</li>
            <li> My natural tone is on the light end of medium.</li>
            <li> Let me first tell you, I am not that into selftanners to begin with, let alone even moisturising my body</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to get suuuuper dark using it, but it gives a great natural looking &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> But, I do think it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> orange the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> hahaha!</li>
            <li> My faves now are Fake Bake Flawless and this.</li>
            <li> This is the first day I have used this product so I can not attest to how well it does as a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> WELL, let me first say, WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I am super white and after say four I start noticing me getting a light tan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like a self tanner until way later, which is better than the whole time.</li>
            <li> have never used self-tanning lotion before, but after not getting a tan at all last summer, and the fact that it takes me literally every day outside in the sun to get to a good color</li>
            <li> Just one coat actually gives me a good baseline color, and two or three coats makes me feel like I can actually go out in tank tops and shorts, which I NEVER do.</li>
            <li> One good thing is the color is natural and it doesn&#x27;t stain the knees as easily as other brands.</li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve used will last several days, but this is an every day use or every other day at best.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy like a regular lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so fair, but the color was also very orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with lotions and self tanners.</li>
            <li> AT ALL - really and truly</li>
            <li> And as farm as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; that&#x27;s an absolute NO lamp but just for the hydrating fact I&#x27;d buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into the whole tanning thing, I never go to tanning beds or anything</li>
            <li> This is 4.97 at Walmart and it really works.</li>
            <li> AND NOW IAM SWIMSUIT READY.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that in areas I don&#x27;t rub it in as well, it gets darker quicker than areas that I really rub it</li>
            <li> I normally am very pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gonna be a real pain when I start getting to the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It dries on my skin really fast, literally in a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li> Help keep my skin very moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> The lotion is much thinner</li>
            <li> I can usually see a difference after about 3 uses, but make sure you wash your hands because I notice the skin around my fingers gets dark if I don&#x27;t wash them good.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is my new go-to for very very fast, convenient self-tanning.</li>
            <li> I think I prefer Fake Bake for my legs because I have found full-fledged self-tanners seem to give my chalky legs a more realistic tone than any gradual tanners.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave an orange residue or streaks and does not smell like most other gradual tanners.</li>
            <li> ALL I KNOW is that I look fabulous and about a hundred times better than with any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, high or low end.</li>
            <li> ALL I KNOW is that I look fabulous and about a hundred times better than with any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, high or low end.</li>
            <li> Imagine my pleasant surprise after finding this giant bottle of lotion w/ about 5 or 6 different essential oils in it!</li>
            <li> I am a pretty pale person and it builds gradual, believable color.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does - gradual, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I just rub it in really well like any normal lotion.</li>
            <li> I just love this hands down</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s the main reason why I purchased this from Walmart.</li>
            <li> firming part does not mean you can skip your diet and eat pizza 7 times a week.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, adding moisture to you skin and absolutely no streaking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time to sit in the sun to get a natural tan and sitting in the sun</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but that is normal for all tanning lotions</li>
            <li> It really has helped my dry skin, which was pretty flaky, and the tan color looks real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind afraid to use it on my face because I break out easily, but it says it doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
            <li> My suggestion if you use this product, on a busy schedule where you end up working out rub a wet towel around lightly so that it won&#x27;t effect your output.</li>
            <li> but then looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact opposite for me!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as white as the day I first applied it.</li>
            <li> and my skin is SO LOOK soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> It actually smells exactly like the bombshell tingling tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would actually rather say that my facial skin has gotten BETTER if that&#x27;s possible?!</li>
            <li> THIS one is the shizzle!eakout (and I have REALLY sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to any type of scented lotion!)</li>
            <li> I would actually rather say that my facial skin has gotten BETTER if that&#x27;s possible?!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time just on my legs as I wanted to test it out before using it on my entire body.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor to it and also has a little tint to it</li>
            <li> Malibu Hemp is also very moisturizing and will not dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> MY TAN IS DEEP AND DARK WITH A HEALTHY GLOW.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it smells good, but within hours you get that gross fake tanner smell going.</li>
            <li> have never had a problem with the color being uneven or staining hands (and sometimes I just put the Hemp tanner on my legs and then go straight to my non-tanning hemp lotion for my arms and just a quick rinse of my hands and no problems)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And for some reason, it refuses to tan certain parts of my body such as my face, the folds of my knees and arms, and chest (my boobs and underneath them).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My husband says it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> People are surprised when I tell them what I buy and the price.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how naturally tanned I am.</li>
            <li> I was so overjoyed to have heard of this stuff, because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores and have been using it for a couple of years it gives an amazingly natural tan not orange or streaky</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I (who purchase EVERYTHING from Amazon, but who never leave reviews) am giving it five stars and actually writing a review.</li>
            <li> Freckled and sensitive and prone to sunburns.</li>
            <li> But it works more slowly than that.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, it&#x27;s a thick lotion that gradually does build a believable tan.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t tan I was looking for a good lotion to use along with my fake bake sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> /hands an ugly orange even after washing my hands good right after appliance.</li>
            <li> The only negative ive ever experienced is sometimes it makes my legs itch which ive read happens with other self tanner as well.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the new bottle had a different color label, but just figured the company was going for a new look.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle glow not over the top.</li>
            <li> so amazon is my only option,  even if it&#x27;s high priced.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day after a shower, and now finally after about 2 weeks I do have a nice golden color, just enough so it does not look fake.</li>
            <li> This self-tanner is like no other when it comes to the scent!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re already tan it will give you that golden dark Beyonc&amp;eacute; glow.</li>
            <li> I tend to just burn in the summer then the little tan I do get it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells good, like the consistency, did not seem to make my fake tan last any longer</li>
            <li> , I forgot to mention in my review that I use this daily on my face also, and have not had the slightest tendency towards a breakout (and I have REALLY sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to any type of scented lotion!)</li>
            <li> I got mine at Walmart for like $5, so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend so much on it.</li>
            <li> It gradually builds a tan, so you don&#x27;t really have to be extremely careful in putting it on because there&#x27;s no streaking.  </li>
            <li> simply the most common use of this is to simply avoid the tanning bed</li>
            <li> As far as the self tanning I have no idea because I tan daily</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, I actually like it.  </li>
            <li> I was rather irritated when I began to lose my tan that I had developed using the Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; I had purchased locally.</li>
            <li> It can get you pretty dark</li>
            <li> you accidentally put the wrong amount on, since the DHA reacts with the skin its very easy to grab a towel at the store and just rub off on your neckline or arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so first of all I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time ordering it online, unless you have no access to a Walmart in your neighborhood.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times to cut down the time needed overall in the tanning bed when I just wish to be a certain shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this at a certain department store a few years ago and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands and wait for it to get pretty dry, and then I can go about my day as usual.</li>
            <li> I went through half a bottle of the Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; I purchased through Amazon before my tan was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The dry skin around a couple of my fingers is the only place that appears orangeish.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it goes RIGHT into the skin, and I mean, super-fast!</li>
            <li> The small is not bad at all, I have been trying to find a good moisturizer with a bronzer that I actually could wear without the horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> and ive been buying this at walmart for as long as ive been using it and its like $6</li>
            <li> The bronzing is gradual and as long as you keep your hands washed after applying then you won&#x27;t look orange.  </li>
            <li> Since I apply it at night, I smell like a waffle house all night long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me to stay tanned all summer long.</li>
            <li> It was in the regular lotion section, not with the other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday starting in the spring all the way til September as my daily lotion.  </li>
            <li> Other tan lotions (like Banana Boat, L&#x27;oreal, Jergens) work much better for getting color, but I can&#x27;t use them because of my sensitive skin :(  </li>
            <li> - I would take a cloth and wipe in these creases so it doesn&#x27;t get extra dark discoloration.  </li>
            <li> People refer this stuff as coconut smelling but honestly It smells just as awful as that dead skin smell right after stepping out of a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> and I only went through half a bottle in one summer.</li>
            <li> It slowly adds a bit of color to you and it looks totally natural!</li>
            <li> I know my husband will hate it because of the smell more so because he is allergic to cinnamon!</li>
            <li> My legs always are white and I wanted them a little darker so as not to wear stockings.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad (I have tried so many self tanning).  </li>
            <li> This one has a delicate coconut smell and is clear, and my skin gradually looks tanner without the orange color.</li>
            <li> Careful on the elbows, wrists, heel, knee&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Does work as expected.</li>
            <li> , so I figured, it&#x27;s only a few bucks, can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> In fact I came here to review the product since I don&#x27;t think I need to move brands like other cases when using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wedding photos will look lovely :(</li>
            <li> I usually can get it locally, but this year I did not stock up before the rush for spring tanning started.</li>
            <li> I have discarded that bottle and started using one of the other three I purchased.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other lotion but this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like any other self-tanner lotion I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li> and you just have to wait a few minutes for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Like a sheer light coconuty almondy scent, that is NOT over-bearing one bit, cuz I hate that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very dry, so self-tanners often leave me feeling dried out because of the alcohol in them.</li>
            <li> This lotion has that great subtle hemp scent to it and as the day goes on it stays very subtle without turning to that unpleasant tanning lotion smell you get from other</li>
            <li> Also wash your hands and between fingers after you&#x27;ve spread all over - or it tends to get too dark and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets you as dark as it claims</li>
            <li> and I am and already was dark when I started using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super dark and you should apply it every day</li>
            <li> Your tan will go away if you stop using after a few days so to maintain I would put on every other day or every two days...</li>
            <li> which is why I rated it less then</li>
            <li> I buy this at walmart for less than $6</li>
            <li> I have a little roll when I sit down.</li>
            <li> , it is reasonly priced,i like the little color it gives you,</li>
            <li> I even have a little bit of a headache from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this  everyday for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, I have the look I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF THE LABEL ON THE BOTTLE IS GREEN.</li>
            <li> I personally am a natural red-head and have a difficult time tanning during the summer months.</li>
            <li> so it was a bit messy</li>
            <li> As it dried and I got dressed and went along my routine</li>
            <li> I am very very pale with dark hair and eyes, but with the skin of a redhead.</li>
            <li> After about 1-2 hours you can smell a very slight sunless tanner smell</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m talking very, very slight.  </li>
            <li> and I feel hotter than usual because my sweating is off from using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only place I could ever find it, and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually get it when it&#x27;s almost summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough for me because I do t want to look fake.</li>
            <li> Now that I discovered this product I don&#x27;t have to go lay out in the sun everyday!</li>
            <li> NO MORE THEN 2 X A WEEK.</li>
            <li> actually makes me feel ill.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend money fake baking or getting a spray tan, so this was my last resort.  </li>
            <li> so it seemed to help my fake tan last longer.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely not orange and no one would think I looked fake or overdone with this.</li>
            <li> All the others are dyes and make my skin orange, and they&#x27;re usually loaded with obnoxious perfume.</li>
            <li> After 4 days of not applying when I went on vacation, I had a few very small spotchy patches, and my bikini rubbed the color off on my ribs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that I paid such a high price for something that did not do what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the old self tanners with that horrible smell that reeks if a phony tan.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other tanners, but it doesn&#x27;t tan as dark either.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only bad thing I have to say-&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> so sometimes I would wake up with creases on the elbows or behind the knees.</li>
            <li> cuz I was afraid it would be greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell as bad as other tanning lotions when it has been on your body.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I have not tried this without a secondary artificial tanning product</li>
            <li> so i dont know why it is so expensive here</li>
            <li> If you use self-tanning lotions you know that weird almost coppery smell that you can get from them.  </li>
            <li> but when it soaks in it does have a faint self tanner smell</li>
            <li> Spring is here and I wanted to kick-start my look with some fake colour.</li>
            <li> SO, I was skeptical to this moisturizer</li>
            <li> I was previously using Jergen&#x27;s skin firming, gradual self Tanner but the smell of that was horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate residue or thick greasy lotions, but this one is so light-weight that I can dress almost immediately!</li>
            <li> self tanner lotion can be used on days you can&#x27;t get to the tanning bed if your afraid of losing you already built up tan.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m mad about that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four days now and no sign of bronzing just a bad after smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me too bad since I wear it at night to bed and not during the day, but my husband said it stunk.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT SO BAD.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s crazy!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s crazy!</li>
            <li> I really hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated :(</li>
            <li> It smells real bad and it works</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this to up keep my fake bake flawless. As you know after you sunless tan you need to MOISTURIZE MOISTURIZE MOISTURIZE. It gives you a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before - purchased at Walmart, but couldn&#x27;t find it this year.  I love how nice and thick the lotion is, the smell is tropical, and it gives just the right amount of color - not fake looking, and yet it shows.  Careful on the elbows, wrists, heel, knee&#x27;s - I would take a cloth and wipe in these creases so it doesn&#x27;t get extra dark discoloration.  Also wash your hands and between fingers after you&#x27;ve spread all over - or it tends to get too dark and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion since i was 14 and im 23 now. It has always worked great. When i use it people ask if ive been to a tanning bed it gets me that tan. Just make sure to use it everyday. I always use it at night so the color develops while im sleeping. The only negative ive ever experienced is sometimes it makes my legs itch which ive read happens with other self tanner as well. Oh yeah and ive been buying this at walmart for as long as ive been using it and its like $6</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It slowly adds a bit of color to you and it looks totally natural! No orange dorito-tan here! Although, I would recommend getting it somewhere else. I got mine at Walmart for like $5, so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend so much on it. Regardless, I love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with lotions and self tanners. This lotion is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling sticky. I have a problem with smells from self tanners but not with this. I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets you as dark as it claims but I definitely do get some color from it. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would recommend this as a maintenance lotion. I gave it 4 stars because of the cost. I found this at Walmart for under $6.</li>
            <li> Applies beautifully and looks very believable. Use this and save yourself from sun and age spots by baking in the sun.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here, I went to Walmart and bought this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and LOVE it!.  I&#x27;m very fair and wanted something to ease me into the spring.  This lotion helped moisturize my dry winter skin and build up a nice light to medium tan.  The biggest thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a self-tanner AT ALL - really and truly (I&#x27;ve tried others that said that and I could still smell that self-tanner yucky smell).  This product has a nice (not obnoxious) coconut/almond kind of smell that I really like, so I put this on after my shower before I go to bed.  There is no bronzer-color in it, so doesn&#x27;t come off on the sheets.  By morning, the smell has faded and I don&#x27;t even have to wash it off.  It gradually builds a tan, so you don&#x27;t really have to be extremely careful in putting it on because there&#x27;s no streaking.  I also use this on my face, because it has nothing that will clog your pores.  You just have to use it every day.  This lotion will also be great to use after using a self-tanner to keep yourself moisturized and prolong the self-tanner.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells good, like the consistency, did not seem to make my fake tan last any longer which is why I rated it less then 5-star. I have not tried this without a secondary artificial tanning product so I cannot testify if it works well as a gradual tanner</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart for $5. YES THIS DOES WORK! I noticed if I don&#x27;t spread the lotion evenly all over my body, I&#x27;ll have darker arms than the rest of my body. I guess I don&#x27;t wash my hands good enough, the lotion stained in between my fingers (proving that this does work!). I&#x27;ll attach a photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly tan on my arms and white everywhere else. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 2 weeks now. if you&#x27;re already tan it will give you that golden dark Beyonc&amp;eacute; glow. if you&#x27;re whiter, you&#x27;ll become couple of shades darker. I do recommend this!</li>
            <li> Though it smells good, even after a week there is no noticeable skin color change (or firming which it is also supposed to do.)  Not a total loss because it is a good moisturizer, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again as a self tanner.  Oh, and it showed up in the mail with a cracked cap and leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> Love it, bronzing, firming, moisturizing,  what more do you need?  It&#x27;s not super dark and you should apply it every day but it&#x27;s a moisturizer so that&#x27;s not a problem.  For me, anyway.  It must work because someone at work asked if I&#x27;ve been laying out.  For my skin tone it&#x27;s more of a light golden tan, not orangey, very natural.  I like it a lot, can&#x27;t find it locally so amazon is my only option,  even if it&#x27;s high priced.  Worth it to me.  Also I have no problems with staining on my palms or finger webs, I just rinse it and go.  Perfect.  Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li> goes on great and works like a charm.. i will always purchase this item</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this higher than five stars. The most perfect tanning bronzer. It doesn&#x27;t blotch, doesn&#x27;t fade, and you notice the tan within three days. Love, love, love this product!!!💜💜💜</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks. The color of my &amp;#34; tan &amp;#34; appears to be believable as a &amp;#34; real sun tan &amp;#34;. I do not see a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of skin tightening though, and the fragrance is a bit strong for me. Would be a better product if it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> First it is a lot cheaper at wal mart and for the price you get more than what you pay for. In fact I came here to review the product since I don&#x27;t think I need to move brands like other cases when using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This self tanner lotion can be used on days you can&#x27;t get to the tanning bed if your afraid of losing you already built up tan. I used it several times to cut down the time needed overall in the tanning bed when I just wish to be a certain shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or simply the most common use of this is to simply avoid the tanning bed altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell but it&#x27;s not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you accidentally put the wrong amount on, since the DHA reacts with the skin its very easy to grab a towel at the store and just rub off on your neckline or arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I have to say-&lt;br /&gt;Even though it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, you can still feel it over the pores throughout the day almost like a filmed tilled its washed off. I find this only noticeable when I try to exercise and I feel hotter than usual because my sweating is off from using this product. My suggestion if you use this product, on a busy schedule where you end up working out rub a wet towel around lightly so that it won&#x27;t effect your output.</li>
            <li> Does work as expected. Gives a nice golden glow over about 10 days. This product does NOT make you orange at all. Has a great smell but does have a small &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell but I notice it only if you perspire a couple hours after applying. I would definitely suggest this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really hate this stuff. I bought it from the raging reviews online and the price is cheap. It&#x27;s my first self tanner and couldn&#x27;t afford tanning sessions so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try so I would have a glow for my wedding coming up soon. According to reviews, it smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t streak, so that&#x27;s the main reason why I purchased this from Walmart. It&#x27;s the exact opposite for me! It made my fingernails/hands an ugly orange even after washing my hands good right after appliance. And for some reason, it refuses to tan certain parts of my body such as my face, the folds of my knees and arms, and chest (my boobs and underneath them). I apply this stuff twice to these areas a day and it&#x27;s still as white as the day I first applied it. Even though I am 140 pounds I have a little roll when I sit down. It also turned very orange around the crease there! People refer this stuff as coconut smelling but honestly It smells just as awful as that dead skin smell right after stepping out of a tanning bed. Now, my wedding is only days away and I have orange hands, tan arms, and a white face. My wedding photos will look lovely :(</li>
            <li> Best hydrating lotion! I&#x27;ve used this after tanning for 3 weeks now and my skin is SO LOOK soft afterwards! As far as the self tanning I have no idea because I tan daily and I am and already was dark when I started using it. And as farm as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; that&#x27;s an absolute NO lamp but just for the hydrating fact I&#x27;d buy it again and again. And FYI stop by your local Wal-Mart and pick this up for 5.87 instead of pAying this price</li>
            <li> I buy this at walmart for less than $6 so i dont know why it is so expensive here but it is the cheapest best gradual tanning lotion i&#x27;ve tried. You have to use it every day and the tan doesnt get noticeable for about 3 or 4 days. The advantage of that is that you dont get streaks. It doesnt smell as bad as other tanning lotions when it has been on your body. After about a week or 2 of having the tan you have to exfoilate and start over because the your tan skin starts to get flaky but that is normal for all tanning lotions</li>
            <li> I found this at a certain department store a few years ago and have been using it ever since.  It&#x27;s the only place I could ever find it, and it&#x27;s not too expensive. For about $6 I think it&#x27;s worth it.  I usually get it when it&#x27;s almost summer so I don&#x27;t look so white when i start wearing summer clothes. I&#x27;m not into the whole tanning thing, I never go to tanning beds or anything but I do like to have a nice color and this works for me.. I can usually see a difference after about 3 uses, but make sure you wash your hands because I notice the skin around my fingers gets dark if I don&#x27;t wash them good.  I&#x27;m kind afraid to use it on my face because I break out easily, but it says it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems.  As far as the smell, I actually like it.  It&#x27;s like a nice tropical scent.  It goes on easy like a regular lotion and you just have to wait a few minutes for it to dry. I never notice any streaks or anything.  My skin feels really nice after using it too.</li>
            <li> I used to use Jergins self tanner but after a while your tan would flake off and get splotchy. This smells much better than Jergins and I think it works better. And is a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and burn easily. I&#x27;m not a sunbather. My legs always are white and I wanted them a little darker so as not to wear stockings. After a few days of use, I have the look I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years now and love it. Recommended by a model that used it and swore by it.</li>
            <li> love this lotion, works great, feels great on skin and is not greasy at all, visible firming  over time, love it</li>
            <li> I have been using Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; Golden Glow for years and I love it. I usually can get it locally, but this year I did not stock up before the rush for spring tanning started. I ordered four bottles but one was shipped separately. The one that was shipped separately arrive first and I started using it immediately since I had just run out of it from my local source. I noticed that the new bottle had a different color label, but just figured the company was going for a new look. Everything else on the label was the same. I was rather irritated when I began to lose my tan that I had developed using the Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; I had purchased locally. I went through half a bottle of the Malibu &amp;#34;Hemp&amp;#34; I purchased through Amazon before my tan was completely gone. I have discarded that bottle and started using one of the other three I purchased. My tan is starting to come back. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF THE LABEL ON THE BOTTLE IS GREEN. The label should be tan in color. I believe the bottle with the green label was a knockoff and did not work like the real thing. I&#x27;m very disappointed that I paid such a high price for something that did not do what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four days now and no sign of bronzing just a bad after smell. My husband says it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> If you use self-tanning lotions you know that weird almost coppery smell that you can get from them.  This lotion has that great subtle hemp scent to it and as the day goes on it stays very subtle without turning to that unpleasant tanning lotion smell you get from other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem with the color being uneven or staining hands (and sometimes I just put the Hemp tanner on my legs and then go straight to my non-tanning hemp lotion for my arms and just a quick rinse of my hands and no problems)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using self-tanning lotions for 24 years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> A lot like jergen&#x27;s natural glow but more product for your $$$. It can get you pretty dark/orangey though... I found a happy medium and won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is reasonly priced,i like the little color it gives you, I love thesmell, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Love all of hemp lotion products. This self Tanner smells great! I was previously using Jergen&#x27;s skin firming, gradual self Tanner but the smell of that was horrible. This product is much better... Smells wonderful and more moisturizing with a gradual Tan just as product claims. Thanks Malibu Tan!</li>
            <li> love this stuff, have been using it for 2 years. Great for early tanning season and/or extending my tan into the fall</li>
            <li> I have fair skin which does not tan easily. I got this a week before an event, thinking I could work up a nice glow by the date. But it works more slowly than that. I use it every day after a shower, and now finally after about 2 weeks I do have a nice golden color, just enough so it does not look fake. The scent is pleasant, and it feels lovely on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is 4.97 at Walmart and it really works. After one application you can see a difference. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a self tanner until way later, which is better than the whole time. It gives a really nice colour and after 3 days it is dark, make sure you exfoliate before application and WASH YOUR HANDS really good because it stains those!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Gives you a nice golden glow without turning u orange!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful. feels great. not greasy. Love it</li>
            <li> I have used this before and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I love this product as it gives a well blended color that is not too orangy and the smell is nice, well worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I love this product! However for a 24.4 FL oz you could get this at walmart for about $5. Last summer I purchased two and I only went through half a bottle in one summer. Great deal! It smells awesome but when it soaks in it does have a faint self tanner smell but I have to put my nose right up to my skin to smell it. I am super white and after say four I start noticing me getting a light tan. It&#x27;s enough for me because I do t want to look fake. This does not turn you orange however make sure you wash your hands after applying and put on joints lightly. I would put it on in the morning not. I guy because when I sleep I bend my elbows and legs so sometimes I would wake up with creases on the elbows or behind the knees. I just love this hands down and I don&#x27;t have to go tanning at all. Since I&#x27;m so white I tend to just burn in the summer then the little tan I do get it goes away quickly. Now that I discovered this product I don&#x27;t have to go lay out in the sun everyday! Where I love it rains about 8 months out of the year so we don&#x27;t get a nice long summer so it&#x27;s nice to have a product to maintain a glow. Your tan will go away if you stop using after a few days so to maintain I would put on every other day or every two days...hope this helps! But don&#x27;t get it here go to walmart!</li>
            <li> It lost 1 star because after I bought I found it at Walmart for $4.78.  The small is not bad at all, I have been trying to find a good moisturizer with a bronzer that I actually could wear without the horrible smell.  It smells tropical when you put it on.  After about 1-2 hours you can smell a very slight sunless tanner smell but I&#x27;m talking very, very slight.  I wear it to bed and shower in the morning.  I wear it for a total of 9 hours and after 9 hours the smell is still very light.  Even after washing it off in the shower my skin feels moisturized.  I do recommend this, it does take about 3 nights for the color to show up but then looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!  Goes on smoothly, adding moisture to you skin and absolutely no streaking.  I will never go back to the old self tanners with that horrible smell that reeks if a phony tan.  Just  a light and pleasant  coconut  fragrance.  Can&#x27;t say enough!!</li>
            <li> This self-tanner is like no other when it comes to the scent! To me it smells like fresh bananas and never gets that burnt smell like so many others. Malibu Hemp is also very moisturizing and will not dry out your skin! I would recommend this product to anyone that has issues with self tanner smells.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work better than the Jergen&#x27;s in my opinion.  The bronzing is gradual and as long as you keep your hands washed after applying then you won&#x27;t look orange.  The dry skin around a couple of my fingers is the only place that appears orangeish.  It does have a tanning lotion smell.  It actually smells exactly like the bombshell tingling tanning lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me too bad since I wear it at night to bed and not during the day, but my husband said it stunk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this product again! It does exactly what it says it does - gradual, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> It smells real bad and it works okay u can get it at Walmart for 4.99 so I&#x27;m mad about that</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years. I get it at Wal-Mart for $5-$6.  It is a gradual lotion and I use it everyday starting in the spring all the way til September as my daily lotion.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad (I have tried so many self tanning).  Also I am very fair skinned and this doesn&#x27;t streak nor make me look orange.  People are surprised when I tell them what I buy and the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff .... love it</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the skin, but takes many uses to see any tanning. The smell is a little coconut which is good. It doesn&#x27;t make your palms tan which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Love it, gives nice color with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for reviews on this product and noticed there wasn&#x27;t one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! However, it&#x27;s $5-6 bucks at Walmart. It has that hemp lotion smell to it, with a tropical flair. Personally, I love the smell of hemp lotions. Anyhow, it&#x27;s a thick lotion that gradually does build a believable tan. It doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, or splotchy or stinky. Still, I always wash my hands after applying. It took about 3-4 days before I noticed results. My natural tone is on the light end of medium. I find it great for the winter months when I don&#x27;t want to look ghostly and I&#x27;m too cheap to go tanning. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Spring is here and I wanted to kick-start my look with some fake colour. I have tried SO many brands, if not all, and in ALL formats, lotions, foam, oil, spray, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I heard about this product, so I figured, it&#x27;s only a few bucks, can&#x27;t hurt. Let me first tell you, I am not that into selftanners to begin with, let alone even moisturising my body cuz of the gooey feeling that I can&#x27;t stand. SO, I was skeptical to this moisturizer cuz I was afraid it would be greasy or heavy. WELL, let me first say, WOW!!!! This product smells DIVINE! Like a sheer light coconuty almondy scent, that is NOT over-bearing one bit, cuz I hate that. Secondly, it goes RIGHT into the skin, and I mean, super-fast! I hate residue or thick greasy lotions, but this one is so light-weight that I can dress almost immediately! I am on day 3 now, and true to the product claim, my skin is a very healthy NATURAL light-tanned shade! It&#x27;s amazing! NO ORANGE!!!!! And NO STREAKING!!!! And let me say, I have seen reviews where people state that they don&#x27;t turn orange, or that there is no stinky selftanner smell, then I have gone and tried the product, and had BOTH. SO, there isn&#x27;t even the slightest selftanner smell, or hint of orange. Not even a hint. SERIOUSLY. This product should be propagated more cuz it truly is amazing. I can&#x27;t wait for day 7 and then daily all summer, cuz right now, I really do look fabulous. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using a gradual tanner AT ALL, just moisturizing with this amazing light-weight scented lotion. This is luxury in a bottle for me. I will not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on day 7 now, and people have been asking me if I&#x27;ve been on a mini-holiday! That&#x27;s how naturally tanned I am. This stuff really IS AMAZING! If you&#x27;re even the slightest bit hesitant, don&#x27;t be, and just buy it, you WON&#x27;T regret it!&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I forgot to mention in my review that I use this daily on my face also, and have not had the slightest tendency towards a breakout (and I have REALLY sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to any type of scented lotion!), it&#x27;s crazy! I would actually rather say that my facial skin has gotten BETTER if that&#x27;s possible?! It says on the bottle &#x27;no oils that clog pores&#x27;, so.. ALL I KNOW is that I look fabulous and about a hundred times better than with any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, high or low end. THIS one is the shizzle!eakout (and I have REALLY sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to any type of scented lotion!), it&#x27;s crazy! I would actually rather say that my facial skin has gotten BETTER if that&#x27;s possible?! It says on the bottle &#x27;no oils that clog pores&#x27;, so.. ALL I KNOW is that I look fabulous and about a hundred times better than with any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, high or low end. THIS one is the shizzle!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion at Walmart (yes you can get it at their stores for around $6.50 for a 13oz. bottle), so first of all I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time ordering it online, unless you have no access to a Walmart in your neighborhood.  I was so overjoyed to have heard of this stuff, because I have sensitive skin and I also think I may be allergic to DHA (every time I use a tan lotion, my skin gets extremely itchy for days after!), and also because I&#x27;ve always loved hemp oil for my skin.  Imagine my pleasant surprise after finding this giant bottle of lotion w/ about 5 or 6 different essential oils in it! Also, it smells divine!! So, as a lotion it works good...makes my skin very smooth and smells great.  However, as a tanning lotion, forget it.  The back of the bottle claims that after 7 days of using it, your skin will be about 2-3 shades darker.  I have extremely fair skin, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing...my skin is just as lily white as the day I bought the stuff.  Other tan lotions (like Banana Boat, L&#x27;oreal, Jergens) work much better for getting color, but I can&#x27;t use them because of my sensitive skin :(  Very frustrated :(</li>
            <li> No streaks, real looking tan, and it SMELLS GOOD! Just make sure you wash your hands well after applying it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how moisturized it makes my skin.  I will be buying more and the prices on Amazon are great</li>
            <li> i HAVE BEEN TANNING IN A TANNING BED FOR 3 WEEKS NOW USING VERY GOOD TANNING LOTION. i BOUGHT THIS HEMP MOISTURIZER THINKING IT WOULD JUST GIVE ME A GLOW. i TANNED ONE MORNING THEN AFTERWARDS I MOISTURIZED WITH THIS HEMP GOLDEN GLOW LOTION. THE NEXT MORNING I SWEAR IT LOOKED LIKE I JUST GOT OFF AN ISLAND. MY TAN IS DEEP AND DARK WITH A HEALTHY GLOW. WE R IN FEB.NOW AND IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE BEEN TANNING FOR 3 MONTHS. THIS STUFF ENHANCED MY TAN AND NOW IAM SWIMSUIT READY. MY SKIN IS NOT ORANGE OR STREAKED. NOW THAT THE RESULTS ARE WONDERFUL I WILL NOT HAVE TO TAN IN THE SALON NO MORE THEN 2 X A WEEK. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT THROUGH SUMMER. IAM VERY PLEASED. OF COURSE THERE IS A SMELL BUT NOT SO BAD. ALL TANNING LOTIONS AND ALL SELF TANNING LOTIONS WILL NEVER SMELL EXACTLY NICE. THANK YOU, BRANDY</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it smells good, but within hours you get that gross fake tanner smell going. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so fair, but the color was also very orange. Pretty disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. My skin is on the fairer side and this lotion is moisturizing and adds a nice, warm color.  You&#x27;re not going to get suuuuper dark using it, but it gives a great natural looking &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s affordable, smells great, and does what it says it does. Buy it! :)</li>
            <li> Use this often.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other tanners, but it doesn&#x27;t tan as dark either.  Makes my skin feel soft.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Okay with this product I noticed it makes me smell good. And to let you know the skin firming part does not mean you can skip your diet and eat pizza 7 times a week. The pump works very good and the bottle is a good size for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart for $6, for a 25.4 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used self-tanning lotion before, but after not getting a tan at all last summer, and the fact that it takes me literally every day outside in the sun to get to a good color, I decided it was time to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all this lotion smells really good when applying. It goes on easy. I have noticed that in areas I don&#x27;t rub it in as well, it gets darker quicker than areas that I really rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in skin color after two uses, and haven&#x27;t had a good chance to use it every day to see how dark I can get, but as of right now, I have 4 uses (since I lost all my color from going on vacation and forgetting to bring it with me) and have a good golden glow. I normally am very pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I smell like maple syrup starting about an hour after application that lasts until I shower again. Since I apply it at night, I smell like a waffle house all night long. Nobody else has mentioned that so it may just be my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;2. After 4 days of not applying when I went on vacation, I had a few very small spotchy patches, and my bikini rubbed the color off on my ribs. I scratched some off my stomach. Maybe applying lotion every day would also help with this?</li>
            <li> I love the lotion.  Feels good, smells good, works good, but they didn&#x27;t pack it very well and the top broke.  SO now I have to take the lid off to use it, which is just a mild inconvience but it&#x27;s gonna be a real pain when I start getting to the bottom of the bottle.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to order another bottle and hopefully that lid will come intact and I can use it for both.  Wow, that&#x27;s a pretty crafty marketing technique!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this  everyday for a little over a week.  I use it after I shower.  It dries on my skin really fast, literally in a couple minutes.  It really has helped my dry skin, which was pretty flaky, and the tan color looks real. Not orange or streaky.  So I give it a 5 for the tan, fragrance and the improvement of my skin.  I will definitely be buying more of this during the summer! Awesome.  2016- Going to buy more of this.  Tried a more expensive brand last week and had to send it back, turned my skin orange.  I still love Malibu Hemp!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me to stay tanned all summer long. Looks natural and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I bought a 24.5 oz bottle of this at Walmart for around 6 bucks, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it here.  But, I do think it works pretty well.  I am a bridesmaid in a wedding coming up and needed to get rid of my farmer&#x27;s tan.  I don&#x27;t have much time to sit in the sun to get a natural tan and sitting in the sun actually makes me feel ill.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend money fake baking or getting a spray tan, so this was my last resort.  Although it doesn&#x27;t appear to get as dark as advertised on the bottle (which I didn&#x27;t expect), it did seem to even out my farmer&#x27;s tan which I&#x27;m happy about.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a week once or twice a day.  It smells nice, too!  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love this product. Skin is so soft. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores and have been using it for a couple of years it gives an amazingly natural tan not orange or streaky I put it on at night and wake up tan in the morning. It has a nice smell going on but if you are sweating it does give off a bit of an odor. Tan lasts for up to a weeek.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t tan I was looking for a good lotion to use along with my fake bake sunless tanner. This doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor to it and also has a little tint to it so it seemed to help my fake tan last longer. But I didn&#x27;t get the orange spots on my hands if I didn&#x27;t rinse them super well, just a quick rinse and no worries. Help keep my skin very moisturized as well. So glad I bought this to use and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years, but I couldn&#x27;t find it at our Wal-Mart. This is not the same as the one I bought from Wal-Mart.  The lotion is much thinner and it turned my legs orange the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over two years. I will not buy any other lotion but this. I love the smell and the nice tan glow it provides. It is a subtle glow not over the top. I work inside most of my day, so this provides a nice hint of tan so it does not appear that i am a total shut in. hahaha!</li>
            <li> This is an effective product, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long. Others I&#x27;ve used will last several days, but this is an every day use or every other day at best. One good thing is the color is natural and it doesn&#x27;t stain the knees as easily as other brands. The smell is OK, better than Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about a year.....it hydrates your skin plus gives it a hint of bronze......I did not like paying almost $20 for it though....however, I was out....and need won!  I just purchased a bottle in a nearby retail outlet for $5.97!!!  they only have it in the warm months....</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I (who purchase EVERYTHING from Amazon, but who never leave reviews) am giving it five stars and actually writing a review. That&#x27;s how happy I am to have found this. I am very very pale with dark hair and eyes, but with the skin of a redhead. Freckled and sensitive and prone to sunburns. I just cannot tan. It&#x27;s also very dry, so self-tanners often leave me feeling dried out because of the alcohol in them. That being said, I gladly suffer the dry skin when I find a product that gives me color that looks realistic and is fairly forgiving. My faves now are Fake Bake Flawless and this. It&#x27;s pretty cool because this is SO easy to apply. I just rub it in really well like any normal lotion. I wash my hands and wait for it to get pretty dry, and then I can go about my day as usual. This is NOT how I do Fake Bake, as that stuff has the bronze color guide which is lovely, but which will rub off on clothes and sheets and everything. This stuff, I actually wear like lotion and go out and run errands or go to work or whatever. Smells awesome and gives me really fast, pretty color. The color isn&#x27;t a reddish tan, like a real tan would be--it&#x27;s more golden. But it&#x27;s definitely not orange and no one would think I looked fake or overdone with this. Just one coat actually gives me a good baseline color, and two or three coats makes me feel like I can actually go out in tank tops and shorts, which I NEVER do. I felt like I would need 3-4 coats to get a good, even, nice color on my legs (which seem to take longer to get dark, probably because they are the whitest part of my body, never seeing the sun EVER), but for face, upper body and back, this color and application is the best I&#x27;ve found. I think I prefer Fake Bake for my legs because I have found full-fledged self-tanners seem to give my chalky legs a more realistic tone than any gradual tanners. The best color still comes from airbrush tanning, but for at home purposes, if I take a few days to layera few coats of self tanner, I get a really good result. This stuff is my new go-to for very very fast, convenient self-tanning. And the reason I love it is because it&#x27;s some of the best color I&#x27;ve gotten from any tanner, let alone a gradual, super easy tanner like this. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the only tanner I&#x27;ll use. All the others are dyes and make my skin orange, and they&#x27;re usually loaded with obnoxious perfume. This one has a delicate coconut smell and is clear, and my skin gradually looks tanner without the orange color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! I am a pretty pale person and it builds gradual, believable color. I will never go back! The scent is also really nice - a kind of coconutty-beachy-hemp scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like any other self-tanner lotion I&#x27;ve tried (Jergens stinks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought a 24 oz. bottle at Walmart for around $5. Definitely a better buy! It was in the regular lotion section, not with the other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> This is a definite must have! I personally am a natural red-head and have a difficult time tanning during the summer months. This product gave me a pretty nice natural glow after three days. After one week, I look sun kissed. This product does not leave an orange residue or streaks and does not smell like most other gradual tanners. If you are looking for quick color, I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but it had leaked during delivery so it was a bit messy</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and smells good, but I don&#x27;t know how much it actually extends the length of my tan.</li>
            <li> This is the first day I have used this product so I can not attest to how well it does as a self-tanner. However I do not think I will be able to use it because of the strong smell. I used it for the first time just on my legs as I wanted to test it out before using it on my entire body. It went on smooth and was easy to rub in and did not leave any marks. But I kept noticing this strong cinnamon smell that I didn&#x27;t really noticed while I put the lotion on. As it dried and I got dressed and went along my routine I noticed it and it seems to have gotten stronger. I even have a little bit of a headache from it. I know my husband will hate it because of the smell more so because he is allergic to cinnamon! So yeah I don&#x27;t think I will use it anymore. It will probably go to one of my sisters instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Being a red head, I dont friggin tan;But this stuff is a miracle!  And it smells AMAZING! Only $5.87 at Walmart!</li>
