            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>they are amazing</li>
            <li>but I just let them sit in a bowl of warm water in the microwave for a minute to kill any bacteria that may have been the producer of the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice, cute sponge.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I do have yet to use the sponge though it may work better than I think it will</li>
            <li>I love it and it came sooner than what I thought</li>
            <li>That being said, i&#x27;m really satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>Very portable and handy :)</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I wish I had order the larger size, but its great for blending under the eye or nose.  </li>
            <li>Good for travel size, but I thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li>The pointy tip is great for getting underneath the eyes &amp; covering dark circles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s teeny but worth the price I think</li>
            <li>I was super excited for this beauty blender, it took a long time to arrive but that is accepted.</li>
            <li>But to compare it to the beauty blender or real technique sponge it is nothing like them.</li>
            <li>It took about a month for me to receive it because it comes straight from China.</li>
            <li>A thanks</li>
            <li>I expected this thing to be extra tiny , but its actually a really good sponge.</li>
            <li>Even smaller than the other cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t super soft but wasn&#x27;t hard as a rock.</li>
            <li>shipping was a little slow but over all amazing</li>
            <li>However, they are slight softer than the other cheap ones sold on here.</li>

            <li> However, they are slight softer than the other cheap ones sold on here.</li>
            <li> Took almost 3 weeks for me to receive item and it was smaller than expected, but it does the job.,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t puff when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> The package came a few days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t expand under water like the other two.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong one I received the large one instead</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even expand when wet!!</li>
            <li> They are obviously not original beauty blenders</li>
            <li> Does the trick for those hard to get at places.</li>
            <li> Shipping was ridiculously slow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was the mini size, so i was expecting a much larger beauty blender and was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It did have a weird smell when I opened the package</li>
            <li> so very disappointed.....</li>
            <li> horrible and would not recommend!</li>

            <li> It blends well. Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s teeny but worth the price I think</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Save $20 by buying this sponge. It&#x27;s the same thing as the brand name but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Took almost 3 weeks for me to receive item and it was smaller than expected, but it does the job.,</li>
            <li> It looked Like it would be what I was wanting. But to compare it to the beauty blender or real technique sponge it is nothing like them. It doesn&#x27;t expand under water like the other two. I do have yet to use the sponge though it may work better than I think it will but we will see.</li>
            <li> Nice, cute sponge. Wasn&#x27;t super soft but wasn&#x27;t hard as a rock. Overall, I do like it</li>
            <li> Does the trick for those hard to get at places.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works !!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Do not buy the $20 ones, this works just as well!!!</li>
            <li> The package came a few days earlier than expected. So that&#x27;s a plus! They are obviously not original beauty blenders so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything comparable to the beauty blender. However, they are slight softer than the other cheap ones sold on here. Note: they are TINY. Even smaller than the other cheap ones. To give you an idea, it&#x27;s the size of my eyeball. It did have a weird smell when I opened the package but I just let them sit in a bowl of warm water in the microwave for a minute to kill any bacteria that may have been the producer of the smell.</li>
            <li> So cute !! Works amazing and its like $6.50 in stores for the mini one! I c ouldn believe itt I lost mine though</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this beauty blender, it took a long time to arrive but that is accepted. When I used it it was amazing blended perfectly however, after 2 weeks it started falling apart.....so very disappointed.....Don&#x27;t always go for the cheaper product....:(</li>
            <li> nothing like the beauty blender! its actually just rubber and it doesn&#x27;t even expand when wet!! horrible and would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Good for travel size, but I thought it would be bigger. It works fine.</li>
            <li> Its a lot smaller than I was thinking but overall gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very portable and handy :)</li>
