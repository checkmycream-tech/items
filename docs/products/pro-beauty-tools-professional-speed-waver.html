            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I love this thing!</li>

            <li>I Love this waver!</li>
            <li>I love the look!</li>
            <li>It gets warm very fast and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Works great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great price.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I love it!</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, and great waves - this is awesome!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair looking amazing.</li>
            <li>This is so amazing.</li>
            <li>but once she did her hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>its amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how amazing my hair looks.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s amazing to be done in that amount of time.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and works great!</li>
            <li>this one had the best price, so I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it that I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting as much money.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wanted to try nice wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I liked it and the curls it made.</li>
            <li>Gives me nice waves without the frizz.</li>
            <li>She liked the way my hair looked.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is, this gives you a wonderful head of waves but it doesn&#x27;t really look like you &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they are nice curled up</li>
            <li>and it kind of burns my hair and hers too</li>
            <li>This creates the kind of waves you get when you braid your hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well, leaves a beautiful wave!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even all that adept at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>It comes out nice</li>
            <li>and I had to have them for my own hair.  </li>
            <li>and I was told by a friend (who gave me her honest opinion, which Im thankful for) that I looked like a 16 y.o.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.. and very chip..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great value!</li>
            <li>My hair comes out nice and defined and crimped the way it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>it works awesome that way and holds really well</li>
            <li>It works nice but it has a smell when you crimp your hair.</li>
            <li>Quick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, was easy to use, and made awesome waves!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Good waver if your wanting it for a date or outing ,but it makes your hair stink ,it frys and damages your hair ,but it good if your looking for a quick hairstyle</li>
            <li>I guarantee you will love it! :)</li>
            <li>I tend to forget so make sure to unplug after each use to be safe!</li>
            <li>This is such a great waver for a really good price!  </li>
            <li>I love to use this about 3-4 days after washing my hair to give it great body and fun waves!</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT waver and for such a good price!</li>
            <li>She loved it so that was fine with me, after all it was her</li>
            <li>Even when you get in a hurry and cram more hair in than you should, it still looks amazing.</li>
            <li>For those who have had success with it, that is great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this, its totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Maybe best for a professional who can use it correctly.</li>
            <li>so I know how much I have turned it and where the ideal wheel position is for me.</li>
            <li>nice and style your hair with mins i love it</li>
            <li>I watched the tutorial and I liked the most the glam waves, so I followed the steps from the video</li>
            <li>how quickly I was able to do my hair, and 2) the great quality/hold of the waves.</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!  </li>
            <li>Too easy with good shap really love love love it and all my friend ask about it they want to make orders</li>
            <li>I really do like how it looked though, beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>This has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; tool for a fast, beautiful look.  </li>
            <li>Works great and is super easy gives you the wave look in minutes</li>
            <li>The curler is quite handy and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Nice tool and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Delivery was exactly as advised and I absolutely LOVE the device!!</li>
            <li>ITS SUPER AWESOME AND WORKS FAST</li>
            <li>So fast to use and creates a great look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.  </li>
            <li>I love this &amp;#34;crimper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this one melted the top of the polder station in the slot it was in.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this waver</li>
            <li>The best part is the waves actually STAY!  </li>
            <li>She figured out that for school, she can just wave the top layer and still get the desired look without having to fool with all the hair underneath that would take longer.</li>
            <li>And do not hold a section for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>but it can be more of a hassle</li>
            <li>Overall one of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The curls were just ok.</li>
            <li>I can make better ones with my straightener.</li>
            <li>and it sure makes our hair look thicker</li>
            <li>I love the size of the waves this leaves.</li>
            <li>but this just adds to it and gives me hair more volume as well.</li>
            <li>so yes make sure you use a hair protector</li>
            <li>I love this waver.  </li>
            <li>Extremely glad I got this.</li>
            <li>So many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll have more luck if your hair is thicker, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get many compliments about it.</li>
            <li>But that aside, it works like it says it does, and makes lovely waves.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>gives me two-three days of a cute hairstyle (I have oily hair</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>she has already used it many times.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair appliance that I have, and my collection includes 2 curling wands and a Miracurl.  </li>
            <li>It gives great beachy waves that you can do a million things with and the process was much quicker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be using it every day, but maybe once every week or two. :)</li>
            <li>My daughter and her friends love this :)</li>
            <li>Love how the waves are loose/flowy &amp; not kinky, my hair stays wavy all day</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I love the wave this give my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I would spend more money and get something nicer</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use TONS of heat protectant and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the 9 feet rubber cord ..</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is a great way to achieve that without much fuss.  </li>
            <li>Instead, you have to wait until it cools, before you can put it on top of any surface.</li>
            <li>recommend it..but make sure to check out level of heat to avoid damage</li>
            <li>It is ok, it does the job</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this Pro Tools</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love Doing My Hair With This</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments when I style my hair with this product.</li>

            <li>Ok so pending on what type of hair you have this tool can be sent from heaven, or the devil himself.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use it at the hottest setting though because that&#x27;s damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li>I love the wave it gives you, people always ask me what I use to wave my hair.</li>

            <li>Fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this iron.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a wig that was supposed to be body waves, but it looked more like a bush.</li>

            <li>and I get so many compliments on it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you want to look 1990&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I use the tresseme heat protector that i love.</li>
            <li>amazing , makes super cute waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light and easy to maneuver/handle when using.  </li>
            <li>i loved this tool for the first four months i had it.  </li>
            <li>This is best for people with long hair.</li>
            <li>Best for long hair.  </li>
            <li>when it hits hair-- just use your best judgment on how long you want to keep it on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, but my waves don&#x27;t come out perfectly when I braid it.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it was a pretty good iron.</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it is easy for me to use</li>
            <li>I decided to give myself more waves/curls but the easy way.</li>
            <li>Let me say that I will use this on semi-wet to dry hair and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I find the best way it works for me is when I wash my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>Love the curls and the waver is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this Waver, it is fast,gets the job done fast, people told me loved my hair.</li>
            <li>Loved the results on the back of my hair, but if you have layers like I do, it will be fairly poufy and unless you wanna look 90, you might wanna skip this.</li>
            <li>Its OK, its large!!!</li>
            <li>My new favorite styling item!!</li>
            <li>It was a very good purchase and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Very cool waver.  </li>
            <li>Just as expected, perfect!</li>
            <li>It worked really well, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Based on all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to using this waver.</li>
            <li>Thanks, the price is good.</li>
            <li>I got it for a good price and it works very well</li>
            <li>So quick and easy to make beachy waves!  </li>
            <li>This is SUCH a good styling tool!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure how to use it, go on youtube as there are tons of videos out there to show you how easy it</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has a range of heat options.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Now, it takes longer, but it&#x27;s so easy to curl my hair now.</li>
            <li>This tool heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>its easy to use as has a gfood lock</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it has a strong order when I turn it on.</li>
            <li>The cord is super long, so it makes it extremely easy to get an awesome wave all over.</li>
            <li>Such a good product at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results (nice body, pretty waves), but I wouldn&#x27;t say fast or easy.</li>
            <li>My hair is just down to my shoulder and it looks great!</li>
            <li>I love this feature as it makes the waver super easy to store away.  </li>
            <li>This gives a perfect beachy look in a few minutes! :)  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>As far as how it treats your hair, a heat protection spray is ideal, if you don&#x27;t have one, here is what you should do: after your tool is finished warming up, first press a towel between the plates to release any over heating on the surface of the plates that can burn your hair.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of locks of hair that are sometimes fine</li>
            <li>I had a wonderful hairdo in less than 10 minutes (note:</li>
            <li>Maybe my daughter&#x27;s hair is just too fine</li>
            <li>Came quick!</li>
            <li>Shipping to Italy was so quick!</li>
            <li>Gives my hair tremendous amount of volume, and I&#x27;m always so confident when I go out with my hair styled with this</li>
            <li>Quick and carefree waves!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>This gadget is saving me money because I don&#x27;t have to get my highlights as often, you really can&#x27;t tell when its all curled up, most just think my hair is ombre!</li>
            <li>This Speed Waver heats up very fast and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am super careful with my hair and have never ever experienced this with any kind of heat-styling product before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best styling tool hands down that I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>BUT IT MAKES FOR HUGE HAIR</li>
            <li>I love the waves, it look nice and natural.</li>
            <li>GET THEM ALL &amp; ENJOY</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t meant to be crimped like mine but excellent quality and isn&#x27;t harsh on her hair.</li>
            <li>The curls turn out really nice, however, it really does damage hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this tool because it&#x27;s a great price and works well.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend a great shampoo and conditioner, and actually leave the conditioner on about 10 minutes before washing it out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and works well so get it.</li>
            <li>I almost bought a similar iron for $30.00 and I&#x27;m do happy I found this.</li>
            <li>It is everything I hoped for and more, and was totally worth my money.</li>
            <li>I wish hair was damage free</li>
            <li>Works just as good or BETTER than the Bed head deep waver!!</li>
            <li>so I am going to have to experiment more, but I thought it did a good job overall.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and only takes me like 10 or 15 minutes to get beautiful waves!</li>
            <li>it was pretty easy to do and neat!</li>
            <li>It waves your hair fast btw !!!</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly because it was very affordable and because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I t did the job, but I love the older models better</li>
            <li>There are certainly others on the market that look good, but at a higher price</li>
            <li>Super easy to use; I did all my hair in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a heat protect spray,  I like hot off the press by Paul Mitchell it adds shine, volume and most importantly will prevent damage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for quick, easy styles.</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li>This is easy to use but BE CAUTIOUS when using - tool gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>It was not user friendly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is okay for the price, I suppose and if you are willing to work with it</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the reason that it works the best of any I&#x27;ve tried or not.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Works great for my daughters with long hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product on my hair and it works nicely!</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Really nice I live it</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had is some kind of stand, so you can safely set it on the counter.</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves me looking like I got my hair professionally done and fast</li>
            <li>but most importantly it works really fast</li>
            <li>have used the Speed Waver MANY times since I received it and have never had such amazing hair.</li>
            <li>But this little iron is fast becoming my best friend.  </li>
            <li>Gave me great, loose waves.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gets hot enough to make nice waves!</li>
            <li>, curling is a &#x27;special occasion&#x27; hairdo.</li>
            <li>Creates very nice loose waves.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous beach waves that last!</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>I love it sooooo much ...</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long, so watching the video really is helpful on best practices.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves the look too :).</li>
            <li>and this makes it look full of volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a waver not a crimper.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of unused curling products, but this is my go-to product now.  </li>
            <li>The waves stay in all day and make my hair so full.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other words to describe it, I love it!</li>
            <li>Seriously - the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It works well and quick.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry you can quickly get some beach waves.</li>
            <li>The waver did not burn my hair and is quick to use.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, as well.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does the job,  but there is a funky smell when it&#x27;s heated up.</li>
            <li>but that smell wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>and yes it did wave the hair quickly</li>
            <li>For the outstanding prices, I would say this is  definite buy :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make hair very pretty..</li>
            <li>Then, the first time I plugged in the waver, the light came on and the waver heated up.</li>
            <li>It gives great big waves that look very beachy and fun.  </li>
            <li>The waver can get very very hot</li>
            <li>Very pretty &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super straight so the waves you see in my picture is all from the tool!!</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t do that this way you switch each wave down not all of them to get great beach waves including the end of the hair</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy I checked the previous reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works fast.</li>
            <li>The reviews were saying it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The process if fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>So fun and quick to use on medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Well, this product definitely makes it easy to make your hair look super cute.</li>
            <li>I really like how quickly you can get through a whole head of hair with this waver and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on the results of using this tool to style my hair, but it is made very cheaply.  </li>
            <li>I HAD MY WHOLE HEAD DONE IN 15 MINUTES !!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product so far!</li>
            <li>It also STAYS hot!</li>
            <li>After using this product, my wig looked like the way I wanted it to when I first got it!</li>
            <li>I bought this waver and it was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Waves looks so natural! :)</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>However, I wanted the first one to be easy and affordable since it would be my daughter&#x27;s first hair iron.</li>
            <li>I NEVER blow-dry my hair, and only do any kind of mild heat-styling once a month or so, and I use heat-protectant spray whenever I do.</li>
            <li>She really likes it, and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is easy to use and creates nice deep crimps.</li>
            <li>Using about 2-3 inches of hair per &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; will leave you with a great looking little wave.</li>
            <li>It gets hot, very hot, but it needs to be in order to quickly wave your hair.</li>
            <li>Professional quality item and packaging easy to handle, as well as enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>You can achieve such an amazing punk,girly,and beach waves.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I would rather spend the extra 5-15 minutes in bed.</li>
            <li>and I have fun with it.</li>
            <li>gives me nice waves in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I had a different kind and brand before and it broke.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s timely but worth it.</li>
            <li>Traditional curling irons never really worked for me, but this contraption is awesome.  </li>
            <li>She is having a lot of fun with it.  </li>
            <li>This will help keep your hair healthy and soft in between waving.</li>
            <li>then it may be worth your while.</li>
            <li>Seldom worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the waver so far</li>
            <li>I love this thing, it works better than the more expensive ones i&#x27;ve bought :)</li>
            <li>and I wanted something to give it some fun.</li>
            <li>This is the product to get if you love soft waves.  </li>
            <li>It has a plastic kind of smell when I pulled it out, that is the only thing I dislike.</li>
            <li>easy to use (although my hand does hurt a bit after i&#x27;ve done my whole head) but the results are exactly what i want.  </li>
            <li>I love this product , the wave is natural and looks beautiful after , I straight little bit my hair before to get define waves after and minder 80&#x27;s looking , don&#x27;t make waves on curly hair .&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does get super hot</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly and adds volume.</li>
            <li>It works well on my hair, gets super hot.</li>
            <li>As a note to the seller this item came super fast, actually shockingly quick.</li>
            <li>, the cord is long but it may fry your hair if you do not use it appropriately !</li>
            <li>I will say that if you do not use the right products before and after, I can see how it makes your hair look damaged.</li>
            <li>I received this product just about 2 hours ago and right away started to do my hair because I had been looking forward to trying out this product for a while.</li>
            <li>but when i do my daughter it doesn&#x27;t come out right</li>
            <li>I had to buy another right away.</li>
            <li>Maybe not as perfectly as I&#x27;d like, but much better than any other in the past.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty fun.  </li>
            <li>This waver surely creates a cute wave however, all of the black plastic began melting and sticking when the waver got hot.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>and although I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, i am beyond impressed with it.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally super straight so once in</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I can do my hair super fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute on my long hair and makes.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and and you can lock it closed foe easy storage.</li>
            <li>I really love this waver the waves last all day and it heats up very fast</li>
            <li>It does have a funny smell every time I use it</li>
            <li>You would definitely want to make sure you&#x27;re using the correct heat level for your hair type.</li>
            <li>LOVE it and will definitely use this!</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I styled her hair the first time to show her how.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how the higher end ones work, but I would recommend giving this one a shot.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more likely to fry your hair than a more expensive 100% ceramic one (I&#x27;m guessing this is just plated?</li>
            <li>It got so hot</li>
            <li>Also you might want to get treseme keritain (red bottle) and treseme smooth (purple bottle) spray to protect your hair from heat damage!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it fried my hair to a crisp.</li>
            <li>so this was one of the first purchases I&#x27;ve made like this.  </li>
            <li>I love the deep waver iron tool.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>But overall, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and she uses this several times a week and her hair looks so cute, some people just need practice or your hair</li>
            <li>And so much volume because I can get to the roots!</li>
            <li>Works like a dream for the first 2 weeks then stops heating up.</li>
            <li>or it gets hot.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it took me forever to unpack this thing.</li>
            <li>You do need to keep this plugged in for about 10 minutes BEFORE use to make sure it is hot enough (which is adjustable on the side).</li>
            <li>Love the deep waves this waver makes.</li>
            <li>they stink though when they are first plugged in...</li>
            <li>they get really hot though, which for me is a plus.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first time I used this tool was a nightmare  my hair frizzed up</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve started to notice through the years which brands to avoid because they do not stay hot.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I did fry a piece of my hair the first time I used it, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it since then</li>
            <li>I did hesitate to order this but did so based upon all the stellar reviews.  </li>
            <li>Even the lowest level seems a bit too hot for my hair, so</li>
            <li>Gets really hot, make my hair smell like burned.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 4 years and after it stopped working</li>
            <li>Yes it gets hot</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Waves last for days and look even better after sleeping on them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the big curls it makes.</li>
            <li>It does smell like chemicals when you first start using it</li>
            <li>and It looks really pretty</li>
            <li>It performs exactly as the description and video said it would -</li>
            <li>I guess this is helpful when you want to let the next door neighbors borrow it! :)</li>
            <li>and it started getting hot again</li>
            <li>I also normally have to wash my hair every day in order to keep my hair looking nice, but this gives my hair such body that it doesn&#x27;t lay against my scalp which fixes the oily greasy hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine is probably at a 2 out of 10 (if the dial was numbered) and that is plenty hot for my hair.</li>
            <li>This crimper can get really hot</li>
            <li>I also use Kenra Platinum hot spray &amp; spray it on each section before waving it...</li>
            <li>AND it looks even better the next day after sleeping on it!</li>
            <li>I use styling lotion first, use the waver and the style lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>- I love this hair wave iron , it actually works</li>
            <li>Works great on thick hair.</li>
            <li>Short wavy hair looks really cute too!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>have you been all my life&amp;#34; ; )</li>
            <li>Yes, it does get pretty hot</li>
            <li>use heat protection to protect your hair from getting damaged because it gets hot.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and reaches a high temperature...</li>
            <li>It does heat quickly, and I haven&#x27;t used it on high because of the texture of her hair</li>
            <li>It is sooooo reasonably priced and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>This gives my hair tons of body and deep waves (not those crinkle crimper-type waves) super fast and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair curls fairly easy, but this product barely made it wave at all.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, stays hot and the swivel cord makes it easy to use with long hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve come to have low expectations of hair tools since my hair is very long and fine - but this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li>So much better than a curling iron, when my curls/waves fall flat in an hour.</li>
            <li>Doing this every day or every other day without some kind of thermal treatment will damage your hair substantially.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many wavers, curling irons, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li>but this one gets hot fast and stays hot</li>
            <li>I always get positive comments on my hair after using this.</li>
            <li>PLUS I am hair-challenged (can&#x27;t even use a curling iron) and pretty much can&#x27;t do anything but straighten it.</li>
            <li>so it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>It heated up pretty fast</li>
            <li>Its super fast, super easy and with hardly no time at all my hair looks like I spent forever on it.</li>
            <li>There is a lock feature to hold down the clamps on its own</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and only takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>This tool is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and makes my hair look naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, course hair &amp; this is the best waver for it!  </li>
            <li>I turn it with a low heat; however it still had the strong order.</li>
            <li>The waves look very pretty and natural.</li>
            <li>Makes really nice soft waves in my daughters long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product , I have very long hair to my low back, after doing nice beach waves it get shorter to my half back , it is definitely great for long hair at last shoulder length to have any effect ,</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick &amp; very long hair and it curls it perfect.</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s mainly my fault though for not realizing that first.</li>
            <li>Big cute waves quick to do short hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a curling iron around the front, but the results aren&#x27;t good (hard to get wavy instead of ringlets) and it takes forever.</li>
            <li>(As a side note, I would recommend using some sort of heat protection creme, spray, whatever on your hair prior to using it because like I said, it gets VERY hot!)</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price this pro tool really works wonders.</li>
            <li>I lightly spray my hair with an aerosol hairspray before using the Speed Waver and the waves last for two days if I don&#x27;t toss and turn too much in the night.  </li>
            <li>I did my whole head in 15 min.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, crimps the hair fast.  </li>
            <li>I was really torn on which waver to get.</li>
            <li>so I went with this one to see how it would go and figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out too much if she never used it.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight so</li>
            <li>So if your hair is naturally straight and you want to change it up a bit I recommend getting this.</li>
            <li>Was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like too much</li>
            <li>so much my friend also bought one.</li>
            <li>AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED MUCH PRODUCT TO HOLD.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning</li>
            <li>I will wear it the whole day, sleep on it, then wake up and don&#x27;t need to retouch it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>They probably sent me a defective one, but it was very underwhelming and dissappointing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>These curls were much funkier and simpler for my hair type.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Smooth Criminal&amp;#34; from Beyond works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the name brand and works so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing my part straight part wavy hair wavy using a waver like this every day for years.</li>
            <li>, this is actually my very</li>
            <li>I feel like because this waver works so well and so fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quicker than curling so when I want a change and to be quicker</li>
            <li>... but it really isn&#x27;t the sort of styling tool I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>thank you i really like how my hair comes out it comes out so wavy</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>Curls fast, too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>did not curl and made my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and well packaged no problems.. was a gift for my sister in law</li>
            <li>it works really</li>
            <li>Not really a waver like the video, more like crimps.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and company!</li>
            <li>and it takes me around 15 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I use it , it takes 10 mintues to do my whole head</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I tried it out as soon as I took it out of the box so this picture is a very half-assed job.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super easy to use and my hair is done in 5 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li>I mainly straighten my hair so its a nice break and less damaging.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this much but the few times I have, it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>, you must pull it through at the right lenght, then relax the hold while you wave the next section so it doesn&#x27;t pull out the first &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>It takes a few times to get it just right, but it looks way cute.</li>
            <li>After my first use, it took less than 10 minutes to wave all the layers of my hair and the waves looked healthy.</li>
            <li>this gets hot soooo quick and only takes 15 mins to finish.</li>
            <li>Creates natural waves that last - works super fast and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t really have time to do much with my hair, but want something a little more than straight!  </li>
            <li>I have fine long super straight hair that can never hold a curl with a traditional curling iron but this speed waver really worked!</li>
            <li>Compliments on my hair all the time, but I had the waver ON in my polder iron station (your supposed to be able to keep irons in the slots while they are on and never had any issues with any of my other irons)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can get VERY HOT and burn your hair if not careful.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone that wants loose waves and easy to use tool.</li>
            <li>hair is long (just below bra length), fine, and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have tons of long, fine hair that, like I said, it part wavy, part</li>
            <li>I am 52, with long hair that is naturally fine and wavy if this helps anyone trying to decide if they want to purchase this.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for gorgeous waves; instead, before I could finish, I noticed that my waves were ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I was seriously considering chopping a good 4 inches off my hair</li>
            <li>I am certain the styles this tool creates are better suited to women half my age.  </li>
            <li>Other wavers I&#x27;ve tried, if I had pieces that were being particularly disobedient, refusing to wave in any cute way, the wavers were just no match for this.</li>
            <li>but she really needed the heat to be on high to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>that being said, definitely make sure you&#x27;re using the right products because it can make your hair look dry.</li>
            <li>so you need to take extra special care of it while using this.</li>
            <li>I went to bed with wet hair (that had wonder waves &amp; sea salt spray in it) and this morning it took me around a half hour to use this iron &amp; get great beachy waves.  </li>
            <li>The plates also have a small section of &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; area that tame my frizz wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It only takes me less than 10 minutes to get really good curls.</li>
            <li>I might buy it again just because I liked how it made my hair look, but only if I find it for a very low price because this is basically disposable junk as far as durability/quality of how it is made.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad purchase</li>
            <li>Start at the bottom with most of your hair pinned up, then pull down sections and run the waver through.</li>
            <li>Granddaughter loves her new waves!</li>
            <li>I have used this deep curler several times and it works great and the waves stay in for a very long period of time and it is not very hard to use.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to burn your hands thinking they&#x27;re cool because they&#x27;re not (hence the 4 stars out of 5)!</li>
            <li>my first iron i bought wasnt hot enough ..</li>
            <li>Better off buying a slightly more expensive version.</li>
            <li>I got this to see how it would work...and the price was decent...</li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this waver and would recommend it to anyone looking for big waves!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought probably ten different wavers in those years, sometimes because one quit working, sometimes because I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with what I had.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to do my whole head in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Other than my hand getting a little sore crimping the plates together, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>After researching several of the wavers, I am glad I went with this less expensive, very effective one!</li>
            <li>after a period of disruption&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need high quality device Please advise me in my request&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t have heat to high or ur hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>... highly recommended</li>
            <li>So much for taking such good care of my long hair for so long.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands that cost roughly $100</li>
            <li>Use this for my little girls and they love it.</li>
            <li>(high heat is waaay too hot) and it only takes about 7 mins to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>did buy for my 7yr old for Christmas who has straight hair.</li>
            <li>have accidentally burned myself with it a few times, but I love the results!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally curl or wave my hair</li>
            <li>I am hassle-free and normally i do the rolled out of bed</li>
            <li>She has thick, shiny hair, and this works great, and holds the curl all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who normally does a lot with my hair.</li>
            <li>Fun deep waves! - beauty blogger</li>
            <li>After that, before pressing firmly on each section to set the style, first lightly glide your section of hair between the plates</li>
            <li>It works really well just be careful with the heat setting because you can and will burn your hair to a crisp if it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>this is more like a wave or messy look.</li>
            <li>and I have long coarse hair that with my curling iron took me more</li>
            <li>The only way I find it useful is if I twirl a section of my hair, and then clamp it in.</li>
            <li>and if it rains I&#x27;m right back to where I started.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>have to used too like any new hair</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one because I couldn&#x27;t find one in store</li>
            <li>Super long cord!  </li>
            <li>It literally takes me under 5 minutes to do my whole head (i DON&#x27;T follow the instructions, and will cram as much hair into that waver as possible to get myself out the door faster).</li>
            <li>Be careful of the ends of your hair since they have a tendency to be more fragile versus the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get the same results by winding your hair around a 1inch barrel curling iron, but this is a tad fast than that even if you don&#x27;t get as much volume.  </li>
            <li>this works way better than i expected, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>VERY NATURAL LOOKING CURL</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, not &amp;#34;crimpy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>completely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Deep Waver the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Prefer regular hot curler.</li>
            <li>I finally tried this and it looks exactly like the waves Khloe had.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write product reviews.</li>
            <li>However, within minutes the light turned off, the waver cooled down, and it never worked again.</li>
            <li>She has long hair and this adds just the right amount of wave without being too curly.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>It took too long to heat up and was not comfortable using on my own hair and on wigs</li>
            <li>you can do large sections of hair or smaller sections depending on your desired look.</li>
            <li>Works better with longer hair just because the waves are a little bigger than some three barrell</li>
            <li>So far, I do like this waver a lot.</li>
            <li>I purchased this upon recommendation from a friend with naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>People asks if my hair is naturally wavy when I use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, 12 years old, but would never have let her use it by herself because of the heat.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my twelve year old hairdresser in training.</li>
            <li>My hair is already naturally wavy</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t completely damage your hair.</li>
            <li>But it was a complete was of money and energy to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up using this nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>but still MUCH faster than a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I wind up with a shiny head of natural looking waves.  </li>
            <li>This is for straight hair only.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 13 year old daughter for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>No problem with the Pro Beauty Tools Professional Speed Waver&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>These have all been professional tools that were within the ranges of $50 to $100.</li>
            <li>Fast and simple to use.</li>
            <li>But my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Overall if you have the time the product works very well.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>have the wand and think that gives a much much prettier curl that last...</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll on my natural hair as well as my weave</li>
            <li>I have a bit of natural curl</li>
            <li>The wave looks so natural.</li>
            <li>So far i have had no problems with it ,</li>
            <li>mi hair feels soft and shines a lot...!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, it ends up frizzy and does not look natural.</li>
            <li>Waver heats up fast, has different setting for cooler or hotter temps.</li>
            <li>I bought it to give my hair a bit more body without spending all day with a curling iron only to flatten out after a few hours or hairspray my head to death.</li>
            <li>Smelled funny the first few times I used it, like a factory in China</li>
            <li>A few hours later it looked even better.</li>
            <li>I love curling my hair, but since my hair is so thick</li>
            <li>It makes really pretty waves and doesnt take very long at all.  </li>
            <li>As one other reviewer mentioned, I don&#x27;t really follow the instructions, I cram as much hair</li>
            <li>The waves hold pretty much all day (without hair spray), but my hair is straight and thick, so I have to leave it on for about 8-10 seconds.</li>
            <li>This tool gets extremely hot wich is a good and bad thing.</li>
            <li>I read some comments on it burning the hair, if you let it sit on a certain part of your hair for too long it will start smoking and give your hair a burnt smell.</li>
            <li>As previous posts said there is no protection against burns and this curler gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Works fast on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>It does work really well and has a long cord which I like.</li>
            <li>it heats up really fast, has adjustable heat levels, &amp; you dont have to keep it on your hair for long either.</li>
            <li>The product itself isn&#x27;t TOO big like some of the other full size</li>
            <li>This is a cool tool to use if you want to do something different with your hair other than curl or straighten it.</li>
            <li>Ok, I waited a while before posting a review because I wanted to see if it really worked, especially for my long thick hair... and?</li>
            <li>The Only thing is the handle, not too comfortable, its kinda heavy</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair and in 5 minutes I have my entire head styled and out the door.</li>
            <li>Only takes about 15 minutes to complete my whole head and my hair is over 20 inches long.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool, but like the flat iron or curling irons, it&#x27;s not great for your hair</li>
            <li>People who say it burns their hair must be turning it up too high or holding it on their hair too long - I&#x27;ve never had that problem.</li>
            <li>This things sucks got it exactly when it was supposed to (thanks to amazon)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Me hair is extremely straight hair, and my look last all day long.</li>
            <li>People always think it&#x27;s natural and tell me they are jealous, then I tell them it is the Deep waiver!</li>
            <li>Only takes about the minutes and it looks like natural beach waves.</li>
            <li>no regrets</li>
            <li>It was only 6 months old when it wouldn&#x27;t heat up anymore.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and it barely waved her hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to curl my thick, long hair in approx.</li>
            <li>it wan worth buying.</li>
            <li>I just received my &amp;#34;Pro Beauty Tools Professional Speed Waver&amp;#34; and I love it, coming from someone who is terrible at doing her own hair.</li>
            <li>When I use this iron my hand gets pretty worn out by holding the clamps down.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it my hair was all the way down to my butt</li>
            <li>She has super long and thick hair that is straight.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE MY HAIR IS SUPER THIN AND STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li>The waver worked fine as far as waving my hair, I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty much I can tame it with a flat iron or tie it back.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a heat protector on your hair before hand and making quick krimps in small sections.</li>
            <li>I own another waver that does smaller curls and, although I like it, the curls were just a little too small for me.</li>
            <li>A little hard to do on your own head though.</li>
            <li>It does NOT have an auto-shut off, so be very conscious to unplug it after you&#x27;re done, locking the plates and not winding the cord around the barrels since it will damage it in the long run.</li>
            <li>And I use professional flat irons in my polder that reach temperatures that are hotter than what the Pro beauty waver was supposed to reach.</li>
            <li>I have very long (halfway down my back, all one length), stick-straight, fair but thick hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make pretty waves, it makes tight zig-zags.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little cumbersome to work with since the plates get so hot, and the &amp;#34;cool tip&amp;#34; ends aren&#x27;t what they say they are.</li>
            <li>When I use a normal curling iron it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>It makes my so somewhat thin  hair look very full.  </li>
            <li>reasons unknown- lasts way longer than normal curls.  </li>
            <li>and I found it for 23, almost exactly like the one I had borrowed and t seen at Sallys but for less!  </li>
            <li>I have used other tools in a high temp and it has never damaged my hair like this tool.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, so I used this product on the lowest setting.</li>

            <li> Works great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I love it!</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, and great waves - this is awesome!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair looking amazing.</li>
            <li> This is so amazing.</li>
            <li> but once she did her hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> its amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how amazing my hair looks.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s amazing to be done in that amount of time.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works great!</li>
            <li> this one had the best price, so I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it that I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting as much money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try nice wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I liked it and the curls it made.</li>
            <li> Gives me nice waves without the frizz.</li>
            <li> She liked the way my hair looked.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is, this gives you a wonderful head of waves but it doesn&#x27;t really look like you &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they are nice curled up</li>
            <li> and it kind of burns my hair and hers too</li>
            <li> This creates the kind of waves you get when you braid your hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well, leaves a beautiful wave!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even all that adept at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> It comes out nice</li>
            <li> and I had to have them for my own hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was told by a friend (who gave me her honest opinion, which Im thankful for) that I looked like a 16 y.o.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. and very chip..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great value!</li>
            <li> My hair comes out nice and defined and crimped the way it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> it works awesome that way and holds really well</li>
            <li> It works nice but it has a smell when you crimp your hair.</li>
            <li> Quick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, was easy to use, and made awesome waves!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Good waver if your wanting it for a date or outing ,but it makes your hair stink ,it frys and damages your hair ,but it good if your looking for a quick hairstyle</li>
            <li> I guarantee you will love it! :)</li>
            <li> I tend to forget so make sure to unplug after each use to be safe!</li>
            <li> This is such a great waver for a really good price!  </li>
            <li> I love to use this about 3-4 days after washing my hair to give it great body and fun waves!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT waver and for such a good price!</li>
            <li> She loved it so that was fine with me, after all it was her</li>
            <li> Even when you get in a hurry and cram more hair in than you should, it still looks amazing.</li>
            <li> For those who have had success with it, that is great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this, its totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Maybe best for a professional who can use it correctly.</li>
            <li> so I know how much I have turned it and where the ideal wheel position is for me.</li>
            <li> nice and style your hair with mins i love it</li>
            <li> I watched the tutorial and I liked the most the glam waves, so I followed the steps from the video</li>
            <li> how quickly I was able to do my hair, and 2) the great quality/hold of the waves.</li>
            <li> So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  </li>
            <li> Too easy with good shap really love love love it and all my friend ask about it they want to make orders</li>
            <li> I really do like how it looked though, beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> This has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; tool for a fast, beautiful look.  </li>
            <li> Works great and is super easy gives you the wave look in minutes</li>
            <li> The curler is quite handy and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Nice tool and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Delivery was exactly as advised and I absolutely LOVE the device!!</li>
            <li> ITS SUPER AWESOME AND WORKS FAST</li>
            <li> So fast to use and creates a great look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.  </li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;crimper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this one melted the top of the polder station in the slot it was in.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this waver</li>
            <li> The best part is the waves actually STAY!  </li>
            <li> She figured out that for school, she can just wave the top layer and still get the desired look without having to fool with all the hair underneath that would take longer.</li>
            <li> And do not hold a section for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> but it can be more of a hassle</li>
            <li> Overall one of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The curls were just ok.</li>
            <li> I can make better ones with my straightener.</li>
            <li> and it sure makes our hair look thicker</li>
            <li> I love the size of the waves this leaves.</li>
            <li> but this just adds to it and gives me hair more volume as well.</li>
            <li> so yes make sure you use a hair protector</li>
            <li> I love this waver.  </li>
            <li> Extremely glad I got this.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll have more luck if your hair is thicker, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get many compliments about it.</li>
            <li> But that aside, it works like it says it does, and makes lovely waves.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> gives me two-three days of a cute hairstyle (I have oily hair</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> she has already used it many times.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair appliance that I have, and my collection includes 2 curling wands and a Miracurl.  </li>
            <li> It gives great beachy waves that you can do a million things with and the process was much quicker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be using it every day, but maybe once every week or two. :)</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends love this :)</li>
            <li> Love how the waves are loose/flowy &amp; not kinky, my hair stays wavy all day</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I love the wave this give my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I would spend more money and get something nicer</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use TONS of heat protectant and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the 9 feet rubber cord ..</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This is a great way to achieve that without much fuss.  </li>
            <li> Instead, you have to wait until it cools, before you can put it on top of any surface.</li>
            <li> recommend it..but make sure to check out level of heat to avoid damage</li>
            <li> It is ok, it does the job</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this Pro Tools</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the way my hair looks after using this.</li>
            <li> Ok so pending on what type of hair you have this tool can be sent from heaven, or the devil himself.</li>
            <li> is one of the best deep wavers I&#x27;ve used yet--bar none!</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more :)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use it at the hottest setting though because that&#x27;s damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love the wave it gives you, people always ask me what I use to wave my hair.</li>

            <li> waves well and is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> This heats up really fast and it works great.</li>
            <li> This waver makes my hair look phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I imagine that it works better on longer hair</li>
            <li> I went to Vegas with my friend and she had one like this and upon borrowing hers I feel in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I love my hair</li>

            <li> I love using this.</li>
            <li> Item works ok , once it did not heat up</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a wig that was supposed to be body waves, but it looked more like a bush.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair turns out when completed</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love this waver.</li>

            <li> im able to do it faster</li>
            <li> I also got many complements.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This deep wave crimper works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you want to look 1990&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use the tresseme heat protector that i love.</li>
            <li> amazing , makes super cute waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light and easy to maneuver/handle when using.  </li>
            <li> i loved this tool for the first four months i had it.  </li>
            <li> This is best for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> Best for long hair.  </li>
            <li> when it hits hair-- just use your best judgment on how long you want to keep it on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, but my waves don&#x27;t come out perfectly when I braid it.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it was a pretty good iron.</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> More importantly, it is easy for me to use</li>
            <li> I decided to give myself more waves/curls but the easy way.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I will use this on semi-wet to dry hair and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I find the best way it works for me is when I wash my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Love the curls and the waver is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this Waver, it is fast,gets the job done fast, people told me loved my hair.</li>
            <li> Loved the results on the back of my hair, but if you have layers like I do, it will be fairly poufy and unless you wanna look 90, you might wanna skip this.</li>
            <li> Its OK, its large!!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite styling item!!</li>
            <li> It was a very good purchase and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very cool waver.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected, perfect!</li>
            <li> It worked really well, and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Based on all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to using this waver.</li>
            <li> Thanks, the price is good.</li>
            <li> I got it for a good price and it works very well</li>
            <li> So quick and easy to make beachy waves!  </li>
            <li> This is SUCH a good styling tool!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure how to use it, go on youtube as there are tons of videos out there to show you how easy it</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has a range of heat options.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Now, it takes longer, but it&#x27;s so easy to curl my hair now.</li>
            <li> This tool heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> its easy to use as has a gfood lock</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it has a strong order when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> The cord is super long, so it makes it extremely easy to get an awesome wave all over.</li>
            <li> Such a good product at such a great price!  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results (nice body, pretty waves), but I wouldn&#x27;t say fast or easy.</li>
            <li> My hair is just down to my shoulder and it looks great!</li>
            <li> I love this feature as it makes the waver super easy to store away.  </li>
            <li> This gives a perfect beachy look in a few minutes! :)  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> As far as how it treats your hair, a heat protection spray is ideal, if you don&#x27;t have one, here is what you should do: after your tool is finished warming up, first press a towel between the plates to release any over heating on the surface of the plates that can burn your hair.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of locks of hair that are sometimes fine</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful hairdo in less than 10 minutes (note:</li>
            <li> Maybe my daughter&#x27;s hair is just too fine</li>
            <li> Came quick!</li>
            <li> Shipping to Italy was so quick!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair tremendous amount of volume, and I&#x27;m always so confident when I go out with my hair styled with this</li>
            <li> Quick and carefree waves!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This gadget is saving me money because I don&#x27;t have to get my highlights as often, you really can&#x27;t tell when its all curled up, most just think my hair is ombre!</li>
            <li> This Speed Waver heats up very fast and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am super careful with my hair and have never ever experienced this with any kind of heat-styling product before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best styling tool hands down that I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> BUT IT MAKES FOR HUGE HAIR</li>
            <li> I love the waves, it look nice and natural.</li>
            <li> GET THEM ALL &amp; ENJOY</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t meant to be crimped like mine but excellent quality and isn&#x27;t harsh on her hair.</li>
            <li> The curls turn out really nice, however, it really does damage hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this tool because it&#x27;s a great price and works well.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend a great shampoo and conditioner, and actually leave the conditioner on about 10 minutes before washing it out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap and works well so get it.</li>
            <li> I almost bought a similar iron for $30.00 and I&#x27;m do happy I found this.</li>
            <li> It is everything I hoped for and more, and was totally worth my money.</li>
            <li> I wish hair was damage free</li>
            <li> Works just as good or BETTER than the Bed head deep waver!!</li>
            <li> so I am going to have to experiment more, but I thought it did a good job overall.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and only takes me like 10 or 15 minutes to get beautiful waves!</li>
            <li> it was pretty easy to do and neat!</li>
            <li> It waves your hair fast btw !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because it was very affordable and because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I t did the job, but I love the older models better</li>
            <li> There are certainly others on the market that look good, but at a higher price</li>
            <li> Super easy to use; I did all my hair in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a heat protect spray,  I like hot off the press by Paul Mitchell it adds shine, volume and most importantly will prevent damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for quick, easy styles.</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use but BE CAUTIOUS when using - tool gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> It was not user friendly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is okay for the price, I suppose and if you are willing to work with it</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the reason that it works the best of any I&#x27;ve tried or not.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughters with long hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product on my hair and it works nicely!</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Really nice I live it</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had is some kind of stand, so you can safely set it on the counter.</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves me looking like I got my hair professionally done and fast</li>
            <li> but most importantly it works really fast</li>
            <li> have used the Speed Waver MANY times since I received it and have never had such amazing hair.</li>
            <li> But this little iron is fast becoming my best friend.  </li>
            <li> Gave me great, loose waves.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gets hot enough to make nice waves!</li>
            <li> , curling is a &#x27;special occasion&#x27; hairdo.</li>
            <li> Creates very nice loose waves.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous beach waves that last!</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> I love it sooooo much ...</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long, so watching the video really is helpful on best practices.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves the look too :).</li>
            <li> and this makes it look full of volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied and I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a waver not a crimper.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of unused curling products, but this is my go-to product now.  </li>
            <li> The waves stay in all day and make my hair so full.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other words to describe it, I love it!</li>
            <li> Seriously - the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It works well and quick.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry you can quickly get some beach waves.</li>
            <li> The waver did not burn my hair and is quick to use.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, as well.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does the job,  but there is a funky smell when it&#x27;s heated up.</li>
            <li> but that smell wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> and yes it did wave the hair quickly</li>
            <li> For the outstanding prices, I would say this is  definite buy :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair very pretty..</li>
            <li> Then, the first time I plugged in the waver, the light came on and the waver heated up.</li>
            <li> It gives great big waves that look very beachy and fun.  </li>
            <li> The waver can get very very hot</li>
            <li> Very pretty &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super straight so the waves you see in my picture is all from the tool!!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t do that this way you switch each wave down not all of them to get great beach waves including the end of the hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy I checked the previous reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works fast.</li>
            <li> The reviews were saying it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The process if fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> So fun and quick to use on medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Well, this product definitely makes it easy to make your hair look super cute.</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly you can get through a whole head of hair with this waver and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on the results of using this tool to style my hair, but it is made very cheaply.  </li>
            <li> I HAD MY WHOLE HEAD DONE IN 15 MINUTES !!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product so far!</li>
            <li> It also STAYS hot!</li>
            <li> After using this product, my wig looked like the way I wanted it to when I first got it!</li>
            <li> I bought this waver and it was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Waves looks so natural! :)</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> However, I wanted the first one to be easy and affordable since it would be my daughter&#x27;s first hair iron.</li>
            <li> I NEVER blow-dry my hair, and only do any kind of mild heat-styling once a month or so, and I use heat-protectant spray whenever I do.</li>
            <li> She really likes it, and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is easy to use and creates nice deep crimps.</li>
            <li> Using about 2-3 inches of hair per &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; will leave you with a great looking little wave.</li>
            <li> It gets hot, very hot, but it needs to be in order to quickly wave your hair.</li>
            <li> Professional quality item and packaging easy to handle, as well as enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> You can achieve such an amazing punk,girly,and beach waves.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I would rather spend the extra 5-15 minutes in bed.</li>
            <li> and I have fun with it.</li>
            <li> gives me nice waves in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I had a different kind and brand before and it broke.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s timely but worth it.</li>
            <li> Traditional curling irons never really worked for me, but this contraption is awesome.  </li>
            <li> She is having a lot of fun with it.  </li>
            <li> This will help keep your hair healthy and soft in between waving.</li>
            <li> then it may be worth your while.</li>
            <li> Seldom worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the waver so far</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it works better than the more expensive ones i&#x27;ve bought :)</li>
            <li> and I wanted something to give it some fun.</li>
            <li> This is the product to get if you love soft waves.  </li>
            <li> It has a plastic kind of smell when I pulled it out, that is the only thing I dislike.</li>
            <li> easy to use (although my hand does hurt a bit after i&#x27;ve done my whole head) but the results are exactly what i want.  </li>
            <li> I love this product , the wave is natural and looks beautiful after , I straight little bit my hair before to get define waves after and minder 80&#x27;s looking , don&#x27;t make waves on curly hair .&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does get super hot</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly and adds volume.</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair, gets super hot.</li>
            <li> As a note to the seller this item came super fast, actually shockingly quick.</li>
            <li> , the cord is long but it may fry your hair if you do not use it appropriately !</li>
            <li> I will say that if you do not use the right products before and after, I can see how it makes your hair look damaged.</li>
            <li> I received this product just about 2 hours ago and right away started to do my hair because I had been looking forward to trying out this product for a while.</li>
            <li> but when i do my daughter it doesn&#x27;t come out right</li>
            <li> I had to buy another right away.</li>
            <li> Maybe not as perfectly as I&#x27;d like, but much better than any other in the past.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty fun.  </li>
            <li> This waver surely creates a cute wave however, all of the black plastic began melting and sticking when the waver got hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, i am beyond impressed with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally super straight so once in</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I can do my hair super fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute on my long hair and makes.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and and you can lock it closed foe easy storage.</li>
            <li> I really love this waver the waves last all day and it heats up very fast</li>
            <li> It does have a funny smell every time I use it</li>
            <li> You would definitely want to make sure you&#x27;re using the correct heat level for your hair type.</li>
            <li> LOVE it and will definitely use this!</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I styled her hair the first time to show her how.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how the higher end ones work, but I would recommend giving this one a shot.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more likely to fry your hair than a more expensive 100% ceramic one (I&#x27;m guessing this is just plated?</li>
            <li> It got so hot</li>
            <li> Also you might want to get treseme keritain (red bottle) and treseme smooth (purple bottle) spray to protect your hair from heat damage!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it fried my hair to a crisp.</li>
            <li> so this was one of the first purchases I&#x27;ve made like this.  </li>
            <li> I love the deep waver iron tool.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> But overall, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> and she uses this several times a week and her hair looks so cute, some people just need practice or your hair</li>
            <li> And so much volume because I can get to the roots!</li>
            <li> Works like a dream for the first 2 weeks then stops heating up.</li>
            <li> or it gets hot.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it took me forever to unpack this thing.</li>
            <li> You do need to keep this plugged in for about 10 minutes BEFORE use to make sure it is hot enough (which is adjustable on the side).</li>
            <li> Love the deep waves this waver makes.</li>
            <li> they stink though when they are first plugged in...</li>
            <li> they get really hot though, which for me is a plus.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this tool was a nightmare  my hair frizzed up</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve started to notice through the years which brands to avoid because they do not stay hot.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I did fry a piece of my hair the first time I used it, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it since then</li>
            <li> I did hesitate to order this but did so based upon all the stellar reviews.  </li>
            <li> Even the lowest level seems a bit too hot for my hair, so</li>
            <li> Gets really hot, make my hair smell like burned.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 4 years and after it stopped working</li>
            <li> Yes it gets hot</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Waves last for days and look even better after sleeping on them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the big curls it makes.</li>
            <li> It does smell like chemicals when you first start using it</li>
            <li> and It looks really pretty</li>
            <li> It performs exactly as the description and video said it would -</li>
            <li> I guess this is helpful when you want to let the next door neighbors borrow it! :)</li>
            <li> and it started getting hot again</li>
            <li> I also normally have to wash my hair every day in order to keep my hair looking nice, but this gives my hair such body that it doesn&#x27;t lay against my scalp which fixes the oily greasy hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine is probably at a 2 out of 10 (if the dial was numbered) and that is plenty hot for my hair.</li>
            <li> This crimper can get really hot</li>
            <li> I also use Kenra Platinum hot spray &amp; spray it on each section before waving it...</li>
            <li> AND it looks even better the next day after sleeping on it!</li>
            <li> I use styling lotion first, use the waver and the style lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> - I love this hair wave iron , it actually works</li>
            <li> Works great on thick hair.</li>
            <li> Short wavy hair looks really cute too!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> have you been all my life&amp;#34; ; )</li>
            <li> Yes, it does get pretty hot</li>
            <li> use heat protection to protect your hair from getting damaged because it gets hot.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and reaches a high temperature...</li>
            <li> It does heat quickly, and I haven&#x27;t used it on high because of the texture of her hair</li>
            <li> It is sooooo reasonably priced and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> This gives my hair tons of body and deep waves (not those crinkle crimper-type waves) super fast and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair curls fairly easy, but this product barely made it wave at all.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, stays hot and the swivel cord makes it easy to use with long hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve come to have low expectations of hair tools since my hair is very long and fine - but this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li> So much better than a curling iron, when my curls/waves fall flat in an hour.</li>
            <li> Doing this every day or every other day without some kind of thermal treatment will damage your hair substantially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many wavers, curling irons, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li> but this one gets hot fast and stays hot</li>
            <li> I always get positive comments on my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> PLUS I am hair-challenged (can&#x27;t even use a curling iron) and pretty much can&#x27;t do anything but straighten it.</li>
            <li> so it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> It heated up pretty fast</li>
            <li> Its super fast, super easy and with hardly no time at all my hair looks like I spent forever on it.</li>
            <li> There is a lock feature to hold down the clamps on its own</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and only takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This tool is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes my hair look naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, course hair &amp; this is the best waver for it!  </li>
            <li> I turn it with a low heat; however it still had the strong order.</li>
            <li> The waves look very pretty and natural.</li>
            <li> Makes really nice soft waves in my daughters long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product , I have very long hair to my low back, after doing nice beach waves it get shorter to my half back , it is definitely great for long hair at last shoulder length to have any effect ,</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick &amp; very long hair and it curls it perfect.</li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s mainly my fault though for not realizing that first.</li>
            <li> Big cute waves quick to do short hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a curling iron around the front, but the results aren&#x27;t good (hard to get wavy instead of ringlets) and it takes forever.</li>
            <li> (As a side note, I would recommend using some sort of heat protection creme, spray, whatever on your hair prior to using it because like I said, it gets VERY hot!)</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price this pro tool really works wonders.</li>
            <li> I lightly spray my hair with an aerosol hairspray before using the Speed Waver and the waves last for two days if I don&#x27;t toss and turn too much in the night.  </li>
            <li> I did my whole head in 15 min.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, crimps the hair fast.  </li>
            <li> I was really torn on which waver to get.</li>
            <li> so I went with this one to see how it would go and figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out too much if she never used it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight so</li>
            <li> So if your hair is naturally straight and you want to change it up a bit I recommend getting this.</li>
            <li> Was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like too much</li>
            <li> so much my friend also bought one.</li>
            <li> AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED MUCH PRODUCT TO HOLD.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning</li>
            <li> I will wear it the whole day, sleep on it, then wake up and don&#x27;t need to retouch it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> straight</li>
            <li> They probably sent me a defective one, but it was very underwhelming and dissappointing.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> These curls were much funkier and simpler for my hair type.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Smooth Criminal&amp;#34; from Beyond works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the name brand and works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my part straight part wavy hair wavy using a waver like this every day for years.</li>
            <li> , this is actually my very</li>
            <li> I feel like because this waver works so well and so fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quicker than curling so when I want a change and to be quicker</li>
            <li> ... but it really isn&#x27;t the sort of styling tool I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> thank you i really like how my hair comes out it comes out so wavy</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> Curls fast, too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> did not curl and made my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and well packaged no problems.. was a gift for my sister in law</li>
            <li> it works really</li>
            <li> Not really a waver like the video, more like crimps.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and company!</li>
            <li> and it takes me around 15 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I use it , it takes 10 mintues to do my whole head</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I tried it out as soon as I took it out of the box so this picture is a very half-assed job.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super easy to use and my hair is done in 5 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> I mainly straighten my hair so its a nice break and less damaging.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much but the few times I have, it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> , you must pull it through at the right lenght, then relax the hold while you wave the next section so it doesn&#x27;t pull out the first &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get it just right, but it looks way cute.</li>
            <li> After my first use, it took less than 10 minutes to wave all the layers of my hair and the waves looked healthy.</li>
            <li> this gets hot soooo quick and only takes 15 mins to finish.</li>
            <li> Creates natural waves that last - works super fast and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t really have time to do much with my hair, but want something a little more than straight!  </li>
            <li> I have fine long super straight hair that can never hold a curl with a traditional curling iron but this speed waver really worked!</li>
            <li> Compliments on my hair all the time, but I had the waver ON in my polder iron station (your supposed to be able to keep irons in the slots while they are on and never had any issues with any of my other irons)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can get VERY HOT and burn your hair if not careful.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone that wants loose waves and easy to use tool.</li>
            <li> hair is long (just below bra length), fine, and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have tons of long, fine hair that, like I said, it part wavy, part</li>
            <li> I am 52, with long hair that is naturally fine and wavy if this helps anyone trying to decide if they want to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for gorgeous waves; instead, before I could finish, I noticed that my waves were ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering chopping a good 4 inches off my hair</li>
            <li> I am certain the styles this tool creates are better suited to women half my age.  </li>
            <li> Other wavers I&#x27;ve tried, if I had pieces that were being particularly disobedient, refusing to wave in any cute way, the wavers were just no match for this.</li>
            <li> but she really needed the heat to be on high to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> that being said, definitely make sure you&#x27;re using the right products because it can make your hair look dry.</li>
            <li> so you need to take extra special care of it while using this.</li>
            <li> I went to bed with wet hair (that had wonder waves &amp; sea salt spray in it) and this morning it took me around a half hour to use this iron &amp; get great beachy waves.  </li>
            <li> The plates also have a small section of &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; area that tame my frizz wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> It only takes me less than 10 minutes to get really good curls.</li>
            <li> I might buy it again just because I liked how it made my hair look, but only if I find it for a very low price because this is basically disposable junk as far as durability/quality of how it is made.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad purchase</li>
            <li> Start at the bottom with most of your hair pinned up, then pull down sections and run the waver through.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves her new waves!</li>
            <li> I have used this deep curler several times and it works great and the waves stay in for a very long period of time and it is not very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to burn your hands thinking they&#x27;re cool because they&#x27;re not (hence the 4 stars out of 5)!</li>
            <li> my first iron i bought wasnt hot enough ..</li>
            <li> Better off buying a slightly more expensive version.</li>
            <li> I got this to see how it would work...and the price was decent...</li>
            <li> Overall, I really love this waver and would recommend it to anyone looking for big waves!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought probably ten different wavers in those years, sometimes because one quit working, sometimes because I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with what I had.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to do my whole head in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Other than my hand getting a little sore crimping the plates together, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> After researching several of the wavers, I am glad I went with this less expensive, very effective one!</li>
            <li> after a period of disruption&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need high quality device Please advise me in my request&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t have heat to high or ur hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> ... highly recommended</li>
            <li> So much for taking such good care of my long hair for so long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands that cost roughly $100</li>
            <li> Use this for my little girls and they love it.</li>
            <li> (high heat is waaay too hot) and it only takes about 7 mins to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> did buy for my 7yr old for Christmas who has straight hair.</li>
            <li> have accidentally burned myself with it a few times, but I love the results!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally curl or wave my hair</li>
            <li> I am hassle-free and normally i do the rolled out of bed</li>
            <li> She has thick, shiny hair, and this works great, and holds the curl all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who normally does a lot with my hair.</li>
            <li> Fun deep waves! - beauty blogger</li>
            <li> After that, before pressing firmly on each section to set the style, first lightly glide your section of hair between the plates</li>
            <li> It works really well just be careful with the heat setting because you can and will burn your hair to a crisp if it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> this is more like a wave or messy look.</li>
            <li> and I have long coarse hair that with my curling iron took me more</li>
            <li> The only way I find it useful is if I twirl a section of my hair, and then clamp it in.</li>
            <li> and if it rains I&#x27;m right back to where I started.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> have to used too like any new hair</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one because I couldn&#x27;t find one in store</li>
            <li> Super long cord!  </li>
            <li> It literally takes me under 5 minutes to do my whole head (i DON&#x27;T follow the instructions, and will cram as much hair into that waver as possible to get myself out the door faster).</li>
            <li> Be careful of the ends of your hair since they have a tendency to be more fragile versus the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get the same results by winding your hair around a 1inch barrel curling iron, but this is a tad fast than that even if you don&#x27;t get as much volume.  </li>
            <li> this works way better than i expected, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> VERY NATURAL LOOKING CURL</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, not &amp;#34;crimpy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> completely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Deep Waver the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Prefer regular hot curler.</li>
            <li> I finally tried this and it looks exactly like the waves Khloe had.  </li>
            <li> I usually never write product reviews.</li>
            <li> However, within minutes the light turned off, the waver cooled down, and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> She has long hair and this adds just the right amount of wave without being too curly.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> It took too long to heat up and was not comfortable using on my own hair and on wigs</li>
            <li> you can do large sections of hair or smaller sections depending on your desired look.</li>
            <li> Works better with longer hair just because the waves are a little bigger than some three barrell</li>
            <li> So far, I do like this waver a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this upon recommendation from a friend with naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> People asks if my hair is naturally wavy when I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, 12 years old, but would never have let her use it by herself because of the heat.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my twelve year old hairdresser in training.</li>
            <li> My hair is already naturally wavy</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t completely damage your hair.</li>
            <li> But it was a complete was of money and energy to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up using this nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> but still MUCH faster than a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I wind up with a shiny head of natural looking waves.  </li>
            <li> This is for straight hair only.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 13 year old daughter for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> No problem with the Pro Beauty Tools Professional Speed Waver&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> These have all been professional tools that were within the ranges of $50 to $100.</li>
            <li> Fast and simple to use.</li>
            <li> But my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Overall if you have the time the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> have the wand and think that gives a much much prettier curl that last...</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll on my natural hair as well as my weave</li>
            <li> I have a bit of natural curl</li>
            <li> The wave looks so natural.</li>
            <li> So far i have had no problems with it ,</li>
            <li> mi hair feels soft and shines a lot...!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either way, it ends up frizzy and does not look natural.</li>
            <li> Waver heats up fast, has different setting for cooler or hotter temps.</li>
            <li> I bought it to give my hair a bit more body without spending all day with a curling iron only to flatten out after a few hours or hairspray my head to death.</li>
            <li> Smelled funny the first few times I used it, like a factory in China</li>
            <li> A few hours later it looked even better.</li>
            <li> I love curling my hair, but since my hair is so thick</li>
            <li> It makes really pretty waves and doesnt take very long at all.  </li>
            <li> As one other reviewer mentioned, I don&#x27;t really follow the instructions, I cram as much hair</li>
            <li> The waves hold pretty much all day (without hair spray), but my hair is straight and thick, so I have to leave it on for about 8-10 seconds.</li>
            <li> This tool gets extremely hot wich is a good and bad thing.</li>
            <li> I read some comments on it burning the hair, if you let it sit on a certain part of your hair for too long it will start smoking and give your hair a burnt smell.</li>
            <li> As previous posts said there is no protection against burns and this curler gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Works fast on my long hair.  </li>
            <li> It does work really well and has a long cord which I like.</li>
            <li> it heats up really fast, has adjustable heat levels, &amp; you dont have to keep it on your hair for long either.</li>
            <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t TOO big like some of the other full size</li>
            <li> This is a cool tool to use if you want to do something different with your hair other than curl or straighten it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I waited a while before posting a review because I wanted to see if it really worked, especially for my long thick hair... and?</li>
            <li> The Only thing is the handle, not too comfortable, its kinda heavy</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and in 5 minutes I have my entire head styled and out the door.</li>
            <li> Only takes about 15 minutes to complete my whole head and my hair is over 20 inches long.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool, but like the flat iron or curling irons, it&#x27;s not great for your hair</li>
            <li> People who say it burns their hair must be turning it up too high or holding it on their hair too long - I&#x27;ve never had that problem.</li>
            <li> This things sucks got it exactly when it was supposed to (thanks to amazon)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Me hair is extremely straight hair, and my look last all day long.</li>
            <li> People always think it&#x27;s natural and tell me they are jealous, then I tell them it is the Deep waiver!</li>
            <li> Only takes about the minutes and it looks like natural beach waves.</li>
            <li> no regrets</li>
            <li> It was only 6 months old when it wouldn&#x27;t heat up anymore.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it barely waved her hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to curl my thick, long hair in approx.</li>
            <li> it wan worth buying.</li>
            <li> I just received my &amp;#34;Pro Beauty Tools Professional Speed Waver&amp;#34; and I love it, coming from someone who is terrible at doing her own hair.</li>
            <li> When I use this iron my hand gets pretty worn out by holding the clamps down.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it my hair was all the way down to my butt</li>
            <li> She has super long and thick hair that is straight.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE MY HAIR IS SUPER THIN AND STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> The waver worked fine as far as waving my hair, I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty much I can tame it with a flat iron or tie it back.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a heat protector on your hair before hand and making quick krimps in small sections.</li>
            <li> I own another waver that does smaller curls and, although I like it, the curls were just a little too small for me.</li>
            <li> A little hard to do on your own head though.</li>
            <li> It does NOT have an auto-shut off, so be very conscious to unplug it after you&#x27;re done, locking the plates and not winding the cord around the barrels since it will damage it in the long run.</li>
            <li> And I use professional flat irons in my polder that reach temperatures that are hotter than what the Pro beauty waver was supposed to reach.</li>
            <li> I have very long (halfway down my back, all one length), stick-straight, fair but thick hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make pretty waves, it makes tight zig-zags.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little cumbersome to work with since the plates get so hot, and the &amp;#34;cool tip&amp;#34; ends aren&#x27;t what they say they are.</li>
            <li> When I use a normal curling iron it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> It makes my so somewhat thin  hair look very full.  </li>
            <li> reasons unknown- lasts way longer than normal curls.  </li>
            <li> and I found it for 23, almost exactly like the one I had borrowed and t seen at Sallys but for less!  </li>
            <li> I have used other tools in a high temp and it has never damaged my hair like this tool.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, so I used this product on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I bought this Speed Waver for my 12 year old daughter, who has thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple waving tools on my hair which is extremely thick and most just damage my hair after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and none of the waves came out right.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and holds curl extremely well and still didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super clumsy and burned myself already!</li>
            <li> all the ones I&#x27;ve tried - Revlon, Tondeo, Babyliss (though not the new Babyliss deep waver), to name a few</li>
            <li> have really really long hair and only takes me about 15 minuets of so to get it done.</li>
            <li> Depending on the thickness or thinness of your hair shaft, you will need to gauge for yourself how long to keep the tool applied to each section for a wave to hold, but I would recommend somewhere around 3-5 seconds, especially if you are not using a heat protection spray.</li>
            <li> That product was big, bulky and hard to handle/use - plus it wasn&#x27;t really giving me the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and we have had a hard time finding an iron that will make lasting curls in her hair because it is so straight.  </li>
            <li> Get too darn hot to touch even the black tip to help hold tight.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t usually take curls well, so a normal curling iron doesn&#x27;t last long on my hair.  </li>
            <li> its loose and wavy can make it look bigger by sectioning in parts.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick long &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; hair, so I can make a few clamps of this waver down the top layer of my hair (in 2 -3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although I was able to peel the melted plastic off it, I threw the iron away because I felt it was dangerous.  </li>
            <li> but it just looked stupid AND with good hair protectors in place it still fried my hair, and I had it on the medium setting.</li>
            <li> but I dont use the lock often my hair is long 18 inches.</li>
            <li> if you have long hair like me, it will take like 30-35 min to do.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and with this waver i literally probably take 15-20 minutes to do all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long (waist-length) hair and in about 5 minutes I can style it to where I get compliments all day long.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a style that took so long.</li>
            <li> Depending on how long your hair is it can take a while to curl/wave your hair with this...</li>
            <li> I felt that it hurt my hand because I had to hold it in one place for son long.</li>
            <li> The cord is really long</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that there really is no burn guard, or anything like that</li>
            <li> Not wild about how the waves came out at all.  </li>
            <li> Lasts all day long</li>
            <li> For the money I spent on this crimper, it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get the waves in the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost waist long</li>
            <li> The curls stay for a long time.  </li>
            <li> i had long hair and was exited to get it to try it</li>
            <li> It has big ends and have to be careful to not burn self</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, straight, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a little more expensive</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take long to make the curls!</li>
            <li> She could easily use my other heated hair tools, but this one was even difficult for me to maneuver without burning myself.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt take very long to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long course hair.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t even blow dry it)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product damage my hair and make it so dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a Ross store a few months ago for around the same price listed here and found it here on Amazon when I was looking for a second one to use at work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the same problem with a traditional curling iron or flat iron, so I&#x27;m not sure what it is with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair every single day.</li>
            <li> I used a root pump and heat protector and blew dry my hair upside down for extra body.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which I usually straighten.</li>
            <li> I have flat, straight, thin, do nothing, hold no curl hair.</li>
            <li> No massive amount of &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34; needed to clamp the plates down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT I had a very unfortunate haircut and wearing it straight &amp; looking presentable aren&#x27;t really compatible.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings I use this, and the total time it takes my hair is always less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I went with this one and not a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> The end result was my hair looking like a big mess.</li>
            <li> I do have long, thick hair (down mid back), but it wasn&#x27;t faster than using a flat iron or curling iron as others implied.</li>
            <li> , I actually save a little bit of time and a LOT of frustration every day.</li>
            <li> I use a little hairspray and I wake up the next morning still looking styled.</li>
            <li> This did not work AT ALL on my thick, heavy, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> I used to wake up every morning with stick straight hair, and had gotten tired of it...</li>
            <li> I SPENT HOURS ON IT.</li>
            <li> When you wash your hair, I recommend using Argan or Moroccan oil treatment on your wet hair.</li>
            <li> so be careful -</li>
            <li> I use it on the highest setting and the burning smell has only happened a few times to me.</li>
            <li> No thanks</li>
            <li> but thats the only trouble i had with this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may look like a big iron, and it did feel a little weird to hold for the first 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it damaged the heck out of my hair even though I was careful to only hold it on each small section of hair for only a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and theres really no gripper on the other end.</li>
            <li> i have other products that go to 430 degrees, but this seems to get hotter than advertised.</li>
            <li> I got tired of my normal &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They shouldn&#x27;t sell items to other countries that can&#x27;t be used there.</li>
            <li> was delivered  before than i expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This gets hotter than any other waver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Makes my tight curly hair loose and wavy.</li>
            <li> wide sections), then spray on some sea salt spray and literally go from bed-head to &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> you only have to hold it on each section of hair for about 5-10 seconds, and only 10 seconds if you have really thick hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair (all the way down my back) and very thick</li>
            <li> I have thin hair with no body, plus I&#x27;m usually in a rush getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, her hair is straight and difficult to curl.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast but does have a weird burning smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the waves hold throughout the day and even a couple days later.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a waver i got for less than $15, but i was so wrong.</li>
            <li> and I cannot set it down until it cools off...</li>
            <li> having this waver makes me want to wear my hair down</li>
            <li> I usually just wash it and let it dry as it will.  </li>
            <li> perms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; everyone refers to is just what a typical iron does</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me less than 15 mins to do my hair</li>
            <li> In fact,using this waver, my hair spends less time in contact with heat than it did when I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and it made mine a mess</li>
            <li> And my hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had to set the curling iron down for a few minutes in between curling sections.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even take very long and I have extremely thick and out of control hair.</li>
            <li> some parts of my hair looked a little dryer than others</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I have one years ago and passed on to one of my little sisters.</li>
            <li> LEAVE HAIR SMELLING A LITTLE LIKE \\&quot;BURNT\\&quot; but nothing oil sheen or spray wont fix so no biggie</li>
            <li> The picture is after 10 hours, so don&#x27;t mind the little bit of frizz Ines I have.</li>
            <li> It does steam or smoke a little but doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I put little nail polish dots on my adjustment wheel</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, long, flat hair</li>
            <li> I have thin dirty blonde hair, kinda wavy, kinda straight, and this machine transforms it into voluminous bouncy wave/curls.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this just about everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair look messy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I like the messy look</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> Had this for a few months now, I bought it for my daughter</li>
            <li> warning I have:  in this picture everything that is the silver color is the plate, which means that you need to be careful and not put this sucker too close to your scalp</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I use this practically everyday.</li>
            <li> so there is contact but nothing firm.</li>
            <li> I just freshen up a few sections</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday</li>
            <li> for me it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I had alittle trouble getting all my hair through the appliance</li>
            <li> Heavy, so not for me.</li>
            <li> I have medium/short hair down a teeny bit past my collar bones</li>
            <li> I can do my hair in half the time of straightening or curling!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use a little hairspray when waving it, then add a little curl booster spray once I&#x27;m finished and voila!</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how little I paid for it!</li>
            <li> What very little wave I had to begin with was gone within an hour</li>
            <li> Terrible burns hair and does not keep wave for more than 10 minutes</li>

            <li> I even used it on my friends who have really thick hair and didn&#x27;t think I could do it, but I proved them wrong.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Poor quality curler</li>
            <li> I saw this one for less than $20 and was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> the video showing the product in action is horrible</li>
            <li> I have previously had a waver like this before and it sadly died :(</li>
            <li> A must have, and you can&#x27;t go wrong w the price.</li>
            <li> sad face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this started happening (after 3 uses)</li>
            <li> #34;bed head&amp;#34; without any worries of a weird curl showing up.  </li>
            <li> sad face</li>
            <li> but it gives you this weird smell</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a weird smell when the iron is on.</li>
            <li> I bought this just randomly, to try.</li>
            <li> This can make it difficult to maneuver if your trying to get some of your shorter hair pieces.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I returned it because it is not for my hair.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!  </li>
            <li> i have been using styling tools for so long, this is one of the worst</li>
            <li> it also has a button to close the waver so you wont hold you and get tired!!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do anything to my hair after I get out of the shower because every time I try to curl it, it looks awful!</li>
            <li> Very casual and beachy.</li>
            <li> I have no clue why it damaged my hair so badly.</li>
            <li> but often so bad (frizzy, straightish) that I have often fantasized about electrolysizing them, viewing bald spots as a preferable alternative.  </li>
            <li> Kindve inconvenient!</li>
            <li> I just look like a frizzball. :(</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using correctly, but I am so disappointed in results.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Oh it works wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;I have accidentally burned myself with it a few times, but I love the results!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it works wonders with my thick hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for a great price! It does have a funny smell every time I use it but thankfully the smell doesn&#x27;t take to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once. So, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars over 5. So far, I do like this waver a lot. It works well and quick. I will say that if you do not use the right products before and after, I can see how it makes your hair look damaged. You would definitely want to make sure you&#x27;re using the correct heat level for your hair type. I have very thick, coarse hair. So, I always use the highest temperature on any styling tool that I own.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, definitely make sure you&#x27;re using the right products because it can make your hair look dry. I used the Joico K-PAK Color Therapy Oil before hand(Since my hair is colored blonde and this oil and UV Protection in it) along with a heat protectant. some parts of my hair looked a little dryer than others but once I finished, I used the Moroccan oil along with Moroccan oil hydrating styling cream and it looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would say to not use it on your bangs, it looked ridiculous on my bangs. Lol I just used a blow dryer on my bangs and it looked WAY better.</li>
            <li> So fast to use and creates a great look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this upon recommendation from a friend with naturally wavy hair. I have very long (halfway down my back, all one length), stick-straight, fair but thick hair. I can make beachy waves in my hair with this curler/waver in about 15 minutes. Start at the bottom with most of your hair pinned up, then pull down sections and run the waver through. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the waves &amp;#34;right &amp;#34;(e.g., you must pull it through at the right lenght, then relax the hold while you wave the next section so it doesn&#x27;t pull out the first &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34;) but I mastered it in one/two uses. The waves/curls stay in all day - unbelievable for my hair! So much better than a curling iron, when my curls/waves fall flat in an hour. LOVE it and will definitely use this! A great price at $20 too.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.  It&#x27;s really easy to use and only takes about 15 minutes. It is really good quality and I have had no problems with it at all. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came quick! Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I do like it!  This gives a perfect beachy look in a few minutes! :)  Shipping to Italy was so quick!</li>
            <li> Works just as good or BETTER than the Bed head deep waver!! Totally worth it! And the price for a tool like this is UNBELIVABLE!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, that said, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with straighteners or curling irons ever before. This waver did what it said but it also damaged and frizzed my hair (I used the lowest heat setting). I&#x27;m going to offer it to my sister to try, but I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
            <li> Where do I start? This machine has changed my life! Just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret. Gave me Taylor Swift waves. I have thin dirty blonde hair, kinda wavy, kinda straight, and this machine transforms it into voluminous bouncy wave/curls. People always think it&#x27;s natural and tell me they are jealous, then I tell them it is the Deep waiver! If you are in a hurry you can quickly get some beach waves. This gadget is saving me money because I don&#x27;t have to get my highlights as often, you really can&#x27;t tell when its all curled up, most just think my hair is ombre!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to style hair this is my second iron,4 * because the lock button is &#x27;nt so sturdy...but I dont use the lock often my hair is long 18 inches.I did my whole head in 15 min. ;)  my first iron i bought wasnt hot enough ..but this one gets hot fast and stays hot...heat protection a mus</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;crimper&amp;#34;. I always get positive comments on my hair after using this. Heats up super fast. And am always asked, &amp;#34;how did you get your hair like that?&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I have really really long hair and only takes me about 15 minuets of so to get it done.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this item. Works great and easy to use. Very fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> The waver worked fine as far as waving my hair, I have long thick hair. Compliments on my hair all the time, but I had the waver ON in my polder iron station (your supposed to be able to keep irons in the slots while they are on and never had any issues with any of my other irons) this one melted the top of the polder station in the slot it was in.  Although I was able to peel the melted plastic off it, I threw the iron away because I felt it was dangerous.  And I use professional flat irons in my polder that reach temperatures that are hotter than what the Pro beauty waver was supposed to reach.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  Such a good product at such a great price!  Heats up fast, crimps the hair fast.  Creates very nice loose waves.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works great! Only takes about the minutes and it looks like natural beach waves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t style my hair. To be honest, I would rather spend the extra 5-15 minutes in bed. I always see girls with these gorgeous waves and go, why can&#x27;t that be me?  (Well for starters, probably because I never take the time to do my hair...)  Well, no more! I LOVE this waver, it&#x27;s super easy to use and my hair is done in 5 minutes or less.  The best part is the waves actually STAY!  I have super fine, thin hair so nothing stays.  Ever.  I even bring this on the road with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Terrible burns hair and does not keep wave for more than 10 minutes it&#x27;s like a frizzy crimped</li>
            <li> I just got my waver today!! Shipping was perfectly on time and the product is exactly what I wanted! I tried it out and the waves are beautiful! The waver did not burn my hair and is quick to use. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s heavy and I cannot set it down until it cools off... Kindve inconvenient! My hair is super straight so the waves you see in my picture is all from the tool!!(:</li>
            <li> I was really torn on which waver to get. I watched videos and read reviews. However, I wanted the first one to be easy and affordable since it would be my daughter&#x27;s first hair iron. There are certainly others on the market that look good, but at a higher price so I went with this one to see how it would go and figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out too much if she never used it. I styled her hair the first time to show her how. It worked really well, and she loved it. She has super long and thick hair that is straight. She figured out that for school, she can just wave the top layer and still get the desired look without having to fool with all the hair underneath that would take longer. She really likes it, and it seems to work just fine. I can&#x27;t say how the higher end ones work, but I would recommend giving this one a shot.</li>
            <li> My hair looks amazing thank you! The lock switch on the handle is a life saver.  I have small hands and holding any heated iron to my hair is exhausting when you trying to keep it clamped</li>
            <li> Super easy to use; I did all my hair in under 5 minutes. (My hair is thin, but still. :) I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more likely to fry your hair than a more expensive 100% ceramic one (I&#x27;m guessing this is just plated? There&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s solid ceramic), but I&#x27;ll only be using it on occasion.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous beach waves that last! A must have, and you can&#x27;t go wrong w the price. I suggest using a heat protect spray,  I like hot off the press by Paul Mitchell it adds shine, volume and most importantly will prevent damage.  And do not hold a section for more than 10 seconds. Especially if you have chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Great iron! People asks if my hair is naturally wavy when I use it. I have thick course hair so it takes a while to curl. When I use this iron my hand gets pretty worn out by holding the clamps down. There is a lock feature to hold down the clamps on its own but it can be more of a hassle and I think it&#x27;s only for storage purposes. Overall one of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> This had an awful smell when it heated up. It got so hot, it was hard to use without being worried if get burned. i have other products that go to 430 degrees, but this seems to get hotter than advertised. I bought this for my daughter, 12 years old, but would never have let her use it by herself because of the heat. She could easily use my other heated hair tools, but this one was even difficult for me to maneuver without burning myself. The curls were just ok. I can make better ones with my straightener. I was just hoping to find an easier alternative. I might try the Bedhead one.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. My hair is naturally straight so having this waver makes me want to wear my hair down and I have fun with it. So if your hair is naturally straight and you want to change it up a bit I recommend getting this. Also you might want to get treseme keritain (red bottle) and treseme smooth (purple bottle) spray to protect your hair from heat damage! GET THEM ALL &amp; ENJOY I KNOW I DO!</li>
            <li> I always want it one and now I have it I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my twelve year old hairdresser in training. Her hair is medium in thickness but she really needed the heat to be on high to get the desired results. Her waves held all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works fast. My daughters and I all have thin hair but lots of it and it sure makes our hair look thicker</li>
            <li> Use this for my little girls and they love it. Works better with longer hair just because the waves are a little bigger than some three barrell but it is a great hair tool!</li>
            <li> This thing rocks! I can do my hair in half the time of straightening or curling! A must buy for girls looking for that beach wave.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the waves this leaves. Very casual and beachy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair very pretty..</li>
            <li> works good. gives me nice waves in a short amount of time. im happy I bought this product. no regrets</li>
            <li> i loved this tool for the first four months i had it.  with the exception of no outer coating, so i&#x27;d burn my ears here and there, but after four months i plugged it in and it won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  sad face.  now i&#x27;m looking for a deep waver replacement</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Hair looks crimped from the 80-90&#x27;s not &#x27;waved&#x27;</li>
            <li> I t did the job, but I love the older models better</li>
            <li> Works great! I had a different kind and brand before and it broke. This one seems like it will last me.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t heat up to what it said it would so it didn&#x27;t even make a dent in my heavy thick hair.  Was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the machine&lt;br /&gt;But after a period of disruption&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need high quality device Please advise me in my request&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This crimper/ waver is awesome. My hair is already naturally wavy but this just adds to it and gives me hair more volume as well. Like everyone else says on here.. it does get super hot so yes make sure you use a hair protector so you don&#x27;t completely damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this waver.  I haven&#x27;t tried others but I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Awesome - heats well! Super long cord!  Great value.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair type and way better than some frizzy braid waves. Extremely glad I got this. It&#x27;s timely but worth it.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it does. Heats quickly, stays hot and the swivel cord makes it easy to use with long hair.</li>
            <li> This waver is amazing! I used to wake up every morning with stick straight hair, and had gotten tired of it...so I wanted to try something new. I was looking at similar hair wavers, but this one had the best price, so I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it that I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting as much money. I definitely DO NOT regret this purchase! The cord is super long, so it makes it extremely easy to get an awesome wave all over. If you are looking at this, buy it! I guarantee you will love it! :)</li>
            <li> Works just like the more expensive ones. The curl will last for days!</li>
            <li> So many compliments on my hair.  Easy to use.  Works fast on my long hair.  Waves last days.  Heat control.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try nice wavy hair. I NEVER blow-dry my hair, and only do any kind of mild heat-styling once a month or so, and I use heat-protectant spray whenever I do. I have fine, thin hair, so I used this product on the lowest setting. Nevertheless, it fried my hair to a crisp. Now, even days after I used it my hair has the most horrible burnt smell and it is dry and ugly. I am super careful with my hair and have never ever experienced this with any kind of heat-styling product before. So much for taking such good care of my long hair for so long. I guess I&#x27;ll have to chop it off.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll have more luck if your hair is thicker, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT BURNT HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have just recently started experimenting with different Beauty Tools for my hair.  I usually go with a straightener.  I absolutely love this waver!  I have gotten a lot of comments on my hair when I use it.  More importantly, it is easy for me to use and I love the results!</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is such a great waver for a really good price!  I don&#x27;t normally curl or wave my hair so this was one of the first purchases I&#x27;ve made like this.  This Pro Beauty waver worked so well and I was impressed.  It heated up quickly, was easy to use, and made awesome waves!</li>
            <li> I only used this maybe 5 times. This last time it fried my hair and it stunk up the room with burnt hair smell! I did nothing different, and the plug didn&#x27;t short out... The tool just glitched out of nowhere!! The plastic also melted and now it quit working. I&#x27;ll have to throw it away. I&#x27;m not happy. I feel I should get a replacement.... Doubt the customer service would allow since I purchased it last year. I liked it and the curls it made.</li>
            <li> I love the deep waver iron tool. It leaves your hair looking amazing. I get many compliments about it. This is a must product for all the ladies to have in their collection of iron tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. if you have long hair like me, it will take like 30-35 min to do.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST buy! I use this just about everyday and yes it leaves your hair looking amazing! This came 4 days after I purchased it, which was awesome! Sooooo happy I bought this. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was hoping for gorgeous waves; instead, before I could finish, I noticed that my waves were ridiculous. Also, I have thick, somewhat wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Idk what it is about this product but it makes my hair look fried! I don&#x27;t have the same problem with a traditional curling iron or flat iron, so I&#x27;m not sure what it is with this product. Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like too much the waves are too Big.</li>
            <li> Only used it once.. My hair came out terrible.. Though I did use it on the lowest setting.. Maybe I just need to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34; , guess we&#x27;ll see!ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Gives me nice waves without the frizz. I like it so much my friend also bought one. She liked the way my hair looked. I mainly straighten my hair so its a nice break and less damaging.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and with this waver i literally probably take 15-20 minutes to do all of my hair. Heats up quickly and i always get compliments on my hair when i use the waver. great purchase!</li>
            <li> Maybe this thing works well for some people. It just made my hair look messy and frizzy.  It heats up quickly and reaches a high temperature...But it was a complete was of money and energy to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t crimp with this-I&#x27;m not sure why. I just look like a frizzball. :(</li>
            <li> Really  good  waver ,Thank you !</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and I must say, it works great, but it smells kinda funky, like burning plastic or rubber or something. But that aside, it works like it says it does, and makes lovely waves.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gets hot enough to make nice waves! Would recommend to anyone that wants loose waves and easy to use tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a night out at a 20&#x27;s themed club and wanted to attempt a bob/wave look.  I&#x27;ve ended up using this nearly every day.  Traditional curling irons never really worked for me, but this contraption is awesome.  I have really long (waist-length) hair and in about 5 minutes I can style it to where I get compliments all day long.  As one other reviewer mentioned, I don&#x27;t really follow the instructions, I cram as much hair as I can in - and even at that, it leaves my hair looking awesome.</li>
            <li> This is so amazing. I love it :)</li>
            <li> THIS SPEED WAVER IS AMAZING !! WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BECAUSE MY HAIR IS SUPER THIN AND STRAIGHT. I HAD MY WHOLE HEAD DONE IN 15 MINUTES !! LOOKED LIKE I SPENT HOURS ON IT. VERY NATURAL LOOKING CURL AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED MUCH PRODUCT TO HOLD.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy to make beachy waves!  I have naturally thick long &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; hair, so I can make a few clamps of this waver down the top layer of my hair (in 2 -3&amp;#34; wide sections), then spray on some sea salt spray and literally go from bed-head to &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; in less than 15 minutes.  Great time saver!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, wavy hair. I got tired of my normal &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; wavy hair however since I do nothing to my hair (don&#x27;t even blow dry it) I didn&#x27;t want a style that took so long. I love curling my hair, but since my hair is so thick and I don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning, curling is a &#x27;special occasion&#x27; hairdo. I decided to give myself more waves/curls but the easy way. This was the cheapest one on the market and although I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, i am beyond impressed with it. It literally takes me under 5 minutes to do my whole head (i DON&#x27;T follow the instructions, and will cram as much hair into that waver as possible to get myself out the door faster). The waves are awesome!! I like the messy look, so I purposely don&#x27;t do the waver perfectly, then tousle and put hairspray on. Let me say that I will use this on semi-wet to dry hair and it works wonderfully! I will wear it the whole day, sleep on it, then wake up and don&#x27;t need to retouch it whatsoever. Using this once for 5min. gives me two-three days of a cute hairstyle (I have oily hair so I don&#x27;t wash every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone. I am hassle-free and normally i do the rolled out of bed look because i hate taking time to &#x27;do&#x27; my thick and very long hair BUT this thing has made its way into my morning routine. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this tool!!! The bigger wave makes it faster to do my hair in the morning. Also this waver makes different degrees of wave. It also makes my hair shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> i got this for my daughters birthday, it is a great value for the price. it heats up well, and is good quality. she has already used it many times.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I have one years ago and passed on to one of my little sisters. Mine lasted 5 uses and then it wouldnt heat anymore. I was highly disappointed. I ordered the bedhead wave master instead and Now I&#x27;m all set</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair appliance that I have, and my collection includes 2 curling wands and a Miracurl.  I have medium/short hair down a teeny bit past my collar bones &amp; I have always worn my hair straight BUT I had a very unfortunate haircut and wearing it straight &amp; looking presentable aren&#x27;t really compatible.  I used this waver this morning &amp; I now adore my hair &amp; I won&#x27;t be chopping it off.  It gives great beachy waves that you can do a million things with and the process was much quicker than I thought it would be.  I used Tresemme heat protectant spray, Not Your Mother&#x27;s sea salt spray, Garnier Wonder Waves spray, and Garnier UV Shield hairspray.  I went to bed with wet hair (that had wonder waves &amp; sea salt spray in it) and this morning it took me around a half hour to use this iron &amp; get great beachy waves.  I LOVE THIS IRON!!!  I was seriously considering chopping a good 4 inches off my hair but I can rock this hairstyle for a bit while my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because it was very affordable and because of all the great reviews. The reviews were saying it was fast and easy. Well, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results (nice body, pretty waves), but I wouldn&#x27;t say fast or easy. Took me at least 30 minutes. I do have long, thick hair (down mid back), but it wasn&#x27;t faster than using a flat iron or curling iron as others implied. Also, it&#x27;s heavy and so I found it was quite a workout for my hand muscles. Whenever I could, I held it with both of my hands or gave me hand a break. But overall, glad I bought it. Won&#x27;t be using it every day, but maybe once every week or two. :)</li>
            <li> Had this for a few months now, I bought it for my daughter and she uses this several times a week and her hair looks so cute, some people just need practice or your hair just isn&#x27;t meant to be crimped like mine but excellent quality and isn&#x27;t harsh on her hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT SO MUCH! So easy to use! It makes my hair have this mermaid hair style! And so much volume because I can get to the roots!</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly you can get through a whole head of hair with this waver and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on the results of using this tool to style my hair, but it is made very cheaply.  It was only 6 months old when it wouldn&#x27;t heat up anymore.  I might buy it again just because I liked how it made my hair look, but only if I find it for a very low price because this is basically disposable junk as far as durability/quality of how it is made.</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I needed. Incredible value for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends love this :)</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, course hair &amp; this is the best waver for it!  Depending on how long your hair is it can take a while to curl/wave your hair with this... but still MUCH faster than a traditional curling iron.  Love how the waves are loose/flowy &amp; not kinky, my hair stays wavy all day</li>
            <li> Gave me great, loose waves. Easy to use and great price. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for quick, easy styles.</li>
            <li> Does not work as described.  Do not buy</li>
            <li> This waver surely creates a cute wave however, all of the black plastic began melting and sticking when the waver got hot. So, when it began melting it would get stuck and would not open back up. It was horrible. Unfortunately this started happening (after 3 uses) and I&#x27;m currently looking for another brand to replace it with!</li>
            <li> THIS CRIMPER IS MASSIVE BUT IT MAKES FOR HUGE HAIR IF YOURE INTO THAT.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  I DO HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK SINCE MY HAND GETS SO TIRED.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This tool is simple and easy to use.It heats up quickly, as well. I love it! Makes my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> Did not work.  Wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  Had to return for a refund.</li>
            <li> I love the wave this give my hair. But... everytime I use it my hair smells burnt. :/  ive got it set on a low setting and use a heat protection. So just be warned.  It does work really well and has a long cord which I like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I would spend more money and get something nicer</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly and adds volume. I would not recommend for anyone with shoulder length hair or shorter. This is best for people with long hair. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream for the first 2 weeks then stops heating up. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this deep curler several times and it works great and the waves stay in for a very long period of time and it is not very hard to use.</li>
            <li> This thing does work how it says . . BUT after I used it, my hair was FRIED for like 3 weeks. I have no clue why it damaged my hair so badly. I&#x27;ve never had a product damage my hair and make it so dry. I really do like how it looked though, beautiful waves. Just make sure to use TONS of heat protectant and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who&#x27;s hair will NOT hold a curl.. She has thick, shiny hair, and this works great, and holds the curl all day long.I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who normally does a lot with my hair. I usually just wash it and let it dry as it will.  But this little iron is fast becoming my best friend.  You can use this with &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; without any worries of a weird curl showing up.  The plates also have a small section of &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; area that tame my frizz wonderfully.  I wind up with a shiny head of natural looking waves.  I constantly get comments on my hair.  The nice thing is, this gives you a wonderful head of waves but it doesn&#x27;t really look like you &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long (just below bra length), fine, and frizzy.  I can get my entire head curled with this in about 10 minutes.  If you&#x27;re unsure how to use it, go on youtube as there are tons of videos out there to show you how easy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may look like a big iron, and it did feel a little weird to hold for the first 5 minutes. I found that I hold this with 3 fingers only (my thumb, and my pointer and middle finger).  That&#x27;s all it takes.  No massive amount of &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34; needed to clamp the plates down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only warning I have:  in this picture everything that is the silver color is the plate, which means that you need to be careful and not put this sucker too close to your scalp or it gets hot.  Silver&#x3D;heated element.  Heated element+Skin&#x3D;pain.  Simple, yes?  LOL</li>
            <li> If you have wavy hair and want to look like a poodle, go for it.  This is for straight hair only.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , I have very long hair to my low back, after doing nice beach waves it get shorter to my half back , it is definitely great for long hair at last shoulder length to have any effect , the video showing the product in action is horrible you don&#x27;t do that this way you switch each wave down not all of them to get great beach waves including the end of the hair so they are nice curled up .. I love this product , the wave is natural and looks beautiful after , I straight little bit my hair before to get define waves after and minder 80&#x27;s looking , don&#x27;t make waves on curly hair .&lt;br /&gt;and I love the 9 feet rubber cord ..what a freedom of movement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy wavering ! lol</li>
            <li> I actually did not like this product. It was not user friendly. It took too long to heat up and was not comfortable using on my own hair and on wigs (I style wigs). I felt that it hurt my hand because I had to hold it in one place for son long. I sold it to someone and she didn&#x27;t like it either. Would not recommend getting.</li>
            <li> They probably sent me a defective one, but it was very underwhelming and dissappointing. You can send it in for a refund, but no replacement. Better off buying a slightly more expensive version.</li>
            <li> Delivery was exactly as advised and I absolutely LOVE the device!! Makes my tight curly hair loose and wavy. I would and have been recommending to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great price. Ordered this for my 13 year old daughter for her birthday.  The process if fast and easy.  Even when you get in a hurry and cram more hair in than you should, it still looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Omggggg I always wanted a deep waver and I finally got one !! I love it sooooo much ... It waves your hair fast btw !!!</li>
            <li> It works well .. just don&#x27;t have heat to high or ur hair will smell like burned hair. . Does leave deep waves</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time to do my hair with this but it works perfectly for a very good price. I would recommend to anyone. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great! I love it</li>
            <li> didnt like it! it doesnt even heat waist of money</li>
            <li> Based on all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to using this waver. First of all, it took me forever to unpack this thing. The packaging is ridiculous. Then, the first time I plugged in the waver, the light came on and the waver heated up. However, within minutes the light turned off, the waver cooled down, and it never worked again. Sending it back. :(</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Best for long hair.  I have a layered cut that reaches my shoulders.  My hair is to short to use this device effectually.  I have naturally curly hair which I usually straighten.</li>
            <li> I own another waver that does smaller curls and, although I like it, the curls were just a little too small for me. These curls were much funkier and simpler for my hair type. My hair is naturally super straight so once in a while I want something different.  This is a great way to achieve that without much fuss.  My hair doesn&#x27;t usually take curls well, so a normal curling iron doesn&#x27;t last long on my hair.  This -for reasons unknown- lasts way longer than normal curls.  I had my hair waved and didn&#x27;t wash it for 2 days, curls still present when I finally washed it 2 days later.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I bought this Speed Waver for my 12 year old daughter, who has thick, straight hair. It works great! The waves look very pretty and natural. This Speed Waver heats up very fast and is very easy to use. It takes no longer than 10 minutes to do my daughter&#x27;s hair. The only thing I wish it had is some kind of stand, so you can safely set it on the counter. Instead, you have to wait until it cools, before you can put it on top of any surface.</li>
            <li> No problem with the Pro Beauty Tools Professional Speed Waver&lt;br /&gt;Just have to used too like any new hair tools.&lt;br /&gt;I like to do some glamourous cramp like &amp;#34;Dita von Teese&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter for a gift.  She is having a lot of fun with it.  She has long hair and this adds just the right amount of wave without being too curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really big on doing my hair all fancy, simply because I don&#x27;t have the time in the morning. If you don&#x27;t like going through stinky perms and dealing with that hassle, this tool is one for you! I bought it to give my hair a bit more body without spending all day with a curling iron only to flatten out after a few hours or hairspray my head to death. The waves hold pretty much all day (without hair spray), but my hair is straight and thick, so I have to leave it on for about 8-10 seconds. My hair is pretty long, so watching the video really is helpful on best practices. It only takes me about 10 minutes to fully wave my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little cumbersome to work with since the plates get so hot, and the &amp;#34;cool tip&amp;#34; ends aren&#x27;t what they say they are. Be careful not to burn your hands thinking they&#x27;re cool because they&#x27;re not (hence the 4 stars out of 5)! Nonetheless, I would not trade this curler/waver for anything. I will never perm my hair again now that I have this-- it is the look I&#x27;ve wanted for years without chemical damaging my hair through wave perms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; everyone refers to is just what a typical iron does when it hits hair-- just use your best judgment on how long you want to keep it on your hair. Other than my hand getting a little sore crimping the plates together, it&#x27;s a great product. Using about 2-3 inches of hair per &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; will leave you with a great looking little wave. Be careful of the ends of your hair since they have a tendency to be more fragile versus the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STRONG Recommendation: Definitely get a thermal protect spray for your hair (I use an aerosol). Doing this every day or every other day without some kind of thermal treatment will damage your hair substantially. I read this before I bought it and immediately bought a thermal spray. I&#x27;ve not curled my hair without the spray since. &amp;#34;Smooth Criminal&amp;#34; from Beyond works very well. You do need to keep this plugged in for about 10 minutes BEFORE use to make sure it is hot enough (which is adjustable on the side). It does NOT have an auto-shut off, so be very conscious to unplug it after you&#x27;re done, locking the plates and not winding the cord around the barrels since it will damage it in the long run. When you wash your hair, I recommend using Argan or Moroccan oil treatment on your wet hair. This will help keep your hair healthy and soft in between waving.</li>
            <li> This put the weakest wave in my hair, and I even used a GOOD QUALITY SPRAY with it. What very little wave I had to begin with was gone within an hour and then my hair looked like bed head, and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is okay for the price, I suppose and if you are willing to work with it then it may be worth your while. For those who have had success with it, that is great. This just was not for me.. *sad face*</li>
            <li> My new favorite styling item!! Quick and beautiful. Waves last all day!</li>
            <li> Love the deep waves this waver makes. It is easy to use and has a range of heat options.  I have shoulder length blond hair and I can wave it all in under ten minutes with this waver.</li>
            <li> This product is great and all, but it takes forever to do your hair. I thought it would be about the same time as a curling wand, but I was so wrong. Seldom worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price this pro tool really works wonders.</li>
            <li> it was pretty easy to do and neat! recommend it..but make sure to check out level of heat to avoid damage</li>
            <li> Excelent! Got it two days before it needed to be deleverd ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> It is ok, it does the job but it gives you this weird smell, is not burn , this is my second one but different brand and I really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> They shouldn&#x27;t sell items to other countries that can&#x27;t be used there. I can&#x27;t even use the speed waver because of the voltage difference. Guess that&#x27;s mainly my fault though for not realizing that first. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I use this practically everyday. I&#x27;ve used a deep waver before, and never knew how horrible my old one was until I bought this. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair stink at all, and the results are beautiful. In the mornings I use this, and the total time it takes my hair is always less than 10 minutes. It&#x27;s so easy to use, and I recommend it to everyone. Gives my hair tremendous amount of volume, and I&#x27;m always so confident when I go out with my hair styled with this (: There&#x27;s no other words to describe it, I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this to see how it would work...and the price was decent...they stink though when they are first plugged in...they get really hot though, which for me is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple waving tools on my hair which is extremely thick and most just damage my hair after a few uses. These have all been professional tools that were within the ranges of $50 to $100. I saw this one for less than $20 and was very skeptical. After my first use, it took less than 10 minutes to wave all the layers of my hair and the waves looked healthy. They also last for 2 days after the fact without flattening which never ever happens with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a Ross store a few months ago for around the same price listed here and found it here on Amazon when I was looking for a second one to use at work.  I already had a Revlon 3 Barrel jumbo waver but it was just not doing it for me.  That product was big, bulky and hard to handle/use - plus it wasn&#x27;t really giving me the results I was looking for.  I fell in love with this Pro Tools Deep Waver the first time I used it.  It gives great big waves that look very beachy and fun.  I usually use a little hairspray when waving it, then add a little curl booster spray once I&#x27;m finished and voila! Perfect beach waves.  I wish my hair looked like this all the time! The waver can get very very hot so be careful - you only have to hold it on each section of hair for about 5-10 seconds, and only 10 seconds if you have really thick hard to curl hair.  It&#x27;s also very light and easy to maneuver/handle when using.  Overall, I really love this waver and would recommend it to anyone looking for big waves!</li>
            <li> this is a girls best friend. it doesnt make my hair look like its in a 70s crimp style its loose and wavy can make it look bigger by sectioning in parts. LOVE this gets hot soooo quick and only takes 15 mins to finish. it also has a button to close the waver so you wont hold you and get tired!! BUY!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES LEAVE HAIR SMELLING A LITTLE LIKE \\&quot;BURNT\\&quot; but nothing oil sheen or spray wont fix so no biggie</li>
            <li> Love!! Fun deep waves! - beauty blogger</li>
            <li> Bigger than what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> Love Doing My Hair With This</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does the job,  but there is a funky smell when it&#x27;s heated up.</li>
            <li> It only takes me less than 10 minutes to get really good curls. This is my favorite product so far!</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Fast and simple to use. My daughter has hard to curl or wave hair, but this did the trick! Looks very natural, not &amp;#34;crimpy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has used it repeatedly to get those waves she lovesâ€¦A great waver!</li>
            <li> here is a picture I found that shows just what the waves will look like:  [...]  Its exactly what I was looking for so I&#x27;m very happy. The waves stay all day for me, without hairspray. But my hair is naturally wavy so that does help.    As far as how it treats your hair, a heat protection spray is ideal, if you don&#x27;t have one, here is what you should do: after your tool is finished warming up, first press a towel between the plates to release any over heating on the surface of the plates that can burn your hair. After that, before pressing firmly on each section to set the style, first lightly glide your section of hair between the plates so there is contact but nothing firm. This prepares your cuticle for the heat when you set the style. Depending on the thickness or thinness of your hair shaft, you will need to gauge for yourself how long to keep the tool applied to each section for a wave to hold, but I would recommend somewhere around 3-5 seconds, especially if you are not using a heat protection spray. Also, this shipped as it said it would, in great time.</li>
            <li> Saw my friends hair wavy one day and asked her if she braided it. She told me it was this iron! I love to use this about 3-4 days after washing my hair to give it great body and fun waves! Especially for the price, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The curls turn out really nice, however, it really does damage hair. Also, there&#x27;s a weird smell when the iron is on. Overall, not a bad purchase</li>
            <li> I LOVE this crimper! Im not one to spend a lot of time doing my hair and with this I don&#x27;t have to. Its super fast, super easy and with hardly no time at all my hair looks like I spent forever on it. My husband absolutely loves the look too :).</li>
            <li> Love it! It is fast and easy to use! The picture is after 10 hours, so don&#x27;t mind the little bit of frizz Ines I have. ;)</li>
            <li> I love this product, and it comes at a great price! I have gotten many compliments when I style my hair with this product. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way my hair looks after using this. I have naturally thick, straight, and frizzy hair. Pretty much I can tame it with a flat iron or tie it back. Now, it takes longer, but it&#x27;s so easy to curl my hair now. 100% recommend. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the name brand and works so well.</li>
            <li> Ok so pending on what type of hair you have this tool can be sent from heaven, or the devil himself. The first time I used this tool was a nightmare  my hair frizzed up and I looked like a lion. However I have it another shot and actually took the time to separate my hair into sections and added some frizz eaze to my hair and I got salon quality turn out. It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok, I waited a while before posting a review because I wanted to see if it really worked, especially for my long thick hair... and? IT DOES!&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best deep wavers I&#x27;ve used yet--bar none! And it&#x27;s speedy!! It gets hot, very hot, but it needs to be in order to quickly wave your hair. I was able to curl my thick, long hair in approx. 30 mins! YAY! It also STAYS hot! I&#x27;ve used so many wavers, curling irons, flat irons, etc. that I&#x27;ve started to notice through the years which brands to avoid because they do not stay hot. (I&#x27;ve had to set the curling iron down for a few minutes in between curling sections.) My curls also last all day through the next day. I just freshen up a few sections and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands that cost roughly $100, this is your best bet! I can&#x27;t believe how little I paid for it! (As a side note, I would recommend using some sort of heat protection creme, spray, whatever on your hair prior to using it because like I said, it gets VERY hot!) GREAT purchase!!! Worth it!!</li>
            <li> This did not work AT ALL on my thick, heavy, straight hair. No &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; for me despite several attempts following the instructions to the letter. Furthermore, it damaged the heck out of my hair even though I was careful to only hold it on each small section of hair for only a few seconds. If you don&#x27;t want fried hair, BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I love this Waver, it is fast,gets the job done fast, people told me loved my hair. I&#x27;am happy,really...Thanks, the price is good.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price!</li>
            <li> I received this product just about 2 hours ago and right away started to do my hair because I had been looking forward to trying out this product for a while. I have really long hair (all the way down my back) and very thick so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well the waves were going to come out. I did about 2 inch sections at a time starting from the bottom layer. After a couple of tries I figured out how to overlap the sections to make it a seamless wave and it was a piece of cake from there. After I was done with a section I would spritz it with hairspray and move on to the next section. I was done in about 20 minutes and it looked amazing! It made my hair look fuller and just a great look all around. The product itself isn&#x27;t TOO big like some of the other full size wavers I&#x27;ve seen. The cord is really long so you don&#x27;t have to worry about pulling the plug out of the wall when you&#x27;re doing the opposite side of your head. I love the waver so far and I will be updating as the weeks go by and I use it more. This is just my first impression of it :D</li>
            <li> Its a great product!! was delivered  before than i expected! I tried it the product as soon as i received it the waves come out great it wan worth buying. 5 stars of sure!</li>
            <li> This things sucks got it exactly when it was supposed to (thanks to amazon)  but it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on or heat up! I would recommend getting a little more expensive well know brand like bed head but not this crap.</li>
            <li> I love this iron!!!! It is sooooo reasonably priced and the shipping was super fast. THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair every single day. It doesn&#x27;t even take very long and I have extremely thick and out of control hair. I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes my hair look naturally wavy. My hair is just down to my shoulder and it looks great! When I first bought it my hair was all the way down to my butt and it looked great waved then too! I recommend</li>
            <li> Wow! This is a GREAT waver and for such a good price! I&#x27;ve been wearing my part straight part wavy hair wavy using a waver like this every day for years. I&#x27;ve bought probably ten different wavers in those years, sometimes because one quit working, sometimes because I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with what I had. I&#x27;ve used these in the US and in Germany, so I&#x27;ve tried wavers in 110v and 220v. I have tons of long, fine hair that, like I said, it part wavy, part straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried - Revlon, Tondeo, Babyliss (though not the new Babyliss deep waver), to name a few, this is actually my very favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets hotter than any other waver I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the reason that it works the best of any I&#x27;ve tried or not. I feel like because this waver works so well and so fast, I actually save a little bit of time and a LOT of frustration every day. Other wavers I&#x27;ve tried, if I had pieces that were being particularly disobedient, refusing to wave in any cute way, the wavers were just no match for this. I have a couple of locks of hair that are sometimes fine but often so bad (frizzy, straightish) that I have often fantasized about electrolysizing them, viewing bald spots as a preferable alternative.  This waver works well even on those pieces. Maybe not as perfectly as I&#x27;d like, but much better than any other in the past. Seriously, I LOVE this cheapo waver. It&#x27;s so cheap I&#x27;m actually going to buy a backup in case it breaks. Seriously - the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works really well! I did fry a piece of my hair the first time I used it, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it since then, I think there is just a learning curve, there are some youtube vidoes out there that help to. It&#x27;s much quicker than curling so when I want a change and to be quicker this is my go to tool!</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I was hoping. Am not &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to hairtools. Will try this one again in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Smelled funny the first few times I used it, like a factory in China but it eventually went away.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it works better than the more expensive ones i&#x27;ve bought :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this, its totally worth the money. I had my reservations but I&#x27;m happy I checked the previous reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This tool gets extremely hot wich is a good and bad thing. It works really well just be careful with the heat setting because you can and will burn your hair to a crisp if it&#x27;s too hot. I love it tho.</li>
            <li> ... but it really isn&#x27;t the sort of styling tool I am looking for.  I want waves/curls, not crimpy looking waves.  I did hesitate to order this but did so based upon all the stellar reviews.  I am 43....I am certain the styles this tool creates are better suited to women half my age.  It does as promised and works perfectly....it just isn&#x27;t for me. I will be sending this to my daughter!</li>
            <li> It is great it works so good</li>
            <li> Only takes about 15 minutes to complete my whole head and my hair is over 20 inches long. Does not cause breakage and does not fry my hair, it actually made it feel softer.</li>
            <li> This is a cool tool to use if you want to do something different with your hair other than curl or straighten it.</li>
            <li> thank you i really like how my hair comes out it comes out so wavy but when i do my daughter it doesn&#x27;t come out right and it kind of burns my hair and hers too</li>
            <li> Creates natural waves that last - works super fast and heats up quickly. I have thin hair with no body, plus I&#x27;m usually in a rush getting ready in the morning. PLUS I am hair-challenged (can&#x27;t even use a curling iron) and pretty much can&#x27;t do anything but straighten it. This gives my hair tons of body and deep waves (not those crinkle crimper-type waves) super fast and is really easy to use. I&#x27;ve used more expensive wave irons but this works great. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much but the few times I have, it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> Really nice I live it</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and shipped to my house very quickly!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! I love it and I&#x27;m glad I went with this one and not a more expensive one. Does the same thing!</li>
            <li> I love it so much! The only downfall is that there really is no burn guard, or anything like that and I&#x27;m super clumsy and burned myself already! hahaha. But that&#x27;s user error! Not a problem with the product! This is SUCH a good styling tool!</li>
            <li> hard to maneuver. seems damaging to hair. Maybe best for a professional who can use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! I recommend it!!! Makes the cutest waves. Make sure you don&#x27;t use it at the hottest setting though because that&#x27;s damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> great product for a great price. i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a waver i got for less than $15, but i was so wrong. this is my new favorite tool! it heats up really fast, has adjustable heat levels, &amp; you dont have to keep it on your hair for long either. i was iffy about what the outcome was going to look like, but i&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments since i started using it. you can do large sections of hair or smaller sections depending on your desired look. a very nice beachy wave look. i would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool. I have had one for 1 1/2 years now and my daughter wanted. It heats up fast and is easy to use and creates nice deep crimps.</li>
            <li> The curler is quite handy and easy to work with. Curls fast, too. The only thing I don&#x27;t quite like is its heat setting. Even the lowest level seems a bit too hot for my hair, so I only it for about 3 seconds. Don&#x27;t regret the buy though.</li>
            <li> Too easy with good shap really love love love it and all my friend ask about it they want to make orders</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, but my waves don&#x27;t come out perfectly when I braid it. I bought this just randomly, to try. It works well on my hair, gets super hot. It did make my hair a bit frizzy so I am going to have to experiment more, but I thought it did a good job overall. This creates the kind of waves you get when you braid your hair.</li>
            <li> Works just as I hoped. Quick and carefree waves!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Good waver if your wanting it for a date or outing ,but it makes your hair stink ,it frys and damages your hair ,but it good if your looking for a quick hairstyle</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty fun.  You get the same results by winding your hair around a 1inch barrel curling iron, but this is a tad fast than that even if you don&#x27;t get as much volume.  Very pretty &amp;#34;Oh, I just woke up like this and ran my hands through it&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot, make my hair smell like burned. But the waves on my hair are not as curvy as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it once, possibly will never use it again. WASTE OF MONEY. I gave it 2 stars because it is cheaper than others.</li>
            <li> Not wild about how the waves came out at all.  Came out when I brushed the hair.  Prefer regular hot curler.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!! I used it during a travel and my hair looks like I wanted! It&#x27;s a great tool if you want to change your look.&lt;br /&gt;Me hair is extremely straight hair, and my look last all day long.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these. The first one lasted 4 years and after it stopped working I had to buy another right away. I love the wave it gives you, people always ask me what I use to wave my hair. Yes it gets hot but anytime you curl,straighten  or wave your hair you should always put a heat protecter product on your hair so it doesnt fry your hair. Come on girls, if beauty 101. Needless to say, I love love love this product. I give it a five stars. Dont let the reviews steer you away, I promise its a must have for a cute wave.</li>
            <li> It took my teenage daughter some time to figure this out but once she did her hair looks amazing.  Just be patient and spend some time playing with it.</li>
            <li> waves well and is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use but BE CAUTIOUS when using - tool gets very hot. Extends my hair options between washing - love that!</li>
            <li> This heats up really fast and it works great. I have very thin, long, flat hair and this makes it look full of volume. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just as expected, perfect!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Works well and great quality sure the price.</li>
            <li> this works way better than i expected, especially for the price. ill be using this almost daily until my hair grows out. looks great if you tease your hair! i am beyond happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> for the price its good.  it works well</li>
            <li> Works great! And you can&#x27;t beat the price! I have used it several times and friends have borrowed it several times...no issues. Love the look this waver creates!</li>
            <li> I adore this waver.  I&#x27;ve seen them online costing upwards of 300.00.  Ridiculous!!  This waver makes my hair look phenomenal. Highly recommended.  Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> The Only thing is the handle, not too comfortable, its kinda heavy and theres really no gripper on the other end. It takes a few times to get it just right, but it looks way cute. I like it a lOt</li>
            <li> Loved the product. It works great and leaves me looking like I got my hair professionally done and fast shipping was a bonus</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and I wanted something to give it some fun. I didn&#x27;t read any reviews for shorter hair so I thought I would write one. As a note to the seller this item came super fast, actually shockingly quick. As previous posts said there is no protection against burns and this curler gets very hot. This can make it difficult to maneuver if your trying to get some of your shorter hair pieces. I have thick hair so it can be a bit pain staking to try and get each piece without burning yourself. Overall if you have the time the product works very well. I imagine that it works better on longer hair but it still looked great on mine.</li>
            <li> This tool heats up very quickly and is easy to use. I have thick hair and the waves hold throughout the day and even a couple days later. I definitely recommend this tool because it&#x27;s a great price and works well.</li>
            <li> This waver is awesome!  It makes really pretty waves and doesnt take very long at all.  It&#x27;s easy to use and and you can lock it closed foe easy storage.</li>
            <li> I went to Vegas with my friend and she had one like this and upon borrowing hers I feel in love with it.  When I returned home I immediately went to Sally&#x27;s to try and buy one but it was $54!  I&#x27;m a big Amazon shopper so of course I knew the next step was to come here and look for one and I found it for 23, almost exactly like the one I had borrowed and t seen at Sallys but for less!  Makes great waves!</li>
            <li> because i can do my hair in 10 min and it looks so great and bounce I love my hair</li>
            <li> did not curl and made my hair very frizzy. i looked like a poodle afterwards despite watching video tutorials.  i am usually very good at doing hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair tool! Love the look I get with it and it works awesome!! It also doesn&#x27;t take long to make the curls! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this waver! So fun and quick to use on medium length hair. I watched a YouTube video on how to use it and it was great! Waves last for days and look even better after sleeping on them.</li>
            <li> Works great and is super easy gives you the wave look in minutes</li>
            <li> Awesome beachy waves!  When I don&#x27;t really have time to do much with my hair, but want something a little more than straight!  Works perfect and fast!  Do wish it had a shut off timer.  I tend to forget so make sure to unplug after each use to be safe!</li>
            <li> Works very well, leaves a beautiful wave! I can get beach waves and well as thick waves. Also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily,</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter. She loves it. She has very thick hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using the speed waver for about 2 years now. I absolutely love the big curls it makes. You have to be patient and do your hair in sections to get the ideal look. I get so many comments on how beautiful my hair looks when I use this. I read some comments on it burning the hair, if you let it sit on a certain part of your hair for too long it will start smoking and give your hair a burnt smell. I suggest using a heat protector on your hair before hand and making quick krimps in small sections. I use it on the highest setting and the burning smell has only happened a few times to me. I would also recommend a great shampoo and conditioner, and actually leave the conditioner on about 10 minutes before washing it out. This is an amazing tool, but like the flat iron or curling irons, it&#x27;s not great for your hair so you need to take extra special care of it while using this.</li>
            <li> Make very nice waves, love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It came in a timely manner. It does smell like chemicals when you first start using it but that smell wears off quickly. I&#x27;m satisfied and I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a waver not a crimper.</li>
            <li> This was just ok for me. I have wavy hair and it made mine a mess (wore it in a hair tie the rest of the day)&lt;br /&gt;I did buy for my 7yr old for Christmas who has straight hair. Worked better on her. She loved it so that was fine with me, after all it was her gift.&lt;br /&gt;I have the wand and think that gives a much much prettier curl that last...this is more like a wave or messy look.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and well packaged no problems.. was a gift for my sister in law and she loves it and said it works well... guess it does because I see her with her hair waved alot now.. and It looks really pretty</li>
            <li> its amazing. i love how it makes my hair look and it doesnt take very long to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using correctly, but I am so disappointed in results.  No matter what I do, it straightens my hair and makes it look and feel like burned hair.  As of now, I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> amazing , makes super cute waves. its easy to use as has a gfood lock, the cord is long but it may fry your hair if you do not use it appropriately !</li>
            <li> This works GREAT.  It performs exactly as the description and video said it would - and I&#x27;m not even all that adept at styling my hair.  The waves even last until the next day.  I love it and use it at least a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product! every time I use it people always compliment my hair! I recommend this hair waver.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! Love it!</li>
            <li> doesnt work on my hair at all. i have been using styling tools for so long, this is one of the worst</li>
            <li> I love this crimper it works really we&#x27;ll on my natural hair as well as my weave</li>
            <li> Not really a waver like the video, more like crimps. I still think it&#x27;s okay but I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday</li>
            <li> Best one I have used!</li>
            <li> Great product and price my daughter loves it! !!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!! ITS SUPER AWESOME AND WORKS FAST</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it is pretty good quality. It does the trick, and even has instructional videos. The cord is the longest appliance cord I&#x27;ve ever seen. I guess this is helpful when you want to let the next door neighbors borrow it! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying my niece&#x27;s. I find the best way it works for me is when I wash my hair and let it air dry. I have a bit of natural curl and I find this waver adds the perfect amount of wave and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and it works great.  The effect is softer, bigger waves.  Very pretty.  You can do big sections so it goes pretty fast.  A little hard to do on your own head though.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and in 5 minutes I have my entire head styled and out the door. I use a little hairspray and I wake up the next morning still looking styled. It makes my so somewhat thin  hair look very full.  It&#x27;s the best styling tool hands down that I have ever owned! I will buy a second one for my daughter because she is always borrowing mine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective. I can do my hair super fast and it looks very nice! Received many compliments</li>
            <li> Heats up within seconds and creates gorgeous waves! I get compliments on my hair every time I use this waver!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this tool!&lt;br /&gt;It did what it said it would do but most importantly it works really fast cause you can use it on big portions of your hair!&lt;br /&gt;It took me less than 15 mins to do my hair and I have long coarse hair that with my curling iron took me more that 55min to do!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice tool and easy to use. Loved the results on the back of my hair, but if you have layers like I do, it will be fairly poufy and unless you wanna look 90, you might wanna skip this. Works great for my daughters with long hair.</li>
            <li> for me it was a waste of money.  may work better for others.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks when I use</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look great!  I used it this morning and I think I have had this things for a couple years.</li>
            <li> I love using this. It does steam or smoke a little but doesn&#x27;t burn. It comes out nice</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves her new waves!</li>
            <li> Okay, I saw Khloe Kardashian on an interview with the most incredible waves and I had to have them for my own hair.  I finally tried this and it looks exactly like the waves Khloe had.  I use this constantly!  The waves are incredibly beautiful.  I lightly spray my hair with an aerosol hairspray before using the Speed Waver and the waves last for two days if I don&#x27;t toss and turn too much in the night.  This has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; tool for a fast, beautiful look.  I am 52, with long hair that is naturally fine and wavy if this helps anyone trying to decide if they want to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. I have thick coarse hair and yes it did wave the hair quickly but it just looked stupid AND with good hair protectors in place it still fried my hair, and I had it on the medium setting. I am in my 30&#x27;s and I was told by a friend (who gave me her honest opinion, which Im thankful for) that I looked like a 16 y.o. No thanks</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> Item works ok , once it did not heat up so just let it sit In the on position and it started getting hot again</li>
            <li> I have fine long super straight hair that can never hold a curl with a traditional curling iron but this speed waver really worked! It made beautiful waves in my hair that lasts all day. It was a very good purchase and I would definitely recommend. I keep it on low heat (high heat is waaay too hot) and it only takes about 7 mins to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. and very chip.. I recomend it!</li>
            <li> For $13 it&#x27;s a good waver/crimper but overall it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> My hair curls fairly easy, but this product barely made it wave at all. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Makes really nice soft waves in my daughters long, straight hair.  Lasts all day long and we have had a hard time finding an iron that will make lasting curls in her hair because it is so straight.  Highly recommend this product and company!</li>
            <li> Perfect waves every time! 8-10 seconds on each piece and it takes me around 15 minutes to do my whole head. Fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> I have flat, straight, thin, do nothing, hold no curl hair. When I use a normal curling iron it doesn&#x27;t last very long and if it rains I&#x27;m right back to where I started. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Speed Waver MANY times since I received it and have never had such amazing hair. The wave looks so natural. No kinks or creases. I also normally have to wash my hair every day in order to keep my hair looking nice, but this gives my hair such body that it doesn&#x27;t lay against my scalp which fixes the oily greasy hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get VERY HOT and burn your hair if not careful. I put little nail polish dots on my adjustment wheel so I know how much I have turned it and where the ideal wheel position is for me. I suggest you do the same to prevent hair damage. Mine is probably at a 2 out of 10 (if the dial was numbered) and that is plenty hot for my hair.</li>
            <li> makes hair look too unnatural</li>
            <li> I love doing my hair with this! After having it for a while, I totally love it and makes everything easier when it comes to doing my hair! Fast shipping and great value!</li>
            <li> Great Seller!  Shipped as Promised!  Would definitely Recommend!</li>
            <li> For the money I spent on this crimper, it definitely does the job! My hair comes out nice and defined and crimped the way it is supposed to.  This crimper can get really hot but you can control the heat settings, bottom line, it&#x27;s cheap and works well so get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this iron. I have very long course hair. I used a root pump and heat protector and blew dry my hair upside down for extra body.  Then used the iron section by section. I can&#x27;t even tell you how amazing my hair looks. A few hours later it looked even better. I almost bought a similar iron for $30.00 and I&#x27;m do happy I found this. Perfect price.</li>
            <li> Very cool waver.  Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I love it! I wear 24&amp;#34; extensions with ombre and they look just awesome! So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a wig that was supposed to be body waves, but it looked more like a bush. After using this product, my wig looked like the way I wanted it to when I first got it! It didn&#x27;t take long to get the waves in the hair. The waves did not fall out during the day. I got this at a great price.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and I love the way my hair turns out when completed</li>
            <li> I love my hair waver!!! There is definitely a learning curve but I am getting the hang of it. A heat proof pad is a must though</li>
            <li> I purchased this waver about 4 years ago from walmart and I LOVE IT! I don&#x27;t use it all the time, just when I want to do something different and I get so many compliments on it. I have extremely thick &amp; very long hair and it curls it perfect. I also use Kenra Platinum hot spray &amp; spray it on each section before waving it... it works awesome that way and holds really well AND it looks even better the next day after sleeping on it!</li>
            <li> I love this waver. I have a drawer full of unused curling products, but this is my go-to product now.  It is incredibly lightweight and easy to use.  My hair is almost waist long and I&#x27;m able to do my whole head in just a few minutes.  I use styling lotion first, use the waver and the style lasts for days.  It looks like I just braided my hair.  ALSO, the handle locks!  I love this feature as it makes the waver super easy to store away.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! It is everything I hoped for and more, and was totally worth my money. I even used it on my friends who have really thick hair and didn&#x27;t think I could do it, but I proved them wrong. I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> - I love this hair wave iron , it actually works &amp; I get complements everytime I use it , it takes 10 mintues to do my whole head &amp; I have thick hair , it&#x27;s stay all day &amp; sometimes the next day also</li>
            <li> Does a perfect job :)</li>
            <li> This tool burned my hair on the low temp. I have thin hair. I do not recomend this at all. I have used other tools in a high temp and it has never damaged my hair like this tool.</li>
            <li> This creates a lot of heat. Make sure to adjust your setting.  It is quite deep and doesn&#x27;t quite wave the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I usually never write product reviews. I bought this for my daughter and it barely waved her hair. I tried it on my hair also and same thing nothing but the smell of burnt unwavering hair. My hair is naturally wavy and holds curl extremely well and still didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Got it in the time they said they would have it shipped by. It heated up pretty fast and i was able to do my hair in 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;many people said it burnt their hair , but that is if you do not use a sort of heat protector.&lt;br /&gt;Over all my hair looks awesome and im able to do it faster I also got many complements. So far i have had no problems with it ,&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love the curls and the waver is easy to use. I would buy this again if the one I bought were to break.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! I wish hair was damage free so I could use it more often.!</li>
            <li> great product, awesome price.  arrived within days.Professional quality item and packaging easy to handle, as well as enviromentally friendly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, her hair is straight and difficult to curl.  This deep wave crimper works wonderfully.  The curls stay for a long time.  It gets very hot in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have previously had a waver like this before and it sadly died :( I ordered a new one because I couldn&#x27;t find one in store and I HAD to have another one! It heats up fast and only takes me like 10 or 15 minutes to get beautiful waves! And my hair is long and thick so that&#x27;s amazing to be done in that amount of time. I get compliments on my hair every time I use this. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this waver!!! I have long thin hair. The waves stay in all day and make my hair so full. So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I bought this waver and it was exactly what I wanted! I got it for a good price and it works very well</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Works as described. Unfortunately I returned it because it is not for my hair.</li>
            <li> OH WOW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i bought this waver i had long hair and was exited to get it to try it on!&lt;br /&gt;Before i received it i cut my hair short...and you know what? Short wavy hair looks really cute too!&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! mi hair feels soft and shines a lot...!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Go ahead and buy this product without hesitation.  It gets warm very fast and it is awesome!  I had a wonderful hairdo in less than 10 minutes (note: I have a lot and thick hair).  This is the product to get if you love soft waves.  I said:  &amp;#34;were have you been all my life&amp;#34; ; )</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I have thick hair and none of the waves came out right. The end result was my hair looking like a big mess. I think I will give it to my sister who has thinner hair</li>
            <li> Big cute waves quick to do short hair! Luv it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you want to look 1990&#x27;s. It doesn&#x27;t make pretty waves, it makes tight zig-zags. The barrel seems to just leave imprints in V shapes in your hair. The only way I find it useful is if I twirl a section of my hair, and then clamp it in. Either way, it ends up frizzy and does not look natural. I would have returned it if I hadn&#x27;t already torn up the package.</li>
            <li> I love it! Waves looks so natural! :)</li>
            <li> I love the waves, it look nice and natural. I gave it 4 stars because it has a strong order when I turn it on. I turn it with a low heat; however it still had the strong order. My husband thought that I burn something. Anyway, it was a pretty good iron.</li>
            <li> nice and style your hair with mins i love it</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this thing! Gives me that voluminous beachy wavy hair. Yes, it does get pretty hot but that&#x27;s&#x27; why you need to use your heat protectant spray. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Get too darn hot to touch even the black tip to help hold tight.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve come to have low expectations of hair tools since my hair is very long and fine - but this one is amazing.  easy to use (although my hand does hurt a bit after i&#x27;ve done my whole head) but the results are exactly what i want.  great beachy waves and my friends all think that it looks like it was done at a salon</li>
            <li> Broke almost immediately, cannot turn on. Poor quality curler</li>
            <li> It works nice but it has a smell when you crimp your hair.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and gives beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, and great waves - this is awesome! My hair is wavy/curly except for a couple of stubborn areas around my face. I&#x27;ve been using a curling iron around the front, but the results aren&#x27;t good (hard to get wavy instead of ringlets) and it takes forever. I was amazed by 1) how quickly I was able to do my hair, and 2) the great quality/hold of the waves. People who say it burns their hair must be turning it up too high or holding it on their hair too long - I&#x27;ve never had that problem. In fact,using this waver, my hair spends less time in contact with heat than it did when I used a curling iron. After researching several of the wavers, I am glad I went with this less expensive, very effective one!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend!!! awesome device</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this iron.</li>
            <li> Maybe my daughter&#x27;s hair is just too fine but it seems to take forever to make a &#x27;wave&#x27;.  It does heat quickly, and I haven&#x27;t used it on high because of the texture of her hair and I don&#x27;t want to burn it.  Maybe on thicker, courser hair it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the waves it gives my hair that lasts for days! use heat protection to protect your hair from getting damaged because it gets hot. I use the tresseme heat protector that i love. I had alittle trouble getting all my hair through the appliance but thats the only trouble i had with this product but im happy with it!!</li>
            <li> Great item! Was exactly what I wanted! Arrived quickly! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is pretty excellent waver. You can achieve such an amazing punk,girly,and beach waves. I would recommend it. It has a plastic kind of smell when I pulled it out, that is the only thing I dislike. The smell doesn&#x27;t go away. For the outstanding prices, I would say this is  definite buy :)</li>
            <li> It has big ends and have to be careful to not burn self</li>
            <li> I Love this waver! It&#x27;s super cute on my long hair and makes. It does what is says and waves...not crimps or curls but waves. I love the look! Waver heats up fast, has different setting for cooler or hotter temps. Works great!</li>
            <li> Its OK, its large!!! Heavy, so not for me. Gave to daughter\ granddaughter. They use it.</li>
            <li> I just received my &amp;#34;Pro Beauty Tools Professional Speed Waver&amp;#34; and I love it, coming from someone who is terrible at doing her own hair. I usually don&#x27;t do anything to my hair after I get out of the shower because every time I try to curl it, it looks awful! Well, this product definitely makes it easy to make your hair look super cute. It heats up fast but does have a weird burning smell to it. I&#x27;m not worried about it though. I tried it out as soon as I took it out of the box so this picture is a very half-assed job.</li>
            <li> I really love this waver the waves last all day and it heats up very fast and i have been using this waver for over 4 months around two times a week and it hasnt damaged my hair and it works well... highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product on my hair and it works nicely! I watched the tutorial and I liked the most the glam waves, so I followed the steps from the video and I loved the results!</li>
