            <li>/&gt;But the hold is good and strong and it really does look great.</li>
            <li>I love the look of this thing.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did</li>

            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>This is a very unique clip and will work well as a gift, or even for yourself.</li>
            <li>Cute for the price but cheaply made.</li>
            <li>However, the product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>I suggest strongly you use a bit of cloth or a tissue when attaching it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very attractive &amp; adds a little something to your outfit.</li>
            <li>Its very nice but clips are too short and slips off sweaters easily.</li>
            <li>If the fabric has a smooth texture they tend to slip off and don&#x27;t stay in place as well.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, and as long as it&#x27;s handled delicately, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fine.  </li>
            <li>They seem to work better on certain fabrics.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely butterfly sweater clip...looks dressy and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I also wear to work with modern sweaters for an elegant touch.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>The personal touch of the wrapping was nice.</li>
            <li>I love this clip and wear it frequently alternating with a couple of others that I bought.</li>
            <li>The clip is beautiful but the clasps are very stiff.</li>
            <li>I would spend a few more dollars for better quality of medal</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Not as nice as expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, it&#x27;s functional, it works.  </li>
            <li>The purchases were exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>I was not especially pleased that the clip was delivered in a plastic envelope without any kind of padding whatsoever.</li>
            <li>really pretty design much admired .</li>
            <li>This one is very nice except it is very hard to put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame really.</li>
            <li>This is so much nicer than anything I once owned.</li>
            <li>It is made of very durable material</li>
            <li>I am very diapponted.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your service.</li>
            <li>I get alot of comments on this, everyone wants to know where I got it.  </li>
            <li>Very antique looking.  </li>
            <li>She really loves it.</li>
            <li>They have been very gracious and helpful and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>We had originally thought that only 9 sweater clips were mailed and the company graciously sent another sweater clip.  </li>
            <li>Pretty to look at, but the first time I used it, I apparently opened one of the clips too far and stretched out the spring mechanism, so it wasn&#x27;t able to grip the fabric anymore.  </li>
            <li>clips are a little hard to open; but it&#x27;s beautiful, and I love it.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty and definitely served their purpose.</li>
            <li>The chain is a little longer and works better for me.</li>
            <li>pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>The clasps are sturdy and fit tightly.  </li>
            <li>so you really have to pinch it to open it.  </li>
            <li>I used sweater clips when I was a young girl in the 50s.  </li>
            <li>This reminds me of the old sweater sets.  </li>
            <li>The chain is a little too long, so I&#x27;ll have it shortened, but otherwise, I love the effect.</li>
            <li>Not for thick fabric or strong grippers.</li>
            <li>Needed this to keep sweaters with no buttons or shrugs closed with a little style, so this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Clasps are a little stiff and the chain is a tad bit long - so it doesn&#x27;t keep the sweater as together as I thought, but it is a gorgeous, heavy piece of jewelry.</li>

            <li> Very nice, however, one issue the claps are very hard to open and someone with arthritis might have a difficult time opening the claps.</li>
            <li> The chain is long enough for a shrug.  </li>
            <li> Also the change is too long and did not hold my sweater together.</li>
            <li> Did not have to wait to long for them to arrive.</li>
            <li> Chain too long, and won&#x27;t hold the cardigans together like it</li>
            <li> My mom, a tiny little woman, wanted something to hold her sweater across her shoulders.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that one of the clips is a bit bent and thus hard to press open.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and in the condition i expected.  </li>
            <li> this was a item my mother needed while in a rehab center after having surgery.</li>
            <li> The clips are small and take a lot of effort to open.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to hold on clip to open and slip on sweater</li>
            <li> The butterflies are smaller than I thought they would be and the filigree is hard to see.  </li>
            <li> But the butterfly pattern is rough and the clasp is firm</li>
            <li> The chain could be a little shorter</li>
            <li> but the chain could have been a little shorter or adjustable.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get them to open.</li>
            <li> not happy - the clips are so tight it hurts to open them and leaves a literal imprint on your finger.</li>
            <li> Pass on this one, it&#x27;s a waste of $.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;but will not fade or turn green.  </li>
            <li> At choir practice Wednesday night, one of our members found the missing sweater clip on the floor.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the clasp is good, but it&#x27;s painful and almost impossible to affix to my sweater since the clips are very hard to open.  </li>
            <li> Clips are extremely tight and small.</li>
            <li> a little difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Anxiously waiting to wear it.</li>
            <li> It is ver difficult to open the clasp.</li>
            <li> The chain was too short and it just looked sad when I saw it in person.</li>
            <li> Clips are rather difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Hard to use clips, and after two uses, the clips sprung and would not work anymore.  </li>
            <li> Clipping the ends on the sweater is difficult due to how small the clips are.</li>
            <li> The size makes it hard to manipulate.</li>
            <li> At least they should grip well.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the clips will loosen up with use because I had a very hard time getting it clipped onto my cape.</li>
            <li> This is just a poor mechanical design.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t just arthritic people who can&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to try and attach them to anything.</li>
            <li> They would be difficult to manipulate for those who have arthritis.</li>
            <li> but the alligator clips are very difficult to work</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to clip them on a sweater</li>
            <li> Disappointed in quality.  </li>
            <li> Completely worthless to me..</li>

            <li> Not very happy with it.  It won&#x27;t stay clipped to my sweater.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! There is a design flaw. This is a beautiful clip and would be great if it worked. It has front handles but the back of the clip&#x27;s handles are non-existent, it folds at the fulcrum, therefore you can&#x27;t get any leverage to open &amp; close the clips. It isn&#x27;t just arthritic people who can&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to try and attach them to anything. It&#x27;s a shame really. The &amp;#34;ugly&amp;#34; square clips &amp; needle nose clips that both look &amp;#34;dentist like&amp;#34; are the ones that actual work well! Go figure. Pass on this one, it&#x27;s a waste of $. Wish they would re-design it.</li>
            <li> Pretty to look at, but the first time I used it, I apparently opened one of the clips too far and stretched out the spring mechanism, so it wasn&#x27;t able to grip the fabric anymore.  Looks nice, and as long as it&#x27;s handled delicately, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fine.  Not for thick fabric or strong grippers.</li>

            <li> This works great to keep my sweaters from falling off my shoulders.  The chain is a little longer and works better for me.</li>
            <li> The photo does not do this clip justice.  It is exquisite.  The clasps are sturdy and fit tightly.  I used sweater clips when I was a young girl in the 50s.  This is so much nicer than anything I once owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sweater chain like this for years. This one is very nice except it is very hard to put on. Hopefully the clips will loosen up with use because I had a very hard time getting it clipped onto my cape.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend. She really liked it.</li>

            <li> Disappointed in quality.  Hard to use clips, and after two uses, the clips sprung and would not work anymore.  Also the change is too long and did not hold my sweater together.</li>
            <li> The perfect thing for a clasp on the deacon&#x27;s stole that I made for my son.  He wanted butterflies!</li>
            <li> Needed this to keep sweaters with no buttons or shrugs closed with a little style, so this fit the bill. I purchased 2 of them. So glad I did, I put both on at the same time.  They flip on very secure, and they work great. Did not have to wait to long for them to arrive. They deserve this five star, because everything was in order.</li>
            <li> My mom, a tiny little woman, wanted something to hold her sweater across her shoulders.  For some reason, she thought I had a sweater clip I could give her???  Found this one on Amazon and had it shipped to her as a surprise.  What a great treat - just what she wanted and looks perfect on her.  Thanks for making my mom happy!!</li>
            <li> I have a couple of sweaters that do not have buttons on them.  This reminds me of the old sweater sets.  I love this item.  I have gotten many compliment on it.  they want to know where they can purchase it.  I had no issues with the product when it arrived.  It was delivered on time and in the condition i expected.  The seller informed me of the progress of my order.  that it was received,  when shipment was made and expectation of arrival.  As I said it arrived on time.  No issues at all.  I would recommend this item to others and look forward to working with the seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my sweater chain.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for generously endowed ladies. It&#x27;s easier to wear sweaters and vests with a chain than fussing with buttons that pop open.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really beautiful.</li>
            <li> clips are a little hard to open; but it&#x27;s beautiful, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very diapponted.It is ver difficult to open the clasp.It doesn&#x27;t open enough to grasp fabric. Completely worthless to me..</li>
            <li> Love it. Thanks for your service.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but the alligator clips are very difficult to work</li>
            <li> The chain was too short and it just looked sad when I saw it in person. Gave it to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> I get alot of comments on this, everyone wants to know where I got it.  The chain could be a little shorter but i think I can shorten it myself.</li>
            <li> not happy - the clips are so tight it hurts to open them and leaves a literal imprint on your finger. Almost impossible to clip them on a sweater</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted.  The chain is a little too long, so I&#x27;ll have it shortened, but otherwise, I love the effect.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  Clasps are a little stiff and the chain is a tad bit long - so it doesn&#x27;t keep the sweater as together as I thought, but it is a gorgeous, heavy piece of jewelry.</li>
            <li> Lovely clip, great for sweaters for shawls.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. My friend loves it</li>
            <li> Not as nice as expected.  The butterflies are smaller than I thought they would be and the filigree is hard to see.  The clips are small and take a lot of effort to open.  At least they should grip well.</li>
            <li> Chain too long, and won&#x27;t hold the cardigans together like it should</li>
            <li> Love this everyone want to know where did I get this LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> Vintage to be sure - Granddaughter had no idea what it was.  Once educated - she loved it !!</li>
            <li> Beautiful but the chain could have been a little shorter or adjustable. Very attractive &amp; adds a little something to your outfit.</li>
            <li> Clips are extremely tight and small. Very hard to get them to open.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sweater clip.  Very antique looking.  I have received several compliments on this clip when I wear it out and about.</li>
            <li> I love this sweater clip.  It holds my sweaters in place so they are hanging off my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Great, got right on time</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of vintage fashion so this goes great with my wardrobe. I also wear to work with modern sweaters for an elegant touch. Love it!</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and I love it.</li>
            <li> Very small. Clipping the ends on the sweater is difficult due to how small the clips are. The size makes it hard to manipulate.</li>
            <li> The clip is beautiful but the clasps are very stiff. They would be difficult to manipulate for those who have arthritis. I was not especially pleased that the clip was delivered in a plastic envelope without any kind of padding whatsoever. However, the product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> this was a item my mother needed while in a rehab center after having surgery. She really loves it.</li>
            <li> really pretty design much admired .</li>
            <li> pretty much what I expected. a little difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I will use it more when the weather cools off, so I require a shawl. It is nice. None of the stores here sell them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, it&#x27;s functional, it works.  The only thing is that one of the clips is a bit bent and thus hard to press open.  But nothing that stops me from wearing it.</li>
            <li> adds a touch of bling &amp; class; get lots of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> The quality of the clasp is good, but it&#x27;s painful and almost impossible to affix to my sweater since the clips are very hard to open.  This is just a poor mechanical design.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law.  She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The purchases were exactly what we were looking for.  We had originally thought that only 9 sweater clips were mailed and the company graciously sent another sweater clip.  At choir practice Wednesday night, one of our members found the missing sweater clip on the floor.  We would like to apologize to DB-ROTH and will send the cost of the replacement clip they sent.  They have been very gracious and helpful and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love these and they go with everything.  A good purchase.</li>
            <li> Looks like the picture. Clips are rather difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Cute for the price but cheaply made. I would spend a few more dollars for better quality of medal</li>
            <li> IT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.... SO GLAD I FOUND IT ON YOUR WEB PAGE</li>
