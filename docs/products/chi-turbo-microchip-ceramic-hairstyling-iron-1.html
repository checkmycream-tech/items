            <li>Thank goodness that Amazon refunded my $200 (they are the best on-line store in the world!).  </li>
            <li>Just go ahead and buy the Chi -- you&#x27;ll be so happy that you did!</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>

            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is the best!</li>
            <li>The Chi is supposed to be the best hair straightener out there.  </li>
            <li>Here the price was excellent.  </li>
            <li>So, although the product itself is wonderful when it works, I would caution everyone against doing business with this company.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome straightening iron!!  </li>
            <li>Have had this straightening iron for 5 years and is still the best product I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>So glad I listened to my hairdresser!!!  </li>
            <li>I love the product!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for hair.</li>
            <li>It works great and is the best hair straightener my daughter has ever had.</li>
            <li>Their hair is helthy and brilliant after years of use.</li>
            <li>and I have an incredible problem with frizz</li>
            <li>I loved this product!</li>
            <li>It works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is awesome about replacing it if malfunction occurs within 30 days but GOOD LUCK in getting Farouk to fix or replace it.</li>
            <li>If you want to straighten your hair, this iron will work splendidly.  </li>
            <li>My replacement works great though.</li>
            <li>The adjustable temperature is great too.  </li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>The product worked great for about 5 months then the on/off switch went haywire and it quit working.</li>
            <li>Great price when compared to stores like Ulta, Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mines for almost 2 years now and its great.</li>
            <li>It seemed like just another great product from Chi.    </li>
            <li>and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Everything was great.  </li>
            <li>they replaced it so my granddaughter was happy.</li>
            <li>it works great, doesn&#x27;t damage her hair, and heats up immediately.  </li>
            <li>She uses it every day and seems happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The straightener was great</li>
            <li>I think this product is great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>and I get great results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for almost two years now, and even though I don&#x27;t use it often, it works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>the Chi tames it and compacts it which has been great during this growing out phase.  </li>
            <li>It was great...</li>
            <li>Had it forever now, and still works great.  </li>
            <li>Great tool if you know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>When I received this straightener, I used it one day and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Price is great, product is great.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, and I recieved it i great condition.  </li>
            <li>I got a great deal on this iron but had my doubts that it was the iron for me.</li>
            <li>I have used the 2\\&quot; for over 3 years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li>and it worked great until this morning, 12/26/08.  </li>
            <li>This one is a bit hotter, the contoured handle makes it easier to maneuver &amp; the swivel cord is great.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is great</li>
            <li>well mine was great</li>
            <li>This straightener, while pricey makes my hair feel silky and straightens great.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for 1 month</li>
            <li>I should note that we do use a salon cord protector but still experienced problems.  </li>
            <li>I am greatly please with my Chi Turbo product.</li>
            <li>(So, be sure not to forget to turn it off!!)  </li>
            <li>I love my Chi!!</li>
            <li>very nice product.</li>
            <li>THis straightener is amazing!  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing this product is!</li>
            <li>it was OK, but this one is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product and thought it was the excellent kind in the market.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sure made my wife a happy woman, and that&#x27;s ALWAYS a good thing!</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was excellent: very fast (3 days!!)</li>
            <li>I went to a beauty store and asked about a good hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>I rather get a good one from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I had what I thought was a good flattening iron..</li>
            <li>The shine is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.     </li>
            <li>It always worked really good...</li>
            <li>The eventual outcome is good though.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this Chi.  </li>
            <li>any day i use it is a good hair day.  </li>
            <li>However the good news is that Amazon will replace the product.      </li>
            <li>I thought I loved my Wigo which was about $80 at Ulta, but after my stylist used the Chi -</li>
            <li>I decided to suck it up and buy it because my hair came out so good</li>
            <li>They must have been throwing it around or not taking good care of it.</li>
            <li>Now i am stuck with this $100 hair iron that is good for nothing.  </li>
            <li>The best straightener I ever bought, very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It works great, I love the adjustable temp control.</li>
            <li>i am very happy with this straightener, it was definately worth the price...</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought this product at Amazon, as well.  </li>
            <li>I can now do my own hair just as good as the beauty salon.  </li>
            <li>and it straightened it better than anything I have ever tried before!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>which I know I love and just happens to be cheaper than the CHI straightener!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love my CHI!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, works very well, good looking and a great value for money.</li>
            <li>then I think you&#x27;re going to love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>i do love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>i love my chi!</li>
            <li>and I still love it now!  </li>
            <li>I love this straightener!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems as yet and am enjoying my purchase!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>I love my CHI!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the CHI!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>She was absolutely correct - it&#x27;s a wonderful gadget and my hair has never looked better in my life!</li>
            <li>This is the greatest little hair straightener, and it&#x27;s at an excellent price!</li>
            <li>what an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The chi is an amazing straightener.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The Chi straightener is AMAZING, it straightens it with the type of heat my hair needs but doesn&#x27;t burn it at all.  </li>
            <li>You can also adjust the temperature which is nice.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I plugged it in and gave it time to warm up.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes it was warm, but I could put my fingers on the iron and close it on them.</li>
            <li>Straightens my hair immediately and is one of kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking time to learn to use it and get the kind of results I am looking for.</li>
            <li>Nice.    </li>
            <li>and it stayed so nice for 2 days.</li>
            <li>Heard many good things about the Chi and decided to   order online after my niece suggested she bought her Chi online.  </li>
            <li>It helps a lot for a perfect straight hair finish.</li>
            <li>it is easy and quick to use and makes any hair perfect!</li>
            <li>It is worth every dollar!!!</li>
            <li>This also was the best price on this particular straightner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at the hair straightening thing, and this iron works great on my naturaly curly hair!!!</li>
            <li>Within two weeks I got a new Solia iron and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>its easy to use and the results are good...</li>
            <li>She was happy with the classic chi, but she&#x27;s even more happy with the turbo chi.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it!  :-)</li>
            <li>(Just be sure that you turn it off! :) )</li>
            <li>As far as I know, it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>The Farouk CHI GF 1583 is the perfect counter to combat the Wild Woman from Boreno look.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that it took me five minutes to completely straighten my hair and it looked wonderful.</li>
            <li>ITS MY FAVORITE THING I OWN (BESIDES MY COACH)</li>
            <li>but it does make it smooth, which is a good thing for my course hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great and is definately worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The velvet on the top is nice for when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to burn my fingers.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>My friends have ceramic ones that work just as well, or better, but my hair stylist used this on me, and I can honestly say that this is my favorite hair straightner.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use, with great results.</li>
            <li>It straightens her hair quickly and makes it look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Product was new, in original packaging and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>So basically, it has done what it is supposed to do and more well and has lasted for us.</li>
            <li>The CHI is an ok straightener.</li>
            <li>This one is even better since it is adjustable for heat settings.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this item was because of its popularity, many of my friends had a CHI.</li>
            <li>I even used the CHI protecter spray, and it still damaged my hair and caused many split ends.</li>
            <li>I am able to straighten with ease.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>She likes this so much better than off-the-shelf Walmart brands.  </li>
            <li>In fact I love it and couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without it.  </li>
            <li>I have also used it many times on my children&#x27;s hair at differing heat levels.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, the model I received 3 years ago was of better quality.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this straightener.  </li>
            <li>It has velvet on the bottom and top shoudl you decide to use this to curl your hair.  </li>
            <li>so it is better for my hair.</li>
            <li>So, even though you buy it through Amazon, a respectable place to buy things, you won&#x27;t get any support for it after 30 days.  </li>
            <li>I have been using straightening irons for many years.  </li>
            <li>and for free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M NOT CONVINCED THE TURBO IS ANY BETTER FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the Solia will prove more durable.</li>
            <li>I had never been able to get my hair to do that.  </li>
            <li>I felt even better about buying it after our stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say great because I never felt that it really did wonders for my hair like a lot of people hair.</li>
            <li>Saves many hours in the bathroom</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my hair, even my beautician has said she can notice the difference in the maintenance of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the same model of Chi flatiron about 4 years ago and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>She has been pleased with product and no problems noted.</li>
            <li>I see that the price has gone up, but I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you know that the warranty for this product is VOID is purchased online.     </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product.  </li>
            <li>At a retail store it cost about $30 more.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good straightener, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It might be best to spend the extra money and get it at a salon...</li>
            <li>Plus I love the felt lining on the top and bottom, it helps to keep from burning your fingers.  </li>
            <li>chi has lasted longer,worked better, and my hair is healthier than before.</li>
            <li>It is quite simply the best out there, and recommended and used by most hair stylists when you visit the salon.  </li>
            <li>I love my straightener.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like most straighteners do.</li>
            <li>was about $40 more than I paid for mine.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this one thinking it would be better because it has temperature controls.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you purchase one from an authorized Beauty Supply Store.  </li>
            <li>My favorite aspect of it is the adjustable temp controls.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good quality straightener, this is definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>Be sure that whatever you buy it is not made by Farouk ...</li>
            <li>I did however LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>(Ceramic is better heat source and it doesn&#x27;t snag and tear my hair like the cheaper ones</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The packaging itself was horrible--the boxed iron had no support in the Amazon shipping box; it had plenty of room to be banged around during the shipping process (perhaps contributing to the cause of it not being able to get</li>
            <li>And fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>If you decide to, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>this one seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>I prefered the Turbo for the Velvet part and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you spray your hair with a protectant before you start.</li>
            <li>great item fast shipping</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>now I dont use it more then 2-3 a month</li>
            <li>I was told by so many friends that this was the best flat iron but still was not convinced.  </li>
            <li>this iron doesnt style very well, but it makes ur hair very nice and sraight.</li>
            <li>Chi definitely is 10 times better than the rest!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this iron, don&#x27;t hesitate buy it now!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product after I had read some of the reviews...</li>
            <li>This flat iron was not my best experience.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect size flat iron for any length hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 6 months and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best ever.</li>
            <li>THE most wonderful flat iron!!!   </li>
            <li>Just as good and much lighter in weight!</li>
            <li>I loved it when I first got it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and it still looks and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>My sisters purchased one first, I used it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>So, after shower, I blow dry my hair and then I straighten them for the best result with this product and as long as it doesn&#x27;t rain, my hair looks perfect!</li>
            <li>well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!!</li>
            <li>Does a good job of straightening curly hair and an even better job of smoothing straight hair.</li>
            <li>She can go thru the whole day with straight hair.it works GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>After asking several people what kind of straight iron works the best, I purchased the CHI &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this item more than 7 years and been worked fine.</li>
            <li>Our hairdresser said it is the best Flat Iron available.  </li>
            <li>I reordered the original CHI for her, I just hope it lasts longer than the first one, when you spend this kind of money for an iron, it would be nice to feel you got what you paid for.  </li>
            <li>but i would recomment to try a different chi, as the chi irons are usually very good products.</li>
            <li>, Farouk Chi won&#x27;t warranty it \\&quot;if not purchased from a professional salon.\\&quot; Bummers, its a great product</li>
            <li>it came even quicker than i expected and was a great transaction!</li>
            <li>I was thinking to buy a newer model more advanced, but I thought why?  </li>
            <li>I had the old Chi iron for about 5 years and it was great.</li>
            <li>An authentic Chi is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>The best 100 dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been brilliant, and I recently bought this US one to use while I&#x27;m visiting my family in the States.  </li>
            <li>It straightened hair fairly well and didn&#x27;t seem very damaging at all.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly &amp; straightens my hair very easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth; I can flip it this way, flip it that way and make it as straight as a stick!!!!</li>
            <li>I have used the original CHI but this product is better because you have the option of changing the temperature.</li>
            <li>I also heard that the chi turbo works better than the original chi.</li>
            <li>Tried other brands but this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything was great!</li>
            <li>It is easy to style the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>and it is also lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>therefore, it was easy to see what was inside.  </li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she gets home from school before anyone else and could have easily seen what her gift was going to be.  </li>
            <li>The item doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>This product is sleek and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>probably one of the best and most heavy duty straighteners that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Easy to control, mistake proof(other</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife for Christmas in 2007 and it&#x27;s still going strong in 2014.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1&amp;#34;CHI Turbo Microchip Ceramic Hairstyling Iron over 8 years ago to help manage my daughter&#x27;s unruly hair and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I loved the high quality hair straighteners used in salons.  </li>
            <li>My whole family has used this product for years and we are all very pleased.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still amazingly still going and still just as hot the day I got it.</li>
            <li>Chi make hair products like silk infusion that smell great and enhance the finish and they protect your hair even more when used with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>great, i could never do my own hair with other irons.</li>
            <li>It is a full ceramic,(not a coated ceramic, like many I have tried before), and has protected my hair.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best price in town is here on Amazon for it too!</li>
            <li>I bought mine literally 5 years ago, and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li>My ceramic one from Walmart has been working just fine for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>She has shoulder-length, fine, but frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>and while you should always use a heat protector -- it does not seem to be damaging my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally fine curly hair</li>
            <li>It does the trick quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li>I love that the temperature is adjustable since my hair is very fine in addition to being a combination of very wavy and curly.</li>
            <li>and I love it for my own very naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>it does leave your hair with a smooth and sleak look afterwards.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t smooth like this one.</li>
            <li>I will never have another cheap iron.</li>
            <li>My hair lasted frizz free until I washed it again.  </li>
            <li>Overall This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The cheap one damaged my hair and made it look frizzier</li>
            <li>There is so much for control with this iron, and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser always used this hair iron to straighten my hair and it always came out fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the 2\\&quot; with is great for a larger area.</li>
            <li>The powere light kept flickering and it didn&#x27;t get up to the highest temp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been several weeks since I got my CHI and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>for superfine hair, I recommend the 0.7\\&quot; (mistakenly advertised as 0.07\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comfortable and light.</li>
            <li>From cheap to not so cheap.  </li>
            <li>The 1\\&quot; iron allows you to get a smooth finish from the roots to the ends of hair and also to flip the ends if you wish.</li>
            <li>It does not pull her hair and leaves her hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I can get away with washing it two - three times a week</li>
            <li>cheap when you pick it up.  </li>
            <li>but it actually works great.</li>
            <li>It really works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it glides on my hair leaving it silky, shiny and straight protecting it against the moisture and humidity.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product, I have very coarse frizzy hair and in about 15 minutes it transforms it into silky straight strands.</li>
            <li>I have used alot of things trying to straighten my hair but this iron is far superior.</li>
            <li>I tried the regular CHI and I loved it, but now with the turbo is much better, I have tons of hair and it straights it immediately</li>
            <li>It gives smooth impressive results especially if you have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling good like my old iron did,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many ceramic flat irons before and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>It did end up costing more, but it worked right out of the box and it is covered for a year.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great</li>
            <li>This really is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have had this flat iron for five years already and it still works great.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy and saves time....</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Straightens quickly and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This one heats up easily, and slides through my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Heated up very quickly and very hot and steamy.</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Upon using it the first time, the felt on top of the heat paddles started pulling up and getting my hair stuck in it.</li>
            <li>i havnt used this chi for a long time, but i dont think its as great as it sounds.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser recommended chi flat straightening iron for my curly hair and so far i am very happy about the results since i have a very unruly curly hair this product work wonders for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>First off, both my wife and daughter LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>, I hope this was useful!</li>
            <li>I would buy the original vs. this one.</li>
            <li>Instead of risking it for this product, I am returning it and purchasing the original in a salon.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>I just used the Chi for the first time and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Id stick to the original chi for flattening hair.</li>
            <li>- I didn&#x27;t want to wait another 5+ weeks for the originally I bought</li>
            <li>the first was a 2\\&quot;, but 1\\&quot; is better for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised and have been very pleased with the results of this straightener.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate and trust the products I purchase from Amazon, for I am never disappointed and always receive the items in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the money!</li>
            <li>this is DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
            <li>It was great to receive the flat iron that I wanted for my daughter so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic iron, heats up quickly, has a swivel cord, variable temperature control.  </li>
            <li>The price was good and the shipping was free, but I sent the product back after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Excellent - heats up very quickly - one swipe and my hair is straight - takes less than 10 minutes to do my enire head</li>
            <li>A good friend had one and used it on my hair - it makes it soo straight so fast -</li>
            <li>It works so perfect and straightens my hair in half of the time as my Hot Tools Iron did.</li>
            <li>Although the Chi is supposed to be the best in hair straighteners, I have had difficulty using it and am returning to my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft, and it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and with free delivery with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>It has to be handled with care and properly stored in order to keep in good condition.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, and it will become an indispensable part of your hair routine.</li>
            <li>I have curly, thick hair and this straightener works great!</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks, the velvet started peeling and it did not seem to be heating to full temperature.  </li>
            <li>Love the product heats fast and works well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas present for a family member and they loved it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was good enough to replace mine.</li>
            <li>It definitely works really good</li>
            <li>The quick heat is wonderful for those late for work mornings.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to straight my hair, I just need to go over once or twice, my hair is already very straight.</li>
            <li>(Color : BLACK)]]I have tried cheaper flat irons, and boy what a difference a good one like the Chi is.  </li>
            <li>Face it, we&#x27;ll never make our hair look as good as it does at the salon when someone else is doing it, but with the Chi flat iron, I think I&#x27;m as close as I&#x27;ll get.  </li>
            <li>I dropped my chi flat iron about a gazillion times and its still working as good as day one.  </li>
            <li>so i need a good flat iron!  </li>
            <li>It is a really good flat iron!</li>
            <li>It works so quickly on my hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily I am in the return window for folica.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this product for my mom because she, too, has fallen in love with the magic of the CHI.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and in time for the holidays even though I ordered it close to Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my very first chi flat iron and loved it.</li>
            <li>and this straightens it quickly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better results.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Amazon replaced my straighter at no charge</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make me love it even more is if it had an auto-shut-off.  </li>
            <li>it heats up quickly also.  </li>
            <li>especially good for the hair types of african American&#x27;s</li>
            <li>At first I was super excited and than I talked to a hairstylist who told me that the CHI turbo has 2x the amount of problems as the origianl often not heating up even close to the ORIGINAL CHI.</li>
            <li>So luckily I still have my receipt</li>
            <li>and i can straighten really quickly.</li>
            <li>i do wish it had an auto-off after a certain amount of time, or that the power light were more visible to a right-hand user, but really, that&#x27;s nitpicking.</li>
            <li>But I never could find one that got very hot.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this iron just under a year ago and it worked beautifully up till just a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>So in sum, it&#x27;s effective, easy to use, great on the hair, and it&#x27;s apparently quite durable even after a HARD fall.</li>
            <li>I love my new CHI that I bought this evening and definately will not say, \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy a CHI at all.\\</li>
            <li>I love my new Chi.</li>
            <li>I have owned this product for a year and a half, and it is a great investment for me.</li>
            <li>it heats up fast and the padded sides make it easy to curl the ends.</li>
            <li>It is easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, heats up fast, and lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and it really durable.</li>
            <li>It takes my wavy hair and very quickly makes it straight.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>and it comes out so much nicer!!</li>
            <li>About a week later I turned it on just to see if I could get it working again, and low and behold, it turned on and works just as perfectly as it did the first day</li>
            <li>parts\\&quot; look like they were glued on and the product did not get hot at all, ended up wasting money on this!</li>
            <li>I purchased two 5 years ago still greats as the first day!</li>
            <li>(I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage).  </li>
            <li>Website is very user friendly and customer service is convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>It straigtens my hair in minutes without drying it out or making it brittle and my hair is smooth, silky, and stays straight no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li>I always used to wonder how my hair stylist could get my hair so silky, straight, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out so smooth and bone straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like that its light and more compact than my old one.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair smooth, bone straight, shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and silky, however, at the same time damages it greatly, like all straighteners.</li>
            <li>It will only get warm now and even after leaving it on for 1 hour</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This professional unit does the job better</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>As a straightner its is really good, but if you want to do fancy flips or shapes then be aware of how long it is on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is definently worth the $$$ to buy a CHI.  </li>
            <li>but, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so sleek and so glossy, everyone always asks me if I&#x27;ve had it done, even though it was only 45 minutes of my own time</li>
            <li>The CHI is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I love to straighten in the winter.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I preferred my cheaper old one that could flip my hair better and was ionizing .</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I liked the fact that it has the felt on the outside</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for that smile.</li>
            <li>All my friends said it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I owned a chi before this one for about 4 years and dropped it one too many times and the plate came completely off.  </li>
            <li>Then my friend got one, and finally I have my own.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I actually had a vastly better experience with the original Chi than this one.</li>
            <li>Love it and glad recomend other to buy it too.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and doesnt give my hair that burnt smell..</li>
            <li>It gets super hot but you can adjust the temp control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a product I would highly suggest however would NOT spend the extra money just because it says it&#x27;s a turbo, they did something right when they created the origianl something they have yet been able to top.</li>
            <li>This Flat Iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think my Chi has finally kicked the bucket, but with all the abuse I put it through, I&#x27;m amazed and impressed it&#x27;s lasted this long and worked so well the whole time.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;ve struggled with finding the right tool for dealing with curly or wavy hair</li>
            <li>Trying to resolve with Amazon right now.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, straightens hair well and still performs as well as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>It does not heat up as high as my original one and is very tinny and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does straighten hair, but again, I and my daughter did not find that it straightened hair better and did not find it worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>and while it is still working fine, wanted a new one on hand in case it dies one of these days.)  </li>
            <li>This makes my normally frizzy hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I could barely touch it and it made my hair have static.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable temperature is great no more split ends.</li>
            <li>This keeps it nice all day long.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy, but my friends hair is very curly, and we both are able to achieve silky straight hair with this iron, thanks to the temperature control.  </li>
            <li>But this has not been an issue because the adjustment slider is set to what heat worked for my hair and it is obviously very easy to know that if I slide it to the left is lower temp and to the right is higher temp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got many positive points: It gets hot fast for people in a hurry (like me); It hasn&#x27;t heat damaged my hair at all; It&#x27;s easy to get the back of my head with the cord.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the chi, they are sooo worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd of these that we have bought (1st for my wife, 2nd for her sister) and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>I am a proud convert to the cult of CHI, and I can never go back to regular straightening irons.</li>
            <li>My hair is now extremely straight, and I just use it for quick touch-ups in the morning between washings.  </li>
            <li>I finally bought one (and was able to rationalize the cost) but it is so worth the money-</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and my hair looks so silky.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly and gets my hair as straight as my stylist does.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast as well.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much...</li>
            <li>I got a replacement and so far it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and straightens my thick curly hair with one pass to a nice smooth, silky texture.</li>
            <li>the tool straightens in one swipe (my hair is hard to straighten) and it also works great to curl the ends.</li>
            <li>and I first used hers.</li>
            <li>Now that I have my second Chi, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I had a WIGO straightener that cost more, but couldn&#x27;t straighten enough.  </li>
            <li>So it works well for people that have really curly/wavy hair (which I do!)</li>
            <li>I unplugged it and after closer inspection, found that it was melting itself where the ceramic hot plat section touched the plastic.</li>
            <li>This straightener is first class.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Chi Turbo after the straightener I had broke.</li>
            <li>If you hold it a certain way it will heat up but its just not styling right.</li>
            <li>First they wanted to keep 30% of what I paid to restock the defective product.</li>
            <li>Please be aware.</li>
            <li>I have been using this tool for over three years, and it works just as well as it did when I first took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my daughter wanted.  </li>
            <li>However, you must first contact them for an RA#.</li>
            <li>I thought I woud try the smaller size iron to see if it offered more flexibility in styling.  </li>
            <li>For an iron that gets so hot, I would think this would be a required feature.    </li>
            <li>size matters - smaller size is better -</li>
            <li>yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost a year since we purchased this iron, and my wife is quite satisfied with this present.  </li>
            <li>Much better than store brands, it only needs to go through my hair once to straighten, so it saves on time it takes to straighten.</li>
            <li>It is made of quality products and much safer on the hair!</li>
            <li>Curls turn out funny.  </li>
            <li>and they said to send the product back in with $15 for processing (on top of the shipping I had to pay to send it in),</li>
            <li>I also use the \\&quot;silk infusion\\&quot; in the summer, to help keep my hair under control in the hot and humid weather (and it works).I bought the \\&quot;silk infusion\\&quot; at an Ulta store, and you can also order it online</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it was made of cheap material, and so far it has not damaged my hair.  </li>
            <li>it works pretty well on both hair types.</li>
            <li>every one of these 1 star reviews have been my exact experience.  </li>
            <li>I should have read them first ..</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I found that the chi turbo is great for women with thick and/or a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teen daughter because I have heard and read so many rave reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>While it works well enough, I don&#x27;t think it works that much better than the $25.00 ones we already owned.</li>
            <li>it made my hair so much healthier, shinier, softer, silkier, everything!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty curly</li>
            <li>After using other brands of hair straighteners (and going through several of them) for 7 years now, the Chi is by far the best hair straightener</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>B000BBF4MW Infrashine Original Professional Ceramic Styling]]</li>
            <li>I love my chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have tried many flat Iron.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it is the most efficient flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>NICE way to treat someone who spent $120 on your product!</li>
            <li>I have an authentic Chi flat iron to compare it to and this one does NOT heat up</li>
            <li>I have had flat irons before, but this one is light weight, does not break my hair, and I have tons of frizz, and after using this iron - my whole texture changes to smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>i love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat Iron!</li>
            <li>Her hair is fine &amp; has a slight natural wave with a tendency to get frizzy without tools or product to help, and any straightener she has used in the past has been able to get her hair nice &amp; straight fairly easily, until now--</li>
            <li>It works well, and makes my hair very \\&quot;stick\\&quot; straight!  </li>
            <li>It was a Christmas Present and was shipped very quickly upon ordering.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and its quick to use.</li>
            <li>its so great!ITS EASY AND SIMPLE!</li>
            <li>Great Irons just make sure you uses chi Iron guard spray and chi oil for sheen(liquid oil in bottle pour little in hand an place on each small section of hair you straighten)</li>
            <li>If she doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;hold\\&quot; it a certain way, it will shut off.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Several months after I purchased this iron, it wouldn&#x27;t get hot, only warm.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super straight and soft.</li>
            <li>It worked fine until it broke two months later</li>
            <li>If your hair is think or short, the 1 inch should work just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than all of the cheaper irons I have bought in the past, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have found that if I use it too often, as with any heat product, my hair has a tendency to dry out, but I bought a silk infused gel, also made by Chi, which works very well to protect my hair and make it look more like naturally straight hair instead of curly hair that was straightened and looks sizzled on the ends.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty decent the one time I tried it</li>
            <li>This is my first professional flat iron and I love it.</li>
            <li>i have tried it on 4 of my friends, 1 of them with the most damaged hair i&#x27;ve ever seen, and every single one of them has now bought one for themself, no joke!    </li>
            <li>I have tried several brands of flat irons and this one is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>After owning this flat iron for a year and a half, I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener and its worth its weight in gold (when it works), but at $120 dollars you are taking an expensive risk.</li>
            <li>I really like the CHI Turbo Iron Hair Straightener, I would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t use it every day, maybe three or four times a year to straighten her hair, but she has very curly hair, so when she does use it, it gets a work out.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is fast and it makes your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Much easier than your run of the mill straighteners.  </li>
            <li>Also curls very well.  </li>
            <li>I have very unruly kinky curly hair that resists styling but with this product I can straighten and style my hair just like my hairdresser, who also uses this product and recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for a couple years already and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I wear it straight all the time.</li>
            <li>The product that arrived on my doorstep is nothing compared to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Really fast</li>
            <li>and my hair stays straight even if it rains.</li>
            <li>Just use it fast and shut it off.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>This is too much money to just throw away.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Even in humid weather my hair stays straight the whole day.   </li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s hair has changed, it is almost completely straight when it dries up by itself, before using the Chi.</li>
            <li>Order was filled quickly, prior to Christmas.</li>
            <li>Their products are great while working, but they do not stand behind them once they break.</li>
            <li>so after about a year, the temperature numbers rubbed off and I can&#x27;t really read them at all.  </li>
            <li>It glides through my hair smoothly and after 8 months of using it almost daily (with Chi iron guard)I</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much because of the ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li>My hair is like curly frizzy straw, I use this iron and the chi silk infusion and my hair becomes straight and silky without looking greasy..</li>
            <li>The straightness really depends on the amount of hair used in each section.  </li>
            <li>pin straight</li>
            <li>and it stays straight until I wash it.</li>
            <li>so decided to treat myself to the real thing</li>
            <li>It has saved me so much money.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li>My friends all bought theirs at retail stores and paid twice as much.</li>
            <li>and I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Using Chi has minimized the amount of hair breakage and my ends dont feel damaged, my hair stays straight with no frizz throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This straightener also works really fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to keep going over it to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep the frizz away and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stick straight</li>
            <li>the product really smooths and softens the hair.</li>
            <li>A friend had this very one</li>
            <li>I have wavey hair that &#x27;grows&#x27; with the humidity, so I was not expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed her hair stays straight for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so straight and KEPT it straight even through all the humidity.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a straightener, so I didn&#x27;t buy one when all my friends were raving about it.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare, but I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The Chi straightened my hair so much that it would just stick straight out</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>this product looks real</li>
            <li>Amazon was nice enough to replace it, but now that one has died 8 months later.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a good quality product, seeing as how it cost so much, but it broke after my daughter used it for a month, after which time it was too late to return.  </li>
            <li>This iron works well on my thick curly hair, but what good is it if it doesn&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Chi I have ever had and highly recommend it to any hair straightner user!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and this is fast and easy</li>
            <li>super HOT and heats up like instantly.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter liked the flat iron ,but it is too pricey to not last a year.  </li>
            <li>My last iron was a Hai which I loved, but the cord eventually broke due to it not having a swivel head.  </li>
            <li>, this is the best straightener for my long thick hair!</li>
            <li>i have not used many straighteners in my life before, and i have VERY curly hair, but this one made my hair softer and straighter than any other straightener.  </li>
            <li>I had another brand flat iron which was cheap.</li>
            <li>It straigntens my hair better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve used, and heats up faster.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and most the time I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of straightening it</li>
            <li>I had heard about this product and it is even better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair shiny, smooth and smelling like your conditioner rather than flat iron like burnt hair.</li>
            <li>When it finally stopped working, I decided to purchase the same model again since it seemed to be a worthwhile investment the first time.</li>
            <li>I got this today, really excited and nervous at the same time.</li>
            <li>I read all the other reviews and notcied the problems they had, so I made sure to check it before I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard the same problems with the original CHI and by purchasing it in the salon, I will be covered by the warrenty.</li>
            <li>&quot; I would just be willing to pay a little more and get a valad warranty.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; staighteners, and have damaged my hair because of them.</li>
            <li>My mom bought me a bunch of different straighteners- steam, cheap ceramic, etc., but Chi turbo saved my high school years.</li>
            <li>Finally, after threatening them with complaints to the State Attorney General&#x27;s Office and the Better Business Bureau, and a phone call from my lawyer they sent me a replacement....and a letter stating that there was NO warranty for this replacement.    </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much money (far more than I&#x27;d ever spent on hair supplies) on a product I&#x27;d never seen, but with a recommendation from my friend, I went ahead and took the risk.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for nearly two years.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but I am not sure that it is all that it is cracked up to be and for the price, some of the cheaper ones work just as well.</li>
            <li>I have the original CHI Flat Iron, which has served me well for years.</li>
            <li>It is a higher grade than my professional stylist uses and in fact this one will save me trups to the salon as I can now do it myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of hesitant about the fact that CHI is going to start distributing via Target... :/</li>
            <li>and I am bringing back to TARGET and getting a full refund.</li>
            <li>I had the original and just recently bought the new one.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the felt is starting to come off but other than that the iron works great.</li>
            <li>(in fact, it was peeling off after one use), the ceramic plates do NOT float (move loosely when you push on them), the power chord is not the advertised 10-feet long (it was 6 feet), and it is light weight and cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is quite curly and you live in a humid area, I would suggest not buying it and going for the curly haired look, because chances are you won&#x27;t find a straightener that will straighten your hair and keep it straight.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really loves her new straightener.</li>
            <li>She says it heats up and is better at temperature control than her previous ones.</li>
            <li>These irons are much better than the ones you might buy in typical stores (Conair, Revlon, etc.).  </li>
            <li>My roommate has had one that I&#x27;ve been using for several months and we haven&#x27;t had a problem with it, but the first one that I was sent broke after the first time I used it-</li>
            <li>The Chi is gentle on your hair and always makes mine look straight and soft.</li>
            <li>HEATS UP QUICKLY, BUT I HAVE ALSO OWNED THE REGULAR CHI.</li>
            <li>I loved the Chi while it lasted - I blow dryed my hair with a round brush (which left it poofy and frizzy) and then used the chi once my hair was dry to get silky smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair</li>
            <li>this is such a great product i recomded it at least once a</li>
            <li>I am glad I went with the more expensive turbo,</li>
            <li>My girlfriend&#x27;s classic chi blew a couple of months ago</li>
            <li>I had the older version &amp;</li>
            <li>I loved how the product handled but it didn&#x27;t last long for the price you pay (my conair curling iron has last 10</li>
            <li>I plugged it in a converter in Germany on the high button.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product ot any one wanting to straighten her hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended to me by my hairstylist</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It leaves my naturally curly, naturally frizzy hair perfectly straight and totally frizz free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li>, but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the CHI Turbo.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how highly I rate it...</li>
            <li>The Chi is an excellent Flat Iron, though expensive.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant on spending this much for a flat iron, but it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have convinced several other women to purchase this item because I love it so much!  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for the price, I would get a little more use out of it, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li>constantly plugged in, always kept it on the highest heat settings, and have thrown it in my bathroom cupboard haphazardly, never taking particular care to protect it.</li>
            <li>I eceived the Chi Flat Iron quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Chi flat iron heats up quickly, maintains the temp well and does not burn your hair.  </li>
            <li>I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a hair straightener.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and much straighter than anything else I had tried.</li>
            <li>The Turbi Chi arrived in the expected time, but when I gave it as a Christmas gift we immediately noticed that the light was not in the correct position</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, especially if you have a lot of hair like me!</li>
            <li>and I can say without a doubt that this iron is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I straighten everyday &amp; love this product dearly.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, and it flat irons your hair.</li>
            <li>The results are well worth the extra dollars it costs.  </li>
            <li>I called Amazon back and told them and asked for some help, but they just pretty much told me there was NOTHING they could do.  </li>
            <li>We were able to return the Chi and did receive a refund within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to not have to worry about the house burning down if I accidentally left it unattended.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it falls over easily on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American and I bought this flat iron because I used a friends and liked the staying power of the curls.  </li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;d pop right back out</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, no complaints so far!</li>
            <li>Repeatedly I have experienced them to have electrical problems which is very frustrating.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same one used at high end salons.</li>
            <li>I live in Houston, Texas/New Orleans, Louisiana</li>
            <li>It was brand new and quite a bit cheaper than purchasing it, with a discount, through the beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>BioSilk 1 inch CHI - NEW Ltd. Edition Hair Iron</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new one anyway,</li>
            <li>I decided to go with this new iron since its what my stylists use at the PR@ Partners salon.    </li>
            <li>I live in humid Florida, and this straightener gets my curly hair</li>
            <li>then after almost 5 weeks I received a new one</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair and wants it straight.</li>
            <li>and now I just blow dry it quickly and use the Chi on my hair in layered sections.  </li>
            <li>this is the only straightener that&#x27;s ever been able to get this awkward, unmanageable cowlick i have in my hair to straighten out, so i love it!</li>
            <li>So if you have a trade secrets near you I would highly reccomend buying your product there.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this new iron, though, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be the same.</li>
            <li>It takes very little time (which saves your hair from more damage).</li>
            <li>I emailed the seller but was told that I had to send mine back in first</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me 4 years and the only reason it did not was</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>In the past 5 years, I&#x27;ve moved several times, throwing this thing in boxes unprotected and throwing stuff on top of it, have mistakenly left it on for more than a day at a time, left it lying out on my bathroom counter</li>
            <li>In the past week it&#x27;s refused to heat up past barely warm, the light won&#x27;t flicker, and resetting it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses almost daily, and the first one lasted a month.  </li>
            <li>This iron does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly, my first one just stopped working and farouk refused to take it back because \\&quot;Amazon in not an authorized dealer so your warranty is void\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>the first one I had broke with a week left on the warranty</li>
            <li>I used to have a basic CHI and it worked pretty well</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased from a salon probably 10 years ago &amp; actually gave it to my niece who is still using it.  </li>
            <li>When this product works it works well, however I have purchased more than five of them in the past two years.</li>
            <li>I would say that this product is well worth the money as long as you get a warrenty to insure your product.</li>
            <li>Asked a model and received a different and more expensive and doesn&#x27;t work now, and charge in my credit card more than I authorize</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is naturally curly and although other straighteners would take out the curl, they did not make the hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I have owned the exact same model for use in the UK for 2 years</li>
            <li>HUGE Kudos to Amazon, and two thumbs down for Farouk.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot fast, never burns me, my hair stays straight all day (I use a little Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide) and my hair feels</li>
            <li>It is a cheap, imitation of the Chi Turbo!</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s used it for the past 4 weeks since I bought it for her and raves every time about how much nicer it is than any of the cheap version hair straighteners</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many other flat irons out there</li>
            <li>For the $100 it is not worth purchasing for only  4 months usage...my advise find something of better value.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding a product that has been able to smooth my cuticle down as well as this item.</li>
            <li>I already have a Hot Tools flat iron, but my hairdresser uses this one and loves it.</li>
            <li>and this is the first flat Iron I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and live in a humid area and my hair stays straight until the next time I wash it.</li>
            <li>This one does not pull on my hair as much, but it does nto get as hot as the other one.</li>
            <li>I have a Chi Turbo flat iron that I bought full price several years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even dropped this thing on the hard tile floor of my bathroom 2 months after I bought it, which chipped the top piece of plastic on it.</li>
            <li>I really like my new Chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li>By the second and third time, it wasn&#x27;t as hot, even though the setting is at high.</li>
            <li>it clearly states that.  </li>
            <li>Just completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and in the summer with the Georgia humidity, my hair will frizz.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on the cheap ones....</li>
            <li>I will never waste my money on another one.</li>
            <li>After 2 uses I have put in my return request to amazon and will be ordering my old straightener again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely buying another one, and can&#x27;t wait to have a Chi back in my bathroom!</li>
            <li>It really sounds like a scam to me, and as such, I will probably NEVER buy another Farouk product ever.  </li>
            <li>It kept my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>When I contacted Farouk they were MOST rude, refusing any warranty service.</li>
            <li>She said it is the only product that has made her hair straight and shinny.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>ions\\&quot; and \\&quot;far infrared technology\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This flatiron works wonders on my naturally wavy/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t only make it straight -- you can bend and curve with it.  </li>
            <li>My old chi lasted 6 years....</li>
            <li>I have had mine for over a year now and still use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky and soft and not at all dry-looking.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have wild, and wavy hair, then this product is a must.</li>
            <li>It will take another year for me to see if it will outlast the Helen of Troy iron I had (which chipped after two years), but it is doing well so far.  </li>
            <li>i bought this item in early april.</li>
            <li>I have curls in the back and straight hair in the front.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but have found that it works really well.</li>
            <li>I could not understand him and it seemed he was calling from far away.</li>
            <li>No trouble and issue so far.</li>
            <li>I am than going to TRADE SECRETS which offers a LIFETIME warrenty on their CHI products.</li>
            <li>The CHI gets a lot hotter than my old iron.</li>
            <li>She loves how the CHI smooths her hair and it stays soft until she washes it again.</li>
            <li>So I finally bought one on Amazon at a much cheaper price then the Beauty Stores.</li>
            <li>No problems, so far.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh on hair.</li>
            <li>and when I went to use my CHI turbo this morning it&#x27;s barely even heated up enough to be hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>At the beginning she thought it was expensive, but over time she has realized it has a good record of reliability</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t like the price so held off on buying a professional flat iron and went for a cheapie one bought for $40 at a drugstore.</li>
            <li>The max is 360 degrees which works fine on normal days but could use a little extra boost when the humidity is up.  </li>
            <li>it did not fry it or make it frizzy, and the small size made it easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I gave it an average rating because it just quick working after 4 months and found out too like others</li>
            <li>I bought this product like 7 years ago, and since then it has been working with no problem, I have used some other flat irons and nothing compare with this, I even have used it in Europe ( with a converter ) and worked fine.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron has served me very well.</li>
            <li>Using in conjunction with a shine spray (spray hair then flat iron) makes my hair very sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment, doesn&#x27;t grab and pull my hair like other cheaper irons.</li>
            <li>the Chi - I was so excited, plugged it in and no light, tried again, checked all the buttons and nothing.</li>
            <li>This turbo model does NOT get hot enough and in fact we believed it to be defective so sent it back to Amazon, the iron temp never got anywhere near the advertised level.  </li>
            <li>WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li>and this gets hot enough to straighten it with only one or two times through.</li>
            <li>It did get hot enough to straighten my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The main reason I have given a low rating is because I paid for shipping both ways which should have been reimbursed as well since the product never worked.</li>
            <li>my daughter is 13 and she has thick full hair that wants to curl.</li>
            <li>It gets right down to the scalp and does an amazing job without making hair dull and flat.  </li>
            <li>so I can lower it for the more delicate areas and higher for the other areas.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and with this flat iron I end up with smooth silky straight hair!</li>
            <li>My Chi has gone through some beatings, too- left on over night, used almost every day in high school and college, dropped, traveled across the world..</li>
            <li>My previous straightener had huge plates, and these were only 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It also saves me money in the long run because I don&#x27;t have to get a relaxer as much.  </li>
            <li>I realize they don&#x27;t last forever, but for that kind of money, I expect several years of use, and according to reviews, this appears to be a common problem.</li>
            <li>Both my daughters &amp; I have one of these, one daughter has blond hair &amp; a little wavy, the other&#x27;s is dark, thick &amp; wavy and mine is somewhat gray very wavy and this flat iron does a great job we can all have stick straight hair if we want in no time at all, heats up quick and is just as quick in straightening, anyone with any type of hair would benefit..and when I ordered the flat iron I received it in a few days...</li>
            <li>Since she saw small kiosks at the local shopping malls where people actually sampled their straighteners and saw how some made her hair silky smooth as well as straight, we&#x27;re going to the mall to buy one of those straighteners.</li>
            <li>I am buying my second one now because I gave my daughter mine, and I can&#x27;t live without one.  </li>
            <li>When it finally quit on me, I decided to buy this new and improved iron.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend Chi flat iron to everybody.</li>
            <li>I have had my eye on a CHI flat iron for a while, but the cost at the salons was too high.</li>
            <li>I bought the Chi turbo flat iron from a local salon after reading all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>I can let my hair air dry then run the straightener over it for perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li>+ minutes trying to blow dry my hair straight,</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and this heats up real fast and gives me straight, shiny hair in no time.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is the way she wants it in about half the time it took her with the classic chi.</li>
            <li>As I was using it I would sometimes hit the heat button and turn it down since the location of the button was right where my hand hits.</li>
            <li>Brand new and apparently well-made, it heated up almost instantly, but the benefits ended there.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s has extremely curly hair, and this iron lets her have straight soft hair.</li>
            <li>that just took me so long to get enough heat to give me a sleek, straight finish.  </li>
            <li>I received this straightener after my old one broke after lasting me 3.5 years.</li>
            <li>Like the professional dryer I bought recently, I wish I would have bought this sooner.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer will only repair or replace it if it is sold through a professional salon.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a solid product as far as I have experienced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is now about 8 months old and gets used REGULARLY!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bummed I spent so much on this one</li>
            <li>I bought this iron because my ten year old chi died, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or look of my old chi turbo the velcro already came off</li>
            <li>Purchased the turbo model for my daughter as her original CHI quit working due to electrical problems (which seem to be pretty common).  </li>
            <li>got the straightener from ULTA, apparently an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li>You will not regret this purchase especially if you live in constant humidity like I do!.  </li>
            <li>although this product claimed to be new, when it arrived, it was clearly not.  </li>
            <li>This thing is EXPENSIVE but well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>It heats up quite a bit significantly less than it did at first.     </li>
            <li>This was a very precise, very well-informed styling effort I was making, and still the results were profoundly disappointing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all types of hair but especially people with short hair, such as myself.</li>
            <li>It does cause a small amount of hair breakage but this chi does a far better job than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used during my lifetime.</li>
            <li>This was the second time I had purchased this particular flat iron, as I chose to buy this as a birthday present for my daughter also.  </li>
            <li>Pissed me off that I spent so much on a straightener that didn&#x27;t even last a year!</li>
            <li>I tried taking it apart to fix it, since the warranty expired by the time it broke, and everything internally seemed completely fine, though I did notice some very audible rattling inside the GFI adapter, and I&#x27;m assuming that the poor build quality of it ultimately led to the flat iron not turning on.</li>
            <li>, I wish the temp went a little higher.  </li>
            <li>Let us see how long the new one is going to last.</li>
            <li>I have heard great things about CHI and was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li>It used to take at least 40 with my cheap flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have bought other curling irons and they last much longer</li>
            <li>Now, its pretty much dead.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick, very course, and very very curly.</li>
            <li>This new Chi iron I purchased is different from my old one due to the fact that you can control the temperature and the red velvet like fabric around</li>
            <li>I use it on the highest setting because I have very thick hair, and it heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even easy for me to use it on the back of my head, which is usually very hard.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li>When my flat iron broke and my friend lend me her CHI, I could not go back to my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li>and it looked like I never flat ironed it to begin with also</li>
            <li>The only reason why I rated it 4 stars is that if I don&#x27;t dry my hair completely and try to straighten them, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth on my hair and calms all the little crazy hairs that never seem to be calm.  </li>
            <li>Unlike others, you have to wait a few minutes for the flat iron to get hot enough.</li>
            <li>When new, this item worked extremely well.</li>
            <li>When ironing I divided my hair into small sections (a maddening process in itself - adding another 20 minutes onto the eternity it already takes to dry my hair) and slid the iron through each section to a quick count of 3 seconds as instructed by my hairstylist.</li>
            <li>However, the woman I spoke with at Amazon (who was unaware of Farouk&#x27;s policy) was extremely helpful and shipped me a new product out immediately (and I received it in 3 days).</li>
            <li>It was brand new and packaged very careful.  </li>

            <li> and I consider it one of my best investments.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is the best!</li>
            <li> The Chi is supposed to be the best hair straightener out there.  </li>
            <li> Here the price was excellent.  </li>
            <li> So, although the product itself is wonderful when it works, I would caution everyone against doing business with this company.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome straightening iron!!  </li>
            <li> Have had this straightening iron for 5 years and is still the best product I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> So glad I listened to my hairdresser!!!  </li>
            <li> I love the product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for hair.</li>
            <li> It works great and is the best hair straightener my daughter has ever had.</li>
            <li> Their hair is helthy and brilliant after years of use.</li>
            <li> and I have an incredible problem with frizz</li>
            <li> I loved this product!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is awesome about replacing it if malfunction occurs within 30 days but GOOD LUCK in getting Farouk to fix or replace it.</li>
            <li> If you want to straighten your hair, this iron will work splendidly.  </li>
            <li> My replacement works great though.</li>
            <li> The adjustable temperature is great too.  </li>
            <li> Great product...</li>
            <li> The product worked great for about 5 months then the on/off switch went haywire and it quit working.</li>
            <li> Great price when compared to stores like Ulta, Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mines for almost 2 years now and its great.</li>
            <li> It seemed like just another great product from Chi.    </li>
            <li> and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Everything was great.  </li>
            <li> they replaced it so my granddaughter was happy.</li>
            <li> it works great, doesn&#x27;t damage her hair, and heats up immediately.  </li>
            <li> She uses it every day and seems happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The straightener was great</li>
            <li> I think this product is great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> and I get great results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for almost two years now, and even though I don&#x27;t use it often, it works great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> the Chi tames it and compacts it which has been great during this growing out phase.  </li>
            <li> It was great...</li>
            <li> Had it forever now, and still works great.  </li>
            <li> Great tool if you know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> When I received this straightener, I used it one day and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> Price is great, product is great.  </li>
            <li> The product is great, and I recieved it i great condition.  </li>
            <li> I got a great deal on this iron but had my doubts that it was the iron for me.</li>
            <li> I have used the 2\\&quot; for over 3 years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> and it worked great until this morning, 12/26/08.  </li>
            <li> This one is a bit hotter, the contoured handle makes it easier to maneuver &amp; the swivel cord is great.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is great</li>
            <li> well mine was great</li>
            <li> This straightener, while pricey makes my hair feel silky and straightens great.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for 1 month</li>
            <li> I should note that we do use a salon cord protector but still experienced problems.  </li>
            <li> I am greatly please with my Chi Turbo product.</li>
            <li> (So, be sure not to forget to turn it off!!)  </li>
            <li> I love my Chi!!</li>
            <li> very nice product.</li>
            <li> THis straightener is amazing!  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing this product is!</li>
            <li> it was OK, but this one is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product and thought it was the excellent kind in the market.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sure made my wife a happy woman, and that&#x27;s ALWAYS a good thing!</li>
            <li> Also the shipping was excellent: very fast (3 days!!)</li>
            <li> I went to a beauty store and asked about a good hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> I rather get a good one from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I had what I thought was a good flattening iron..</li>
            <li> The shine is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.     </li>
            <li> It always worked really good...</li>
            <li> The eventual outcome is good though.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this Chi.  </li>
            <li> any day i use it is a good hair day.  </li>
            <li> However the good news is that Amazon will replace the product.      </li>
            <li> I thought I loved my Wigo which was about $80 at Ulta, but after my stylist used the Chi -</li>
            <li> I decided to suck it up and buy it because my hair came out so good</li>
            <li> They must have been throwing it around or not taking good care of it.</li>
            <li> Now i am stuck with this $100 hair iron that is good for nothing.  </li>
            <li> The best straightener I ever bought, very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> It works great, I love the adjustable temp control.</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this straightener, it was definately worth the price...</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I bought this product at Amazon, as well.  </li>
            <li> I can now do my own hair just as good as the beauty salon.  </li>
            <li> and it straightened it better than anything I have ever tried before!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> which I know I love and just happens to be cheaper than the CHI straightener!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love my CHI!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, works very well, good looking and a great value for money.</li>
            <li> then I think you&#x27;re going to love this product!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> i do love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!</li>
            <li> i love my chi!</li>
            <li> and I still love it now!  </li>
            <li> I love this straightener!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems as yet and am enjoying my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> I love my CHI!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the CHI!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> She was absolutely correct - it&#x27;s a wonderful gadget and my hair has never looked better in my life!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little hair straightener, and it&#x27;s at an excellent price!</li>
            <li> what an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The chi is an amazing straightener.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The Chi straightener is AMAZING, it straightens it with the type of heat my hair needs but doesn&#x27;t burn it at all.  </li>
            <li> You can also adjust the temperature which is nice.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I plugged it in and gave it time to warm up.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes it was warm, but I could put my fingers on the iron and close it on them.</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair immediately and is one of kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking time to learn to use it and get the kind of results I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice.    </li>
            <li> and it stayed so nice for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Heard many good things about the Chi and decided to   order online after my niece suggested she bought her Chi online.  </li>
            <li> It helps a lot for a perfect straight hair finish.</li>
            <li> it is easy and quick to use and makes any hair perfect!</li>
            <li> It is worth every dollar!!!</li>
            <li> This also was the best price on this particular straightner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at the hair straightening thing, and this iron works great on my naturaly curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I got a new Solia iron and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> its easy to use and the results are good...</li>
            <li> She was happy with the classic chi, but she&#x27;s even more happy with the turbo chi.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it!  :-)</li>
            <li> (Just be sure that you turn it off! :) )</li>
            <li> As far as I know, it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> The Farouk CHI GF 1583 is the perfect counter to combat the Wild Woman from Boreno look.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that it took me five minutes to completely straighten my hair and it looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> ITS MY FAVORITE THING I OWN (BESIDES MY COACH)</li>
            <li> but it does make it smooth, which is a good thing for my course hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is definately worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The velvet on the top is nice for when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to burn my fingers.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> My friends have ceramic ones that work just as well, or better, but my hair stylist used this on me, and I can honestly say that this is my favorite hair straightner.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use, with great results.</li>
            <li> It straightens her hair quickly and makes it look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Product was new, in original packaging and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> So basically, it has done what it is supposed to do and more well and has lasted for us.</li>
            <li> The CHI is an ok straightener.</li>
            <li> This one is even better since it is adjustable for heat settings.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this item was because of its popularity, many of my friends had a CHI.</li>
            <li> I even used the CHI protecter spray, and it still damaged my hair and caused many split ends.</li>
            <li> I am able to straighten with ease.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> She likes this so much better than off-the-shelf Walmart brands.  </li>
            <li> In fact I love it and couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without it.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it many times on my children&#x27;s hair at differing heat levels.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, the model I received 3 years ago was of better quality.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this straightener.  </li>
            <li> It has velvet on the bottom and top shoudl you decide to use this to curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> so it is better for my hair.</li>
            <li> So, even though you buy it through Amazon, a respectable place to buy things, you won&#x27;t get any support for it after 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I have been using straightening irons for many years.  </li>
            <li> and for free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT CONVINCED THE TURBO IS ANY BETTER FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the Solia will prove more durable.</li>
            <li> I had never been able to get my hair to do that.  </li>
            <li> I felt even better about buying it after our stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say great because I never felt that it really did wonders for my hair like a lot of people hair.</li>
            <li> Saves many hours in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my hair, even my beautician has said she can notice the difference in the maintenance of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the same model of Chi flatiron about 4 years ago and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> She has been pleased with product and no problems noted.</li>
            <li> I see that the price has gone up, but I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you know that the warranty for this product is VOID is purchased online.     </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product.  </li>
            <li> At a retail store it cost about $30 more.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good straightener, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It might be best to spend the extra money and get it at a salon...</li>
            <li> Plus I love the felt lining on the top and bottom, it helps to keep from burning your fingers.  </li>
            <li> chi has lasted longer,worked better, and my hair is healthier than before.</li>
            <li> It is quite simply the best out there, and recommended and used by most hair stylists when you visit the salon.  </li>
            <li> I love my straightener.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like most straighteners do.</li>
            <li> was about $40 more than I paid for mine.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this one thinking it would be better because it has temperature controls.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you purchase one from an authorized Beauty Supply Store.  </li>
            <li> My favorite aspect of it is the adjustable temp controls.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good quality straightener, this is definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> Be sure that whatever you buy it is not made by Farouk ...</li>
            <li> I did however LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> (Ceramic is better heat source and it doesn&#x27;t snag and tear my hair like the cheaper ones</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The packaging itself was horrible--the boxed iron had no support in the Amazon shipping box; it had plenty of room to be banged around during the shipping process (perhaps contributing to the cause of it not being able to get</li>
            <li> And fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> If you decide to, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> this one seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> I prefered the Turbo for the Velvet part and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you spray your hair with a protectant before you start.</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> now I dont use it more then 2-3 a month</li>
            <li> I was told by so many friends that this was the best flat iron but still was not convinced.  </li>
            <li> this iron doesnt style very well, but it makes ur hair very nice and sraight.</li>
            <li> Chi definitely is 10 times better than the rest!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this iron, don&#x27;t hesitate buy it now!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product after I had read some of the reviews...</li>
            <li> This flat iron was not my best experience.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect size flat iron for any length hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 6 months and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best ever.</li>
            <li> THE most wonderful flat iron!!!   </li>
            <li> Just as good and much lighter in weight!</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and it still looks and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My sisters purchased one first, I used it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> So, after shower, I blow dry my hair and then I straighten them for the best result with this product and as long as it doesn&#x27;t rain, my hair looks perfect!</li>
            <li> well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of straightening curly hair and an even better job of smoothing straight hair.</li>
            <li> She can go thru the whole day with straight hair.it works GREAT!!  </li>
            <li> After asking several people what kind of straight iron works the best, I purchased the CHI &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item more than 7 years and been worked fine.</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser said it is the best Flat Iron available.  </li>
            <li> I reordered the original CHI for her, I just hope it lasts longer than the first one, when you spend this kind of money for an iron, it would be nice to feel you got what you paid for.  </li>
            <li> but i would recomment to try a different chi, as the chi irons are usually very good products.</li>
            <li> , Farouk Chi won&#x27;t warranty it \\&quot;if not purchased from a professional salon.\\&quot; Bummers, its a great product</li>
            <li> it came even quicker than i expected and was a great transaction!</li>
            <li> I was thinking to buy a newer model more advanced, but I thought why?  </li>
            <li> I had the old Chi iron for about 5 years and it was great.</li>
            <li> An authentic Chi is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> The best 100 dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been brilliant, and I recently bought this US one to use while I&#x27;m visiting my family in the States.  </li>
            <li> It straightened hair fairly well and didn&#x27;t seem very damaging at all.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; straightens my hair very easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth; I can flip it this way, flip it that way and make it as straight as a stick!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the original CHI but this product is better because you have the option of changing the temperature.</li>
            <li> I also heard that the chi turbo works better than the original chi.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands but this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> Other than that everything was great!</li>
            <li> It is easy to style the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> and it is also lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> therefore, it was easy to see what was inside.  </li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she gets home from school before anyone else and could have easily seen what her gift was going to be.  </li>
            <li> The item doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> This product is sleek and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> probably one of the best and most heavy duty straighteners that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Easy to control, mistake proof(other</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas in 2007 and it&#x27;s still going strong in 2014.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1&amp;#34;CHI Turbo Microchip Ceramic Hairstyling Iron over 8 years ago to help manage my daughter&#x27;s unruly hair and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I loved the high quality hair straighteners used in salons.  </li>
            <li> My whole family has used this product for years and we are all very pleased.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still amazingly still going and still just as hot the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Chi make hair products like silk infusion that smell great and enhance the finish and they protect your hair even more when used with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> great, i could never do my own hair with other irons.</li>
            <li> It is a full ceramic,(not a coated ceramic, like many I have tried before), and has protected my hair.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best price in town is here on Amazon for it too!</li>
            <li> I bought mine literally 5 years ago, and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li> My ceramic one from Walmart has been working just fine for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> She has shoulder-length, fine, but frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> and while you should always use a heat protector -- it does not seem to be damaging my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally fine curly hair</li>
            <li> It does the trick quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li> I love that the temperature is adjustable since my hair is very fine in addition to being a combination of very wavy and curly.</li>
            <li> and I love it for my own very naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> it does leave your hair with a smooth and sleak look afterwards.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t smooth like this one.</li>
            <li> I will never have another cheap iron.</li>
            <li> My hair lasted frizz free until I washed it again.  </li>
            <li> Overall This is a great product.</li>
            <li> The cheap one damaged my hair and made it look frizzier</li>
            <li> There is so much for control with this iron, and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser always used this hair iron to straighten my hair and it always came out fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the 2\\&quot; with is great for a larger area.</li>
            <li> The powere light kept flickering and it didn&#x27;t get up to the highest temp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several weeks since I got my CHI and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> for superfine hair, I recommend the 0.7\\&quot; (mistakenly advertised as 0.07\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comfortable and light.</li>
            <li> From cheap to not so cheap.  </li>
            <li> The 1\\&quot; iron allows you to get a smooth finish from the roots to the ends of hair and also to flip the ends if you wish.</li>
            <li> It does not pull her hair and leaves her hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I can get away with washing it two - three times a week</li>
            <li> cheap when you pick it up.  </li>
            <li> but it actually works great.</li>
            <li> It really works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it glides on my hair leaving it silky, shiny and straight protecting it against the moisture and humidity.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product, I have very coarse frizzy hair and in about 15 minutes it transforms it into silky straight strands.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of things trying to straighten my hair but this iron is far superior.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular CHI and I loved it, but now with the turbo is much better, I have tons of hair and it straights it immediately</li>
            <li> It gives smooth impressive results especially if you have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling good like my old iron did,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many ceramic flat irons before and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> It did end up costing more, but it worked right out of the box and it is covered for a year.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great</li>
            <li> This really is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for five years already and it still works great.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy and saves time....</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Straightens quickly and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This one heats up easily, and slides through my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Heated up very quickly and very hot and steamy.</li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Upon using it the first time, the felt on top of the heat paddles started pulling up and getting my hair stuck in it.</li>
            <li> i havnt used this chi for a long time, but i dont think its as great as it sounds.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser recommended chi flat straightening iron for my curly hair and so far i am very happy about the results since i have a very unruly curly hair this product work wonders for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> First off, both my wife and daughter LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> , I hope this was useful!</li>
            <li> I would buy the original vs. this one.</li>
            <li> Instead of risking it for this product, I am returning it and purchasing the original in a salon.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> I just used the Chi for the first time and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Id stick to the original chi for flattening hair.</li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t want to wait another 5+ weeks for the originally I bought</li>
            <li> the first was a 2\\&quot;, but 1\\&quot; is better for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised and have been very pleased with the results of this straightener.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate and trust the products I purchase from Amazon, for I am never disappointed and always receive the items in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the money!</li>
            <li> this is DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
            <li> It was great to receive the flat iron that I wanted for my daughter so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic iron, heats up quickly, has a swivel cord, variable temperature control.  </li>
            <li> The price was good and the shipping was free, but I sent the product back after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Excellent - heats up very quickly - one swipe and my hair is straight - takes less than 10 minutes to do my enire head</li>
            <li> A good friend had one and used it on my hair - it makes it soo straight so fast -</li>
            <li> It works so perfect and straightens my hair in half of the time as my Hot Tools Iron did.</li>
            <li> Although the Chi is supposed to be the best in hair straighteners, I have had difficulty using it and am returning to my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft, and it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money and with free delivery with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> It has to be handled with care and properly stored in order to keep in good condition.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, and it will become an indispensable part of your hair routine.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick hair and this straightener works great!</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks, the velvet started peeling and it did not seem to be heating to full temperature.  </li>
            <li> Love the product heats fast and works well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for a family member and they loved it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was good enough to replace mine.</li>
            <li> It definitely works really good</li>
            <li> The quick heat is wonderful for those late for work mornings.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to straight my hair, I just need to go over once or twice, my hair is already very straight.</li>
            <li> (Color : BLACK)]]I have tried cheaper flat irons, and boy what a difference a good one like the Chi is.  </li>
            <li> Face it, we&#x27;ll never make our hair look as good as it does at the salon when someone else is doing it, but with the Chi flat iron, I think I&#x27;m as close as I&#x27;ll get.  </li>
            <li> I dropped my chi flat iron about a gazillion times and its still working as good as day one.  </li>
            <li> so i need a good flat iron!  </li>
            <li> It is a really good flat iron!</li>
            <li> It works so quickly on my hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily I am in the return window for folica.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this product for my mom because she, too, has fallen in love with the magic of the CHI.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and in time for the holidays even though I ordered it close to Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my very first chi flat iron and loved it.</li>
            <li> and this straightens it quickly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better results.</li>
            <li> Luckily, Amazon replaced my straighter at no charge</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make me love it even more is if it had an auto-shut-off.  </li>
            <li> it heats up quickly also.  </li>
            <li> especially good for the hair types of african American&#x27;s</li>
            <li> At first I was super excited and than I talked to a hairstylist who told me that the CHI turbo has 2x the amount of problems as the origianl often not heating up even close to the ORIGINAL CHI.</li>
            <li> So luckily I still have my receipt</li>
            <li> and i can straighten really quickly.</li>
            <li> i do wish it had an auto-off after a certain amount of time, or that the power light were more visible to a right-hand user, but really, that&#x27;s nitpicking.</li>
            <li> But I never could find one that got very hot.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this iron just under a year ago and it worked beautifully up till just a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> So in sum, it&#x27;s effective, easy to use, great on the hair, and it&#x27;s apparently quite durable even after a HARD fall.</li>
            <li> I love my new CHI that I bought this evening and definately will not say, \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy a CHI at all.\\</li>
            <li> I love my new Chi.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for a year and a half, and it is a great investment for me.</li>
            <li> it heats up fast and the padded sides make it easy to curl the ends.</li>
            <li> It is easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, heats up fast, and lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and it really durable.</li>
            <li> It takes my wavy hair and very quickly makes it straight.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> and it comes out so much nicer!!</li>
            <li> About a week later I turned it on just to see if I could get it working again, and low and behold, it turned on and works just as perfectly as it did the first day</li>
            <li> parts\\&quot; look like they were glued on and the product did not get hot at all, ended up wasting money on this!</li>
            <li> I purchased two 5 years ago still greats as the first day!</li>
            <li> (I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage).  </li>
            <li> Website is very user friendly and customer service is convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> It straigtens my hair in minutes without drying it out or making it brittle and my hair is smooth, silky, and stays straight no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li> I always used to wonder how my hair stylist could get my hair so silky, straight, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out so smooth and bone straight.  </li>
            <li> I really like that its light and more compact than my old one.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair smooth, bone straight, shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and silky, however, at the same time damages it greatly, like all straighteners.</li>
            <li> It will only get warm now and even after leaving it on for 1 hour</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This professional unit does the job better</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> As a straightner its is really good, but if you want to do fancy flips or shapes then be aware of how long it is on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is definently worth the $$$ to buy a CHI.  </li>
            <li> but, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so sleek and so glossy, everyone always asks me if I&#x27;ve had it done, even though it was only 45 minutes of my own time</li>
            <li> The CHI is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I love to straighten in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I preferred my cheaper old one that could flip my hair better and was ionizing .</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I liked the fact that it has the felt on the outside</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for that smile.</li>
            <li> All my friends said it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I owned a chi before this one for about 4 years and dropped it one too many times and the plate came completely off.  </li>
            <li> Then my friend got one, and finally I have my own.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I actually had a vastly better experience with the original Chi than this one.</li>
            <li> Love it and glad recomend other to buy it too.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly and doesnt give my hair that burnt smell..</li>
            <li> It gets super hot but you can adjust the temp control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a product I would highly suggest however would NOT spend the extra money just because it says it&#x27;s a turbo, they did something right when they created the origianl something they have yet been able to top.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think my Chi has finally kicked the bucket, but with all the abuse I put it through, I&#x27;m amazed and impressed it&#x27;s lasted this long and worked so well the whole time.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve struggled with finding the right tool for dealing with curly or wavy hair</li>
            <li> Trying to resolve with Amazon right now.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, straightens hair well and still performs as well as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> It does not heat up as high as my original one and is very tinny and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does straighten hair, but again, I and my daughter did not find that it straightened hair better and did not find it worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> and while it is still working fine, wanted a new one on hand in case it dies one of these days.)  </li>
            <li> This makes my normally frizzy hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I could barely touch it and it made my hair have static.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable temperature is great no more split ends.</li>
            <li> This keeps it nice all day long.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, but my friends hair is very curly, and we both are able to achieve silky straight hair with this iron, thanks to the temperature control.  </li>
            <li> But this has not been an issue because the adjustment slider is set to what heat worked for my hair and it is obviously very easy to know that if I slide it to the left is lower temp and to the right is higher temp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got many positive points: It gets hot fast for people in a hurry (like me); It hasn&#x27;t heat damaged my hair at all; It&#x27;s easy to get the back of my head with the cord.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the chi, they are sooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd of these that we have bought (1st for my wife, 2nd for her sister) and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I am a proud convert to the cult of CHI, and I can never go back to regular straightening irons.</li>
            <li> My hair is now extremely straight, and I just use it for quick touch-ups in the morning between washings.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought one (and was able to rationalize the cost) but it is so worth the money-</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and my hair looks so silky.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and evenly and gets my hair as straight as my stylist does.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast as well.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much...</li>
            <li> I got a replacement and so far it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and straightens my thick curly hair with one pass to a nice smooth, silky texture.</li>
            <li> the tool straightens in one swipe (my hair is hard to straighten) and it also works great to curl the ends.</li>
            <li> and I first used hers.</li>
            <li> Now that I have my second Chi, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I had a WIGO straightener that cost more, but couldn&#x27;t straighten enough.  </li>
            <li> So it works well for people that have really curly/wavy hair (which I do!)</li>
            <li> I unplugged it and after closer inspection, found that it was melting itself where the ceramic hot plat section touched the plastic.</li>
            <li> This straightener is first class.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Chi Turbo after the straightener I had broke.</li>
            <li> If you hold it a certain way it will heat up but its just not styling right.</li>
            <li> First they wanted to keep 30% of what I paid to restock the defective product.</li>
            <li> Please be aware.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tool for over three years, and it works just as well as it did when I first took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted.  </li>
            <li> However, you must first contact them for an RA#.</li>
            <li> I thought I woud try the smaller size iron to see if it offered more flexibility in styling.  </li>
            <li> For an iron that gets so hot, I would think this would be a required feature.    </li>
            <li> size matters - smaller size is better -</li>
            <li> yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year since we purchased this iron, and my wife is quite satisfied with this present.  </li>
            <li> Much better than store brands, it only needs to go through my hair once to straighten, so it saves on time it takes to straighten.</li>
            <li> It is made of quality products and much safer on the hair!</li>
            <li> Curls turn out funny.  </li>
            <li> and they said to send the product back in with $15 for processing (on top of the shipping I had to pay to send it in),</li>
            <li> I also use the \\&quot;silk infusion\\&quot; in the summer, to help keep my hair under control in the hot and humid weather (and it works).I bought the \\&quot;silk infusion\\&quot; at an Ulta store, and you can also order it online</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it was made of cheap material, and so far it has not damaged my hair.  </li>
            <li> it works pretty well on both hair types.</li>
            <li> every one of these 1 star reviews have been my exact experience.  </li>
            <li> I should have read them first ..</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I found that the chi turbo is great for women with thick and/or a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter because I have heard and read so many rave reviews about it.  </li>
            <li> While it works well enough, I don&#x27;t think it works that much better than the $25.00 ones we already owned.</li>
            <li> it made my hair so much healthier, shinier, softer, silkier, everything!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty curly</li>
            <li> After using other brands of hair straighteners (and going through several of them) for 7 years now, the Chi is by far the best hair straightener</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> B000BBF4MW Infrashine Original Professional Ceramic Styling]]</li>
            <li> I love my chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have tried many flat Iron.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it is the most efficient flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> NICE way to treat someone who spent $120 on your product!</li>
            <li> I have an authentic Chi flat iron to compare it to and this one does NOT heat up</li>
            <li> I have had flat irons before, but this one is light weight, does not break my hair, and I have tons of frizz, and after using this iron - my whole texture changes to smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat Iron!</li>
            <li> Her hair is fine &amp; has a slight natural wave with a tendency to get frizzy without tools or product to help, and any straightener she has used in the past has been able to get her hair nice &amp; straight fairly easily, until now--</li>
            <li> It works well, and makes my hair very \\&quot;stick\\&quot; straight!  </li>
            <li> It was a Christmas Present and was shipped very quickly upon ordering.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and its quick to use.</li>
            <li> its so great!ITS EASY AND SIMPLE!</li>
            <li> Great Irons just make sure you uses chi Iron guard spray and chi oil for sheen(liquid oil in bottle pour little in hand an place on each small section of hair you straighten)</li>
            <li> If she doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;hold\\&quot; it a certain way, it will shut off.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Several months after I purchased this iron, it wouldn&#x27;t get hot, only warm.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair super straight and soft.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until it broke two months later</li>
            <li> If your hair is think or short, the 1 inch should work just fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than all of the cheaper irons I have bought in the past, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have found that if I use it too often, as with any heat product, my hair has a tendency to dry out, but I bought a silk infused gel, also made by Chi, which works very well to protect my hair and make it look more like naturally straight hair instead of curly hair that was straightened and looks sizzled on the ends.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty decent the one time I tried it</li>
            <li> This is my first professional flat iron and I love it.</li>
            <li> i have tried it on 4 of my friends, 1 of them with the most damaged hair i&#x27;ve ever seen, and every single one of them has now bought one for themself, no joke!    </li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of flat irons and this one is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> After owning this flat iron for a year and a half, I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener and its worth its weight in gold (when it works), but at $120 dollars you are taking an expensive risk.</li>
            <li> I really like the CHI Turbo Iron Hair Straightener, I would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it every day, maybe three or four times a year to straighten her hair, but she has very curly hair, so when she does use it, it gets a work out.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is fast and it makes your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Much easier than your run of the mill straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Also curls very well.  </li>
            <li> I have very unruly kinky curly hair that resists styling but with this product I can straighten and style my hair just like my hairdresser, who also uses this product and recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for a couple years already and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I wear it straight all the time.</li>
            <li> The product that arrived on my doorstep is nothing compared to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Really fast</li>
            <li> and my hair stays straight even if it rains.</li>
            <li> Just use it fast and shut it off.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> This is too much money to just throw away.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Even in humid weather my hair stays straight the whole day.   </li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s hair has changed, it is almost completely straight when it dries up by itself, before using the Chi.</li>
            <li> Order was filled quickly, prior to Christmas.</li>
            <li> Their products are great while working, but they do not stand behind them once they break.</li>
            <li> so after about a year, the temperature numbers rubbed off and I can&#x27;t really read them at all.  </li>
            <li> It glides through my hair smoothly and after 8 months of using it almost daily (with Chi iron guard)I</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much because of the ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> My hair is like curly frizzy straw, I use this iron and the chi silk infusion and my hair becomes straight and silky without looking greasy..</li>
            <li> The straightness really depends on the amount of hair used in each section.  </li>
            <li> pin straight</li>
            <li> and it stays straight until I wash it.</li>
            <li> so decided to treat myself to the real thing</li>
            <li> It has saved me so much money.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li> My friends all bought theirs at retail stores and paid twice as much.</li>
            <li> and I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Using Chi has minimized the amount of hair breakage and my ends dont feel damaged, my hair stays straight with no frizz throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This straightener also works really fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep going over it to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep the frizz away and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stick straight</li>
            <li> the product really smooths and softens the hair.</li>
            <li> A friend had this very one</li>
            <li> I have wavey hair that &#x27;grows&#x27; with the humidity, so I was not expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks much softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed her hair stays straight for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so straight and KEPT it straight even through all the humidity.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a straightener, so I didn&#x27;t buy one when all my friends were raving about it.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare, but I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The Chi straightened my hair so much that it would just stick straight out</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this product looks real</li>
            <li> Amazon was nice enough to replace it, but now that one has died 8 months later.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a good quality product, seeing as how it cost so much, but it broke after my daughter used it for a month, after which time it was too late to return.  </li>
            <li> This iron works well on my thick curly hair, but what good is it if it doesn&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Chi I have ever had and highly recommend it to any hair straightner user!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this is fast and easy</li>
            <li> super HOT and heats up like instantly.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter liked the flat iron ,but it is too pricey to not last a year.  </li>
            <li> My last iron was a Hai which I loved, but the cord eventually broke due to it not having a swivel head.  </li>
            <li> , this is the best straightener for my long thick hair!</li>
            <li> i have not used many straighteners in my life before, and i have VERY curly hair, but this one made my hair softer and straighter than any other straightener.  </li>
            <li> I had another brand flat iron which was cheap.</li>
            <li> It straigntens my hair better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve used, and heats up faster.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and most the time I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of straightening it</li>
            <li> I had heard about this product and it is even better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair shiny, smooth and smelling like your conditioner rather than flat iron like burnt hair.</li>
            <li> When it finally stopped working, I decided to purchase the same model again since it seemed to be a worthwhile investment the first time.</li>
            <li> I got this today, really excited and nervous at the same time.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and notcied the problems they had, so I made sure to check it before I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard the same problems with the original CHI and by purchasing it in the salon, I will be covered by the warrenty.</li>
            <li> &quot; I would just be willing to pay a little more and get a valad warranty.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; staighteners, and have damaged my hair because of them.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me a bunch of different straighteners- steam, cheap ceramic, etc., but Chi turbo saved my high school years.</li>
            <li> Finally, after threatening them with complaints to the State Attorney General&#x27;s Office and the Better Business Bureau, and a phone call from my lawyer they sent me a replacement....and a letter stating that there was NO warranty for this replacement.    </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money (far more than I&#x27;d ever spent on hair supplies) on a product I&#x27;d never seen, but with a recommendation from my friend, I went ahead and took the risk.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for nearly two years.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but I am not sure that it is all that it is cracked up to be and for the price, some of the cheaper ones work just as well.</li>
            <li> I have the original CHI Flat Iron, which has served me well for years.</li>
            <li> It is a higher grade than my professional stylist uses and in fact this one will save me trups to the salon as I can now do it myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of hesitant about the fact that CHI is going to start distributing via Target... :/</li>
            <li> and I am bringing back to TARGET and getting a full refund.</li>
            <li> I had the original and just recently bought the new one.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the felt is starting to come off but other than that the iron works great.</li>
            <li> (in fact, it was peeling off after one use), the ceramic plates do NOT float (move loosely when you push on them), the power chord is not the advertised 10-feet long (it was 6 feet), and it is light weight and cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is quite curly and you live in a humid area, I would suggest not buying it and going for the curly haired look, because chances are you won&#x27;t find a straightener that will straighten your hair and keep it straight.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really loves her new straightener.</li>
            <li> She says it heats up and is better at temperature control than her previous ones.</li>
            <li> These irons are much better than the ones you might buy in typical stores (Conair, Revlon, etc.).  </li>
            <li> My roommate has had one that I&#x27;ve been using for several months and we haven&#x27;t had a problem with it, but the first one that I was sent broke after the first time I used it-</li>
            <li> The Chi is gentle on your hair and always makes mine look straight and soft.</li>
            <li> HEATS UP QUICKLY, BUT I HAVE ALSO OWNED THE REGULAR CHI.</li>
            <li> I loved the Chi while it lasted - I blow dryed my hair with a round brush (which left it poofy and frizzy) and then used the chi once my hair was dry to get silky smooth hair.  </li>
            <li> The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair</li>
            <li> this is such a great product i recomded it at least once a</li>
            <li> I am glad I went with the more expensive turbo,</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s classic chi blew a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> I had the older version &amp;</li>
            <li> I loved how the product handled but it didn&#x27;t last long for the price you pay (my conair curling iron has last 10</li>
            <li> I plugged it in a converter in Germany on the high button.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product ot any one wanting to straighten her hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended to me by my hairstylist</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It leaves my naturally curly, naturally frizzy hair perfectly straight and totally frizz free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> , but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the CHI Turbo.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how highly I rate it...</li>
            <li> The Chi is an excellent Flat Iron, though expensive.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on spending this much for a flat iron, but it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have convinced several other women to purchase this item because I love it so much!  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for the price, I would get a little more use out of it, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> constantly plugged in, always kept it on the highest heat settings, and have thrown it in my bathroom cupboard haphazardly, never taking particular care to protect it.</li>
            <li> I eceived the Chi Flat Iron quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Chi flat iron heats up quickly, maintains the temp well and does not burn your hair.  </li>
            <li> I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and much straighter than anything else I had tried.</li>
            <li> The Turbi Chi arrived in the expected time, but when I gave it as a Christmas gift we immediately noticed that the light was not in the correct position</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, especially if you have a lot of hair like me!</li>
            <li> and I can say without a doubt that this iron is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I straighten everyday &amp; love this product dearly.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, and it flat irons your hair.</li>
            <li> The results are well worth the extra dollars it costs.  </li>
            <li> I called Amazon back and told them and asked for some help, but they just pretty much told me there was NOTHING they could do.  </li>
            <li> We were able to return the Chi and did receive a refund within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to not have to worry about the house burning down if I accidentally left it unattended.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it falls over easily on the counter.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American and I bought this flat iron because I used a friends and liked the staying power of the curls.  </li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;d pop right back out</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Repeatedly I have experienced them to have electrical problems which is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same one used at high end salons.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston, Texas/New Orleans, Louisiana</li>
            <li> It was brand new and quite a bit cheaper than purchasing it, with a discount, through the beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> BioSilk 1 inch CHI - NEW Ltd. Edition Hair Iron</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new one anyway,</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this new iron since its what my stylists use at the PR@ Partners salon.    </li>
            <li> I live in humid Florida, and this straightener gets my curly hair</li>
            <li> then after almost 5 weeks I received a new one</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair and wants it straight.</li>
            <li> and now I just blow dry it quickly and use the Chi on my hair in layered sections.  </li>
            <li> this is the only straightener that&#x27;s ever been able to get this awkward, unmanageable cowlick i have in my hair to straighten out, so i love it!</li>
            <li> So if you have a trade secrets near you I would highly reccomend buying your product there.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this new iron, though, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be the same.</li>
            <li> It takes very little time (which saves your hair from more damage).</li>
            <li> I emailed the seller but was told that I had to send mine back in first</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me 4 years and the only reason it did not was</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> In the past 5 years, I&#x27;ve moved several times, throwing this thing in boxes unprotected and throwing stuff on top of it, have mistakenly left it on for more than a day at a time, left it lying out on my bathroom counter</li>
            <li> In the past week it&#x27;s refused to heat up past barely warm, the light won&#x27;t flicker, and resetting it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses almost daily, and the first one lasted a month.  </li>
            <li> This iron does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly, my first one just stopped working and farouk refused to take it back because \\&quot;Amazon in not an authorized dealer so your warranty is void\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> the first one I had broke with a week left on the warranty</li>
            <li> I used to have a basic CHI and it worked pretty well</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased from a salon probably 10 years ago &amp; actually gave it to my niece who is still using it.  </li>
            <li> When this product works it works well, however I have purchased more than five of them in the past two years.</li>
            <li> I would say that this product is well worth the money as long as you get a warrenty to insure your product.</li>
            <li> Asked a model and received a different and more expensive and doesn&#x27;t work now, and charge in my credit card more than I authorize</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is naturally curly and although other straighteners would take out the curl, they did not make the hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I have owned the exact same model for use in the UK for 2 years</li>
            <li> HUGE Kudos to Amazon, and two thumbs down for Farouk.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot fast, never burns me, my hair stays straight all day (I use a little Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide) and my hair feels</li>
            <li> It is a cheap, imitation of the Chi Turbo!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s used it for the past 4 weeks since I bought it for her and raves every time about how much nicer it is than any of the cheap version hair straighteners</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many other flat irons out there</li>
            <li> For the $100 it is not worth purchasing for only  4 months usage...my advise find something of better value.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a product that has been able to smooth my cuticle down as well as this item.</li>
            <li> I already have a Hot Tools flat iron, but my hairdresser uses this one and loves it.</li>
            <li> and this is the first flat Iron I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and live in a humid area and my hair stays straight until the next time I wash it.</li>
            <li> This one does not pull on my hair as much, but it does nto get as hot as the other one.</li>
            <li> I have a Chi Turbo flat iron that I bought full price several years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even dropped this thing on the hard tile floor of my bathroom 2 months after I bought it, which chipped the top piece of plastic on it.</li>
            <li> I really like my new Chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li> By the second and third time, it wasn&#x27;t as hot, even though the setting is at high.</li>
            <li> it clearly states that.  </li>
            <li> Just completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and in the summer with the Georgia humidity, my hair will frizz.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the cheap ones....</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money on another one.</li>
            <li> After 2 uses I have put in my return request to amazon and will be ordering my old straightener again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely buying another one, and can&#x27;t wait to have a Chi back in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> It really sounds like a scam to me, and as such, I will probably NEVER buy another Farouk product ever.  </li>
            <li> It kept my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> When I contacted Farouk they were MOST rude, refusing any warranty service.</li>
            <li> She said it is the only product that has made her hair straight and shinny.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> ions\\&quot; and \\&quot;far infrared technology\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This flatiron works wonders on my naturally wavy/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t only make it straight -- you can bend and curve with it.  </li>
            <li> My old chi lasted 6 years....</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over a year now and still use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and soft and not at all dry-looking.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have wild, and wavy hair, then this product is a must.</li>
            <li> It will take another year for me to see if it will outlast the Helen of Troy iron I had (which chipped after two years), but it is doing well so far.  </li>
            <li> i bought this item in early april.</li>
            <li> I have curls in the back and straight hair in the front.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but have found that it works really well.</li>
            <li> I could not understand him and it seemed he was calling from far away.</li>
            <li> No trouble and issue so far.</li>
            <li> I am than going to TRADE SECRETS which offers a LIFETIME warrenty on their CHI products.</li>
            <li> The CHI gets a lot hotter than my old iron.</li>
            <li> She loves how the CHI smooths her hair and it stays soft until she washes it again.</li>
            <li> So I finally bought one on Amazon at a much cheaper price then the Beauty Stores.</li>
            <li> No problems, so far.  </li>
            <li> Not harsh on hair.</li>
            <li> and when I went to use my CHI turbo this morning it&#x27;s barely even heated up enough to be hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> At the beginning she thought it was expensive, but over time she has realized it has a good record of reliability</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t like the price so held off on buying a professional flat iron and went for a cheapie one bought for $40 at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> The max is 360 degrees which works fine on normal days but could use a little extra boost when the humidity is up.  </li>
            <li> it did not fry it or make it frizzy, and the small size made it easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I gave it an average rating because it just quick working after 4 months and found out too like others</li>
            <li> I bought this product like 7 years ago, and since then it has been working with no problem, I have used some other flat irons and nothing compare with this, I even have used it in Europe ( with a converter ) and worked fine.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron has served me very well.</li>
            <li> Using in conjunction with a shine spray (spray hair then flat iron) makes my hair very sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment, doesn&#x27;t grab and pull my hair like other cheaper irons.</li>
            <li> the Chi - I was so excited, plugged it in and no light, tried again, checked all the buttons and nothing.</li>
            <li> This turbo model does NOT get hot enough and in fact we believed it to be defective so sent it back to Amazon, the iron temp never got anywhere near the advertised level.  </li>
            <li> WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li> and this gets hot enough to straighten it with only one or two times through.</li>
            <li> It did get hot enough to straighten my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The main reason I have given a low rating is because I paid for shipping both ways which should have been reimbursed as well since the product never worked.</li>
            <li> my daughter is 13 and she has thick full hair that wants to curl.</li>
            <li> It gets right down to the scalp and does an amazing job without making hair dull and flat.  </li>
            <li> so I can lower it for the more delicate areas and higher for the other areas.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and with this flat iron I end up with smooth silky straight hair!</li>
            <li> My Chi has gone through some beatings, too- left on over night, used almost every day in high school and college, dropped, traveled across the world..</li>
            <li> My previous straightener had huge plates, and these were only 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It also saves me money in the long run because I don&#x27;t have to get a relaxer as much.  </li>
            <li> I realize they don&#x27;t last forever, but for that kind of money, I expect several years of use, and according to reviews, this appears to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters &amp; I have one of these, one daughter has blond hair &amp; a little wavy, the other&#x27;s is dark, thick &amp; wavy and mine is somewhat gray very wavy and this flat iron does a great job we can all have stick straight hair if we want in no time at all, heats up quick and is just as quick in straightening, anyone with any type of hair would benefit..and when I ordered the flat iron I received it in a few days...</li>
            <li> Since she saw small kiosks at the local shopping malls where people actually sampled their straighteners and saw how some made her hair silky smooth as well as straight, we&#x27;re going to the mall to buy one of those straighteners.</li>
            <li> I am buying my second one now because I gave my daughter mine, and I can&#x27;t live without one.  </li>
            <li> When it finally quit on me, I decided to buy this new and improved iron.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend Chi flat iron to everybody.</li>
            <li> I have had my eye on a CHI flat iron for a while, but the cost at the salons was too high.</li>
            <li> I bought the Chi turbo flat iron from a local salon after reading all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> I can let my hair air dry then run the straightener over it for perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li> + minutes trying to blow dry my hair straight,</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this heats up real fast and gives me straight, shiny hair in no time.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is the way she wants it in about half the time it took her with the classic chi.</li>
            <li> As I was using it I would sometimes hit the heat button and turn it down since the location of the button was right where my hand hits.</li>
            <li> Brand new and apparently well-made, it heated up almost instantly, but the benefits ended there.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s has extremely curly hair, and this iron lets her have straight soft hair.</li>
            <li> that just took me so long to get enough heat to give me a sleek, straight finish.  </li>
            <li> I received this straightener after my old one broke after lasting me 3.5 years.</li>
            <li> Like the professional dryer I bought recently, I wish I would have bought this sooner.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer will only repair or replace it if it is sold through a professional salon.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a solid product as far as I have experienced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is now about 8 months old and gets used REGULARLY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed I spent so much on this one</li>
            <li> I bought this iron because my ten year old chi died, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or look of my old chi turbo the velcro already came off</li>
            <li> Purchased the turbo model for my daughter as her original CHI quit working due to electrical problems (which seem to be pretty common).  </li>
            <li> got the straightener from ULTA, apparently an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> You will not regret this purchase especially if you live in constant humidity like I do!.  </li>
            <li> although this product claimed to be new, when it arrived, it was clearly not.  </li>
            <li> This thing is EXPENSIVE but well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> It heats up quite a bit significantly less than it did at first.     </li>
            <li> This was a very precise, very well-informed styling effort I was making, and still the results were profoundly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all types of hair but especially people with short hair, such as myself.</li>
            <li> It does cause a small amount of hair breakage but this chi does a far better job than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used during my lifetime.</li>
            <li> This was the second time I had purchased this particular flat iron, as I chose to buy this as a birthday present for my daughter also.  </li>
            <li> Pissed me off that I spent so much on a straightener that didn&#x27;t even last a year!</li>
            <li> I tried taking it apart to fix it, since the warranty expired by the time it broke, and everything internally seemed completely fine, though I did notice some very audible rattling inside the GFI adapter, and I&#x27;m assuming that the poor build quality of it ultimately led to the flat iron not turning on.</li>
            <li> , I wish the temp went a little higher.  </li>
            <li> Let us see how long the new one is going to last.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about CHI and was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It used to take at least 40 with my cheap flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other curling irons and they last much longer</li>
            <li> Now, its pretty much dead.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, very course, and very very curly.</li>
            <li> This new Chi iron I purchased is different from my old one due to the fact that you can control the temperature and the red velvet like fabric around</li>
            <li> I use it on the highest setting because I have very thick hair, and it heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even easy for me to use it on the back of my head, which is usually very hard.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> When my flat iron broke and my friend lend me her CHI, I could not go back to my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and it looked like I never flat ironed it to begin with also</li>
            <li> The only reason why I rated it 4 stars is that if I don&#x27;t dry my hair completely and try to straighten them, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth on my hair and calms all the little crazy hairs that never seem to be calm.  </li>
            <li> Unlike others, you have to wait a few minutes for the flat iron to get hot enough.</li>
            <li> When new, this item worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> When ironing I divided my hair into small sections (a maddening process in itself - adding another 20 minutes onto the eternity it already takes to dry my hair) and slid the iron through each section to a quick count of 3 seconds as instructed by my hairstylist.</li>
            <li> However, the woman I spoke with at Amazon (who was unaware of Farouk&#x27;s policy) was extremely helpful and shipped me a new product out immediately (and I received it in 3 days).</li>
            <li> It was brand new and packaged very careful.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my thick naturally curly hair, silky straight.</li>
            <li> She tells me this is a definite improvement over her last flat iron.  </li>
            <li> purchased this ceramic flat iron because it advertised it could also curl by wrapping your hair around the outside along the red flet material.  </li>
            <li> Several of my friends had bought Chi flat irons, so I decided to take the plunge last month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ASSUMING if you avoid this, this flat iron will continue to work for several years.</li>
            <li> B0009V1YRS Farouk CHI GF1538 Turbo Regular 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]    </li>
            <li> I purchased the flat iron online and have used it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well over 40 and thought flat irons were for younger women...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous flat irons and they damage your hair</li>
            <li> B0009V1YRS Farouk CHI GF1538 Turbo Regular 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]  </li>
            <li> This is my second CHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I had a low end flat iron that never seemed to get the frizz out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, and my insane, tangled, frizzy, jumbled mass of hair became straight and sleek and lovely in 10 minutes, I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> My hair usually responds to humidity, but when I use this iron, it stays straight until the next washing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t purchase this product when my hairstylist first recommended it.</li>
            <li> So now 11 months later, the thing is broken again and the manufacturer (true to their word) is not going to honor any warranty.      </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it only goes to 350degrees and apparently that is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> Now after writing this review I&#x27;ve noticed many other complaints on here and other sites about it going bad quickly.</li>
            <li> With small sections, you get really straight hair, but it seems to lose a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> My friend has this flat iron</li>
            <li> CHI flat iron always makes my hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> This problem seems to affect a lot of flat irons.    </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to finally buy this???</li>
            <li> I got my flat iron in 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheaper flat iron from another brand</li>
            <li> and it worked just as well, but my hair smelled like it was burning even though that too was a ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> The flat iron that I ordered quit working after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I am selling mine to my sister, who loves the iron and has hair sort of similar to mine but not as prone to frizzing and with no natural wave.</li>
            <li> She uses it every day with the result of hair that does indeed look flat -</li>
            <li> This flat iron does not come close to the temperature printed on the iron itself.</li>
            <li> If the warranty is the only thing holding you back, then there&#x27;s not much anyone can say to change that (just know that in my personal experience I haven&#x27;t had to use my warranty</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace a 2\\&quot; flat iron.   </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to pay an arm and a leg for a flat iron, I expect it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Chi flat iron for over three years now</li>
            <li> It is an expenisve flat iron</li>
            <li> Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> It works well with long hair and short hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Farouk Turbo Ceramic Flat Iron for my granddaughter for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 2-3 weeks ago...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been flat ironing my hair for years</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> And the bottom rest should be flat instead of curved, because it keeps falling over.</li>
            <li> I just called them about my defective flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought the CHI after using a Revlon flat iron for 3-years.</li>
            <li> I have recommended others to get their flat iron from this store too!</li>
            <li> If you use a flat iron -- you need to try this one!</li>
            <li> Used many other brands in the past, and  was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I hope it will last me for a really long time!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of other customers and from my personal experience I am going to try a different one next</li>
            <li> I have owned all types of straighteners, and regardless of the price they all did the same thing....straightened my hair with incredibly high heat (which I thought I needed, because my hair is very curly and very thick!)</li>
            <li> It is money well spent, I now have shiny straight hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Other flat iron made me go over the same hair strain over and over again and still couldn&#x27;t reach the same straightening effect.</li>
            <li> So I finally broke down, spent the money and threw my old one in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews about how they didn&#x27;t like it because of the red felt, but you just don&#x27;t put your fingers on the red</li>
            <li> Must admit that for the price we paid I am little surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad straightener, it just doesn&#x27;t work as incredibly amazingly as everyone made it out to be.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was much smaller than I expected (</li>
            <li> I have long, course, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The cord is so long it tends to get in the way.</li>
            <li> I used it often for a long time.</li>
            <li> It took me about 30 minutes to go through my thick hair and it really worked.  </li>
            <li> Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> However, it got a short in the wire after using it daily for less than 2 months, and Farouk won&#x27;t cover it if bought on the internet...</li>
            <li> They are expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> within two days I recieved another Chi, even without having sent back the other one.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work that well for such a low price</li>
            <li> It has outlasted several other brands my family has used.  </li>
            <li> So I finally broke down and spent the big bucks on the Chi.  </li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I has tamed thick, coarse, wavy hair into soft workable hair that moves.  </li>
            <li> I have used other flat irons and they do not work as well.</li>
            <li> They seems to last about a year (11 months on average for me), and if you bought the thing on-line, well you can forget about any warranty support.  </li>
            <li> The other flat iron also pulled out pieces of my hair.    </li>
            <li> It is a complete waste of money!  </li>
            <li> do I going to loose my money????</li>
            <li> If you have hair like mine you might want to rethink plunking down a big chunk of change on this product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is to add a heat setting dial so that I could turn down the heat for my bangs.</li>
            <li> i hope it lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li> However, as I was using the chi last week, it stopped working half way through straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> I called Amazon&#x27;s customer service and they will only take care of this matter in the first 30 days, so I&#x27;m not impressed with Amazon&#x27;s customer service...</li>
            <li> but it also looks very dry, lifeless and overprocessed.</li>
            <li> It arrived, and to our disappointment, the thing just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to properly work.  </li>
            <li> Always the same result - dry wispy flyaways on the surface of the hair and a dried up \\&quot;burned</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife, and she loves it cuts down the time on getting ready, if you know what i mean guys....</li>
            <li> It looked to be in new condition at the time of failure, wasn&#x27;t dropped or damaged in any way.</li>
            <li> At first I did not want to drop the money, but after learning the hard way (after three awful, cheap, ceramic coated straighteners that chipped off, and dried out my hair), I splurged on a chi, and it was well worth</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse long hair which MUST be flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, very wavy, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve used a cheap 2\\&quot; Vidal Sassoon flat iron and finally broke down and bought this 1\\&quot; Chi (I bought the 1\\&quot; vs the 2\\&quot; based on customer reviews) because the plates on my old one were getting nasty and my hair started to feel brittle after using it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not a real Chi Turbo.</li>
            <li> I actually wish I would have purchased it a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> so I finally spent the $$ and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times, making sure to blowdry as thoroughly as possible to ensure any damp hair wouldn&#x27;t negatively affect the process (this in itself is a time consuming, tedious chore for me).</li>
            <li> It came in sooner then I expected.  </li>
            <li> Also just an FYI, these are not really warranted as they claim.</li>
            <li> and do I want to go to all this trouble again with this same product?  </li>
            <li> It is such a relief to not worry about my hair reacting to weather the way that it used to, and to not have dried out hair</li>
            <li> Previously, I spent 30</li>
            <li> Product was received on expected date of delivery.  </li>
            <li> I am not very please with this item and was sent ridculous return guidelines from the seller so I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> and I have extremely thick hair and before purchasing my Chi I had to get my hair professionally done every two weeks because there was no way I could do it myself.  </li>
            <li> Cut down the time it takes her to flat iron her hair in half from her previous flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It might cost you less in the long run.</li>
            <li> If you have thick or long hair, I would suggest getting the larger model (2 inch).  </li>
            <li> Purchasing this product from Amazon or any other non-salon retailer voids your warranty with Farouk, the manufacturer.      </li>
            <li> For the money I spent on it, it should have lasted me years, not 4 months!</li>
            <li> this iron does NOT leave your hair smelling burnt like other irons that i have tried.</li>
            <li> If they are purchased anywhere other than thru a Salon, if it had broke in the one year period, they would not have repaired it, read your warranty..</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Two other things to keep in mind when choosing a straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I have one that doesn&#x27;t heat like the other....</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> so I just asked for some other products to make up for the price difference</li>
            <li> and I have medium/fine extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> i went to turn it on the other day</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s weird is there is red felt on the outside of it.</li>
            <li> My hair has volume, which with the other straighteners</li>
            <li> I do not straighten my hair everyday, but I usually straighten my bangs and I see FAR LESS damage to my hair than my friends who use metal straighteners.   </li>
            <li> I use it daily, on the highest heat setting possibly because I have very thick and wavy hair to combat in Texas weather.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!!!</li>
            <li> i got this chi after my pink chi broke after less than a year after it was purchased.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried other flat irons in the past &amp; have been discouraged</li>
            <li> I have tried other flat irons in the past and none have compared with the results I get from the Farouk Chi.</li>
            <li> The only slight issue is that the temperature control numbers are written in white on the handle and it is approximately where my thumb rests...</li>
            <li> It can work with a little bit wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the product in February and have used it maybe 4 or 5 times and the other day with half of my hair straightened it died.  </li>
            <li> Currently my hair is a little bit past shoulder length</li>
            <li> If you like products that cost 4 times what other similar products cost, that break after less than a year of use, that have non-existent warranties, and are supported by Customer Service personnel who are rude and condescending</li>
            <li> The CHI Turbo is one of the less expensive professional grade flat irons.  </li>
            <li> It does not damage it as the other common flat irons.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not have an automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> WIth the amount that I spent on this product my beautician could&#x27;ve blown dried my hair all 4 times.  </li>
            <li> But then suddenly it started to slowly flicker on and off, then eventually, it just stopped turning on.</li>
            <li> However, if you have thick curly hair this product only works at the highest setting</li>
            <li> It has a heavy duty cord that swivels - it still tangles a bit, but not much.   </li>
            <li> so I took a risk and plunked down over $100 for the Chi (2\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> so im stuck wearing it down</li>
            <li> u gotta know the humidity down here to know what i am speaking of.</li>
            <li> I usually blow dry my hair and then use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Time doing hair went from 20 minutes down to less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am NOT saying that its quality is bad, or that it is a bad product; I am simply saying that I had difficulty using it successfully and have decided it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> There were no problems, and I didnt have to go over my hair a few times, as with other irons I have tried.</li>
            <li> When I tried it on my thick, bushy, dry, coarse, frizzy, wavy, highlighted and miserably uncooperative hair, not only did it not straighten it but left it with large, S-shaped kinks in some spots.     </li>
            <li> It takes me less time to straighten my hair with the chi</li>
            <li> then my previous hair straightener.</li>
            <li> We used Amazon&#x27;s return and had it replaced in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it gets the job done in less them 15 mins..</li>
            <li> Purchased this product, in less than 1 year it quit.</li>
            <li> It has held up for 2 and a half years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a 1\\&quot; Chi Turbo for my daughter less than one year ago - still under warranty.</li>
            <li> I previously had the 2\\&quot; Farouk model and switched to this one.  </li>
            <li> I had a Wigo straightener that worked just as well, and it was half the price.</li>
            <li> Also easier to make to curl under slightly if desired.  </li>
            <li> This is my previous review, while it was still usable:    </li>
            <li> - I can straighten my spikey, unruly hair in less than 5 minutes with this straightener.  </li>
            <li> and i can straighten it in half an hour.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt recommend this chi to someone with thick, wavy, or long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is long, thick and curly)</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended the CHI to me and did warn me that they are very expensive, but worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wavy and long and within about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavy hair and have always been really frustrated with trying to blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> it is a little bit pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;We still think it is a little pricey, and this is the reason why I did not mark it as a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> However, it did take a little longer than I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged poorly and half open.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Just try to be careful when unplugging the GFI adapter and dropping it on hard ground.</li>
            <li> Farouk does not stand behind their warranty very well and are very rude to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product just because its a Chi.</li>
            <li> Buy it and your money will not go to waste.</li>
            <li> it takes a few times to flatten the hair, and it doenst curl that</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift that did not work after a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightner for a few months now</li>
            <li> After one use, it fried itself and would not light up at all, even after I switched outlets and tried to reset them.</li>
            <li> I owned a few of these and did not have any problems.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Chi iron because my cousin has had one for a few years.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t waste the time or energy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on anything else.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t damaged or dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> When I did finally reach someone they told me that even though the iron had broken in a week they would not fix it because I had purchased it online</li>
            <li> it has a firm grip of the hair when you want curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but it has never given me any trouble.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on something that worked for 3 and half months!</li>
            <li> My hair is not the easiest to tame.</li>
            <li> It can straighten my hair even after it dries in a wavy mess!    </li>
            <li> I rate customer service as bad although the product was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Every time after I wash my hair, my hair would be flying around everywhere, not a very nice hairstyle.</li>
            <li> (Those little rascals!)  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and I need more value for my money.</li>
            <li> Virtually pointless unless it&#x27;s winter for me.</li>
            <li> , it usually takes just one pass</li>
            <li> I always used cheaper models (usually in the $30 to $40 dollar range)</li>
            <li> I was not confident -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It works just the way it should, straightening the hair effecively in a small amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have two small children</li>
            <li> and sometimes I have to attend to small \\&quot;emergencies\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They did not send an explanation (beyond the invoice that had a small notation about it being out of stock) or apology . . .</li>
            <li> (not sure if amazon sells it).</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s had in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more going to the salon and having my hair done and then paying the salon price.</li>
            <li> (over the past 4 years or so) i have realized...</li>
            <li> NO MORE CHI for me.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut to just below my shoulders, and the waves got even worse!  </li>
            <li> but Farouk has lousy customer service and the only reason I purchased this brand again</li>
            <li> but when I got it shipped it ended up being a fake, the \\&quot;velvet red</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d spend a lot of money &amp; then get something that barely worked.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was a hard plastic material.</li>
            <li> I placed my hand closer to iron and could hardly feel any heat coming from it.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one for years but hard to spend the money.</li>
            <li> will last at least a year!!!</li>
            <li> I thought straightening my crazy hair would take an hour with this tiny thing, until I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have edited this review to add this negative note.    </li>
            <li> at least then you&#x27;d have the warranty.</li>
            <li> of their shampoo and conditioner, which sucks too.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably give it 5 stars, but I think it needs an automatic shutoff after at least an hour.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a late Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> (I have thick curly hair).</li>
            <li> When they say turbo, they mean turbo.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> My daughters knew these were really expensive flatirons and were very careful to not wind the cord around the unit or kink it in any way.  </li>
            <li> Do not purchase this flat iron as it is a 100 percent FAKE!  </li>
            <li> I have bought several of these and they are very expensive  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried less expensive irons</li>
            <li> The price is a little scary</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and can now straighten it in 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick, &#x27;big\\&quot; hair that I am growing longer...</li>
            <li> Given the amount of money I spent on the product, I&#x27;m shocked that it turned out to be a lemon.</li>
            <li> it was actually begining to stick out and away from it&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> so I assumed I had broken it permanently.</li>
            <li> that this manufacturer does not stand behind its products.</li>
            <li> persuing  a refund, it seems fruitless and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> When I was in high school I was going through the worst hair stage!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and hate to blow dry it.</li>
            <li> However, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the packing.  </li>
            <li> I would reccommend anyone with difficult hair to straighten to use this product.</li>
            <li> It burned it up unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, my hair is fried and it will stay that way till it grows out.</li>
            <li> no, I haven&#x27;t grabbed the wrong end and waited for it to burn me yet.  </li>
            <li> and some may do the job just as well, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> They do not stand behind their products, so BEWARE of this brand!</li>
            <li> It eventually became too expensive to get my hair done</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within 1 month of use the product broke.  </li>
            <li> I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year.  </li>
            <li> VERY frustrating.  </li>
            <li> also found out about the chi after my hairdresser used it on my hair, and since then I have had no more bad hair days!</li>
            <li> I plugged it in this morning and it was ICE cold.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be sad the day it breaks!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> I am just mad</li>
            <li> I pointed out to her that this would have been impossible since I didn&#x27;t have the warranty to read until I had already bought the product.  </li>
            <li> my hair starts to curl or frizz out bad after a hour or two of using it.</li>
            <li> Then again, the one I had could have been just a bad one.</li>
            <li> Then they threatened not to refund my money after I had already returned the product because I wrote bad feedback about their customer service.</li>
            <li> Makes every bad hair day easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I am incredibly shocked to hear that some people&#x27;s irons quit working.  </li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed....</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Boy was I disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, VERY disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very annoying!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They have absolutely terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> Hate it!!!</li>
            <li> curly at times, which I HATE!!!  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product and a terrible company ....</li>
            <li> and they were nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the CHI Turbo Iron Hair Straightener, I would recommend this to anyone.  Works great!  gwen</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product after I had read some of the reviews... but when I received my iron the on/off switch didn&#x27;t work and I think that I got a knock-off. I emailed the seller but was told that I had to send mine back in first which I couldn&#x27;t go with out an iron so I had to keep it and use it not working properly. I feel I paid a lot of money for a product that doesn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas in 2007 and it&#x27;s still going strong in 2014. She doesn&#x27;t use it every day, maybe three or four times a year to straighten her hair, but she has very curly hair, so when she does use it, it gets a work out. I also noticed that she has started to use it recently to seal mylar bags for food storage. So basically, it has done what it is supposed to do and more well and has lasted for us.</li>
            <li> This just crapped out on me one day &amp; Farouk wouldn&#x27;t take it back. Pissed me off that I spent so much on a straightener that didn&#x27;t even last a year!</li>
            <li> My friend has this flat iron and I first used hers. I like it because it is fast and it makes your hair silky and shiny. I had another brand flat iron which was cheap. It worked with my hair as well. But I needed to spend a lot of time to straighten my hair with it and also it didn&#x27;t give my hair this silky touch. CHI flat iron always makes my hair silky and shiny. This is a very good product. The only reason why I rated it 4 stars is that if I don&#x27;t dry my hair completely and try to straighten them, it doesn&#x27;t work. So, after shower, I blow dry my hair and then I straighten them for the best result with this product and as long as it doesn&#x27;t rain, my hair looks perfect!</li>
            <li> Now that I have my second Chi, I love it.  My roommate has had one that I&#x27;ve been using for several months and we haven&#x27;t had a problem with it, but the first one that I was sent broke after the first time I used it- VERY frustrating.  My replacement works great though.</li>
            <li> The CHI is an ok straightener. I live in Houston, Texas/New Orleans, Louisiana so I know what curly hair + humidity does, and the CHI does not solve the problem. If your hair is quite curly and you live in a humid area, I would suggest not buying it and going for the curly haired look, because chances are you won&#x27;t find a straightener that will straighten your hair and keep it straight. When I use it anytime between March and October my hair starts to curl or frizz out bad after a hour or two of using it. Virtually pointless unless it&#x27;s winter for me.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It was a Christmas Present and was shipped very quickly upon ordering.  It was brand new and quite a bit cheaper than purchasing it, with a discount, through the beauty supply store.  It works great and is the best hair straightener my daughter has ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it. It straightens her hair quickly and makes it look gorgeous. She had the regular chi before and it lasted 3 years. This one is even better since it is adjustable for heat settings.</li>
            <li> The Chi is an excellent Flat Iron, though expensive. I would reccommend anyone with difficult hair to straighten to use this product. It is one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this item was because of its popularity, many of my friends had a CHI. It makes your hair soft and silky, however, at the same time damages it greatly, like all straighteners. I even used the CHI protecter spray, and it still damaged my hair and caused many split ends.</li>
            <li> This is the second Chi straighter that I have owned and I would buy it again and again. The first one lasted me 4 years and the only reason it did not was I plugged it in a converter in Germany on the high button. It burned it up unfortunately.  The Chi is gentle on your hair and always makes mine look straight and soft. This also was the best price on this particular straightner.  They are expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> I should be a spokes person for the Chi!  I have convinced several other women to purchase this item because I love it so much!  My hair is silky smooth; I can flip it this way, flip it that way and make it as straight as a stick!!!! I highly recommend this product ot any one wanting to straighten her hair.  It is worth every dollar!!!</li>
            <li> My Chi heats up in seconds and works great! It straigntens my hair better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve used, and heats up faster. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the tool straightens in one swipe (my hair is hard to straighten) and it also works great to curl the ends. The best straightener I ever bought, very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I have very curly hair and it straightened it better than anything I have ever tried before!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener one year ago, I didn&#x27;t even use it every day, and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It will only get warm now and even after leaving it on for 1 hour I could still touch the ceramic irons. I will never buy a CHI product again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000TKV83Y Farouk BioSilk 1 inch CHI - NEW Ltd. Edition Hair Iron (Color : BLACK)]]I have tried cheaper flat irons, and boy what a difference a good one like the Chi is.  It is the best product and price anywhere.  Quick and easy to use, with great results.</li>
            <li> I went to a beauty store and asked about a good hair straightener.  The man suggested the Chi Turbo. I found this on amazon so I decided to purchase it. The first few days it worked well, after that it damaged my hair! I used thermo hair shield spray and everything. It broke the strands of my hair and now my hair is different lengths. My stylist said that the product ruined my hair. After using it for awhile the heat doesn&#x27;t straighten out the waves and I eventually threw it away. The same thing happened to my friend when she bought one!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product just because its a Chi. I rather get a good one from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and most the time I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of straightening it but I thought this would make it a lot easier.  I purchased the product in February and have used it maybe 4 or 5 times and the other day with half of my hair straightened it died.  Just completely stopped working.  I&#x27;ve tried everything-changing outlets, pressing the restart button.  WIth the amount that I spent on this product my beautician could&#x27;ve blown dried my hair all 4 times.  I am highly disappointed....</li>
            <li> Much easier than your run of the mill straighteners.  Also curls very well.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair.  I am able to straighten with ease.  I had a WIGO straightener that cost more, but couldn&#x27;t straighten enough.  I wish I had the CHI from the beginning.  The adjustable temperature is great too.  It heats up very fast as well.  Well worth the money, especially if you have a lot of hair like me!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I have naturally curly hair and in the summer with the Georgia humidity, my hair will frizz. So I straighten my hair. I have no frizz and my hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product...great price!  Wife couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This is the exact same one used at high end salons.</li>
            <li> THE most wonderful flat iron!!!   Don&#x27;t waste money on the cheap ones....just buy this one!  So quick and easy and saves time....worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product! I have used the original CHI but this product is better because you have the option of changing the temperature. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product worked great for about 5 months then the on/off switch went haywire and it quit working. I will never waste my money on another one.</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener. It is definitely worth the investment. It makes my hair soft and its quick to use. It takes me less time to straighten my hair with the chi then my previous hair straightener. I also heard that the chi turbo works better than the original chi. So it works well for people that have really curly/wavy hair (which I do!)</li>
            <li> This product produces salon results that last. It heats quickly and is lightweight and easy to use. I have very unruly kinky curly hair that resists styling but with this product I can straighten and style my hair just like my hairdresser, who also uses this product and recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  It&#x27;s THE best hair product I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried less expensive irons and there&#x27;s simply no comparison.  It is totally worth the money.  It straigtens my hair in minutes without drying it out or making it brittle and my hair is smooth, silky, and stays straight no matter what the weather. Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Great price when compared to stores like Ulta, Sephora.  When it was used by wife the initial iron wouldn&#x27;t work.  We used Amazon&#x27;s return and had it replaced in less than a week.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has served me very well. I bought it to replace a cheaper one that I had, which broke. I&#x27;ve had this one for a couple years already and it works very well. I love that the temperature is adjustable since my hair is very fine in addition to being a combination of very wavy and curly. I have found that if I use it too often, as with any heat product, my hair has a tendency to dry out, but I bought a silk infused gel, also made by Chi, which works very well to protect my hair and make it look more like naturally straight hair instead of curly hair that was straightened and looks sizzled on the ends. It&#x27;s very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much... its easy to use and the results are good...</li>
            <li> She likes this so much better than off-the-shelf Walmart brands.  This professional unit does the job better</li>
            <li> I received this straightener after my old one broke after lasting me 3.5 years. Upon using it the first time, the felt on top of the heat paddles started pulling up and getting my hair stuck in it. As I was using it I would sometimes hit the heat button and turn it down since the location of the button was right where my hand hits.I wouldn&#x27;t even realize until it stopped straightening. And there are only 3 heat settings. I have heard great things about CHI and was sorely disappointed. After 2 uses I have put in my return request to amazon and will be ordering my old straightener again which I know I love and just happens to be cheaper than the CHI straightener! [[ASIN:B000BBF4MW Infrashine Original Professional Ceramic Styling]]</li>
            <li> I love my chi flat iron. I&#x27;ve had mines for almost 2 years now and its great. It does cause a small amount of hair breakage but this chi does a far better job than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used during my lifetime. Buy it and your money will not go to waste.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am incredibly shocked to hear that some people&#x27;s irons quit working.  I&#x27;ve had this iron for 3 years and I never had a problem.  In fact I love it and couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without it.  I use it daily, on the highest heat setting possibly because I have very thick and wavy hair to combat in Texas weather. I have also used it many times on my children&#x27;s hair at differing heat levels. Perhaps, the model I received 3 years ago was of better quality.  As far as I know, it works wonderfully! Best iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works so quickly on my hair. I wear it straight all the time. I definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was not my best experience. It worked pretty well for nearly two years. It straightened hair fairly well and didn&#x27;t seem very damaging at all. It seemed like just another great product from Chi.    But then suddenly it started to slowly flicker on and off, then eventually, it just stopped turning on. I tried taking it apart to fix it, since the warranty expired by the time it broke, and everything internally seemed completely fine, though I did notice some very audible rattling inside the GFI adapter, and I&#x27;m assuming that the poor build quality of it ultimately led to the flat iron not turning on. Just try to be careful when unplugging the GFI adapter and dropping it on hard ground. I&#x27;m ASSUMING if you avoid this, this flat iron will continue to work for several years. This problem seems to affect a lot of flat irons.    I was hoping for the price, I would get a little more use out of it, but that was not the case. I actually had a vastly better experience with the original Chi than this one.</li>
            <li> i got this chi after my pink chi broke after less than a year after it was purchased. i havnt used this chi for a long time, but i dont think its as great as it sounds. it takes a few times to flatten the hair, and it doenst curl that well. it does leave your hair with a smooth and sleak look afterwards.  i wouldnt recommend this chi to someone with thick, wavy, or long hair. this iron doesnt style very well, but it makes ur hair very nice and sraight. but i would recomment to try a different chi, as the chi irons are usually very good products.</li>
            <li> I have a Chi Turbo flat iron that I bought full price several years ago. It is perfect in every way. When my daughter left for college I bought another on Amazon. The product that arrived on my doorstep is nothing compared to the real thing. It is a cheap, imitation of the Chi Turbo! It does not heat up as high as my original one and is very tinny and cheap feeling. It is definitely not a real Chi Turbo. I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this product off of Amazon.  It worked fine until it broke two months later (I only used it about 10 times).  I&#x27;ve tried everything, but the iron no longer heats up.  Given the amount of money I spent on the product, I&#x27;m shocked that it turned out to be a lemon.</li>
            <li> Man!!! Why did I wait so long to finally buy this??? This thing is EXPENSIVE but well worth every penny!!! &lt;br /&gt;I have semi-straight hair. It is kinda wavy. Every time after I wash my hair, my hair would be flying around everywhere, not a very nice hairstyle. I have tried many flat Iron. Chi definitely is 10 times better than the rest!!! It is truly flash heating in seconds. Unlike others, you have to wait a few minutes for the flat iron to get hot enough. It is very easy to straight my hair, I just need to go over once or twice, my hair is already very straight. Other flat iron made me go over the same hair strain over and over again and still couldn&#x27;t reach the same straightening effect. &lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Chi flat iron to everybody.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this straightener.  Worth every penny.  Straightens quickly and easy to use.  Leaves my thick naturally curly hair, silky straight.</li>
            <li> The best hair straightener I&#x27;ve used. Really fast and my hair stays straight even if it rains.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a week and it worked great. However, one day it overheated and burned a section of my hair. I unplugged it and after closer inspection, found that it was melting itself where the ceramic hot plat section touched the plastic. The ceramic part o f it was actually begining to stick out and away from it&#x27;s base. Sadly, my hair is fried and it will stay that way till it grows out. I would not recommend having the unit on for an extended period. Just use it fast and shut it off. I got a replacement and so far it seems to be fine. As a straightner its is really good, but if you want to do fancy flips or shapes then be aware of how long it is on. Then again, the one I had could have been just a bad one.</li>
            <li> The Farouk CHI GF 1583 is the perfect counter to combat the Wild Woman from Boreno look.  I has tamed thick, coarse, wavy hair into soft workable hair that moves.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Like the professional dryer I bought recently, I wish I would have bought this sooner. I had what I thought was a good flattening iron..it was ceramic and one I bought from the beauty store. But oh my gosh!!!! it is so different. I didn&#x27;t realize your hair isn&#x27;t supposed to get pulled out with your flattening. Well it wasn&#x27;t pulled out but it wasn&#x27;t smooth like this one. It had adjustable temp so I can lower it for the more delicate areas and higher for the other areas. It has velvet on the bottom and top shoudl you decide to use this to curl your hair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair over and over again, it usually takes just one pass so it is better for my hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know this is pricey, but you won&#x27;t regret the purchase!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good quality product, seeing as how it cost so much, but it broke after my daughter used it for a month, after which time it was too late to return.  The manufacturer will only repair or replace it if it is sold through a professional salon.  So, even though you buy it through Amazon, a respectable place to buy things, you won&#x27;t get any support for it after 30 days.  You won&#x27;t find this out until you read the pamphlet that comes with the iron.</li>
            <li> I got my flat iron in 3 days.  I could not believe it.  It was brand new and packaged very careful.  I have recommended others to get their flat iron from this store too!</li>
            <li> I have been using straightening irons for many years.  I always used cheaper models (usually in the $30 to $40 dollar range) and I can say without a doubt that this iron is worth the extra money.  I actually wish I would have purchased it a few years ago.  It definitely saves time!</li>
            <li> This iron works well on my thick curly hair, but what good is it if it doesn&#x27;t hold up.  Several months after I purchased this iron, it wouldn&#x27;t get hot, only warm.  Farouk replaced the iron.  Now, ten months later, the ceramic plates, (both plates, on both sides) are cracked and oozing out whatever it is inside the plates.  What is this stuff?  Farouk says the warranty on a replacement iron is 90 days.  They offered to fix it if I send it back with $35, but it will take up to five weeks.  That&#x27;s an unacceptable amount of time.  It&#x27;s summertime, what would I do without an iron for five weeks.  I have to buy a new one anyway, may as well look for on that will last at least a year!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was great.  I eceived the Chi Flat Iron quite quickly.  I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a friend.  She was absolutely correct - it&#x27;s a wonderful gadget and my hair has never looked better in my life! It does the trick quickly and safely.  There are no split ends and the felt on the iron keeps you from accidently burning yourself.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my CHI! This makes my normally frizzy hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li> This straightener is first class. It takes very little time (which saves your hair from more damage). I straighten everyday &amp; love this product dearly. I will never have another cheap iron.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift that did not work after a few months. My granddaughter liked the flat iron ,but it is too pricey to not last a year.  Thanks to Amazon they replaced it so my granddaughter was happy.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great and I received it in one day after ordering from Amazon.  I have used other flat irons and they do not work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, works very well, good looking and a great value for money.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd of these that we have bought (1st for my wife, 2nd for her sister) and they&#x27;re great. Built to last and heat up immediately. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this product and it is even better than I expected!  Well worth the money and with free delivery with Amazon Prime, it was cheaper than I have found it anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for hair. It does not damage it as the other common flat irons. Also the shipping was excellent: very fast (3 days!!) and for free!</li>
            <li> This is the 5th CHI turbo we have purchased in the last 4 years.  According to my daughter (who is the user of the CHI) it works great, doesn&#x27;t damage her hair, and heats up immediately.  She uses it every day and seems happy with it.  As I said, my daughter loves it, but then she isn&#x27;t the one paying for it.    I have several problems with this product.  As I mentioned earlier, this is the FIFTH CHI I&#x27;ve purchased.  They seems to last about a year (11 months on average for me), and if you bought the thing on-line, well you can forget about any warranty support.  I called the dealer who sold me the CHI and they told me I had to contact the manufacturer for warranty work.  I&#x27;ve called Farouk (the manufacturer) and they have repeatedly refused to honor the warranty for an on-line purchase.  Finally, after threatening them with complaints to the State Attorney General&#x27;s Office and the Better Business Bureau, and a phone call from my lawyer they sent me a replacement....and a letter stating that there was NO warranty for this replacement.    So now 11 months later, the thing is broken again and the manufacturer (true to their word) is not going to honor any warranty.      I&#x27;ll NOT BUY ANOTHER ONE!    If you like products that cost 4 times what other similar products cost, that break after less than a year of use, that have non-existent warranties, and are supported by Customer Service personnel who are rude and condescending then I think you&#x27;re going to love this product!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really loves her new straightener. She says it heats up and is better at temperature control than her previous ones. Hands down the best price in town is here on Amazon for it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightner for a few months now and I love it! It gets hot quickly and doesnt give my hair that burnt smell.. I have shoulder length hair and it gets the job done in less them 15 mins.. The shine is gorgeous. I dont recommend it for curling though you don&#x27;t get the same effect as you would with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The straightener was great but it did not make my daughter&#x27;s hair &#x27;shiny&#x27; as it claimed. Since she saw small kiosks at the local shopping malls where people actually sampled their straighteners and saw how some made her hair silky smooth as well as straight, we&#x27;re going to the mall to buy one of those straighteners.</li>
            <li> great, i could never do my own hair with other irons. well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> HEATS UP QUICKLY, BUT I HAVE ALSO OWNED THE REGULAR CHI. I&#x27;M NOT CONVINCED THE TURBO IS ANY BETTER FOR THE PRICE. BUT THE CHI HAIR STRAIGHTENERS ARE THE BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron is amazing. You&#x27;ll never regret spending the money.</li>
            <li> I bought a Chi to straighten my thermally reconditioned (but still curly) hair at home.  I was spending a fortune at the salon ($40 a pop b/c my hair is long, thick and curly) so I took a risk and plunked down over $100 for the Chi (2\\&quot;).  I loved the Chi while it lasted - I blow dryed my hair with a round brush (which left it poofy and frizzy) and then used the chi once my hair was dry to get silky smooth hair.  It took me about 30 minutes to go through my thick hair and it really worked.  My hair lasted frizz free until I washed it again.  I only used it once a week b/c of the heat plus the chemicals in my hair.  However, as I was using the chi last week, it stopped working half way through straightening my hair.  I tried several different outlets and nada.  It won&#x27;t heat up anymore.  I plugged it in this morning and it was ICE cold.  So, the Chi is going back.  Luckily I am in the return window for folica.  I have ordered a Solia instead.  Hopefully the Solia will prove more durable.</li>
            <li> Face it, we&#x27;ll never make our hair look as good as it does at the salon when someone else is doing it, but with the Chi flat iron, I think I&#x27;m as close as I&#x27;ll get.  My hair is straighter, smoother, and shinier, all in a shorter amount of time, than it ever was with a cheaper iron.</li>
            <li> I am an African American and I bought this flat iron because I used a friends and liked the staying power of the curls.  The quick heat is wonderful for those late for work mornings. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is the red material, it&#x27;s felt like, and at times it pulls my hair when curling.  No where on the web page does it describe the \\&quot;red\\&quot; area. I assumed it was a hard plastic material. This is not so problematic that I would return the iron. Overall This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.     I had a cheaper flat iron from another brand and it worked just as well, but my hair smelled like it was burning even though that too was a ceramic flat iron. The other flat iron also pulled out pieces of my hair.    This product leaves your hair shiny, smooth and smelling like your conditioner rather than flat iron like burnt hair. I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t like the price so held off on buying a professional flat iron and went for a cheapie one bought for $40 at a drugstore. The cheap one damaged my hair and made it look frizzier so I finally spent the $$ and bought this one. It is money well spent, I now have shiny straight hair everyday. It is a wonderful product, I have very coarse frizzy hair and in about 15 minutes it transforms it into silky straight strands. I am soooo happy! You will not regret spending the $$ on this product!</li>
            <li> this is the only straightener that&#x27;s ever been able to get this awkward, unmanageable cowlick i have in my hair to straighten out, so i love it! i do wish it had an auto-off after a certain amount of time, or that the power light were more visible to a right-hand user, but really, that&#x27;s nitpicking. i do love it!</li>
            <li> After using other brands of hair straighteners (and going through several of them) for 7 years now, the Chi is by far the best hair straightener I have ever used.  I always used to wonder how my hair stylist could get my hair so silky, straight, and smooth.  My hair is very thick, very course, and very very curly. It&#x27;s basically like horse hair.  I bought every hair product there ever was.  Everything my hair stylist used.  Then I bought a Chi.  Wow!  I had never been able to get my hair to do that.  It was the biggest difference in the world.  I am now going to be a life time user of Chi&#x27;s.    I&#x27;ve read other reviews about how they didn&#x27;t like it because of the red felt, but you just don&#x27;t put your fingers on the red felt constantly.  In fact, I find it easier not to.  If you&#x27;re up in the air about this product, my vote is BUY IT.  It&#x27;s amazing and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Chi Turbo after the straightener I had broke. I was hesitant to spend so much money (far more than I&#x27;d ever spent on hair supplies) on a product I&#x27;d never seen, but with a recommendation from my friend, I went ahead and took the risk. When I got it, it was much smaller than I expected (my fault for not paying attention to the description). My previous straightener had huge plates, and these were only 1\\&quot;. I was not confident - I thought straightening my crazy hair would take an hour with this tiny thing, until I tried it. The first time I tried it, and my insane, tangled, frizzy, jumbled mass of hair became straight and sleek and lovely in 10 minutes, I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 5 years ago. In the past 5 years, I&#x27;ve moved several times, throwing this thing in boxes unprotected and throwing stuff on top of it, have mistakenly left it on for more than a day at a time, left it lying out on my bathroom counter constantly plugged in, always kept it on the highest heat settings, and have thrown it in my bathroom cupboard haphazardly, never taking particular care to protect it. It&#x27;s taken a beating from me, and it worked perfectly for 5 years. In the past week it&#x27;s refused to heat up past barely warm, the light won&#x27;t flicker, and resetting it doesn&#x27;t work. I think my Chi has finally kicked the bucket, but with all the abuse I put it through, I&#x27;m amazed and impressed it&#x27;s lasted this long and worked so well the whole time. I&#x27;m absolutely buying another one, and can&#x27;t wait to have a Chi back in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> Great Irons just make sure you uses chi Iron guard spray and chi oil for sheen(liquid oil in bottle pour little in hand an place on each small section of hair you straighten)</li>
            <li> I think this product is great. I had the original and just recently bought the new one. Anyone having problems with it might want to consider how you take care of it. It has to be handled with care and properly stored in order to keep in good condition. My whole family has used this product for years and we are all very pleased.</li>
            <li> Fantastic iron, heats up quickly, has a swivel cord, variable temperature control.  My only future design request would be to add an \\&quot;indicator light\\&quot; to show that the iron is on.    My last iron was a Hai which I loved, but the cord eventually broke due to it not having a swivel head.  I decided to go with this new iron since its what my stylists use at the PR@ Partners salon.    November 17, 2008.  I have edited this review to add this negative note.    Internet buyers beware.  Purchasing this product from Amazon or any other non-salon retailer voids your warranty with Farouk, the manufacturer.      I purchased this iron just under a year ago and it worked beautifully up till just a few days ago.  Farouk refuses to provide repair services and Amazon refuses to provide customer service beyond 30 days from date of purchase.    If it breaks, you will be out of luck just like I am now.  This is too much money to just throw away.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried.  I have very curly hair and this gets hot enough to straighten it with only one or two times through.</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas present for my daughter.  She tells me this is a definite improvement over her last flat iron.  I felt even better about buying it after our stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I has my hair dresser order this for me off of ebay probably about 4 or 5 months ago. It always worked really good...I&#x27;m not going to say great because I never felt that it really did wonders for my hair like a lot of people hair. About 2 months into having it I started having problems where it wouldnt turn on, so I had to press the reset button on the plug but then it&#x27;d pop right back out so I had to do that several times till it would go on. Now, its pretty much dead. If you hold it a certain way it will heat up but its just not styling right. For the money I spent on it, it should have lasted me years, not 4 months! So now I dont know if I want to replace it or look for something else. It&#x27;s just a big inconvenience because my hair is too short to put up so im stuck wearing it down so i need a good flat iron!  Now after writing this review I&#x27;ve noticed many other complaints on here and other sites about it going bad quickly. Very annoying!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this heats up real fast and gives me straight, shiny hair in no time.  Wish I would have got it sooner.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener. The price is a little scary but if you&#x27;ve struggled with finding the right tool for dealing with curly or wavy hair it&#x27;s worth it. Even in humid weather my hair stays straight the whole day.   I&#x27;ve been using the chi iron along with chi Silk Infusion for 6 months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses almost daily, and the first one lasted a month.  Amazon was nice enough to replace it, but now that one has died 8 months later.  I realize they don&#x27;t last forever, but for that kind of money, I expect several years of use, and according to reviews, this appears to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> although this product claimed to be new, when it arrived, it was clearly not.  It was packaged poorly and half open.  I have no complaints about the straightener itself.  However, if you have thick curly hair this product only works at the highest setting and I have to go over the same strand a couple of times.  The eventual outcome is good though.</li>
            <li> I already have a Hot Tools flat iron, but my hairdresser uses this one and loves it. I decided to shell out the money for this one, and boy was I happy I did! There is so much for control with this iron, and the results are amazing.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it, beats anything you can buy in the stores.  Saves many hours in the bathroom</li>
            <li> It is definently worth the $$$ to buy a CHI.  I have very thick curly hair and can now straighten it in 20 minutes.  It used to take at least 40 with my cheap flat iron.  I am so happy I bought this product.  The only draw back is that it falls over easily on the counter.  I would recommend buying the stand for it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but I am not sure that it is all that it is cracked up to be and for the price, some of the cheaper ones work just as well.</li>
            <li> Everybody in my family has one. My sisters and cousins. Their hair is helthy and brilliant after years of use. You just have to use it properly, not to damage your hair. My sister&#x27;s hair has changed, it is almost completely straight when it dries up by itself, before using the Chi. (After about 4 years of use). I got it for may daughter, and I hope it will do the same for her!!!!</li>
            <li> The CHI Turbo is one of the less expensive professional grade flat irons.  This came highly recommended to me by my hairstylist and I have to say it is the most efficient flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used and I get great results.  I have very thick, very wavy, shoulder length hair and it takes me about 10 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser always used this hair iron to straighten my hair and it always came out fabulous.  So I finally broke down, spent the money and threw my old one in the trash.  I researched where to buy it from and Amazon had the best price around with the fastest shipping.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser recommended chi flat straightening iron for my curly hair and so far i am very happy about the results since i have a very unruly curly hair this product work wonders for my kind of hair. it is a little bit pricey but, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this every day, and says it is wonderful.  Order was filled quickly, prior to Christmas.</li>
            <li> The flat iron that I ordered quit working after 2 weeks of use.  I was not satisified with this.  The price was good and the shipping was free, but I sent the product back after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener through NoCurls on Amazon. After one use, it fried itself and would not light up at all, even after I switched outlets and tried to reset them. It worked pretty decent the one time I tried it but I went against the advice of my friends who told me they had them too and they only worked one or two times before overheating. My ceramic one from Walmart has been working just fine for over a year now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh and I suggest that you DO NOT buy this or anything from NoCurls. They have absolutely terrible customer service. First they wanted to keep 30% of what I paid to restock the defective product. Then they threatened not to refund my money after I had already returned the product because I wrote bad feedback about their customer service. After I removed what I wrote and two months of unreturned emails and waiting for my refund, I finally had to get Amazon to assist me with the refund. Please be aware.</li>
            <li> I bought the Chi turbo flat iron from a local salon after reading all the positive reviews here. Brand new and apparently well-made, it heated up almost instantly, but the benefits ended there. When I tried it on my thick, bushy, dry, coarse, frizzy, wavy, highlighted and miserably uncooperative hair, not only did it not straighten it but left it with large, S-shaped kinks in some spots.     After I blowdryed my hair I applied the Chi silk infusion, which by the way I do like, and I had also used a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing. When ironing I divided my hair into small sections (a maddening process in itself - adding another 20 minutes onto the eternity it already takes to dry my hair) and slid the iron through each section to a quick count of 3 seconds as instructed by my hairstylist. So I wasn&#x27;t just clamping it on and letting it sit on a section of hair until it burned.     This was a very precise, very well-informed styling effort I was making, and still the results were profoundly disappointing. I tried it a few times, making sure to blowdry as thoroughly as possible to ensure any damp hair wouldn&#x27;t negatively affect the process (this in itself is a time consuming, tedious chore for me). Always the same result - dry wispy flyaways on the surface of the hair and a dried up \\&quot;burned out\\&quot; look in some sections.    If you have hair like mine you might want to rethink plunking down a big chunk of change on this product.  I am selling mine to my sister, who loves the iron and has hair sort of similar to mine but not as prone to frizzing and with no natural wave. She uses it every day with the result of hair that does indeed look flat - but it also looks very dry, lifeless and overprocessed.</li>
            <li> I give it an A+.  I tried tons of different hair straighteners for years since I have wavy and unruly hair. This product worked wonders on me.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that it took me five minutes to completely straighten my hair and it looked wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t even curl in humidity anymore. I&#x27;ve had it for almost two years now, and even though I don&#x27;t use it often, it works great.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009V1YRS Farouk CHI GF1538 Turbo Regular 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]    This iron does not get hot enough. I have the original CHI Flat Iron, which has served me well for years. The first time I used this new iron, though, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be the same. This flat iron does not come close to the temperature printed on the iron itself. I used 3 thermometers and only recorded temperature of 120 degrees F unlike the 300+ degrees printed on the iron.    Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love my Chi!!!!! It works so perfect and straightens my hair in half of the time as my Hot Tools Iron did.</li>
            <li> My hair is not the easiest to tame. I have had my eye on a CHI flat iron for a while, but the cost at the salons was too high. My hairstylist uses CHI and told me that it was affordable on Amazon. I love it! My hair looks like silk everytime I use it and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!!! Won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. Heats up quickly and straightens my thick curly hair with one pass to a nice smooth, silky texture. Worth the money, delivered very quickly. I also purchased the 2\\&quot; with is great for a larger area. the 1\\&quot; gets closer to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product for my mom because she, too, has fallen in love with the magic of the CHI. I have been using this tool for over three years, and it works just as well as it did when I first took it out of the box. It makes my hair so sleek and so glossy, everyone always asks me if I&#x27;ve had it done, even though it was only 45 minutes of my own time (I have thick curly hair). It is worth every penny, and it will become an indispensable part of your hair routine. I do not straighten my hair everyday, but I usually straighten my bangs and I see FAR LESS damage to my hair than my friends who use metal straighteners.   I am a proud convert to the cult of CHI, and I can never go back to regular straightening irons. My friends have ceramic ones that work just as well, or better, but my hair stylist used this on me, and I can honestly say that this is my favorite hair straightner.  It&#x27;s worth it! Love this thing!</li>
            <li> My Sister wanted a CHI so I looked on Amazon.com and there it was. I lucked out that day the CHI was also on sale. The CHI is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron! it heats up fast and the padded sides make it easy to curl the ends. this iron does NOT leave your hair smelling burnt like other irons that i have tried. i highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> When they say turbo, they mean turbo. This iron heats up in a matter of seconds. It works great, I love the adjustable temp control. Very easy to use. Haven&#x27;t burned myself once...yay!</li>
            <li> When I was in high school I was going through the worst hair stage! It was frizzy, corse, and unmanageable. My mom bought me a bunch of different straighteners- steam, cheap ceramic, etc., but Chi turbo saved my high school years. I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting anything else! My Chi has gone through some beatings, too- left on over night, used almost every day in high school and college, dropped, traveled across the world.. and it&#x27;s still amazingly still going and still just as hot the day I got it. I will definitely be sad the day it breaks!</li>
            <li> After owning this flat iron for a year and a half, I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister bought it for me as a gift after her hair stylist was showing us the wonders of her Chi.  It gets hot fast, never burns me, my hair stays straight all day (I use a little Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide) and my hair feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The felt is still perfect on mine and no, I haven&#x27;t grabbed the wrong end and waited for it to burn me yet.  If the warranty is the only thing holding you back, then there&#x27;s not much anyone can say to change that (just know that in my personal experience I haven&#x27;t had to use my warranty, it&#x27;s a solid product as far as I have experienced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other flat irons out there and some may do the job just as well, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  Take care of your Chi (get a case and baby it) and it will serve you well.</li>
            <li> THis straightener is amazing!  I have curly, thick hair and this straightener works great! Best straightener Ive ever had,</li>
            <li> I think this one of the best investments for my hair I have ever made.  I so please with the way it straightens my hair.  It also saves me money in the long run because I don&#x27;t have to get a relaxer as much.  I have gotten so many compliments on my hair, even my beautician has said she can notice the difference in the maintenance of my hair.  I love it!  :-)</li>
            <li> It came in sooner then I expected.  My Chi straightener I replaced lasted me 5 years so I decided to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same model of Chi flatiron about 4 years ago and was very happy with it.  When it finally stopped working, I decided to purchase the same model again since it seemed to be a worthwhile investment the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought this chi for my wife for christmas.  She has been pleased with product and no problems noted.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and in time for the holidays even though I ordered it close to Christmas.  It was perfect.  Exactly what my daughter wanted.  Cut down the time it takes her to flat iron her hair in half from her previous flat iron.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First off, both my wife and daughter LOVE this product.  However, after about 1 month of use, it broke.  I called the manufacturer and they responded to me that Farouk products are NOT sold over the internet, ONLY through \\&quot;CERTIFIED\\&quot; salons.  Therefore, because I purchased this from Amazon, they could not, and would not, honor the warranty.  It really sounds like a scam to me, and as such, I will probably NEVER buy another Farouk product ever.  However, the woman I spoke with at Amazon (who was unaware of Farouk&#x27;s policy) was extremely helpful and shipped me a new product out immediately (and I received it in 3 days). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is, if you can deal with the warranty issues, this is probably the best hair straightener you can get.  HUGE Kudos to Amazon, and two thumbs down for Farouk.  They came off as pompous, even insinuating that they were unaware that Amazon carried their products (as if Amazon was some nickel and dime outfit).  Shame on them! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I hope this was useful!</li>
            <li> This WAS the best iron I ever used. It kept my hair shiny and soft. However, it got a short in the wire after using it daily for less than 2 months, and Farouk won&#x27;t cover it if bought on the internet...therefore, no warranty. Amazon came thru in the end and refunded my money promptly. Yeah for Amazon!! I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> This one does not pull on my hair as much, but it does nto get as hot as the other one. It has a temp gauge and the velvet liner. I would buy the original vs. this one.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product, in less than 1 year it quit. When I contacted Farouk they were MOST rude, refusing any warranty service. They do not stand behind their products, so BEWARE of this brand!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this Chi.  She said it is the only product that has made her hair straight and shinny.  It has held up for 2 and a half years.  The cord is now giving her problems. If she doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;hold\\&quot; it a certain way, it will shut off.  I have contacted Chi several times to send it back. The warranty states that when out of warranty, they will repair for $35.  However, you must first contact them for an RA#. Well, they never contact you back! That is their scam. Also just an FYI, these are not really warranted as they claim. If they are purchased anywhere other than thru a Salon, if it had broke in the one year period, they would not have repaired it, read your warranty.. it clearly states that.  Chi seems to run a scam when it comes to warranty&#x27;s. Their products are great while working, but they do not stand behind them once they break.</li>
            <li> I owned a few of these and did not have any problems.  This one may have been a lemon.  Within a couple of weeks, the velvet started peeling and it did not seem to be heating to full temperature.  CHI told me that this model is no longer made.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair.  I loved the high quality hair straighteners used in salons.  But I never could find one that got very hot.  I think I bought 2 that just took me so long to get enough heat to give me a sleek, straight finish.  My hair stylist recommended the CHI to me and did warn me that they are very expensive, but worth the investment.  I bought mine from Amazon in 2009 for $99.  I see that the price has gone up, but I LOVE this product.  It gets super hot but you can adjust the temp control.  It has a setting from about 176 to 356 F.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for two years and it has continued to work excellently.  The only slight issue is that the temperature control numbers are written in white on the handle and it is approximately where my thumb rests...so after about a year, the temperature numbers rubbed off and I can&#x27;t really read them at all.  But this has not been an issue because the adjustment slider is set to what heat worked for my hair and it is obviously very easy to know that if I slide it to the left is lower temp and to the right is higher temp.  Other than that, this is the best straightener for my long thick hair!</li>
            <li> It is easy and fast to use. I have curly hair and live in a humid area and my hair stays straight until the next time I wash it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and she loves me for getting her the best</li>
            <li> So glad I listened to my hairdresser!!!  This iron works like a charm. I can get my hair done faster and it comes out so much nicer!!! I&#x27;m new at the hair straightening thing, and this iron works great on my naturaly curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I really like my new Chi flat iron.  It works well, and makes my hair very \\&quot;stick\\&quot; straight!  It&#x27;s worth the investment, doesn&#x27;t grab and pull my hair like other cheaper irons.</li>
            <li> This is my first professional flat iron and I love it. It leaves my naturally curly, naturally frizzy hair perfectly straight and totally frizz free. It glides through my hair smoothly and after 8 months of using it almost daily (with Chi iron guard)I don&#x27;t see any damage to my hair. I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter had this used on her curly hair in a salon and she had to have one.  She absolutely loves it.  This was the best price I could find, also.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife, and she loves it cuts down the time on getting ready, if you know what i mean guys....</li>
            <li> I purchased the flat iron online and have used it daily. Love it and glad recomend other to buy it too. I</li>
            <li> I purchased my very first chi flat iron and loved it. Heated up very quickly and very hot and steamy. I gave it an average rating because it just quick working after 4 months and found out too like others, Farouk Chi won&#x27;t warranty it \\&quot;if not purchased from a professional salon.\\&quot; Bummers, its a great product and I cant get an exchange. Is this Amazon&#x27;s responsibility to disclose to its customers regarding warranty being void. I would have reconsidered buying it online if I&#x27;d known that. Trying to resolve with Amazon right now.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size flat iron for any length hair.  I have long, course, wavy hair.  It gets right down to the scalp and does an amazing job without making hair dull and flat.  It heats up quickly and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  My hair usually responds to humidity, but when I use this iron, it stays straight until the next washing.</li>
            <li> I got this today, really excited and nervous at the same time. I read all the other reviews and notcied the problems they had, so I made sure to check it before I decided to keep it. The powere light kept flickering and it didn&#x27;t get up to the highest temp. like it should have. Instead of risking it for this product, I am returning it and purchasing the original in a salon. I haven&#x27;t heard the same problems with the original CHI and by purchasing it in the salon, I will be covered by the warrenty. It did end up costing more, but it worked right out of the box and it is covered for a year. Make sure you know that the warranty for this product is VOID is purchased online.     I love my new CHI that I bought this evening and definately will not say, \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy a CHI at all.\\&quot; I would just be willing to pay a little more and get a valad warranty. It might cost you less in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost a year now. It works just the way it should, straightening the hair effecively in a small amount of time. I&#x27;ve even dropped this thing on the hard tile floor of my bathroom 2 months after I bought it, which chipped the top piece of plastic on it. It stopped working because of this and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on so I assumed I had broken it permanently. About a week later I turned it on just to see if I could get it working again, and low and behold, it turned on and works just as perfectly as it did the first day I used it. So in sum, it&#x27;s effective, easy to use, great on the hair, and it&#x27;s apparently quite durable even after a HARD fall. 5 star, recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace a 2\\&quot; flat iron.   I thought I woud try the smaller size iron to see if it offered more flexibility in styling.  It is easy to style the ends of your hair. It flattens like a charm.  It has a heavy duty cord that swivels - it still tangles a bit, but not much.   My only complaint is that it does not have an automatic shut off. (So, be sure not to forget to turn it off!!)  For an iron that gets so hot, I would think this would be a required feature.    If you want to straighten your hair, this iron will work splendidly.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  (Just be sure that you turn it off! :) )</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who just started straightening her hair.  She has shoulder-length, fine, but frizzy hair.  It works wonderfully for her.  I have the 2 inch Chi iron and I love it for my own very naturally curly hair.  If you have thick or long hair, I would suggest getting the larger model (2 inch).  If your hair is think or short, the 1 inch should work just fine.  These irons are much better than the ones you might buy in typical stores (Conair, Revlon, etc.).  It also doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much because of the ceramic plates.  You can also adjust the temperature which is nice.</li>
            <li> I was told by so many friends that this was the best flat iron but still was not convinced.  When my flat iron broke and my friend lend me her CHI, I could not go back to my old flat iron.  It&#x27;s been several weeks since I got my CHI and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have naturally curly hair and this straightens it quickly.  The only thing I would change is to add a heat setting dial so that I could turn down the heat for my bangs.</li>
            <li> what an amazing product. I have used alot of things trying to straighten my hair but this iron is far superior. My hair is like curly frizzy straw, I use this iron and the chi silk infusion and my hair becomes straight and silky without looking greasy.. Thank you Chi!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a 1\\&quot; Chi Turbo for my daughter less than one year ago - still under warranty. The red felt started to come off and it was burning her fingers. NOTE: She uses this iron only occasionally. I called Farouk, the manufacturer, and left a message for someone to call back with a return authorization approval. After three weeks passed, I called again and was told to return it with a check for $15. When I asked why the $15, I was told that it was to cover return shipping. There is no mention of return shipping charges in the warranty. I questioned the rep and she stated that this was Farouk&#x27;s policy. The estimated time to repair was 3 to 5 weeks!! For giggles, I checked the UPS rate to ship this item back and it was under $5. So, as this item probably costs about $10 to manufacture, it looks like the purchaser winds up paying for both the return shipping as well as the cost of the item. NICE way to treat someone who spent $120 on your product! If I treated my customers this way, I would be out of business in short order. When new, this item worked extremely well. I will never purchase from this manufacturer again and you can bet that my daughter will tell all of her friends at school, etc.  that this manufacturer does not stand behind its products.</li>
            <li> I was suspect of the need for \\&quot;ceramic ions\\&quot; and \\&quot;far infrared technology\\&quot;, but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it.  You don&#x27;t need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product.  This was a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;!  It is lightweight and ergonomic, heats up almost immediately, has a slider bar for varying heat from 176-356F (80-180C), and velvety felt that protects you from burns (also allows me to get closer to my ears and scalp without getting burned).  The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair (I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage).  Two other things to keep in mind when choosing a straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) size matters - smaller size is better - it&#x27;s more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better results. for superfine hair, I recommend the 0.7\\&quot; (mistakenly advertised as 0.07\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) not all ceramic is created equal - there are solid ceramic plates or plates COATED with ceramic that are cheaper.  the ceramic layer on the coated plates can peel off and is supposedly damaging to your hair (not to mention your product is ruined).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.</li>
            <li> This flatiron works wonders on my naturally wavy/frizzy hair.  I haven&#x27;t had any circuit problems yet, but only use it about once a week.  The straightness really depends on the amount of hair used in each section.  With small sections, you get really straight hair, but it seems to lose a lot of volume. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I have naturally curly hair that I love to straighten in the winter. I usually blow dry my hair and then use a curling iron. I had heard mixed reviews about this product and decided to buy it and give it a shot. When I received it, I plugged it in and gave it time to warm up. 10 minutes later I put a section of my hair in the straightener and got NOTHING! I placed my hand closer to iron and could hardly feel any heat coming from it. After 10 minutes it was warm, but I could put my fingers on the iron and close it on them. I let it sit for another 10 minutes and it never got any hotter. I&#x27;m very, VERY disappointed with this product. If I&#x27;m going to pay an arm and a leg for a flat iron, I expect it to work. This is a waste of your money. I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> The chi is an amazing straightener. I live in humid Florida, and this straightener gets my curly hair pin straight and it stays straight until I wash it. Unfortunatly, my first one just stopped working and farouk refused to take it back because \\&quot;Amazon in not an authorized dealer so your warranty is void\\&quot;. Luckily, Amazon replaced my straighter at no charge and I didn&#x27;t even have to pay for shipping. This is a great straightener and its worth its weight in gold (when it works), but at $120 dollars you are taking an expensive risk.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of straightening curly hair and an even better job of smoothing straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have had flat irons before, but this one is light weight, does not break my hair, and I have tons of frizz, and after using this iron - my whole texture changes to smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> i ordered it for my niece b&#x27;day. it came even quicker than i expected and was a great transaction!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my daughter. Tried other brands but this one seems to work the best. At a retail store it cost about $30 more. I would not hesitate to buy this product again!</li>
            <li> im a teen and i use my chi every morning its so great!ITS EASY AND SIMPLE! i got it for a beging of the year preasent and use it every day!its all ways next to me! ITS MY FAVORITE THING I OWN (BESIDES MY COACH) this is such a great product i recomded it at least once a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;u should definitally get this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year since we purchased this iron, and my wife is quite satisfied with this present.  At the beginning she thought it was expensive, but over time she has realized it has a good record of reliability and it is also lightweight and easy to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We still think it is a little pricey, and this is the reason why I did not mark it as a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair immediately and is one of kind. I recommend the product and the seller to anyone!</li>
            <li> I previously had the 2\\&quot; Farouk model and switched to this one.  Just as good and much lighter in weight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well over 40 and thought flat irons were for younger women... I was wrong!  i have very thick, &#x27;big\\&quot; hair that I am growing longer... the Chi tames it and compacts it which has been great during this growing out phase.  any day i use it is a good hair day.  highly recommend.  it doesn&#x27;t only make it straight -- you can bend and curve with it.  but it does make it smooth, which is a good thing for my course hair.</li>
            <li> I got the same s@&amp;t that I got before... My old chi lasted 6 years.... It was great... Now I have one that doesn&#x27;t heat like the other.... This one gets warm and cold as it pleases .... Hate it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 6 months and it works perfectly.  Using in conjunction with a shine spray (spray hair then flat iron) makes my hair very sleek and shiny.  I&#x27;ve had many ceramic flat irons before and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Much better than store brands, it only needs to go through my hair once to straighten, so it saves on time it takes to straighten. It leaves my hair soft and much straighter than anything else I had tried. My sister decided to get one after trying mine. I have owned almost 4 months, so cant comment on durability. It also curls and flips hair well.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Chi clone for years until it finally broke--so decided to treat myself to the real thing and it is amazing.  It is a higher grade than my professional stylist uses and in fact this one will save me trups to the salon as I can now do it myself.  What a value for the price and while you should always use a heat protector -- it does not seem to be damaging my fine hair.  If you use a flat iron -- you need to try this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this product like 7 years ago, and since then it has been working with no problem, I have used some other flat irons and nothing compare with this, I even have used it in Europe ( with a converter ) and worked fine.  I am buying my second one now because I gave my daughter mine, and I can&#x27;t live without one.  I was thinking to buy a newer model more advanced, but I thought why?  This has worked perfectly I have tested it for years, so I stick to the same.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it with no hesitation, about the guarantee I can&#x27;t tell you, because I have never needed it.</li>
            <li> i love my chi! super HOT and heats up like instantly. perfect for my mop!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is by far the best I have ever used. I highly recommend it for all types of hair but especially people with short hair, such as myself.</li>
            <li> Had it forever now, and still works great.  Makes every bad hair day easier to manage.  A girl&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Chi flat iron for over three years now and I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m African American and I have extremely thick hair and before purchasing my Chi I had to get my hair professionally done every two weeks because there was no way I could do it myself.  It eventually became too expensive to get my hair done that often so I ended up buying a Chi after my friend told me about it.  I can now do my own hair just as good as the beauty salon.  It is an expenisve flat iron but it&#x27;s totally worth it!  It has saved me so much money.  I would recommend it to anyone, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A must have...I definitely recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair and wants it straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for a friend who tried mine and wanted one...this is the second friend I have bought one for.  I have had mine for over a year now and still use it frequently.  I loved it when I first got it and I still love it now!  The only thing that would make me love it even more is if it had an auto-shut-off.  I have two small children and sometimes I have to attend to small \\&quot;emergencies\\&quot; that always seem to occur when I am trying to groom myself or find some alone time in the bathroom...go figure! (Those little rascals!)  It would be nice to not have to worry about the house burning down if I accidentally left it unattended.  Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair. I tried the regular CHI and I loved it, but now with the turbo is much better, I have tons of hair and it straights it immediately, I reccommend this product to everybody !!</li>
            <li> I have natural, very thick hair.  I purchased the Chi iron because my cousin has had one for a few years.  I went swimming and used the iron to straighten back out my hair.  There were no problems, and I didnt have to go over my hair a few times, as with other irons I have tried. There was also no burning at all, and no breakage.</li>
            <li> Great tool if you know how to use it.  I&#x27;ve had my hair dresser working with me to show me how to use it.  It&#x27;s taking time to learn to use it and get the kind of results I am looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a good straightener, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price. I still have to blow out my hair before straightening it, and my hair isn&#x27;t even curly, it&#x27;s just wavy. I also have to run a comb through my hair while I pull the straightener through. It does give a shiny finish, though, when I blow it out well. I had a Wigo straightener that worked just as well, and it was half the price. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad straightener, it just doesn&#x27;t work as incredibly amazingly as everyone made it out to be.</li>
            <li> When I received this straightener, I used it one day and it worked great.  By the second and third time, it wasn&#x27;t as hot, even though the setting is at high. It heats up quite a bit significantly less than it did at first.     Now I have to send it back.... and do I want to go to all this trouble again with this same product?  No, I&#x27;ll go back to the cheaper straightener that I bought at Target.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for my daughter for Christmas--received an email on December 17th, telling me that the item was out of stock and it could be February before I was to receive said item.  So, I cancelled</li>
            <li> i have not used many straighteners in my life before, and i have VERY curly hair, but this one made my hair softer and straighter than any other straightener.  it did not fry it or make it frizzy, and the small size made it easy to manage.  it heats up quickly also.  i am very happy with this straightener, it was definately worth the price... i hope it lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li> I love the product!!! I have curly hair and hate to blow dry it. I can let my hair air dry then run the straightener over it for perfectly straight hair. I also use it after blowing out my hair and it works just as well. My hair stays straight all day. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or damage it. It is worth the money. My stylist has been telling me to get one forever and I finally did. I am so thankful I listened and you will be, too.</li>
            <li> Love the product heats fast and works well.  Extra long cord. Comfortable and light. Great price!</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair in under 20 minutes. Leaves hair silky and soft and not at all dry-looking. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for a family member and they loved it.  It was easy to use, heats up fast, and lasted for hours.  Unfortunately within 1 month of use the product broke.  I have sent it back to amazon for a replacement, so we&#x27;ll see how that works.  On the opposite side, my fiance has the same product from another website and it has been working for almost 2 years now.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews that say the same thing as mine, so please beware of this.  It might be best to spend the extra money and get it at a salon...at least then you&#x27;d have the warranty.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  It gets very hot, and it flat irons your hair. I preferred my cheaper old one that could flip my hair better and was ionizing .</li>
            <li> Excellent - heats up very quickly - one swipe and my hair is straight - takes less than 10 minutes to do my enire head and I have shoulder length wavy/curly hair.  My hair looks great.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve used a cheap 2\\&quot; Vidal Sassoon flat iron and finally broke down and bought this 1\\&quot; Chi (I bought the 1\\&quot; vs the 2\\&quot; based on customer reviews) because the plates on my old one were getting nasty and my hair started to feel brittle after using it. I just used the Chi for the first time and LOVE IT. I am just mad I didn&#x27;t spend the money months ago! My hair is shinier, smoother and straighter than I could ever get it with the Vidal Sassoon model, all in a fraction of the time. Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest straightening Iron I have ever purchased. The same one is offered at the hair Salon I go to....but 50$$ cheaper!!! It is made of quality products and much safer on the hair! Do BUY it!</li>
            <li> purchased this ceramic flat iron because it advertised it could also curl by wrapping your hair around the outside along the red flet material.  Curls turn out funny.  Id stick to the original chi for flattening hair.</li>
            <li> After lots of shopping, I finally decided on the Chi after using a girlfriend&#x27;s. I found Amazon to be the lowest price, plus I got the credit card and saved an additional $30...yay! I got the Chi - I was so excited, plugged it in and no light, tried again, checked all the buttons and nothing. What a dissappointment! But I went online the next day and submitted for an exchange and within two days I recieved another Chi, even without having sent back the other one. Website is very user friendly and customer service is convenient and quick. I love my Chi!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little hair straightener, and it&#x27;s at an excellent price! My friends all bought theirs at retail stores and paid twice as much. Plus I love the felt lining on the top and bottom, it helps to keep from burning your fingers.  I loved this product!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!  I had accidentally ordered another one because when I did a search it came up &amp; I just didn&#x27;t read close enough the name brand...it was OK, but this one is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2-3 months now &amp; my hair can be frizzy &amp; kinky curly at times, which I HATE!!!  This straightens my hair perfectly! Highly recommend, no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> The Chi does an awesome job straighting your hair. This was a replacement though because I bought one at Christmas 2007 and it went out in May 2008. There was not a warranty because I had bought it online and not through a authorized dealer. Amazon was good enough to replace mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product because I purchased it in May and it broke in  August.  I tried to contact Farouk to get a replacement but the warranty is void for straighteners purchased over the internet.  However the good news is that Amazon will replace the product.      To save yourself the hassle of all of this, I recommend you purchase a straightener from another brand.</li>
            <li> I just went through my second Chi in two years . . . very disappointed. I loved how the product handled but it didn&#x27;t last long for the price you pay (my conair curling iron has last 10+ years!). . . the first one I had broke with a week left on the warranty so I called and they said to send the product back in with $15 for processing (on top of the shipping I had to pay to send it in), then after almost 5 weeks I received a new one but they DOWNGRADED me from a 2\\&quot; to a 1\\&quot; because they were out of stock. They did not send an explanation (beyond the invoice that had a small notation about it being out of stock) or apology . . . I guess they thought they could just slip in a cheaper/smaller one and I wouldn&#x27;t notice! Nice.    I called to ask about it and they said I could send it back (paying the shipping again!) and I could wait for the 2\\&quot; but they did not know when it would be in stock again (way to go manufacturer) - I didn&#x27;t want to wait another 5+ weeks for the originally I bought so I just asked for some other products to make up for the price difference - they sent me (basically samples!) of their shampoo and conditioner, which sucks too.     Humph  . . . and btw the 1\\&quot; they sent me just broke - just a year later!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through loads of irons over the years.  From cheap to not so cheap.  I thought I loved my Wigo which was about $80 at Ulta, but after my stylist used the Chi - I decided to suck it up and buy it because my hair came out so good and I have an incredible problem with frizz and it stayed so nice for 2 days. Here in GA it gets humid..so this was the deciding factor for me. My hair comes out so smooth and bone straight.  I have naturally fine curly hair and this totally does the trick with one maybe two swipes on my hair.  With my Wigo, by the afternoon, my hair would start to puff and start to frizz.  This keeps it nice all day long. I&#x27;d probably give it 5 stars, but I think it needs an automatic shutoff after at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. If you are like me and have wild, and wavy hair, then this product is a must. It is a full ceramic,(not a coated ceramic, like many I have tried before), and has protected my hair. I have owned this product for a year and a half, and it is a great investment for me. I also use the \\&quot;silk infusion\\&quot; in the summer, to help keep my hair under control in the hot and humid weather (and it works).I bought the \\&quot;silk infusion\\&quot; at an Ulta store, and you can also order it online (not sure if amazon sells it). I have tried many other \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; staighteners, and have damaged my hair because of them. At first I did not want to drop the money, but after learning the hard way (after three awful, cheap, ceramic coated straighteners that chipped off, and dried out my hair), I splurged on a chi, and it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chi has lasted longer,worked better, and my hair is healthier than before. You get what you pay for, that is for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also remove it from my bathroom when taking a shower. The product manual recommends to not expose it to humid conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found out about the chi after my hairdresser used it on my hair, and since then I have had no more bad hair days! It is such a relief to not worry about my hair reacting to weather the way that it used to, and to not have dried out hair anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> my daughter is 13 and she has thick full hair that wants to curl.THIS CHI works on her hair perfect.She can go thru the whole day with straight hair.it works GREAT!!  u gotta know the humidity down here to know what i am speaking of.</li>
            <li> 1\\&quot; is easier to use than the 2\\&quot; and cheaper!  Also easier to make to curl under slightly if desired.  Great product and I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this iron.  She&#x27;s has extremely curly hair, and this iron lets her have straight soft hair.</li>
            <li> It was great to receive the flat iron that I wanted for my daughter so quickly.  However, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the packing.  The box was not sealed (the packing tape did not go across the opening of the box) therefore, it was easy to see what was inside.  This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she gets home from school before anyone else and could have easily seen what her gift was going to be.  That&#x27;s all I have to say - otherwise the shipment speed was awesome.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is definately worth the money.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous flat irons and they damage your hair and you still don&#x27;t get the results you want.  My hair would frizz by the time I got to work and it looked like I never flat ironed it to begin with also, I would find numerous strands of hair in the sink.  Using Chi has minimized the amount of hair breakage and my ends dont feel damaged, my hair stays straight with no frizz throughout the day.  I also use Chi silk infusion to protect my hair from the heat.  This straightener also works really fast.  I don&#x27;t have to keep going over it to get my hair straight.  My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t purchase this product when my hairstylist first recommended it.</li>
            <li> This was the second time I had purchased this particular flat iron, as I chose to buy this as a birthday present for my daughter also.  It is quite simply the best out there, and recommended and used by most hair stylists when you visit the salon.  The Chi flat iron heats up quickly, maintains the temp well and does not burn your hair.  It gives smooth impressive results especially if you have very curly hair.  The 1\\&quot; iron allows you to get a smooth finish from the roots to the ends of hair and also to flip the ends if you wish. It works well with long hair and short hair.  The results are well worth the extra dollars it costs.  You will not regret this purchase especially if you live in constant humidity like I do!.  Chi make hair products like silk infusion that smell great and enhance the finish and they protect your hair even more when used with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> product was excellent until it burnt out mid-use which in turn fried the hair i was straightening.</li>
            <li> I had the old Chi iron for about 5 years and it was great. When it finally quit on me, I decided to buy this new and improved iron. Boy was I disappointed! It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it&#x27;s heavy and I really didn&#x27;t like it at all. Within two weeks I got a new Solia iron and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love my straightener.  Used many other brands in the past, and  was not satisfied.  Heard many good things about the Chi and decided to   order online after my niece suggested she bought her Chi online.  Price is great, product is great.  Received by UPS in 3 days.</li>
            <li> This really is a great flat iron.  It&#x27;s very smooth on my hair and calms all the little crazy hairs that never seem to be calm.  It&#x27;s better than all of the cheaper irons I have bought in the past, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought the Farouk Turbo Ceramic Flat Iron for my granddaughter for her birthday.  She is very pleased with it.  Our hairdresser said it is the best Flat Iron available.  It does not pull her hair and leaves her hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this item about 3 years ago. It is the perfect straightener. The price is a little high but it does what i says it will do, except in the description where it says it curls. It heats up very quickly and it really durable. I use it almost every day and it works perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like most straighteners do. I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about. The item doesn&#x27;t break easily. They must have been throwing it around or not taking good care of it. I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and it still looks and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This unit died in one year.  I would now rate this thing 2-stars.      This is my previous review, while it was still usable:    This product is sleek and easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it was made of cheap material, and so far it has not damaged my hair.  It will take another year for me to see if it will outlast the Helen of Troy iron I had (which chipped after two years), but it is doing well so far.  I use it on the highest setting because I have very thick hair, and it heats up very quickly.  It can straighten my hair even after it dries in a wavy mess!    Besides the performance, the color is awesome!    I&#x27;m very glad I bought this product at Amazon, as well.  The beauty salon was selling Chi&#x27;s for $130--which was about $40 more than I paid for mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 2-3 weeks ago...we did use it 3 times and its broked...dosent work!!!  and I dont now what to do... do I going to loose my money???? dont have the recipt, no box.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my sister and have used It on her hair [and my hair]. it works pretty well on both hair types. she has coarse wavy hair and I have medium/fine extremely curly hair. I have a hard time finding a product that has been able to smooth my cuticle down as well as this item. I am glad I went with the more expensive turbo, although there are products that get hotter, this product works well. It is now about 8 months old and gets used REGULARLY!</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year.  The iron stopped working.  I thought, \\&quot;Great!  Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!\\&quot;  After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet.  This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron.  DO NOT BUY!!  WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li> I used to have a basic CHI and it worked pretty well so I ordered this one thinking it would be better because it has temperature controls. Unfortunately, it only goes to 350degrees and apparently that is not hot enough. It doesn&#x27;t keep the frizz away and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stick straight--only \\&quot;not frizzy\\&quot;. I&#x27;m bummed I spent so much on this one and it doesn&#x27;t do what I want.</li>
            <li> The product is great, and I recieved it i great condition.  However, it did take a little longer than I had hoped for.  I recieved it on the last day of the estimated arrival time.  Other than that everything was great!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s used it for the past 4 weeks since I bought it for her and raves every time about how much nicer it is than any of the cheap version hair straighteners she&#x27;s had in the past.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best one out there, but it&#x27;s sure made my wife a happy woman, and that&#x27;s ALWAYS a good thing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat Iron! I&#x27;ve been flat ironing my hair for years and this is the first flat Iron I&#x27;ve had that makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve just left the salon. It is a big money and time saver. No more going to the salon and having my hair done and then paying the salon price. I am one happy woman!</li>
            <li> This is the second Chi I have ever had and highly recommend it to any hair straightner user!!!!  Worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product back in March of this year and it hasn&#x27;t even been 4 months and it quit working!!!!</li>
            <li> the product really smooths and softens the hair. especially good for the hair types of african American&#x27;s</li>
            <li> i bought this item in early april. it&#x27;s now mid-july and the thing just quit working. i went to turn it on the other day and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. so that&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on something that worked for 3 and half months! the store wouldn&#x27;t return it either since you can only return things within 30 days! don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron.  A friend had this very one and I liked the fact that it has the felt on the outside so you can hold the iron as you lead it through your hair.  I had gotten a Paul Mitchell iron and it got even hotter than the CHI.  I could barely touch it and it made my hair have static.  I had to take that one back.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems as yet and am enjoying my purchase!</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on this iron but had my doubts that it was the iron for me. It&#x27;s got many positive points: It gets hot fast for people in a hurry (like me); It hasn&#x27;t heat damaged my hair at all; It&#x27;s easy to get the back of my head with the cord. I have curls in the back and straight hair in the front. It makes my entire head of hair appear like it has the same texture. I have already recommended it to my friends! It also came faster than they even predicted in the confirmation email!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  It&#x27;s my second Chi Turbo - the first was a 2\\&quot;, but 1\\&quot; is better for shorter hair.  I have used the 2\\&quot; for over 3 years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> After asking several people what kind of straight iron works the best, I purchased the CHI &amp; love it. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but have found that it works really well. Heats up quickly &amp; straightens my hair very easily. I was afraid I&#x27;d spend a lot of money &amp; then get something that barely worked. I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009V1YRS Farouk CHI GF1538 Turbo Regular 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]  Bought this as a gift and feedback is definitely 5 stars. Time doing hair went from 20 minutes down to less than 5 minutes. Definitely worth the price for that smile.</li>
            <li> I purchased this August 13th and got it a week later and it worked great until this morning, 12/26/08.  It will not heat up now and I did not even use this daily!  For the $100 it is not worth purchasing for only  4 months usage...my advise find something of better value.  I will not be purchasing a CHI again.   I called Amazon&#x27;s customer service and they will only take care of this matter in the first 30 days, so I&#x27;m not impressed with Amazon&#x27;s customer service...and I think I was speaking to someone in India.  I could not understand him and it seemed he was calling from far away.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair straightener my wife will use. She was given the one from TV and one from the mall with the various different attachments and gimmicks and none of them worked for her. I recommend getting this one from the start and saving some money.</li>
            <li> The cord is so long it tends to get in the way. And the bottom rest should be flat instead of curved, because it keeps falling over.</li>
            <li> This CHI only lasted about 6 months. It did get hot enough to straighten my coarse hair. I wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This is my second CHI flat iron.  The first one I purchased from a salon probably 10 years ago &amp; actually gave it to my niece who is still using it.  This one is a bit hotter, the contoured handle makes it easier to maneuver &amp; the swivel cord is great.  I have thick, coarse long hair which MUST be flat ironed.  Fortunately I can get away with washing it two - three times a week otherwise I think I would have to cut it off.  If you&#x27;ve tried other flat irons in the past &amp; have been discouraged I would certainly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I bought mine literally 5 years ago, and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this flat iron as it is a 100 percent FAKE!  I have an authentic Chi flat iron to compare it to and this one does NOT heat up (I could touch it with my finger), the red velvet looks like it is glued on (in fact, it was peeling off after one use), the ceramic plates do NOT float (move loosely when you push on them), the power chord is not the advertised 10-feet long (it was 6 feet), and it is light weight and cheap looking.  It evens &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap when you pick it up.  In addition, it sticks to your hair.  It is a complete waste of money!  An authentic Chi is FANTASTIC.  Just make sure you purchase one from an authorized Beauty Supply Store.  Keep in mind that if you buy a Chi on-line, the manufacturer guarantee fromFarouk Systems is invalid.  Thank goodness that Amazon refunded my $200 (they are the best on-line store in the world!).  Do not buy this item!</li>
            <li> I bought this item more than 7 years and been worked fine. No trouble and issue so far. It can work with a little bit wet hair.</li>
            <li> i am finally enlightened!  after purchasing 5  various CHI straighten irons (over the past 4 years or so) i have realized... it&#x27;s NOT JUST ME.  every one of these 1 star reviews have been my exact experience.  the CHI irons work well for awhile then nothing, in each case i thought it was something i did.  thank goodness i didn&#x27;t waste the time or energy persuing  a refund, it seems fruitless and frustrating.  well, the time has come and i need another one, i will looking elsewhere.  NO MORE CHI for me.</li>
            <li> before it shorted out. Must admit that for the price we paid I am little surprised. It looked to be in new condition at the time of failure, wasn&#x27;t dropped or damaged in any way.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavy hair and have always been really frustrated with trying to blow dry it straight.  I bought a similar, cheaper straightening iron, and it did nothing at all for my hair.  I recently got my hair cut to just below my shoulders, and the waves got even worse!  So I finally broke down and spent the big bucks on the Chi.  I am so glad that I did!  It works beautifully.  Previously, I spent 30+ minutes trying to blow dry my hair straight, and now I just blow dry it quickly and use the Chi on my hair in layered sections.  It&#x27;s even easy for me to use it on the back of my head, which is usually very hard.  My hair is now extremely straight, and I just use it for quick touch-ups in the morning between washings.  I just can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  Don&#x27;t even waste your money on anything else.  Just go ahead and buy the Chi -- you&#x27;ll be so happy that you did!</li>
            <li> This product is a salon quality product.  It takes my wavy hair and very quickly makes it straight.  Hasn&#x27;t damaged or dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Several of my friends had bought Chi flat irons, so I decided to take the plunge last month.  I have wavey hair that &#x27;grows&#x27; with the humidity, so I was not expecting too much.  I was surprised and have been very pleased with the results of this straightener.  My favorite aspect of it is the adjustable temp controls.  If you are looking for a good quality straightener, this is definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product and a terrible company .... Amazon is great but if you buy this here, and when (not if) it breaks, you are 100% out of luck. Farouk will ignore you. I just called them about my defective flat iron and they were nasty. I have had this for 7 months ...  Be sure that whatever you buy it is not made by Farouk ... Others have had this same problem. I should have read them first ..</li>
            <li> probably one of the best and most heavy duty straighteners that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  A good friend had one and used it on my hair - it makes it soo straight so fast - plus it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  It&#x27;s so shiny!  This is def. a must have for working girls with short hair who are on the go - I can straighten my spikey, unruly hair in less than 5 minutes with this straightener.  The velvet on the top is nice for when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to burn my fingers.  The cord won&#x27;t tangle up either - all around - GREAT buy!  VERY happy.  Would buy it all over again.</li>
            <li> When this product works it works well, however I have purchased more than five of them in the past two years. Repeatedly I have experienced them to have electrical problems which is very frustrating. Amazon is awesome about replacing it if malfunction occurs within 30 days but GOOD LUCK in getting Farouk to fix or replace it. I have called them repeatedly and they just refuse to call back. When I did finally reach someone they told me that even though the iron had broken in a week they would not fix it because I had purchased it online and they would not guarantee it.</li>
            <li> It is a really good flat iron! I hope it will last me for a really long time! I&#x27;m kind of hesitant about the fact that CHI is going to start distributing via Target... :/</li>
            <li> This morning my CHI simply would not turn on, even after pressing the reset button and trying multiple outlets.  I&#x27;m returning it to amazon and going back to the FHI iron.  (I&#x27;ve had a FHI for 2.5 yrs and while it is still working fine, wanted a new one on hand in case it dies one of these days.)  I would not recommend the CHI.</li>
            <li> Alright so I got my Chi Turbo for Christmas. At first I was super excited and than I talked to a hairstylist who told me that the CHI turbo has 2x the amount of problems as the origianl often not heating up even close to the ORIGINAL CHI. I figured oh well mine was great had no problems. Now we are 5 days later and when I went to use my CHI turbo this morning it&#x27;s barely even heated up enough to be hot to the touch. So luckily I still have my receipt and I am bringing back to TARGET and getting a full refund. I am than going to TRADE SECRETS which offers a LIFETIME warrenty on their CHI products. So if you have a trade secrets near you I would highly reccomend buying your product there. I did however LOVE THE PRODUCT. It&#x27;s still a product I would highly suggest however would NOT spend the extra money just because it says it&#x27;s a turbo, they did something right when they created the origianl something they have yet been able to top. I would say that this product is well worth the money as long as you get a warrenty to insure your product.</li>
            <li> I love my CHI! I have been lusting after one for years as all of my hairdresser friends use them and I know they are the best! I finally bought one (and was able to rationalize the cost) but it is so worth the money- I have long curly hair and this is fast and easy and I feel like it doesnt damage my hair like the cheaper ones do (Ceramic is better heat source and it doesn&#x27;t snag and tear my hair like the cheaper ones do.)&lt;br /&gt;NO complaints!</li>
            <li> Product was received on expected date of delivery.  Product was new, in original packaging and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work that well for such a low price but it actually works great. I love it. It makes my hair super straight and soft.</li>
            <li> They took my $20 for expedited shipping and sent it ground.  It took 2 weeks to arrived.  I told them I wanted a refund for my shipping expense and they did not respond to my conplaint.I rate customer service as bad although the product was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best ever. I have used it for over a month now and I love it. The adjustable temperature is great no more split ends. My hair looks much softer. No chance of burning ears or fingers unless you actually touch the inner part of iron. Easy to control, mistake proof(other irons caused ridges not this one) I have used many different brands this one tops them all. I would highly recommend this iron, don&#x27;t hesitate buy it now!!!!!</li>
            <li> This item works just as promised. I would highly recommend the CHI Turbo. I had a low end flat iron that never seemed to get the frizz out of my hair. With the CHI I get the frizz out in one try. I LOVE the CHI!</li>
            <li> this has all the features that you want in an iron, also flips and curls!  produces incredible shine!</li>
            <li> I bought the CHI after using a Revlon flat iron for 3-years. The CHI gets a lot hotter than my old iron. I really like that its light and more compact than my old one. The only thing that&#x27;s weird is there is red felt on the outside of it. When I looked at the photo I saw the red but thought it was plastic. I just hope that the felt doesn&#x27;t come off over time.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair straightener for a couple weeks now.  It definitely works really good, I wish the temp went a little higher.  The max is 360 degrees which works fine on normal days but could use a little extra boost when the humidity is up.  I haven&#x27;t figured out how to curl my hair with it yet without leaving a crimp at the ends.  Overall i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s classic chi blew a couple of months ago so I decided to surprise her with the chi turbo. After reading reviews I found that the chi turbo is great for women with thick and/or a lot of hair. I don&#x27;t know the specifics of straightening hair, but I do know TIME. Her hair is the way she wants it in about half the time it took her with the classic chi. I&#x27;ve also noticed her hair stays straight for a longer period of time. She was happy with the classic chi, but she&#x27;s even more happy with the turbo chi.</li>
            <li> Asked a model and received a different and more expensive and doesn&#x27;t work now, and charge in my credit card more than I authorize</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1&amp;#34;CHI Turbo Microchip Ceramic Hairstyling Iron over 8 years ago to help manage my daughter&#x27;s unruly hair and it is still going strong.  Easy to use, straightens hair well and still performs as well as it did when it was new.  I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I still believe that CHI makes the best straighteners. This one heats up easily, and slides through my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This straightener, while pricey makes my hair feel silky and straightens great.  It works effortlessly. I would recommend CHI straighteners to anyone looking for a premium brand.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these and they are very expensive  and they do not seem to last over a year.  You would think for the cost of them they would last longer.  I have bought other curling irons and they last much longer</li>
            <li> My daughter tried a friend&#x27;s CHI and asked for one quite awhile before I bit the bullet on the price. My daughter&#x27;s hair is naturally curly and although other straighteners would take out the curl, they did not make the hair smooth. She loves how the CHI smooths her hair and it stays soft until she washes it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron because my ten year old chi died, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or look of my old chi turbo the velcro already came off and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling good like my old iron did,</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a late Christmas gift.  Requested for a gift message which DID NOT happen--bummer #1.  It arrived, and to our disappointment, the thing just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to properly work.  Her hair is fine &amp; has a slight natural wave with a tendency to get frizzy without tools or product to help, and any straightener she has used in the past has been able to get her hair nice &amp; straight fairly easily, until now--bummer #2.  The packaging itself was horrible--the boxed iron had no support in the Amazon shipping box; it had plenty of room to be banged around during the shipping process (perhaps contributing to the cause of it not being able to get hot?)--bummer #3.  So, this has been returned to Amazon for a refund--hopefully there will be no issues with that.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has this hair iron.  When on vacation I used it alot.  And fell in love with it. It made my hair so straight and KEPT it straight even through all the humidity. So when i got home i ordered it from Amazon.  It worked great for 1 month and then all of a sudden it just stopped working all together.  I called Amazon and they said no refunds and to call the manufacture of the iron.  I called them and said that the guarantee is not valid if purchased online.  There was nothing they could do.  I called Amazon back and told them and asked for some help, but they just pretty much told me there was NOTHING they could do.  Now i am stuck with this $100 hair iron that is good for nothing.  So beware when purchasing this product.  If you decide to, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I am not very please with this item and was sent ridculous return guidelines from the seller so I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I have owned all types of straighteners, and regardless of the price they all did the same thing....straightened my hair with incredibly high heat (which I thought I needed, because my hair is very curly and very thick!) while burning it at the same time.  The Chi straightener is AMAZING, it straightens it with the type of heat my hair needs but doesn&#x27;t burn it at all.  It can straighten as well as style.  My hair has volume, which with the other straighteners it didn&#x27;t!  My hair feels so soft, and it looks amazing.  The best 100 dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I had the older version &amp; this one seems to work better.  I highly recommend the chi, they are sooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love my new Chi. I have been wanting one for years but hard to spend the money. All my friends said it is worth it. So I finally bought one on Amazon at a much cheaper price then the Beauty Stores. It is worth every cent!! It heats up super fast and my hair looks so silky. I can even use it as a curling iron. I prefered the Turbo for the Velvet part and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Purchased the turbo model for my daughter as her original CHI quit working due to electrical problems (which seem to be pretty common).  I should note that we do use a salon cord protector but still experienced problems.  This turbo model does NOT get hot enough and in fact we believed it to be defective so sent it back to Amazon, the iron temp never got anywhere near the advertised level.  Farouk does not stand behind their warranty very well and are very rude to deal with.  I reordered the original CHI for her, I just hope it lasts longer than the first one, when you spend this kind of money for an iron, it would be nice to feel you got what you paid for.  When these work, they work well...but Farouk has lousy customer service and the only reason I purchased this brand again is at my daughter&#x27;s insistence.</li>
            <li> ive had one before but after 7 years the cord got damaged, so i bought another one and the price was cheaper than at the store and it arrived on scheduled day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for fifteen years and I have to say this straightener is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a straightener, so I didn&#x27;t buy one when all my friends were raving about it.  Now that I have one, I understand all the hoopla.  It really works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters &amp; I have one of these, one daughter has blond hair &amp; a little wavy, the other&#x27;s is dark, thick &amp; wavy and mine is somewhat gray very wavy and this flat iron does a great job we can all have stick straight hair if we want in no time at all, heats up quick and is just as quick in straightening, anyone with any type of hair would benefit..and when I ordered the flat iron I received it in a few days...thanks</li>
            <li> I am greatly please with my Chi Turbo product. I have tried other flat irons in the past and none have compared with the results I get from the Farouk Chi. It was definitely worth the money and I consider it one of my best investments. I appreciate and trust the products I purchase from Amazon, for I am never disappointed and always receive the items in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product and thought it was the excellent kind in the market. I really liked the way it glides on my hair leaving it silky, shiny and straight protecting it against the moisture and humidity. It worked wonders on my hair until yesterday when it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I wish it lasted longer though. After reading the reviews of other customers and from my personal experience I am going to try a different one next time.&lt;br /&gt;I got the straightener from ULTA, apparently an authorized dealer. I am sending the product back to Farouk systems Inc with a $15 USD for return shipping charges. Let us see how long the new one is going to last. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I am very disappointed and I need more value for my money.</li>
            <li> I owned a chi before this one for about 4 years and dropped it one too many times and the plate came completely off.  This new Chi iron I purchased is different from my old one due to the fact that you can control the temperature and the red velvet like fabric around it has a firm grip of the hair when you want curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I bought this in 2008 and now its almost 2013.  I dropped my chi flat iron about a gazillion times and its still working as good as day one.  I use it everyday. Very much worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair is thick, wavy and long and within about 10 minutes it makes my hair smooth, bone straight, shiny and silky. I have owned the exact same model for use in the UK for 2 years and it&#x27;s been brilliant, and I recently bought this US one to use while I&#x27;m visiting my family in the States.  That&#x27;s how highly I rate it... I just can&#x27;t go a couple of weeks without it.</li>
            <li> This one I bought as a gift for my daughter.  I have one myself, same model, that I&#x27;ve had for 3 years now.  No problems, so far.  It has outlasted several other brands my family has used.  I would not hesitate recommending this model to anyone.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the best!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter because I have heard and read so many rave reviews about it.  While it works well enough, I don&#x27;t think it works that much better than the $25.00 ones we already owned. It heats up quickly and does straighten hair, but again, I and my daughter did not find that it straightened hair better and did not find it worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is just like the one my local stylist sales but at a reduced rate. I have thick curly hair and with this flat iron I end up with smooth silky straight hair! Just make sure you spray your hair with a protectant before you start.</li>
            <li> The Chi is supposed to be the best hair straightener out there.  I haven&#x27;t ever used anything else so I can&#x27;t really compare, but I really like this product.  Here the price was excellent.  They can sell for over 150 dollars elsewhere and this one was 89.  I would also recommend this model over others that do not have a temperature control.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for each of my daughters (two total).  My daughters knew these were really expensive flatirons and were very careful to not wind the cord around the unit or kink it in any way.  After 6 months one of them seemed to acquire a short in the cord and would only work sporadically.  No problem, I thought, it&#x27;s still under warranty.  I called Farouk and they REFUSED to honor the warranty stating that I had bought it online and, therefore, that voided out their warranty!  The customer service rep said if I would have read the warranty I would have seen this.  I pointed out to her that this would have been impossible since I didn&#x27;t have the warranty to read until I had already bought the product.  Her response was that I could have gone to their website and read the warranty before I bought it!  Who does that?  So, although the product itself is wonderful when it works, I would caution everyone against doing business with this company.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of flat irons and this one is the best hands down. It heats up quickly and evenly and gets my hair as straight as my stylist does. I was hesitant on spending this much for a flat iron, but it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Although the Chi is supposed to be the best in hair straighteners, I have had difficulty using it and am returning to my old flat iron.  The Chi straightened my hair so much that it would just stick straight out and I could not control it to get the look I wanted.  I am NOT saying that its quality is bad, or that it is a bad product; I am simply saying that I had difficulty using it successfully and have decided it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> oh my god! i can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing this product is! it made my hair so much healthier, shinier, softer, silkier, everything! i dont know how i lived without it! everyone noticed and thought i had gotten my hair done at the salon! i can curl, straighten, flip, wave, do anything to my hair and all in record timing! this is DEFINITELY worth the money! it is easy and quick to use and makes any hair perfect! i have tried it on 4 of my friends, 1 of them with the most damaged hair i&#x27;ve ever seen, and every single one of them has now bought one for themself, no joke!    BUY THE CHI!</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for five years already and it still works great. The only thing is that the felt is starting to come off but other than that the iron works great. My hair is pretty curly and i can straighten really quickly. Currently my hair is a little bit past shoulder length and i can straighten it in half an hour. I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome straightening iron!!  My sisters purchased one first, I used it and loved it.  Then my friend got one, and finally I have my own. My hair is wavy, but my friends hair is very curly, and we both are able to achieve silky straight hair with this iron, thanks to the temperature control.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this product looks real but when I got it shipped it ended up being a fake, the \\&quot;velvet red parts\\&quot; look like they were glued on and the product did not get hot at all, ended up wasting money on this! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I purchased two 5 years ago still greats as the first day! It helps a lot for a perfect straight hair finish. Not harsh on hair. Definitively reccomended</li>
            <li> The Turbi Chi arrived in the expected time, but when I gave it as a Christmas gift we immediately noticed that the light was not in the correct position then when it was plugged in it did not work properly. We were able to return the Chi and did receive a refund within a few weeks. The main reason I have given a low rating is because I paid for shipping both ways which should have been reimbursed as well since the product never worked.</li>
            <li> I have had this for three years. i love it. I used it often for a long time. now I dont use it more then 2-3 a month but it has never given me any trouble. we moved overseas (220v instead of 110v in the USA) and i am using it with a converter now and no problems at all. very nice product.</li>
            <li> Have had this straightening iron for 5 years and is still the best product I&#x27;ve had. Well worth the money.</li>
