            <li>A nice color, be aware if it is the right nude for your skin, it is too browny for my skin and doesn&#x27;t look like a good nude for me.</li>

            <li> THIS is the nude color I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time!</li>
            <li> i was slightly nervous about buying it, however, because the picture if obviously not &#x27;don&#x27;t pretzel my buttons&#x27;, so i felt i was taking a risk and may end up with that other color.</li>
            <li> This arrived and had partially leaked out of the bottle, and it was extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only thing is you need at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> added a nail polish thinner to improve the consistency which made it better but still not where I think it should be.&lt;br /&gt;Shame, I was going to use this as a base coat for glitters.</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> colour on the little picture here is completely wrong</li>

            <li> Obviously the color pictured is incorrect, but I received the correct polish. Delivery was estimated between the 31st and the 5th and it arrived on the 1st.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a manicure with this color and fell in love, so I just had to buy it!</li>
            <li> Love opi, but this color looks much lighter than in the pic, I still love it though on days I don&#x27;t feel like having a lot of color, it is sheer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the market for the *PERFECT* shade of nude/beige for a while and I found it. LOVE &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Pretzel My Buttons&amp;#34;. Great, high quality OPI polish, as expected!</li>
            <li> I love this color, it applies very smooth, and evenly. Two coats are enough, you do not need to layer and layer to see the color. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> A nice color, be aware if it is the right nude for your skin, it is too browny for my skin and doesn&#x27;t look like a good nude for me.</li>

            <li> Great nailpolish.  This color is soft and neutral with a great shine.  OPI - the best!!!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. Put a top coat on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour on the little picture here is completely wrong</li>
            <li> This color was recommended by my manicurist. I&#x27;m a simple chick. I normally wear Lincoln in the Dark but she suggested this color because I have healthy nails. I don&#x27;t have acrylic or do shellac.  I get so many compliments with this color. It&#x27;s professional looking and simple. I still wear the Lincoln on my toes but Don&#x27;t Pretzel My Buttons is it.</li>
            <li> THIS is the nude color I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time! Yes!  Closest I&#x27;ve come to is &amp;#34;Bubble Bath&amp;#34; applied in several coats.  I am sticking with this color for as long as OPI makes it.</li>
            <li> Very nice color. Perfect nude. Long lasting. Quick shipping. I&#x27;ve had it on my nails for almost a week now and there is barely any chipping. Definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, earthy color!!!! Gives nails a lovely healthy natural look!!!! Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color! It is rich, trendy and lasts without chipping! LOVE LOVE LOVE! I highly recommend this color if you are looking for something new or simply love nude tones</li>
            <li> I used this color at the nail salon. Found it on amazon and ordered. Fast &amp; easy! Didn&#x27;t have to look all over town for it.</li>
            <li> I love this color and OPI polishes. It is one of my favorites and I always get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s super cute!!  Only thing is you need at least 3 coats. Cute neutral color. In my top five.</li>
            <li> Great color for the summer</li>
            <li> i am so happy with this nail polish. i did my online searching and this is where i found it the cheapest. i was slightly nervous about buying it, however, because the picture if obviously not &#x27;don&#x27;t pretzel my buttons&#x27;, so i felt i was taking a risk and may end up with that other color. but i did get the correct color (the color in the listing title), and i love love love it.</li>
