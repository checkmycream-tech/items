            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many soaps irritate it.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, the original Dove soap is great but the other soaps and lotions leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li>This particular box of Dove is great value as long as you buy it as an add-on and have Prime.  </li>
            <li>There may not be a better natural moisturizing ingredient than shea butter.</li>
            <li>I use lotion every morning but with this soap it&#x27;s ok if I don&#x27;t have the time because my skin will be smooth and soft even without lotion, not dry!</li>
            <li>My current favorite scent of Dove bar soap.</li>

            <li>My favirite soap  Fast response to my order.</li>
            <li>After hearing much praise from my dermatologist, I joined the cult and started to purchase Dove as well.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that the makers of Dove at last created this beauty bar as I use it exclusively on my face and this particular blend is better than any of the previous formulae.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this soap is not as good as the original Dove in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I decided to try some other Dove products including this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the Dove soap it makes my skin soft and supple and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin either.</li>
            <li>Dove is smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li>My skin is super dry this winter</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the Shea Butter and Vanilla body wash, so I searched for other Dove products with the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It has the normal soft smoothness that you expect from Dove</li>
            <li>i have to be SUPER careful when washing with it.</li>
            <li>Im sure it&#x27;ll happen one day since thats so hard to prevent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal Dove soap user, but have since gone with some of the other fruity and floral fragrances.</li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin and all of hese prducts work well on me.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and</li>
            <li>I thought this soap would be a bit on the natural side since it was shea butter</li>
            <li>This is by far</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not very appealing and this soapbos not as sudsy or creamy as the original.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something more subtle.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove soap for 20 years mainly because deodorant soaps dried my skin out..</li>
            <li> If you have any type of dry skin issues, try this extra moisturizing soap.  </li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin and living in the Northeast, I usually have to use a lot of lotions during winter.</li>
            <li> Does not leave the skin dry like other dove soaps.</li>
            <li> Not really the Shea butter scent that you thing it is going to be.</li>
            <li> If you like dove and really do not care that you smell like a candle then this if for you.</li>
            <li> Been using Dove since I was a kid, and hate using any other kind of soap.</li>
            <li> I also tried some of the highly rated Dove lotions and was not very impressed with those products either.</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint about it.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> So I usually replenish my soap supply from these stores</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that my mom will use but it is so hard to find and expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like seriously obsessed with the smell of this soap</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> What could be bad?</li>
            <li> I hate bar soap</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is just wonderful and it does soften and nourish my skin. It feels creamy going on the skin, and smells like a spa. I will continue to use this brand, and this scent of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always LOVED this soap, it&#x27;s convenient, and at the right price!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the scent, but delivery was great.</li>
            <li> Great scent ! And 6 bars are a good number to have.</li>
            <li> I always love Dove soap and this one reminds me of my lotion i use to use. shea butter is amazing for your skin and the deal is good! I like buying stuff in packs to save</li>
            <li> I hate bar soap but this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> I like dove, but buying a 6 bar pack you kind of get tired of the same smell.  I will not buy a 6 pack again.  But good soap overall!</li>
            <li> I love the way Dove Shea Butter Moisturizing Cream Beauty Bar smells and it makes my skin soft, never tight feeling</li>
            <li> My current favorite scent of Dove bar soap. Yes I&#x27;m satisfied, esp. Since I didn&#x27;t have to stand on line at a big box store to get it..Go Amazon, huge fan. Please don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> This soap make my skin so soft it feels like I&#x27;m using a skin moisturizer. I recommend this to anyone that wants a gentle but moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> If you have any type of dry skin issues, try this extra moisturizing soap.  There may not be a better natural moisturizing ingredient than shea butter.</li>
            <li> Smells SOOOO wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I was never a fan of this moisturizing soap. My skin is super dry this winter so thought id try it. Worked VERY well!&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint about it. It makes me tub SUPER slippery! I can EASILY fall i have to be SUPER careful when washing with it. Im sure it&#x27;ll happen one day since thats so hard to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;So buyer use caution. Besides that AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that my mom will use but it is so hard to find and expensive. It is very good and keep the skin moisturized, it also helps with all skin tones and types and it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have totally switched to all dove products. Shampoo, conditioner and soap. I have sensitive skin and all of hese prducts work well on me.</li>
            <li> I love the Dove soap it makes my skin soft and supple and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin either. I love that it also smells good as well.</li>
            <li> Dove is smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove soap for 20 years mainly because deodorant soaps dried my skin out.. Dove is easy on the skjn and it smells great too. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Shea Butter and Vanilla body wash, so I searched for other Dove products with the same ingredients.  I absolutely love the fragrance, and every woman knows Dove soap is the best!  :-)</li>
            <li> Great smell, great feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like seriously obsessed with the smell of this soap it smells so amazing and refreshing at the same time.</li>
            <li> We live in a very dry climate. This is a wonderful soap lots of moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that the makers of Dove at last created this beauty bar as I use it exclusively on my face and this particular blend is better than any of the previous formulae.  The scent is caramel and makes my bathroom smell great - I have taken it all out of the boxes and put it in my linen cupboard.  It has the normal soft smoothness that you expect from Dove but then some - it seems more like an old fashioned cold cream than soap and I do find that anything else makes my skin sting. This particular box of Dove is great value as long as you buy it as an add-on and have Prime.  Cheaper than anywhere else I was able to scope out.  The product is nicely packed to avoid any transit damage and everything sent is recyclable.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! Finally one that lathers enough that I can shave with - and no skin irritation after shaving! I use lotion every morning but with this soap it&#x27;s ok if I don&#x27;t have the time because my skin will be smooth and soft even without lotion, not dry!</li>
            <li> My favirite soap  Fast response to my order.</li>
            <li> Great stuff with extra care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last longer than just regular dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the stuff and perfer this soap the best.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and it&#x27;s cheap it&#x27;s really good if you like nice smelly stuff then you will like it very much lol</li>
            <li> Good leave feeling good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how it leaves my body.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ever. The smell of shea butter and vanilla is delicious, it moisturizes and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. It does its job. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice feel after using. Your skin will not squeak with over dryness. Pleasant smell. Nice rich lather. I use it after swimming to get rid of the chlorine odor. Regular Dove is also good, but i just like the mild Shea butter smell. Makes the shower joy.</li>
            <li> Does not leave the skin dry like other dove soaps. It has good smell and actually moisturises the skin. I would use it in winters.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap just like the coconut milk scent by Dove. Will continue buying this scent by Dove along with the coconut milk kind. It is moisturizing and the scent last on the skin up til one hour later.</li>
            <li> Not really the Shea butter scent that you thing it is going to be. Leaves you smelling like you slept in a Yankee Candle Store overnight. It is Dove, keeps the skin smooth and hydrated though. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. If you like dove and really do not care that you smell like a candle then this if for you.</li>
            <li> Nourishing Care Shea Butter Moisturizing Cream Beauty Bar is great.  Only soap I would use and it doesn&#x27;t clod  my drains.  You feel clean and soft after using this soap.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in store. Good soap with a neutral scent, which I prefer. Comparable price for the convenience of online.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is breathtaking. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the vanilla or the Shea butter but when I&#x27;m in the shower I feel like I&#x27;m in one of those garnier fruitis commercials. I take even longer showers now. Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if you aren&#x27;t allergic to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Heavy scent, smells good but I wanted something more subtle. I&#x27;m a loyal Dove soap user, but have since gone with some of the other fruity and floral fragrances.</li>
            <li> I thought this soap would be a bit on the natural side since it was shea butter but I was wrong. The smell is pretty nauseating for my taste. Used it up but will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin and living in the Northeast, I usually have to use a lot of lotions during winter. These soap feels rich and the shea butter leave my skin well moisturized without feeling greasy. The soap smells great, not too feminine for a guy to use.  The price is also slightly better than CVS.</li>
            <li> My mom has sworn by Dove since I was a kid. After hearing much praise from my dermatologist, I joined the cult and started to purchase Dove as well. I have very sensitive skin and many soaps irritate it. This is by far my favorite Dove soap due to the fact that it smells pleasant and makes my skin feel soft and clean without irritation.</li>
            <li> I love Dove soap. It&#x27;s the only bar soap I use. Though I purchased it to fill an order for free shipping, the price was good and I can always use extra Dove.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Been using Dove since I was a kid, and hate using any other kind of soap.</li>
            <li> I love dove soap and it came in right away. It was a little bit cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> i love the creaminess of the soap and how it makes my skin feel (and smell) after my shower.  It does everything it promises and has the scent that I love.  What could be bad?</li>
            <li> I am a soap lover and I found that Ross and Marshall stores carry a healthy supply of quality soaps from all over the world. So I usually replenish my soap supply from these stores but recently my mom bought some original Dove soap to my house which I used and was very pleased with the creamy silky feeling I got when showering. I was so pleased that I decided to try some other Dove products including this soap.  Unfortunately this soap is not as good as the original Dove in my opinion. The fragrance is not very appealing and this soapbos not as sudsy or creamy as the original. I am used to high quality soaps and French milled soaps so I know good soap when I use one. I also tried some of the highly rated Dove lotions and was not very impressed with those products either. In conclusion, the original Dove soap is great but the other soaps and lotions leave much to be desired.</li>
