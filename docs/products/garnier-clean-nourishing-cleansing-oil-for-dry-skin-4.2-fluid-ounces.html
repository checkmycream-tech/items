            <li>This is one of my favorite cleansing oils!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Then, I take a warm wash cloth and just wipe it off.  </li>
            <li>I use mineral foundation and it cleans it all off nicely.  </li>
            <li>This has been working nicely for me as a cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This came onto the market, so I decided to give it a try before attempting to mix my own oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is how much I liked the it.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The oil&#x27;s fragrance is really nice, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I originally found on Pinterest as a great cleanser to help remove makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, removes face makeup great, and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about this cleansing oil, I was hoping for the best, but wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is my favorite part of this honestly.</li>
            <li>the product is OK</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice and light.</li>
            <li>This has made it&#x27;s way into my morning and night routine and has become one of my most favorite products.</li>
            <li>it runs $24-$30 depending on how many royalty points i have for a discount.</li>
            <li>It smells better and works well,plus it leaves skin feeling hydrated from the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see Garnier&#x27;s was more affordable</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>(could try the 4oz, but I found the 8oz a more stable width).</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing oil removes my eye makeup better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>love this product, repurchasing on Amazon and leaving this comment.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it removes my eye makeup without fussing over cotton balls and Qtips.</li>
            <li>During the day, I had a healthy glow but never felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t had a pimple for a while now, and I noticed more blackheads too.</li>
            <li>I was sure it was this cleanser, so I stopped using it immediately.</li>
            <li>Love this product but the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>This oil by Garnier works better than coconut oil because of the way it rinses cleaner.</li>
            <li>After just one use, most of my problems were gone.</li>
            <li>It is extremely better than lotion, as it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before going to bed to get make sure all my makeup is gone.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Garnier cleansing oil, so I gave it a try hoping for a more convenient product.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin nicely moist &amp; smooth, not at all oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty brand-loyal, and I have used and loved the Garnier hair products for awhile.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and pleasant scent (5 stars).</li>
            <li>Putting an oil on my face didn&#x27;t seem like the greatest idea because even though I do have dry skin, I didn&#x27;t want to give up my moisturizing routine.  </li>
            <li>I will say that regardless of the time of year, it does an excellent job of removing waterproof makeup, but if I was putting on a full face of foundation, I would need to double cleanse to remove all the makeup from my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the pump but a travel size with a different top would be great for when I got out of town.</li>
            <li>So easy to wash my face at night with this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil, which I really like but takes a while to receive from Korea.</li>
            <li>Mineral oil is the main oil listed which isn&#x27;t good for cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>fragrance was strong, it reminded me of hairspray.</li>
            <li>It washes off fine</li>
            <li>Putting oil on my face was a huge leap of faith, as I&#x27;ve been having a fight with zits for about 20 years.  </li>
            <li>so I could take it with me while I travel without it making a huge oily</li>
            <li>Price was appealing but the need to remove the tackiness afterwards isn&#x27;t worth the $7-8 price.&lt;br /&gt;Shisedo</li>
            <li>Great facial oil.</li>
            <li>i really hope this continues to work for me because as of right now i love this product!</li>
            <li>Add water to emulsify, lather and rinse clean.</li>
            <li>While it takes off mascara, I won&#x27;t be using full strength on my eyes.</li>
            <li>so coats the face and lashes more gently to prevent breakage...</li>
            <li>Had to get the full size.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been happy with their other products that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is super moisterizing and takes my makeup off with ease.</li>
            <li>and i can not believe have much clearer and clean my face looks!</li>
            <li>It is mildly scented, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very fruity, not bad, just too strong for my preference.</li>
            <li>I would normally have to use my free samples of DHC cleansing oil,now i NO longer have to do that!</li>
            <li>well worth the money for the product and fresh clean feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>After I used this, I noticed it took off most of my makeup (only a bit of mascara left) and it smells soooo good.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, &amp; I have been able to use this with no problems.  </li>
            <li>DHC Cleansing Oil washes off clean and leaves the face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>soft, smooth, and so clean, I can&#x27;t help but tell everyone I see to buy some.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin clean and very moist</li>
            <li>Plus it is GREAT as makeup remover, no more waking up with bits of yesterday&#x27;s mascara in my pores.</li>
            <li>Helps tremendously with hydration while removing makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and easily removes my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>It removes makeup and dirt quickly, easily and completely.</li>
            <li>I have normal/ dry skin, and I love how it makes my skin look &amp; feel incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(For consideration, my skin is 30 years old, very fair with some redness, sensitive, mostly dry, with a somewhat oily nose).</li>
            <li>I normally use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil and was trying to look for a more budget friendly alternative.</li>
            <li>a cleanser it sit on top of the skin rather than obsorb into the skin and even a tiny bit is problematic in removing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I missed the first ingredient in this product.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is great and it&#x27;s so easy to use-because you put it on dry skin with dry hands, there&#x27;s none of that pre-wetting with water step that you have to do with normal cleansers.</li>
            <li>howerever,  I do use it as the first step in my skincare as a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this at Walxxxxns and thought to myself for around $8, I am gonna give this a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used many before this but could never remove all -see residue the next morning under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My one flaky patch was gone, and my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>Oil cleansing is a bit of an art form that is supposed to use certain oils, this one does not have all the right oils in it.</li>
            <li>I love it, actually.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped control his oily skin, and he rarely has a pimple now.  </li>
            <li>Try it, you can feel the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for removing stubborn make up &amp; for leaving your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really really soft and I&#x27;m excited about it.  </li>
            <li>With that being said I can&#x27;t compare this to other oil cleansers but I am re-ordering this for a 2nd time, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>Garnier really moisturized after the first use.</li>
            <li>This product caught my attention because it is specifically designed &amp;#34;to remove long-wear make up.&amp;#34;  The first time I used the Garner sample, after &amp;#34;removing&amp;#34; my make up with the baby wipes, I saw how much cleaner my skin was:  no make up residue.  </li>
            <li>After toweling off my face, my skin is perfectly clean and soft and ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and love how my skin isn&#x27;t on fire and super tight afterwards.</li>
            <li>This one is specifically for dry skin, I should&#x27;ve done more research.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean, but it truly does &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off your makeup, especially eye make up.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m just using an old travel shampoo bottle!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great as a makeup remover; simply dam a few drops on piece of cotton and wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it really helped,</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>and it really works to get the make up off with out drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Just gently massage over your face and wash it off.</li>
            <li>just asked my sis if she wants another bottle, her reply, &amp;#34;it isn&#x27;t THAT good.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Popped the 5 pimples, then have not broken out since (1 month has passed).</li>
            <li>I wear makeup, the whole shebang.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning after a shower before putting makeup on to hydrate my skin, remove any impurities, and make my face ready for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>But it really does wash my face well</li>
            <li>My husband has very oily skin that is prone to acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>leaked everywhere all the time, grew mold inside the bottle after just a couple months, &amp; really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I follow up after washing with a few drops of pure jojoba oil to further moisturize and so far so good!</li>
            <li>My post breakout marks have healed more quickly than usual too.</li>
            <li>I always have the problem with dark smudges of eye makeup with most cleansers but not this one.</li>
            <li>CVS is across the street and may be my new go to cleansing oil by Garnier!</li>
            <li>After this cleansing oil I do use a face wash and a non-alcohol toner, and the combination of the three really leaves my skin squeaky clean but not stripped dry of moisture.</li>
            <li>I want to try another cleansing oil just maybe not this one in particular.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using this as your makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically highly fragranced mineral oil.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up without high hopes.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes it all off and quicker and better than any other cosmetic remover I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li>In the winter, this barrier was much appreciated and made my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly normal, but leans sometimes towards the drier side</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft afterwards but not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>This takes off any make up and leaves my face feeling very soft</li>
            <li>I have super dry, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for months to remove my makeup when I wear a full face of makeup and then following it with my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a replacement for the oil cleansing method (where you would otherwise use a 100% pure oil to cleanse the face, rather than a commercially bought product).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 and my skin has not been this soft since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>It does take off makeup, especially eye makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin or brn my eyes.</li>
            <li>It takes off Maybelline-Colossal Volum&#x27; Express mascara and Milani Liquid Eye eyeliner completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 types of cleansing oils so far.  </li>
            <li>Before using this product, by mid-day my face would be very oily and  I would have to blot and reapply facial powder.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel and thought it was working well for me, but after a week of being broken out, I just didn&#x27;t have the nerve to keep hoping my skin would adjust.</li>
            <li>It really makes me feel refreshed if my face is feeling gross (dry skin OR oily from a hot day).</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, typically not too sensitive.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me too much for how well the cleanser seemed to work the first few days.</li>
            <li>First off, this stuff has mineral oil which is a big no-no especially if you are acne prone.</li>
            <li>A little more product but not much.</li>
            <li>Depending on the air quality (dry, humid, etc), or whether or not I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup - or even how much makeup - I like to switch up my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>It works very well for combination skin despite it being for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It takes off even the most difficult mascara without having to tug and scrub my face too much.</li>
            <li>so much I reordered several before the current price went up.  </li>
            <li>It is heavily scented, has a much heavier feel, and felt much too oily.</li>
            <li>This product does not leave you feeling greasy or oily, I actually found my skin felt quite soft and supple immediately after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my early 20s and still struggle with occasional acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I fixed this by pouring some into a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recently started wearing a couple of cream foundations &amp; noticed that the baby wipes I&#x27;d been using for years were not removing this make up completely .</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because like I said I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>DHC, my skin was soft but still dry in some areas.</li>
            <li>The Garnier cleansing oil makes my dry skin feel really soft after using it to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would describe my skin as dry and it can be sensitive to some facial</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as my only cleanser at night for the last 3 weeks and my skin is much clearer and less oily during the day.</li>
            <li>So even when I&#x27;m super tired before bed and just want to skip the face washing, I just do a couple quick pumps, rub it into my skin, then another small pump for my eye makeup, rinse</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My skin feels good after using it and I haven&#x27;t had any reactions (breakouts, etc)</li>
            <li> The price is good too.</li>
            <li> They have the right idea, using oil to remove makeup or to even just cleanse works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It removes all my make-up including water proof mascara I lOve it!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing oil!</li>
            <li> If you have been interested in trying a cleansing oil, this is a great option!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cleansing oils!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Then, I take a warm wash cloth and just wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> I use mineral foundation and it cleans it all off nicely.  </li>
            <li> This has been working nicely for me as a cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This came onto the market, so I decided to give it a try before attempting to mix my own oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is how much I liked the it.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> The oil&#x27;s fragrance is really nice, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I originally found on Pinterest as a great cleanser to help remove makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, removes face makeup great, and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this cleansing oil, I was hoping for the best, but wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is my favorite part of this honestly.</li>
            <li> the product is OK</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells nice and light.</li>
            <li> This has made it&#x27;s way into my morning and night routine and has become one of my most favorite products.</li>
            <li> it runs $24-$30 depending on how many royalty points i have for a discount.</li>
            <li> It smells better and works well,plus it leaves skin feeling hydrated from the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see Garnier&#x27;s was more affordable</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> (could try the 4oz, but I found the 8oz a more stable width).</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing oil removes my eye makeup better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> love this product, repurchasing on Amazon and leaving this comment.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it removes my eye makeup without fussing over cotton balls and Qtips.</li>
            <li> During the day, I had a healthy glow but never felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had a pimple for a while now, and I noticed more blackheads too.</li>
            <li> I was sure it was this cleanser, so I stopped using it immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this product but the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> This oil by Garnier works better than coconut oil because of the way it rinses cleaner.</li>
            <li> After just one use, most of my problems were gone.</li>
            <li> It is extremely better than lotion, as it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before going to bed to get make sure all my makeup is gone.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Garnier cleansing oil, so I gave it a try hoping for a more convenient product.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin nicely moist &amp; smooth, not at all oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty brand-loyal, and I have used and loved the Garnier hair products for awhile.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and pleasant scent (5 stars).</li>
            <li> Putting an oil on my face didn&#x27;t seem like the greatest idea because even though I do have dry skin, I didn&#x27;t want to give up my moisturizing routine.  </li>
            <li> I will say that regardless of the time of year, it does an excellent job of removing waterproof makeup, but if I was putting on a full face of foundation, I would need to double cleanse to remove all the makeup from my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the pump but a travel size with a different top would be great for when I got out of town.</li>
            <li> So easy to wash my face at night with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil, which I really like but takes a while to receive from Korea.</li>
            <li> Mineral oil is the main oil listed which isn&#x27;t good for cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> fragrance was strong, it reminded me of hairspray.</li>
            <li> It washes off fine</li>
            <li> Putting oil on my face was a huge leap of faith, as I&#x27;ve been having a fight with zits for about 20 years.  </li>
            <li> so I could take it with me while I travel without it making a huge oily</li>
            <li> Price was appealing but the need to remove the tackiness afterwards isn&#x27;t worth the $7-8 price.&lt;br /&gt;Shisedo</li>
            <li> Great facial oil.</li>
            <li> i really hope this continues to work for me because as of right now i love this product!</li>
            <li> Add water to emulsify, lather and rinse clean.</li>
            <li> While it takes off mascara, I won&#x27;t be using full strength on my eyes.</li>
            <li> so coats the face and lashes more gently to prevent breakage...</li>
            <li> Had to get the full size.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been happy with their other products that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is super moisterizing and takes my makeup off with ease.</li>
            <li> and i can not believe have much clearer and clean my face looks!</li>
            <li> It is mildly scented, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very fruity, not bad, just too strong for my preference.</li>
            <li> I would normally have to use my free samples of DHC cleansing oil,now i NO longer have to do that!</li>
            <li> well worth the money for the product and fresh clean feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> After I used this, I noticed it took off most of my makeup (only a bit of mascara left) and it smells soooo good.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, &amp; I have been able to use this with no problems.  </li>
            <li> DHC Cleansing Oil washes off clean and leaves the face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> soft, smooth, and so clean, I can&#x27;t help but tell everyone I see to buy some.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin clean and very moist</li>
            <li> Plus it is GREAT as makeup remover, no more waking up with bits of yesterday&#x27;s mascara in my pores.</li>
            <li> Helps tremendously with hydration while removing makeup very well.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and easily removes my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> It removes makeup and dirt quickly, easily and completely.</li>
            <li> I have normal/ dry skin, and I love how it makes my skin look &amp; feel incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(For consideration, my skin is 30 years old, very fair with some redness, sensitive, mostly dry, with a somewhat oily nose).</li>
            <li> I normally use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil and was trying to look for a more budget friendly alternative.</li>
            <li> a cleanser it sit on top of the skin rather than obsorb into the skin and even a tiny bit is problematic in removing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I missed the first ingredient in this product.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is great and it&#x27;s so easy to use-because you put it on dry skin with dry hands, there&#x27;s none of that pre-wetting with water step that you have to do with normal cleansers.</li>
            <li> howerever,  I do use it as the first step in my skincare as a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I first saw this at Walxxxxns and thought to myself for around $8, I am gonna give this a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used many before this but could never remove all -see residue the next morning under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My one flaky patch was gone, and my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> Oil cleansing is a bit of an art form that is supposed to use certain oils, this one does not have all the right oils in it.</li>
            <li> I love it, actually.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped control his oily skin, and he rarely has a pimple now.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you can feel the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for removing stubborn make up &amp; for leaving your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really really soft and I&#x27;m excited about it.  </li>
            <li> With that being said I can&#x27;t compare this to other oil cleansers but I am re-ordering this for a 2nd time, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Garnier really moisturized after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product caught my attention because it is specifically designed &amp;#34;to remove long-wear make up.&amp;#34;  The first time I used the Garner sample, after &amp;#34;removing&amp;#34; my make up with the baby wipes, I saw how much cleaner my skin was:  no make up residue.  </li>
            <li> After toweling off my face, my skin is perfectly clean and soft and ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and love how my skin isn&#x27;t on fire and super tight afterwards.</li>
            <li> This one is specifically for dry skin, I should&#x27;ve done more research.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean, but it truly does &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off your makeup, especially eye make up.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m just using an old travel shampoo bottle!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great as a makeup remover; simply dam a few drops on piece of cotton and wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it really helped,</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> and it really works to get the make up off with out drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just gently massage over your face and wash it off.</li>
            <li> just asked my sis if she wants another bottle, her reply, &amp;#34;it isn&#x27;t THAT good.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Popped the 5 pimples, then have not broken out since (1 month has passed).</li>
            <li> I wear makeup, the whole shebang.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning after a shower before putting makeup on to hydrate my skin, remove any impurities, and make my face ready for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> But it really does wash my face well</li>
            <li> My husband has very oily skin that is prone to acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> leaked everywhere all the time, grew mold inside the bottle after just a couple months, &amp; really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I follow up after washing with a few drops of pure jojoba oil to further moisturize and so far so good!</li>
            <li> My post breakout marks have healed more quickly than usual too.</li>
            <li> I always have the problem with dark smudges of eye makeup with most cleansers but not this one.</li>
            <li> CVS is across the street and may be my new go to cleansing oil by Garnier!</li>
            <li> After this cleansing oil I do use a face wash and a non-alcohol toner, and the combination of the three really leaves my skin squeaky clean but not stripped dry of moisture.</li>
            <li> I want to try another cleansing oil just maybe not this one in particular.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using this as your makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically highly fragranced mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up without high hopes.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes it all off and quicker and better than any other cosmetic remover I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> In the winter, this barrier was much appreciated and made my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly normal, but leans sometimes towards the drier side</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft afterwards but not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> This takes off any make up and leaves my face feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I have super dry, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months to remove my makeup when I wear a full face of makeup and then following it with my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a replacement for the oil cleansing method (where you would otherwise use a 100% pure oil to cleanse the face, rather than a commercially bought product).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and my skin has not been this soft since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> It does take off makeup, especially eye makeup very well.  </li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin or brn my eyes.</li>
            <li> It takes off Maybelline-Colossal Volum&#x27; Express mascara and Milani Liquid Eye eyeliner completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 types of cleansing oils so far.  </li>
            <li> Before using this product, by mid-day my face would be very oily and  I would have to blot and reapply facial powder.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel and thought it was working well for me, but after a week of being broken out, I just didn&#x27;t have the nerve to keep hoping my skin would adjust.</li>
            <li> It really makes me feel refreshed if my face is feeling gross (dry skin OR oily from a hot day).</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, typically not too sensitive.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me too much for how well the cleanser seemed to work the first few days.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff has mineral oil which is a big no-no especially if you are acne prone.</li>
            <li> A little more product but not much.</li>
            <li> Depending on the air quality (dry, humid, etc), or whether or not I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup - or even how much makeup - I like to switch up my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> It works very well for combination skin despite it being for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It takes off even the most difficult mascara without having to tug and scrub my face too much.</li>
            <li> so much I reordered several before the current price went up.  </li>
            <li> It is heavily scented, has a much heavier feel, and felt much too oily.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave you feeling greasy or oily, I actually found my skin felt quite soft and supple immediately after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my early 20s and still struggle with occasional acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I fixed this by pouring some into a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recently started wearing a couple of cream foundations &amp; noticed that the baby wipes I&#x27;d been using for years were not removing this make up completely .</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because like I said I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> DHC, my skin was soft but still dry in some areas.</li>
            <li> The Garnier cleansing oil makes my dry skin feel really soft after using it to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would describe my skin as dry and it can be sensitive to some facial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my only cleanser at night for the last 3 weeks and my skin is much clearer and less oily during the day.</li>
            <li> So even when I&#x27;m super tired before bed and just want to skip the face washing, I just do a couple quick pumps, rub it into my skin, then another small pump for my eye makeup, rinse</li>
            <li> Priced around $25 but can last a long time with only 1/2 - 1 pump per cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier</li>
            <li> One squirt in your hand, rub on a dry face, watch it all come off instantly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, which my current cleansing water did.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for dry skin only.</li>
            <li> Once again i used a product that completely broke me out, so as usual i headed down to the drug store to try something new.</li>
            <li> It falls over if you look at too long.</li>
            <li> -Stays on and needs 2 washing with another cleanser to remove…took me 3 times as long to wash the oily makeup gunk from my eye area…</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it in the evening to wash off any makeup and leave my face feeling hydrated after a long day.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about their BB cream, but that was mostly because of the limited shades it comes in.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction, and broke out all across my forehead and cheeks after using this product, and it did nothing to improve my dry skin situation either</li>
            <li> This oil IS for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m used to my hands feeling dry, but my face never felt greasy or oily like my hands did.</li>
            <li> Garnier and DHC are both applied on with dry hands to dry</li>
            <li> Dissolves every bit of makeup and leaves my dry skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> When I hadn&#x27;t been using it, my skin was flaking off like a dry lizard.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li> You can find it at any local CVS or even at drugstore.com for half the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have SUPER dry skin or a lot of acne, but I use this at least once a day, usually twice!</li>
            <li> My face was getting very dry during the winter months and using this oil has reversed the dryness.</li>
            <li> (though that&#x27;s not really the job of a cleanser, I was still hopeful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> With the mineral oil in it, it&#x27;s also harder to wash off and makes me feel oily after using a toner and my aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a cleansing oil before but was prompted too from a constant dry skin problem around the mouth area which regular cleanser just burned and made worse.</li>
            <li> Gets eye makeup and all other makeup off</li>
            <li> Check out other brands before using this one.</li>
            <li> I know realize that I was drying my skin out for years with anti-oil products and my face would get oily due to dryness..</li>
            <li> I must say, 2-3 days later all my active pimples have dried up!</li>
            <li> I always cleanse with a normal Wash after, but for lazy and late nights this will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, I love the other Garnier face products I use!</li>
            <li> so I had a mess when I opened the package and then had to go through the mess and trouble of shipping it back.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint with this is that it gets in my eyes and blurs my vision.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bottle leaks a bit.</li>
            <li> Ended up just buying it at Target for less money...</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of this acne for a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> It is an oil based product so it was quite messy.</li>
            <li> I applied it exactly as written in the directions and had a milky film in both of my eyes that made it almost impossible to see and didn&#x27;t go away for about twenty minutes even after rinsing and using a makeup removing wipe to try to get all the mascara this stuff left behind.</li>
            <li> ; usually end up having to use face cloth to wipe off access oils.</li>
            <li> NOT sure i can Cut off DHC we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I add a pinch of sugar to my hand and mix a small amt of oil before I use it at night and my face looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> No, okay.</li>
            <li> At first my skin seemed softer, clearer but within a few days this broke me out something awful.</li>
            <li> Well let me first start off by saying i have terrible acne that has just came out of no where!</li>
            <li> I have broken out 1-2x&#x27;s now, so no longer using as a cleanser but rather as a makeup/eye remover for my makeup: eyes, lipstic and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and this has not made it worse.</li>
            <li> product leaves something behind on your face after rinsing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an unnecessary fragrance.</li>
            <li> With a very cold winter, this oil doesn&#x27;t allow my face to dry out and itch.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like baby-oil and DHC is thick like olive oil or cooking oil and smells bad and burns if it gets in your eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the product is OK but it had leaked during shipping so I had a mess when I opened the package and then had to go through the mess and trouble of shipping it back.  Ended up just buying it at Target for less money...</li>
            <li> I like it to REMOVE makeup but NOT as a cleanser. It is way too oily as a daily cleanser to cleanse ones skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great as a makeup remover; simply dam a few drops on piece of cotton and wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cleanser it sit on top of the skin rather than obsorb into the skin and even a tiny bit is problematic in removing; usually end up having to use face cloth to wipe off access oils. I have broken out 1-2x&#x27;s now, so no longer using as a cleanser but rather as a makeup/eye remover for my makeup: eyes, lipstic and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This product was not for me. I have sensitive and dry skin. I can&#x27;t believe I missed the first ingredient in this product. I had a reaction, and broke out all across my forehead and cheeks after using this product, and it did nothing to improve my dry skin situation either (though that&#x27;s not really the job of a cleanser, I was still hopeful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and light. Gets eye makeup and all other makeup off well. I liked the feel and thought it was working well for me, but after a week of being broken out, I just didn&#x27;t have the nerve to keep hoping my skin would adjust. This product does not leave you feeling greasy or oily, I actually found my skin felt quite soft and supple immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For consideration, my skin is 30 years old, very fair with some redness, sensitive, mostly dry, with a somewhat oily nose).</li>
            <li> I have never tried a cleansing oil before but was prompted too from a constant dry skin problem around the mouth area which regular cleanser just burned and made worse. With that being said I can&#x27;t compare this to other oil cleansers but I am re-ordering this for a 2nd time, I&#x27;m very satisfied! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and love how my skin isn&#x27;t on fire and super tight afterwards. I do have acne-prone skin and this has not made it worse. I follow up after washing with a few drops of pure jojoba oil to further moisturize and so far so good! You can&#x27;t beat the price, I plan to stay with this. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because like I said I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I used this for two days. I broke out and got a very painful stye. Be careful.</li>
            <li> This has made it&#x27;s way into my morning and night routine and has become one of my most favorite products. It takes off even the most difficult mascara without having to tug and scrub my face too much. I massage it all over my face and neck for a minute or two before I get in the shower, then I rinse it off. My face feels supple rather than greasy once I wash it off. Highly recommend using this as your makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;I have already repurchased this twice! One bottle lasts me almost 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump but a travel size with a different top would be great for when I got out of town. Right now I&#x27;m just using an old travel shampoo bottle!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on a whim, since I&#x27;ve recently been using oil on my face and it&#x27;s actually been HELPING my acne.  Putting oil on my face was a huge leap of faith, as I&#x27;ve been having a fight with zits for about 20 years.  But it really helped, and then I added this into my routine as my cleanser, and my face feels softer and I think is happier overall. Plus it is GREAT as makeup remover, no more waking up with bits of yesterday&#x27;s mascara in my pores.</li>
            <li> I originally found on Pinterest as a great cleanser to help remove makeup.  It works great, it removes virtually all makeup. I have combination skin and I never feel greasy after washing and drying my face.  While rinsing it does feel like the oil is still there but it does rinse fully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and my skin has not been this soft since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I tried this tonight to compare it to my DHC Cleansing Oil. It is 4.2 fl oz and cost $6.99 at CVS and $5.99 at Walmart. I pay $24.99 plus tax and shipping and handling. DHC is 6.7 fl oz. A little more product but not much. it runs $24-$30 depending on how many royalty points i have for a discount. I like the scent of Garnier&#x27;s cleansing oil and it didn&#x27;t burn/sting my eyes like DHC!  It smells better and works well,plus it leaves skin feeling hydrated from the jojoba oil.The consistency is like baby-oil and DHC is thick like olive oil or cooking oil and smells bad and burns if it gets in your eyes. I am a faithful user of DHC for Years. I have to say i am very IMPRESSED with Garnier. It removes all my make-up including water proof mascara I lOve it! This will be my back-up when waiting for my shipment from DHC. NOT sure i can Cut off DHC we&#x27;ll see. I do hate waiting for DHC in the mail and the cost! CVS is across the street and may be my new go to cleansing oil by Garnier! I can&#x27;t believe i NEVER found this earlier. I would normally have to use my free samples of DHC cleansing oil,now i NO longer have to do that! WOOOOHOOOOOOO!</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this is that it gets in my eyes and blurs my vision. But it is super moisterizing and takes my makeup off with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at these oil based face cleaners, but they can be pricey.  I was glad to see Garnier&#x27;s was more affordable and I&#x27;ve always been happy with their other products that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe my skin as dry and it can be sensitive to some facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pump some into your hand and work it into your face and then put some water in your hands and continue rubbing your face.  When you add water to the oil on your face it will turn whitish.  Then, I take a warm wash cloth and just wipe it off.  I use mineral foundation and it cleans it all off nicely.  My face feels very soft afterwards but not oily at all.  I think any skin type can use this cleanser and have good results.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin clean and very moist</li>
            <li> This has been working nicely for me as a cleaner.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every morning and night with great results. I add a pinch of sugar to my hand and mix a small amt of oil before I use it at night and my face looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser, but this sells for $7.99 at Ulta!&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil is non-comedogenic so there is no need to be afraid of it!</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing oil. My face was getting very dry during the winter months and using this oil has reversed the dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months to remove my makeup when I wear a full face of makeup and then following it with my regular cleanser. My skin has been breaking out the last couple months and I decided to give oil-cleansing a try. I&#x27;ve been using this as my only cleanser at night for the last 3 weeks and my skin is much clearer and less oily during the day. My post breakout marks have healed more quickly than usual too.</li>
            <li> I found it too oily.  Have to wash out after use which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Bought this from the recommendation of YouTuber Hapagurl8.  It does take off makeup, especially eye makeup very well.  It&#x27;s basically highly fragranced mineral oil.  I quit using it because of the fragrance and moved on to a balm cleanser which takes off the makeup just as well but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  The fragrance is very fruity, not bad, just too strong for my preference.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing oil! At first I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean, but it truly does &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off your makeup, especially eye make up. I always have the problem with dark smudges of eye makeup with most cleansers but not this one. After toweling off my face, my skin is perfectly clean and soft and ready for moisturizer. My skin is fairly normal, but leans sometimes towards the drier side and this doesn&#x27;t make me greasy at all. Plus the smell is great and it&#x27;s so easy to use-because you put it on dry skin with dry hands, there&#x27;s none of that pre-wetting with water step that you have to do with normal cleansers. So even when I&#x27;m super tired before bed and just want to skip the face washing, I just do a couple quick pumps, rub it into my skin, then another small pump for my eye makeup, rinse and I&#x27;m done! Perfect product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> So easy to wash my face at night with this product and it really works to get the make up off with out drying out my skin.  I can wash the makeup off my eyes with it too and it doesn&#x27;t tend to sting like soap.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and pleasant scent (5 stars). The container (as of 2014/2015) is worthless! It leaks in shipping. It leaks when you try pump it. The now slimy bottle label peels off. It falls over if you look at too long. Now, I immediately transfer it to a 8 oz glass dispenser  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y5SW86/  (could try the 4oz, but I found the 8oz a more stable width).</li>
            <li> Mineral oil is the main oil listed which isn&#x27;t good for cleaning your skin. They have the right idea, using oil to remove makeup or to even just cleanse works wonderful. But not an oil that will clog your pores. I would recommend almond or jojoba oil, they both work great and can also be used as a moisturizer. I use a lot of Garnier products and they work well. But this one is a miss.</li>
            <li> I bought this elsewhere for $7 and found that it has a pleasant smell, removes makeup excellently and softens my skin. Word of caution though around the eyes. While it takes off mascara, I won&#x27;t be using full strength on my eyes. My eyes teared and hurt after use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t use it as a facial cleanser,  howerever,  I do use it as the first step in my skincare as a makeup remover.  This cleansing oil removes my eye makeup better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. It does not irritate my sensitive skin or brn my eyes. I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> It takes off my eye makeup-mascara and eyeliner. I have super dry, sensitive and acne prone skin. I first saw this at Walxxxxns and thought to myself for around $8, I am gonna give this a try and I also got a bottle for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, repurchasing on Amazon and leaving this comment. It takes off Maybelline-Colossal Volum&#x27; Express mascara and Milani Liquid Eye eyeliner completely. I&#x27;d used many before this but could never remove all -see residue the next morning under my eyes. It washes off fine you do feel a bit tacky after because of the oil. Since I am acne prone, I use it before I step into the shower and then I use my Mia2 with The Body Shop Tea Tree cleaner to wash off my face. The smell is pleasant. I love the fact that it removes my eye makeup without fussing over cotton balls and Qtips. Just gently massage over your face and wash it off. No breakout and that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just asked my sis if she wants another bottle, her reply, &amp;#34;it isn&#x27;t THAT good.&amp;#34; My sis has combination skin and acne prone. This oil IS for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I normally use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil and was trying to look for a more budget friendly alternative. This came onto the market, so I decided to give it a try before attempting to mix my own oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;With DHC, my skin was soft but still dry in some areas. Garnier really moisturized after the first use. My one flaky patch was gone, and my skin was incredibly soft and smooth. During the day, I had a healthy glow but never felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird:&lt;br /&gt;My hands felt sticky with grease after I massaged the cleanser into my face. I would follow by washing my hands with soap, and then washing the cleanser off my face (not with soap), and then washing my hands again. I think I&#x27;m used to my hands feeling dry, but my face never felt greasy or oily like my hands did. My hands never felt sticky with DHC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was strong, it reminded me of hairspray. It didn&#x27;t bother me too much for how well the cleanser seemed to work the first few days. Then I woke up with 5 pimples on the fourth day. I hadn&#x27;t had a pimple for a while now, and I noticed more blackheads too. I was sure it was this cleanser, so I stopped using it immediately. Popped the 5 pimples, then have not broken out since (1 month has passed).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 types of cleansing oils so far.  Garnier and DHC are both applied on with dry hands to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DHC- Rinses off best…Viscous so coats the face and lashes more gently to prevent breakage...Priced around $25 but can last a long time with only 1/2 - 1 pump per cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier-Rinse off with after film/ residue…personally, would opt for makeup remover sheets before using this…Price was appealing but the need to remove the tackiness afterwards isn&#x27;t worth the $7-8 price.&lt;br /&gt;Shisedo-Stays on and needs 2 washing with another cleanser to remove…took me 3 times as long to wash the oily makeup gunk from my eye area…no thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conclude that DHC is the superior product and well worth the money for the product and fresh clean feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have been interested in trying a cleansing oil, this is a great option! It&#x27;s inexpensive, removes face makeup great, and rinsed clean. I always cleanse with a normal Wash after, but for lazy and late nights this will get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an oil cleanser. I bought it as a replacement for the oil cleansing method (where you would otherwise use a 100% pure oil to cleanse the face, rather than a commercially bought product). I am in my early 20s and still struggle with occasional acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves something behind on your face after rinsing. In the winter, this barrier was much appreciated and made my skin feel soft and supple. Now that it&#x27;s summertime, it just amplifies my feeling of humid/sweaty face and causes me to break out and look shiny. I will say that regardless of the time of year, it does an excellent job of removing waterproof makeup, but if I was putting on a full face of foundation, I would need to double cleanse to remove all the makeup from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the bottle locked so I could take it with me while I travel without it making a huge oily mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I will use this product in the colder months only, when my face needs that extra moisture.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to go the oil cleansing route and can splurge a bit, may I recommend DHC&#x27;s Cleansing Oil instead? First off, this stuff has mineral oil which is a big no-no especially if you are acne prone. With the mineral oil in it, it&#x27;s also harder to wash off and makes me feel oily after using a toner and my aloe gel. There&#x27;s also an unnecessary fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but you don&#x27;t need it. Oil cleansing is a bit of an art form that is supposed to use certain oils, this one does not have all the right oils in it. DHC Cleansing Oil washes off clean and leaves the face so soft and smooth. Check out other brands before using this one.</li>
            <li> Can we just call this miracle in a bottle? No, okay. Well let me first start off by saying i have terrible acne that has just came out of no where! I have been trying to get rid of this acne for a year and a half now. I have tried literally everything. Once again i used a product that completely broke me out, so as usual i headed down to the drug store to try something new. I saw this out of the corner of my eye. Ive tried using oils for moisturizer without sucess, but never as a cleanser. I picked this up without high hopes. I massage this into my face for about 5 minutes, and then rinse off with water. I follow it up with either biore&#x27;s ice cleanser or Neutrogena naturals purifying cleanser. I must say, 2-3 days later all my active pimples have dried up! Imagine that! Its been 6 days and i can not believe have much clearer and clean my face looks! i really hope this continues to work for me because as of right now i love this product!</li>
            <li> OMG I love this stuff!!!! I wear makeup, the whole shebang. Foundation, translucent powders, blush, shadows, liners, mascaras, lipsticks/glosses/stains/balms. This stuff takes it all off and quicker and better than any other cosmetic remover I have tried thus far. One squirt in your hand, rub on a dry face, watch it all come off instantly. Not kidding, instantly. Add water to emulsify, lather and rinse clean. Simple as that and it leaves your skin soft, smooth, and so clean, I can&#x27;t help but tell everyone I see to buy some. This is the best ever!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I would like this product, but I couldn&#x27;t resist buying it.  I am definitely on the cleansing water/cleansing oil wagon.  The cleansing oil works surprisingly well.  I love it, actually.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, which my current cleansing water did.  It doesn&#x27;t make me oily, which I was worried about.  Putting an oil on my face didn&#x27;t seem like the greatest idea because even though I do have dry skin, I didn&#x27;t want to give up my moisturizing routine.  After I used this, I noticed it took off most of my makeup (only a bit of mascara left) and it smells soooo good.  I really like the smell.  It makes my skin really really soft and I&#x27;m excited about it.  I do have to go back in with some of my no.7 cleansing water to get that mascara off though.</li>
            <li> Love this product but the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t work.  Amazon replaced it for me and I loved the product so much I reordered several before the current price went up.  If these don&#x27;t work I will transfer the product to another bottle.  That is how much I liked the it.  Made my face feel like a dream and got every bit of makeup off.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Keeps skin feeling very soft.  One complaint-not about product-the shipping is lax. I bought this item twice and both times the bottles leaked. It is an oil based product so it was quite messy.</li>
            <li> Ever wanted to try put being blind without the commitment? Then this is the product for you! I applied it exactly as written in the directions and had a milky film in both of my eyes that made it almost impossible to see and didn&#x27;t go away for about twenty minutes even after rinsing and using a makeup removing wipe to try to get all the mascara this stuff left behind. I&#x27;m so disappointed, I love the other Garnier face products I use!</li>
            <li> Helps tremendously with hydration while removing makeup very well.  After this cleansing oil I do use a face wash and a non-alcohol toner, and the combination of the three really leaves my skin squeaky clean but not stripped dry of moisture.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cleansing oils! It works great!</li>
            <li> Had to get the full size. I love this stuff! Dissolves every bit of makeup and leaves my dry skin feeling hydrated. Smells nice too. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This takes off any make up and leaves my face feeling very soft</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have very oily skin and recently I read an article in a magazine saying washing with oils helps oily skin. I found this product in a clearance bin one day at a well known store and I decided to give it a try. I was always scared to put any type of oil on my face because I automatically assumed I would break out. Needless to say I have been using this produce for one week and my skin has NEVER looked so amazing!! NO breakouts whatsoever!! Before using this product, by mid-day my face would be very oily and  I would have to blot and reapply facial powder. Since I started using this produce my face is NEVER oily anymore! I LOOOOOVE this stuff! I know realize that I was drying my skin out for years with anti-oil products and my face would get oily due to dryness.. Now that I am nourishing my skin with an oil based product my skin doesn&#x27;t get oily anymore because it is nourished and moisturized... makes perfect sense !!</li>
            <li> Broke out within minutes of use. Horrible</li>
            <li> Even though I have oily skin, this cleanser works great for me.  It leaves my skin soft and easily removes my eye makeup.  The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  The oil leaks out of the pump and I&#x27;m left with an oily spot on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty brand-loyal, and I have used and loved the Garnier hair products for awhile. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about their BB cream, but that was mostly because of the limited shades it comes in. When I first heard about this cleansing oil, I was hoping for the best, but wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work. Well, it DOES work. It does a great job. I have used different types of cleansers on my face - soaps, foams, wipes. Depending on the air quality (dry, humid, etc), or whether or not I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup - or even how much makeup - I like to switch up my cleansing routine. Before trying the Cleansing Oil, I had used coconut oil as my &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; cleanser. This oil by Garnier works better than coconut oil because of the way it rinses cleaner. My skin feels good after using it and I haven&#x27;t had any reactions (breakouts, etc) so I&#x27;m happy. The price is good too.</li>
            <li> Great facial oil. I use twice a week before showering. My face feels refreshed. With a very cold winter, this oil doesn&#x27;t allow my face to dry out and itch. Love this product!</li>
            <li> The Garnier cleansing oil makes my dry skin feel really soft after using it to remove makeup. Does a great job removing mascara and eyeliner! The oil&#x27;s fragrance is really nice, and not overpowering. Would recommend for dry skin only.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have SUPER dry skin or a lot of acne, but I use this at least once a day, usually twice! I&#x27;ll use it in the evening to wash off any makeup and leave my face feeling hydrated after a long day. I use it in the morning after a shower before putting makeup on to hydrate my skin, remove any impurities, and make my face ready for applying makeup. It really makes me feel refreshed if my face is feeling gross (dry skin OR oily from a hot day). Furthermore, I used it during a two month stay in the desert. When I hadn&#x27;t been using it, my skin was flaking off like a dry lizard. After just one use, most of my problems were gone. I was letting friends who were suffering similar problems use it. It is extremely better than lotion, as it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil has been great to my skin. I use it every night before going to bed to get make sure all my makeup is gone. It has made my skin noticeably softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying this elsewhere, though. You can find it at any local CVS or even at drugstore.com for half the price.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, typically not too sensitive. I used this product for about a week to remove makeup and followed with both a cleanser and moisturizer. At first my skin seemed softer, clearer but within a few days this broke me out something awful. I want to try another cleansing oil just maybe not this one in particular. This one is specifically for dry skin, I should&#x27;ve done more research.</li>
            <li> I tried the sample of it and used all of it up. LOVE this product. Only complaint is that the bottle leaks a bit. I fixed this by pouring some into a smaller bottle. That way it doesn&#x27;t leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is my favorite part of this honestly. It&#x27;s smells so good! It works very well for combination skin despite it being for dry skin. In fact my skin leans more toward the oily side, but it&#x27;s still great for my skin! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the product came in a simple plastic bag and leaked into the packaging... But it really does wash my face well and I like the dewy finish rather than the sticky feeling creams leave.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It removes makeup and dirt quickly, easily and completely. Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry. I use it everyday if need be and my skin looks and feels much smoother, cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li> My husband has very oily skin that is prone to acne breakouts.  This product has really helped control his oily skin, and he rarely has a pimple now.  I have normal/ dry skin, and I love how it makes my skin look &amp; feel incredibly clean.  Try it, you can feel the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> leaked everywhere all the time, grew mold inside the bottle after just a couple months, &amp; really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. please don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil, which I really like but takes a while to receive from Korea. I received a sample of the Garnier cleansing oil, so I gave it a try hoping for a more convenient product. Unfortunately, I found it quite inferior. It is heavily scented, has a much heavier feel, and felt much too oily. I will stick to The Face Shop!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after trying a sample that arrived via mail.  I&#x27;d recently started wearing a couple of cream foundations &amp; noticed that the baby wipes I&#x27;d been using for years were not removing this make up completely . This product caught my attention because it is specifically designed &amp;#34;to remove long-wear make up.&amp;#34;  The first time I used the Garner sample, after &amp;#34;removing&amp;#34; my make up with the baby wipes, I saw how much cleaner my skin was:  no make up residue.  It also leaves my skin nicely moist &amp; smooth, not at all oily.  I do have an oily T-zone, so I don&#x27;t use this every day, although the label states that it will not block pores.  I also have sensitive skin, &amp; I have been able to use this with no problems.  It is mildly scented, not unpleasant. I recommend it for removing stubborn make up &amp; for leaving your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth.</li>
