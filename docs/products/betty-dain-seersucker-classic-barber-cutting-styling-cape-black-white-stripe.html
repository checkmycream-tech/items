            <li>Great large size.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one that comes stock in haircut kits.</li>
            <li>Better quality and way better price than in retail stores.</li>
            <li>This cape does a great job of catching hair, keeping it off him and our 2 year old son.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We dont have salon chairs and the skills that magically keep hair off our clothes.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>It is so much better than the plastic bag that came with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Love this this cape...</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m kind of a cheap skate and rather than pay a barber to cut my hair every two or three weeks</li>
            <li>I love that it is machine washable.  </li>
            <li>Its just ok....</li>
            <li>I am glad we bought this.  </li>
            <li>My search continues for a better cape.</li>
            <li>There is also many snaps to adjust to many sizes.</li>
            <li>I wish they added more buttons though so that all sizes are literally covered.</li>
            <li>I love everything Betty Dain makes.</li>
            <li>I am always pleased with their stuff.</li>
            <li>This cape is a 100x better.</li>
            <li>the barbers love them</li>
            <li>worth the $$ and good value,&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>a big guy, but this cape covers me perfectly well.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Its an okay cape covers up the customers well</li>
            <li>Cape fits okay</li>
            <li>This cape sure did the trick.  </li>
            <li>and i like the snap closure which is better than the velcro</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this for all of one haircut before it got stolen from me.</li>
            <li>For most of my life I have had some sort of hair on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there are snaps around neckline</li>
            <li>so you can adjust to many size necks.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I love that you can shake this out and all the hairs fall off so easily.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to keep clean and is quite durable.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, is pretty large.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cape and does exactly what it should do!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for home or shop and easy to throw in washer and hang dry in minutes.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s better than nothing, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to fit like it did.</li>
            <li>hope it makes me more comfortable.</li>
            <li>A good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This cape has a nice texture that makes the hair you cut, seem to just fall right off to the floor.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and protects from falling hair and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>The hair easily glides off the cape and into the trashcan.</li>
            <li>It does works though, and washes easily.</li>
            <li>You can fold this up and put it away easily too.</li>
            <li>The snaps old very good, and the hair falls right off when your done.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and it covers me pretty well.</li>
            <li>That said it does the job fine</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine;</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I like the non-sticky material that is comfortable to wear and easy to shake clean.  </li>
            <li>So this is a cheap Barber cape.  </li>
            <li>Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a really comfortable cape that does</li>
            <li>The snaps secure comfortably around the neck.</li>
            <li>great quality and coverage in back and front</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to cut hair at home, and it&#x27;s not one of those cheap plastic robes.</li>
            <li>a at home barber and was using the cheap cape that comes with the clippers (thats a joke).</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li>but there wasn&#x27;t a button that fit snugly with my neck size.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it, whoever and wherever you are.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is made in the USA!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend the cape as an affordable option for folks that don&#x27;t need anything special, but still want some good coverage.</li>
            <li>Home users want full coverage.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to stay cool when getting your hair cut.</li>
            <li>Good quality, this has lasted for about 3 years with occasional use.</li>
            <li>I cut my husband and two boys hair, and really needed a better cape.  </li>
            <li>just looks good on photo only!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cool and light weight with very large coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Hair cleans off with a quick shake.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The material is pretty cheap feeling, but it does do the job.</li>
            <li>Such a good price for such an effective cape.  </li>
            <li>I bought one and returned it for replacement, hoping the new one would be better made.  </li>
            <li>is great, just not very strong.</li>
            <li>This works very well and it easy care.</li>
            <li>i bought this with lots of hair cutting stuff nice fits any size and is salon quality and cheap used it over 20 times and still holding up great product</li>
            <li>Kind of thought from the picture and description that this would almost be like a poncho, but it&#x27;s meant for being in an actual barber chair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more for teenagers to adults but the neck sizes don&#x27;t really fit younger children.</li>
            <li>Overall though an effective cape that keeps hair out.</li>
            <li>Worth the price paid</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be longer at the back.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it if you do a lot of haircutting at home.</li>
            <li>Useful product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily a revolutionary idea (as good old-fashioned barbers have been using these for decades), but it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice to finally have a cape that will cover the enitre body.</li>
            <li>Hair slides right off of cape.</li>
            <li>price is right and do the job</li>
            <li>all the hair comes right off.</li>
            <li>; hair slides right off.  </li>
            <li>This cape has a nice feel to it and with the snaps on the neck I am able to make it fit my husband and both my kids with no gaps for hair to fall down their back.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping cigar ashes off clothes when driving -- where short back is a benefit.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m not real sure what separates the great capes from the inferior capes in the high stakes</li>
            <li>I love the multiple snaps as it makes it easier to use the same cape with many people.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as you would expect it to do.</li>
            <li>THINK, since mostly retail buyers are shopping here, that MAYBE they &#x27;might&#x27; have considered to SHOW the BACK IN THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My first rodeo with a barber cape.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything that would make this simple cape better.</li>
            <li>The cape does exactly what it supposed to do..keep hair out of my shirt.</li>
            <li>but he says its really hot to wear.</li>
            <li>but I think they should have added more material to the back side.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to keep the hair out of my collar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: 2/4/2015 I have used this cape exactly 27 times in two years</li>
            <li>Light wait and fits my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>Good material and big enough in front.</li>
            <li>The snaps are still strong and work well for a tight fit.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, keeps the hair off, and has enough snap options that you can get a pretty snug fit on different necks.  </li>
            <li>The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I recommend this item very highly.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sitting on very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BARBER CUTTING CAPE.</li>
            <li>VERY DURABLE.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li>very durable, and made out of quality material.  </li>
            <li>I really like this and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>and I use this cape; it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this cape works really well.</li>
            <li>It is well constructed and the snaps look like they will be very durable.</li>
            <li>Nice material but short in back.</li>
            <li>It fits well, has adjustable neck snaps, and the seersucker fabric does not get hot while wearing and the hair quickly falls off while shaking outside.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right size and the nylon fabric makes it slippery enough that the hair falls right off.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easier to clean up, but with this cape, my back is still exposed.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this cape as it covers you totally and keeps the hair off, minimal cleaning up after the cut.</li>
            <li>The cheap plastic cape that came with the clippers died long ago.  </li>
            <li>I thought the size, even of the parts in the back were adequate.</li>
            <li>it came with velcro but the snaps are decent</li>
            <li>Their cuts have become more pleasant for them and less frustrating for me.</li>
            <li>If this is all you require in a barber cape, then I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>so i had to adjust to a high snap</li>
            <li>The cape is of great quality, but the back is very short and looks odd after it&#x27;s around the neck.</li>
            <li>One of the snaps doesn&#x27;t stay closed but still work fine.</li>
            <li>Adjust to most sizes and keeps the kids from complaining about being itchy which keeps them still for a little longer.</li>
            <li>I was no expecting much when I placed the order but was pleasantly surprised when I started using the cape.</li>
            <li>I love that this is machine washable, I bought a plastic one which did not last long.</li>
            <li>It has a few snaps instead of velcro, which I love.</li>
            <li>The price was right, it&#x27;s plenty big, and it sheds the hair well.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is pretty good at cutting my hair, but we don&#x27;t have a real chair.  </li>
            <li>The snaps are designed to give you endless size options and the fabric does not feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy to shake hair off of it, Big enough for an adult any size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional Lice Remover and we are switching over to these capes!</li>
            <li>If I had a chair with a higher back, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue though.</li>
            <li>Both are the same and so am returning the second one for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Maybe when I am ready to replace it the price will be back to what it is worth (or that of the other colors which are reasonably priced for the product.  </li>
            <li>I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home because he is disabled and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too large, nor too big.</li>
            <li>I can only use this cape on certain people to insure that hair doesn&#x27;t end up on them</li>
            <li>Cover large enough to cover what needs to be covered.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>It is certainly large enough.</li>
            <li>Great cape for doing my hair cutting process.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand some of the negatives I&#x27;ve read about the neckline being too big --</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job as far as keeping the hair from getting all over my husband</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace an old cape I had.</li>
            <li>It covers the front, but won&#x27;t cover the back very well.</li>
            <li>I always felt like I was alive with all this&lt;br /&gt;loose hair everywhere.</li>
            <li>It folds small and washes easily.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, it should work much better as I uad to use Scotch tape to keep the other one closed</li>
            <li>Well I finally got smart and bought this barber cutting cape and life is now good again,</li>
            <li>I thought it would be bigger enough to cover the entire body, however it only covers full on one side.</li>
            <li>On larger guys, the cape does not cover the back as much as I&#x27;d like- hence the 4star rating.</li>
            <li>Back side is much too short.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very generous in size and may prove too big for smaller children.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance because he started cutting all of his friends&#x27; hair and he loves it and says that the hair slides right off of it and the button clasp is better than velcro.</li>
            <li>Fabric is very sturdy and will last forever as long as it isn&#x27;t abused.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I found with this item was that it is too short for an adult.  </li>
            <li>apparently this makes the cut.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone who may wish to cut hair (whether professionally or not)!</li>
            <li>Good quality cape for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li>There should be one or two snaps near top of cape opening; instead, there are 3 on one side and 4 on the other  running down middle of each seam which makes no logical sense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cape and keeps hair from getting on your victim while styling up their new do.</li>
            <li>This cutting cape is nothing extraordinary or anything special, but it gets the job done for what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using a clear plastic cape that came with our cutters a long time ago.</li>
            <li>paid way too much for HALF OF A CAPE.  </li>
            <li>Item is black and covers person really well.</li>
            <li>Poorly made with the seams coming apart very quickly.</li>

            <li> great item good price fast delivery</li>

            <li> They look great and clean easily.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap made don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great large size.</li>
            <li> Much better than the one that comes stock in haircut kits.</li>
            <li> Better quality and way better price than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> This cape does a great job of catching hair, keeping it off him and our 2 year old son.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We dont have salon chairs and the skills that magically keep hair off our clothes.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the plastic bag that came with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Love this this cape...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m kind of a cheap skate and rather than pay a barber to cut my hair every two or three weeks</li>
            <li> I love that it is machine washable.  </li>
            <li> Its just ok....</li>
            <li> I am glad we bought this.  </li>
            <li> My search continues for a better cape.</li>
            <li> There is also many snaps to adjust to many sizes.</li>
            <li> I wish they added more buttons though so that all sizes are literally covered.</li>
            <li> I love everything Betty Dain makes.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with their stuff.</li>
            <li> This cape is a 100x better.</li>
            <li> the barbers love them</li>
            <li> worth the $$ and good value,&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> a big guy, but this cape covers me perfectly well.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Its an okay cape covers up the customers well</li>
            <li> Cape fits okay</li>
            <li> This cape sure did the trick.  </li>
            <li> and i like the snap closure which is better than the velcro</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this for all of one haircut before it got stolen from me.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have had some sort of hair on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there are snaps around neckline</li>
            <li> so you can adjust to many size necks.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I love that you can shake this out and all the hairs fall off so easily.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to keep clean and is quite durable.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, is pretty large.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cape and does exactly what it should do!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for home or shop and easy to throw in washer and hang dry in minutes.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it&#x27;s better than nothing, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to fit like it did.</li>
            <li> hope it makes me more comfortable.</li>
            <li> A good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This cape has a nice texture that makes the hair you cut, seem to just fall right off to the floor.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and protects from falling hair and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> The hair easily glides off the cape and into the trashcan.</li>
            <li> It does works though, and washes easily.</li>
            <li> You can fold this up and put it away easily too.</li>
            <li> The snaps old very good, and the hair falls right off when your done.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and it covers me pretty well.</li>
            <li> That said it does the job fine</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine;</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> I like the non-sticky material that is comfortable to wear and easy to shake clean.  </li>
            <li> So this is a cheap Barber cape.  </li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a really comfortable cape that does</li>
            <li> The snaps secure comfortably around the neck.</li>
            <li> great quality and coverage in back and front</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to cut hair at home, and it&#x27;s not one of those cheap plastic robes.</li>
            <li> a at home barber and was using the cheap cape that comes with the clippers (thats a joke).</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li> but there wasn&#x27;t a button that fit snugly with my neck size.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it, whoever and wherever you are.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is made in the USA!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend the cape as an affordable option for folks that don&#x27;t need anything special, but still want some good coverage.</li>
            <li> Home users want full coverage.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to stay cool when getting your hair cut.</li>
            <li> Good quality, this has lasted for about 3 years with occasional use.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband and two boys hair, and really needed a better cape.  </li>
            <li> just looks good on photo only!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cool and light weight with very large coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Hair cleans off with a quick shake.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The material is pretty cheap feeling, but it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Such a good price for such an effective cape.  </li>
            <li> I bought one and returned it for replacement, hoping the new one would be better made.  </li>
            <li> is great, just not very strong.</li>
            <li> This works very well and it easy care.</li>
            <li> i bought this with lots of hair cutting stuff nice fits any size and is salon quality and cheap used it over 20 times and still holding up great product</li>
            <li> Kind of thought from the picture and description that this would almost be like a poncho, but it&#x27;s meant for being in an actual barber chair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more for teenagers to adults but the neck sizes don&#x27;t really fit younger children.</li>
            <li> Overall though an effective cape that keeps hair out.</li>
            <li> Worth the price paid</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to be longer at the back.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it if you do a lot of haircutting at home.</li>
            <li> Useful product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily a revolutionary idea (as good old-fashioned barbers have been using these for decades), but it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice to finally have a cape that will cover the enitre body.</li>
            <li> Hair slides right off of cape.</li>
            <li> price is right and do the job</li>
            <li> all the hair comes right off.</li>
            <li> ; hair slides right off.  </li>
            <li> This cape has a nice feel to it and with the snaps on the neck I am able to make it fit my husband and both my kids with no gaps for hair to fall down their back.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping cigar ashes off clothes when driving -- where short back is a benefit.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not real sure what separates the great capes from the inferior capes in the high stakes</li>
            <li> I love the multiple snaps as it makes it easier to use the same cape with many people.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as you would expect it to do.</li>
            <li> THINK, since mostly retail buyers are shopping here, that MAYBE they &#x27;might&#x27; have considered to SHOW the BACK IN THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My first rodeo with a barber cape.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything that would make this simple cape better.</li>
            <li> The cape does exactly what it supposed to do..keep hair out of my shirt.</li>
            <li> but he says its really hot to wear.</li>
            <li> but I think they should have added more material to the back side.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to keep the hair out of my collar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 2/4/2015 I have used this cape exactly 27 times in two years</li>
            <li> Light wait and fits my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> Good material and big enough in front.</li>
            <li> The snaps are still strong and work well for a tight fit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, keeps the hair off, and has enough snap options that you can get a pretty snug fit on different necks.  </li>
            <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I recommend this item very highly.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sitting on very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BARBER CUTTING CAPE.</li>
            <li> VERY DURABLE.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li> very durable, and made out of quality material.  </li>
            <li> I really like this and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> and I use this cape; it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this cape works really well.</li>
            <li> It is well constructed and the snaps look like they will be very durable.</li>
            <li> Nice material but short in back.</li>
            <li> It fits well, has adjustable neck snaps, and the seersucker fabric does not get hot while wearing and the hair quickly falls off while shaking outside.  </li>
            <li> This is just the right size and the nylon fabric makes it slippery enough that the hair falls right off.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easier to clean up, but with this cape, my back is still exposed.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this cape as it covers you totally and keeps the hair off, minimal cleaning up after the cut.</li>
            <li> The cheap plastic cape that came with the clippers died long ago.  </li>
            <li> I thought the size, even of the parts in the back were adequate.</li>
            <li> it came with velcro but the snaps are decent</li>
            <li> Their cuts have become more pleasant for them and less frustrating for me.</li>
            <li> If this is all you require in a barber cape, then I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> so i had to adjust to a high snap</li>
            <li> The cape is of great quality, but the back is very short and looks odd after it&#x27;s around the neck.</li>
            <li> One of the snaps doesn&#x27;t stay closed but still work fine.</li>
            <li> Adjust to most sizes and keeps the kids from complaining about being itchy which keeps them still for a little longer.</li>
            <li> I was no expecting much when I placed the order but was pleasantly surprised when I started using the cape.</li>
            <li> I love that this is machine washable, I bought a plastic one which did not last long.</li>
            <li> It has a few snaps instead of velcro, which I love.</li>
            <li> The price was right, it&#x27;s plenty big, and it sheds the hair well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is pretty good at cutting my hair, but we don&#x27;t have a real chair.  </li>
            <li> The snaps are designed to give you endless size options and the fabric does not feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Easy to shake hair off of it, Big enough for an adult any size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional Lice Remover and we are switching over to these capes!</li>
            <li> If I had a chair with a higher back, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue though.</li>
            <li> Both are the same and so am returning the second one for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Maybe when I am ready to replace it the price will be back to what it is worth (or that of the other colors which are reasonably priced for the product.  </li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home because he is disabled and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too large, nor too big.</li>
            <li> I can only use this cape on certain people to insure that hair doesn&#x27;t end up on them</li>
            <li> Cover large enough to cover what needs to be covered.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> It is certainly large enough.</li>
            <li> Great cape for doing my hair cutting process.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand some of the negatives I&#x27;ve read about the neckline being too big --</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job as far as keeping the hair from getting all over my husband</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace an old cape I had.</li>
            <li> It covers the front, but won&#x27;t cover the back very well.</li>
            <li> I always felt like I was alive with all this&lt;br /&gt;loose hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> It folds small and washes easily.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, it should work much better as I uad to use Scotch tape to keep the other one closed</li>
            <li> Well I finally got smart and bought this barber cutting cape and life is now good again,</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger enough to cover the entire body, however it only covers full on one side.</li>
            <li> On larger guys, the cape does not cover the back as much as I&#x27;d like- hence the 4star rating.</li>
            <li> Back side is much too short.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very generous in size and may prove too big for smaller children.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance because he started cutting all of his friends&#x27; hair and he loves it and says that the hair slides right off of it and the button clasp is better than velcro.</li>
            <li> Fabric is very sturdy and will last forever as long as it isn&#x27;t abused.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I found with this item was that it is too short for an adult.  </li>
            <li> apparently this makes the cut.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone who may wish to cut hair (whether professionally or not)!</li>
            <li> Good quality cape for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> There should be one or two snaps near top of cape opening; instead, there are 3 on one side and 4 on the other  running down middle of each seam which makes no logical sense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cape and keeps hair from getting on your victim while styling up their new do.</li>
            <li> This cutting cape is nothing extraordinary or anything special, but it gets the job done for what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using a clear plastic cape that came with our cutters a long time ago.</li>
            <li> paid way too much for HALF OF A CAPE.  </li>
            <li> Item is black and covers person really well.</li>
            <li> Poorly made with the seams coming apart very quickly.</li>
            <li> The material is light and typical of something that you would have at a small time local neighborhood barbershop.  </li>
            <li> The snaps are spread out enough for large and small necks.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting this to completely wrap around, but it only covers maybe 6 inches down in the back.  </li>
            <li> The back isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> Long enough to be used as a superhero cape.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> and that is how many times it was washed on Permanent Press cycle in cold water.  </li>
            <li> - I can cut my husband&#x27;s hair, take this off him, carefully take it outside and shake it -</li>
            <li> I like that this cape is long and covers the knee when sitting.</li>
            <li> We will see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?</li>
            <li> I Needed this a long time ago</li>
            <li> I retired and decided that I would grow my hair long and have a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any amateur... or maybe even the professional!</li>
            <li> However, my only real complaint was that her not actually owning a salon, she was not very well equipped, and as such we ended up using old towels to keep my clippings off me.  </li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit short in the back.  </li>
            <li> the loose hair as it gets trimmed.</li>
            <li> so hair didn&#x27;t go down my kid&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> when she got finished I would have hair inside my shirt, and always down my back.</li>
            <li> The back as other have described is a little short</li>
            <li> , Solid Black</li>
            <li> I wish they would have made the barber cutting cape just a little bit longer in the back!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> never used yet tried on it will work great price is not to bad either for this product ! !</li>
            <li> THIS is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This worked, but was not real convenient.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be heavier for the price, but it seems to be sturdy.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a few different snap closures on it depending on your neck size.</li>
            <li> Material is thicker than expected and works well.</li>
            <li> This cape works, but certainly not barbershop or salon quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This also covers the back and goes down just a little below the lower trapezius muscles.</li>
            <li> When I went to use it it had snaps on one side but nothing on the other side to snap into.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I never understood why other models used Velcro...which immediately catches and traps (forever?)</li>
            <li> However, I paid LESS than half of the current $24.99 selling price for this black cape.  </li>
            <li> and they hate the hair clippings cause it makes them itch.......not any more.</li>
            <li> Keeps those pesky trimmings from getting all over my clothes...and down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should last a few years for the &amp;#34;at home haircuts&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I trim my husband&#x27;s hair in between haircuts and this keeps the mess to a minimum.</li>
            <li> my clippers and my 6 foot 6 inch husband didn&#x27;t like how little that cape covered.  </li>
            <li> Having little ones getting haircuts it helps keep hair from getting on clothes as it should</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little longer, but otherwise it did the job.</li>
            <li> It is wearing and little holes can be seen in spots.  </li>
            <li> , my wife has been cutting my hair for me with quite comparable results at a very steep discount.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t washed yet, but the material shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble holding up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I get this...when I give myself a Haircut....very nice</li>
            <li> I love that this is machine washable, I bought a plastic one which did not last long. I am also happy that this fits my dad who is 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I found with this item was that it is too short for an adult.  Not only that, but it won&#x27;t cover the back of the chair you&#x27;re sitting on very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would have liked a material that hair would slide off of more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These details are difficult to clarify in product descriptions, so be wary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too large, nor too big. Fits perfect and I&#x27;ve received no complaints from my family members that I&#x27;ve used it on. It has a few snaps instead of velcro, which I love. Makes it easy to put on and take off. Perfect, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Work well but tend to be cold when wrapped around a shirtless upper body.</li>
            <li> One of the snaps doesn&#x27;t stay closed but still work fine.</li>
            <li> I cut hair at home and find this cape to be a great addition. I never have to feel bad about getting someone&#x27;s shirt all hairy or the hairs tickling them uncomfortably. The hair easily glides off the cape and into the trashcan. I love the multiple snaps as it makes it easier to use the same cape with many people. On larger guys, the cape does not cover the back as much as I&#x27;d like- hence the 4star rating. I have learned to clip the hair in such a way that hairs do not get all over the back.</li>
            <li> This cape works, but certainly not barbershop or salon quality.  The material is pretty cheap feeling, but it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Would have been great if it had had snaps to close it like advertised.  Does me no good without having a way to close it!</li>
            <li> Much better than the one that comes stock in haircut kits.</li>
            <li> This cape is made from a sturdy material which seems to be holding up. I give my husband a haircut every week and bought this as a replacement for the vinyl cape that came with the hair cllippers. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The fabric is great and fits perfectly for when I&#x27;m getting my haircut.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality cape.  Better quality and way better price than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> This cutting cape is nothing extraordinary or anything special, but it gets the job done for what we wanted.  The material is light and typical of something that you would have at a small time local neighborhood barbershop.  The snaps are spread out enough for large and small necks.  There are indentations/bumps on the cape that help to catch hair as it falls.  I cut my husbands hair once every two weeks into a buzz cut.  This cape does a great job of catching hair, keeping it off him and our 2 year old son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend the cape as an affordable option for folks that don&#x27;t need anything special, but still want some good coverage.</li>
            <li> loved it came in handy when I got my bi-weekly buzz cut</li>
            <li> Great cape for doing my hair cutting process. Easy to put on and protects from falling hair and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Poorly made with the seams coming apart very quickly.</li>
            <li> works great. keeps the hair off your clothes. very satisfied. would definitely recommend to those in the hair business and those who cut hair at home</li>
            <li> The cape fits nicely around the neck.  Plenty of snaps for different size necks.  Hair slides right off of cape.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as you would expect it to do. Keeps the hair off the customer. Would recommend to anyone looking for a simple solution for a low price.</li>
            <li> if the guy in picture had fangs, he&#x27;d say, \\&quot;i vant to suck your blood!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy halloween.&lt;br /&gt;happy hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I love it! Well made and I&#x27;m saving money on hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Kind of thought from the picture and description that this would almost be like a poncho, but it&#x27;s meant for being in an actual barber chair.  There is enough of a backing to put over a chair, but if you are not in a barber chair, your back is exposed.  My girlfriend is pretty good at cutting my hair, but we don&#x27;t have a real chair.  I just usually sit on a stool so it&#x27;s easier to clean up, but with this cape, my back is still exposed.  Oh well, it&#x27;s better than nothing, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to fit like it did.</li>
            <li> Such a good price for such an effective cape.  Hair just slides right off, great coverage (drapes over the knees) and a good selection of snaps around the neck to adjust the fit.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a pro or cutting for the family this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Snap closures are misaligned and therefore ineffective in terms of securing cape around neck.  There should be one or two snaps near top of cape opening; instead, there are 3 on one side and 4 on the other  running down middle of each seam which makes no logical sense.  I bought one and returned it for replacement, hoping the new one would be better made.  Both are the same and so am returning the second one for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I opened this about one month after ordering it. When I went to use it it had snaps on one side but nothing on the other side to snap into.  Had to use a safety pin to hold it together. Not sure if  want to pay the postage to return it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for home or shop and easy to throw in washer and hang dry in minutes. A must have if you cut hair</li>
            <li> I use this cape each time I cut hair, I just wish it was waterproof.  as I&#x27;m wetting their hair, it leaks through.</li>
            <li> Well maybe in a barber shop one can cut hair without any cape at all in the back.. THIS is not what I expected.  THe cape has NO BACK SIDE TO IT.  seriously.&lt;br /&gt;I THINK, since mostly retail buyers are shopping here, that MAYBE they &#x27;might&#x27; have considered to SHOW the BACK IN THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;I paid way too much for HALF OF A CAPE.  Home users want full coverage.  We dont have salon chairs and the skills that magically keep hair off our clothes. / OK</li>
            <li> So this is a cheap Barber cape.  My first rodeo with a barber cape.  This is not like what is found at barber shops; there isn&#x27;t much of a back to it.  The cape simply clasps around the neck.  Haven&#x27;t put it though the paces, yet.</li>
            <li> great cape.. great length.. use for family when in pinch and can&#x27;t make to barber... works great, cleans and dusts off easily</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like the non-sticky material that is comfortable to wear and easy to shake clean.  Good system of adjustable snaps for&lt;br /&gt;around-the-neck sizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance because he started cutting all of his friends&#x27; hair and he loves it and says that the hair slides right off of it and the button clasp is better than velcro.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and he has a big neck, so I have to snap this cape in the second holes to accommodate him.  Other than that, it is made from a good grade of plastic and works well for us.</li>
            <li> This is a really comfortable cape that does it&#x27;s job well. It&#x27;s definitely more for teenagers to adults but the neck sizes don&#x27;t really fit younger children. I still use it on my 2 and 3 year olds but there is definitely a gap around the neck with them. Overall though an effective cape that keeps hair out.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this cape as it covers you totally and keeps the hair off, minimal cleaning up after the cut.</li>
            <li> Sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li> i like the barber cape !!! but it looks nothing like the picture !!!!!!!! has no stripes , it is not seersucker !!!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BARBER CUTTING CAPE. VERY DURABLE. AS DESCRIBED. I AM VERY PLEASED. THANK YOU AMAZON. HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. Item is black and covers person really well.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the plastic bag that came with the trimmer.  It allows you to stay cool when getting your hair cut.</li>
            <li> Great large size. Good quality, this has lasted for about 3 years with occasional use. I bought this to do my husbands hair at home.</li>
            <li> These are very good capes. They look great and clean easily.  I&#x27;m a professional Lice Remover and we are switching over to these capes!</li>
            <li> I have three boys who get haircuts from dad.  This was a great investment and fits my kids well.  I don&#x27;t really understand some of the negatives I&#x27;ve read about the neckline being too big -- My boys are ages 2, 4, and 6 and there&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> I started doing home haircuts a couple of months ago. The length of the cover is nice.The snaps secure comfortably around the neck. I would recommend this cover as an accessory for haircuts.</li>
            <li> price is right and do the job</li>
            <li> Could be longer in the back. Good material and big enough in front. Covers arms well. Worth the price paid</li>
            <li> I got tired of grabbing towels to drape around my home &amp;#34;customers.&amp;#34;  This works very well and it easy care.</li>
            <li> never used yet tried on it will work great price is not to bad either for this product ! !</li>
            <li> Love this this cape...and so do my clients.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cool and light weight with very large coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great too.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product. I like that it has snaps around the collar. It is very easy to keep clean and is quite durable.</li>
            <li> The cape is of great quality, but the back is very short and looks odd after it&#x27;s around the neck. I can only use this cape on certain people to insure that hair doesn&#x27;t end up on them</li>
            <li> does what its suppose to&lt;br /&gt;quality is good too!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m kind of a cheap skate and rather than pay a barber to cut my hair every two or three weeks, my wife has been cutting my hair for me with quite comparable results at a very steep discount.  However, my only real complaint was that her not actually owning a salon, she was not very well equipped, and as such we ended up using old towels to keep my clippings off me.  This worked, but was not real convenient.  Enter the Betty Dain Classic Stripe Barber Cutting Cape.  I guess I&#x27;m not real sure what separates the great capes from the inferior capes in the high stakes world of barbers and beauticians, but in my admittedly uninformed opinion this cape does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It remains solidly snapped around my neck and keeps my hair off of me.  If this is all you require in a barber cape, then I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love that you can shake this out and all the hairs fall off so easily. I thought the size, even of the parts in the back were adequate. If I needed another, I definitely would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I cut my husband and two boys hair, and really needed a better cape.  I bought this one, and I&#x27;ve really liked it.  For the price I think it&#x27;s excellent and very sturdy, my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit short in the back.  If I had a chair with a higher back, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue though.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, is pretty large.</li>
            <li> very durable, and made out of quality material.  Haven&#x27;t washed yet, but the material shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble holding up.</li>
            <li> How did I ever do without this it&#x27;s great..</li>
            <li> I really like this and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I cut hair at home.  The cheap thin vinyl cape that comes with the clippers was not holding up, so we decided to try this.  I like that it has snaps and makes the neck adjustable.  I love that it is machine washable.  I would recommend it to any amateur... or maybe even the professional!</li>
            <li> I really loved  them.  I wanted 2, but had only one.</li>
            <li> Its just ok....I would have liked it to be longer at the back.  It does works though, and washes easily.</li>
            <li> This barber cape works like a dream - I can cut my husband&#x27;s hair, take this off him, carefully take it outside and shake it - all the hair comes right off. I can&#x27;t think of anything that would make this simple cape better.</li>
            <li> Very good product for a good price! Highly recommend it to anyone who may wish to cut hair (whether professionally or not)!</li>
            <li> A nice cape. Cover large enough to cover what needs to be covered.&lt;br /&gt;Fits well around my neck. Hair cleans off with a quick shake.</li>
            <li> This is just the right size and the nylon fabric makes it slippery enough that the hair falls right off. This went with the clipper set I purchased perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, keeps the hair off, and has enough snap options that you can get a pretty snug fit on different necks.  Breathes well.</li>
            <li> I cut my sons&#x27; hair at home and I use this cape; it works very well. A good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great Cape, hair slides off easily and doesn&#x27;t stick. Seems to be well constructed, will update my review in six months.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality and size is to small.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Don&#x27;t buy this product... just looks good on photo only!</li>
            <li> I am glad we bought this.  Works great and it is a great value.  I did not price them anywhere else but $10 is not too bad for this cape.</li>
            <li> bought this to help with the hair mess on the kids when cutting their hair. Works great! No more itchy backs!!</li>
            <li> This has been great. The price was right, it&#x27;s plenty big, and it sheds the hair well. Definitely worth it if you do a lot of haircutting at home.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Easy to shake hair off of it, Big enough for an adult any size.  would recommend it but I am not hair profecional.</li>
            <li> I bought this cape on insistence from my husband.  I was using the plastic cape that came with my clippers and my 6 foot 6 inch husband didn&#x27;t like how little that cape covered.  This cape has a nice feel to it and with the snaps on the neck I am able to make it fit my husband and both my kids with no gaps for hair to fall down their back. I like that this cape is long and covers the knee when sitting.</li>
            <li> Betty Dain Betty Dain Classic Stripe Barber Cutting Cape, Solid Black the best barber cape i have ever owned, love it !</li>
            <li> great item good price fast delivery</li>
            <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> Plenty of coverage on the front.  Back side is much too short.  The picture is somewhat deceiving.  The back length stops just below the should blades.  My search continues for a better cape.</li>
            <li> Useful product.  Great for keeping cigar ashes off clothes when driving -- where short back is a benefit.</li>
            <li> great quality and coverage in back and front</li>
            <li> The cape does exactly what it supposed to do..keep hair out of my shirt. We will see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li> i bought this with lots of hair cutting stuff nice fits any size and is salon quality and cheap used it over 20 times and still holding up great product</li>
            <li> Very cheap made don&#x27;t get it.  it feels that you are where a plastic bag.  I will never get one or tell some one to get this one.</li>
            <li> I use this cape once a month when cutting my husbands hair.  It does it&#x27;s job as far as keeping the hair from getting all over my husband but he says its really hot to wear.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It is light weight and has great coverage.  There is also many snaps to adjust to many sizes.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be heavier for the price, but it seems to be sturdy. It is certainly large enough. I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home because he is disabled and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> work as it should. Having little ones getting haircuts it helps keep hair from getting on clothes as it should</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy one of my i tried snapping together and it didn&#x27;t snap so i had to adjust to a high snap don&#x27;t bout buy go with the velcro instead of snaps/button on</li>
            <li> I wish they would have made the barber cutting cape just a little bit longer in the back!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s ok. Yes, I would recommend it to friends or family.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent. No hair went insde. I wish they added more buttons though so that all sizes are literally covered. Click here to view the video [...]</li>
            <li> Nice Quality compared to others</li>
            <li> Perfect, nice and cool and comfortable!</li>
            <li> This cape has been the best cape I have ever bought in my 10 years of being a barber. I recommend this item very highly.</li>
            <li> Adjust to most sizes and keeps the kids from complaining about being itchy which keeps them still for a little longer.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Usually my wife cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Until last time, I felt stress so I had no covering cloth.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it makes me more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean the best barber cape I have ever owned. I recommend this cape.  for people who cut their own hair.</li>
            <li> I love everything Betty Dain makes. Awesome stuff for hair stylist. I am always pleased with their stuff. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to cut hair at home, and it&#x27;s not one of those cheap plastic robes.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving a man&#x27;s beard and probably men&#x27;s haircuts. Do not buy this for cutting woman&#x27;s hair. The back isn&#x27;t long enough. I am very happy with it for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Good quality material</li>
            <li> This cape is awesome. Im a at home barber and was using the cheap cape that comes with the clippers (thats a joke). This cape is a 100x better. Its a good size, I have used on both kids and adults.</li>
            <li> Excellent cape; good quality; hair slides right off.  No more towels, cloths and messes.  Why did I wait so long?</li>
            <li> the barbers love them</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to completely wrap around, but it only covers maybe 6 inches down in the back.  That said it does the job fine but I think they should have added more material to the back side.</li>
            <li> this cape works really well. however getting my hair-cut outside or inside, it makes me sweat.  it does a good job, and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Works as it should and wears well.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the $$ and good value,&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with velcro but the snaps are decent</li>
            <li> I was no expecting much when I placed the order but was pleasantly surprised when I started using the cape. It is well constructed and the snaps look like they will be very durable. Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll look like Dracula, so what! Snap closure around neck fit perfectly snug for me &amp; there&#x27;s a few different snap closures on it depending on your neck size. Doesn&#x27;t close around your back but that&#x27;s fine; had to take a star away for that though.</li>
            <li> This cape has a nice texture that makes the hair you cut, seem to just fall right off to the floor.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. I recently started using an electric clipper to cut my hair. It&#x27;s not necessarily a revolutionary idea (as good old-fashioned barbers have been using these for decades), but it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a snap closure, which is what the &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34; use. Very comfortable. I never understood why other models used Velcro...which immediately catches and traps (forever?) the loose hair as it gets trimmed. Yuk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big guy, but this cape covers me perfectly well. Keeps those pesky trimmings from getting all over my clothes...and down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Does the job for occasional haircuts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for around $10, which was a great investment! I cut my husband&#x27;s hair once a month at home and this cape does the job of keeping the hair off of him. You can fold this up and put it away easily too. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Its an okay cape covers up the customers well but after a couple of months it tore at the neck maybe from force.</li>
            <li> Long enough to be used as a superhero cape. :-p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also covers the back and goes down just a little below the lower trapezius muscles.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to keep the hair out of my collar. If you are looking to buy something like this, this is IT!</li>
            <li> Nice quality cape for home hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Nice material but short in back.</li>
            <li> Nice cape.  It folds small and washes easily. I trim my husband&#x27;s hair in between haircuts and this keeps the mess to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Thats the only word I can use to describe this item I would recommend it to anyone I mean anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a barber&#x27;s cape.  What can I say.  It works fine.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace an old cape I had. Good quality cape for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed. The snaps old very good, and the hair falls right off when your done.</li>
            <li> Bought it for haircuts to keep hair from body and clothing. It works well for this purpose and the fabric is good quality.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger enough to cover the entire body, however it only covers full on one side.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and he always complains about air on him.  I wish it were a little longer, but otherwise it did the job.</li>
            <li> Cape fits okay but there wasn&#x27;t a button that fit snugly with my neck size. The back as other have described is a little short but it will still work. Fabric is very sturdy and will last forever as long as it isn&#x27;t abused. Machine washable and Made In USA which are also pluses.</li>
            <li> This cape sure did the trick.  It fits well, has adjustable neck snaps, and the seersucker fabric does not get hot while wearing and the hair quickly falls off while shaking outside.  It washes well and is a welcome addition for giving home haircuts.  I would recommend this and buy another when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2/4/2015 I have used this cape exactly 27 times in two years and that is how many times it was washed on Permanent Press cycle in cold water.  It is wearing and little holes can be seen in spots.  The snaps are still strong and work well for a tight fit. However, I paid LESS than half of the current $24.99 selling price for this black cape.  Maybe when I am ready to replace it the price will be back to what it is worth (or that of the other colors which are reasonably priced for the product.  I do like the cape and the seersucker material is great, just not very strong. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the coverage in the back.  I cut my own hair and it covers me pretty well.</li>
            <li> the fabric is kinda weird but it has a good size and i like the snap closure which is better than the velcro, i recommend it</li>
            <li> My wife has been my in home barber for years.  The cheap plastic cape that came with the clippers died long ago.  We tried getting by without one until I spotted this one on Amazon.  It has proven to be a great choice.  The fabric is thin, but sturdy.  It sheds clipped hair like the ones used in shops.  The neck has multiple snap adjustment.  When we finish, I shake it out and put it up for next time.&lt;br /&gt;It is very generous in size and may prove too big for smaller children.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using a clear plastic cape that came with our cutters a long time ago. It worked but not so well. While I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, it should work much better as I uad to use Scotch tape to keep the other one closed so hair didn&#x27;t go down my kid&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> I do all the haircuts for my boys at home and they hate the hair clippings cause it makes them itch.......not any more. Their cuts have become more pleasant for them and less frustrating for me. I Needed this a long time ago lol</li>
            <li> i have a 22 inch neck and i can use this awesome and my kids can too</li>
            <li> It is nice to finally have a cape that will cover the enitre body. Beats the small plastic ones you can get,plus it doesn&#x27;t stick to your body.Very impressed, good price</li>
            <li> The item was shipped timely.  What I received for a pattern isn&#x27;t what the picture looks like, but it will work for what I am using it for.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am now cutting my husbands hair. It covers the front, but won&#x27;t cover the back very well. Not too happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Use this when I buzz cut my kids hair.  Work well to keep it off them.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this for all of one haircut before it got stolen from me. Of all the things to steal- apparently this makes the cut. Enjoy it, whoever and wherever you are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cape and keeps hair from getting on your victim while styling up their new do. Light wait and fits my 3 year old. It&#x27;s all I ever wanted in a cape.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cape and does exactly what it should do!  The snaps are designed to give you endless size options and the fabric does not feel cheap. Should last a few years for the &amp;#34;at home haircuts&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> good detail of what it has and does great ship time and great costumer service . .would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have had some sort of hair on my face. When I was still working, I would go to the barber like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;Then I retired and decided that I would grow my hair long and have a ponytail. I also decided I could trim my own beard. So for&lt;br /&gt;quite some time I&#x27;ve been having my wife do the trimming for me cause she says I do a crummy job. She would put a towel on me&lt;br /&gt;and when she got finished I would have hair inside my shirt, and always down my back. I always felt like I was alive with all this&lt;br /&gt;loose hair everywhere. Well I finally got smart and bought this barber cutting cape and life is now good again, If you cut your own&lt;br /&gt;hair, you need one of these.</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight seersucker material.  Doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin or clothes and perfect for haircuts.  I love the fact that there are snaps around neckline so you can adjust to many size necks.  Will update at a later date after using this cape for awhile.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is made in the USA!!  I cut my husbands hair at home and this is a quality product!  Recommend it to anyone that needs a cutting cape!</li>
            <li> Material is thicker than expected and works well. Item arrived quickly. Works well for both adults and children. Should last a long time.</li>
