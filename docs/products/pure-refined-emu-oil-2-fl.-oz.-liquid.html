    <ol>
            <li>This is great stuff !!</li>
            <li>Best decision of my life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were told by a plastic surgeon friend to use this, as he had had patients who had gotten great results with emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen remarkable results.</li>
            <li>it feel so good on my face...</li>
            <li>am hoping this one has a good story unlike the others</li>
            <li>Might be a good brand of EMU Oil</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s moisturizing properties are not that good.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll prob need about 1 &amp;1/2 more bottles to see improvement.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;re some important factors that must be adhered in order to see a difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and I am really excited about the results so far.</li>
            <li>I decided to try using the emu oil on the spot, and after a few days, the patch seems to have disappeared and the area is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This oil is excellent, especially for people of African descent, who tend to have dry hair.</li>
            <li>As someone who makes her own lotion and has tested oils on the skin from regular olive oil to all natural shea butter, I will have to say that this product is overhyped.</li>
            <li>My hair is in the recovery mode and becoming fuller and this product has made it possible.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that my hairs look much healthier.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to treat my edges, hair line, they were very sparse.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really work on my hair</li>
            <li>While it is more moisturizing than olive oil, it pales in comparison to plain old pure unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>i can see new growth</li>
            <li>but I ordered it directly to the company</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these were not deep gashes, her skin was cut from beside her right eye down below her jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few months ago it was discovered that I had Impetigo on my right hand.</li>

            <li> A few months ago it was discovered that I had Impetigo on my right hand.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted me about a month, my hair/ roots are pretty thick.</li>
            <li> and it eventually went away, although every once and a while I get a dry and itchy spot on the same area.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much results from just 1 bottle but a small amount def goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This can become tedious, but I promise you, this is what assists with blood circulating to the area which is the primary cause, regardless of addt&#x27;l reasons.</li>
            <li> Not every 5 days, whenever your long haired friend flips her hair, etc.</li>
            <li> Doing it in the morning will allow you to do it with energy and not after a long, stressful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Add</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 3weeks, I&#x27;m starting to see a little bit of results but not tremendously.</li>

            <li> Bull.. Don&#x27;t believe the you tube hype</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it for over a month now and I can already see my edges growing back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for Amazon to mail it to me (a month) but I ordered it directly to the company and I have to say that my hairs look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much results from just 1 bottle but a small amount def goes a long way. The bottle lasted me about a month, my hair/ roots are pretty thick. I was expecting to see some improvement on a bald spot I have. I guess it takes time, I&#x27;ll prob need about 1 &amp;1/2 more bottles to see improvement. Consistency is key to regrowing balding areas of the hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent, especially for people of African descent, who tend to have dry hair. I am using it for thinning crown and edges and I&#x27;ve seen remarkable results. Some people have criticisms, but possibly used the product in a manner that wasn&#x27;t beneficial. Here&#x27;re some important factors that must be adhered in order to see a difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-MUST USE DAILY!!! Not every 5 days, whenever your long haired friend flips her hair, etc. Every day. Consistency is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Gently massage it in for at least 5 min. This can become tedious, but I promise you, this is what assists with blood circulating to the area which is the primary cause, regardless of addt&#x27;l reasons. Doing it in the morning will allow you to do it with energy and not after a long, stressful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Add a pinch of tumeric &amp; cayenne each to the oil. This again helps the oil stimulate circulation. Indian women use this on their hair to proven results. So have I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have researched PRP hair treatments, Bosley, hair transplants, Rogaine, and NONE OF THESE BASTARDS will work as well for the costs. Just do it.</li>
            <li> dont like the odor, it tends to get rancy after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;i still use it from time to time.</li>
            <li> A few months ago it was discovered that I had Impetigo on my right hand. My doctor gave me some cream to put on it and it eventually went away, although every once and a while I get a dry and itchy spot on the same area.  I decided to try using the emu oil on the spot, and after a few days, the patch seems to have disappeared and the area is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife suffered a four inch scratch to her face when our cat reached out to her when falling from an eight foot ledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these were not deep gashes, her skin was cut from beside her right eye down below her jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were told by a plastic surgeon friend to use this, as he had had patients who had gotten great results with emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has now been using the emu oil three times a day for the past five weeks, and there is almost no scarring.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to treat my edges, hair line, they were very sparse.  My hair is in the recovery mode and becoming fuller and this product has made it possible.</li>
            <li> It is not! greasy!....you only need a..drop!....it feel so good on my face...you can add a few drops to your bath water...you can use it in your hair as well...but they also make the shampoo and conditioner which I bought as well..smile...But I learned this later if you buy the shampoo and conditioner...this 2oz ! jar comes with it..&amp;#34;free&amp;#34;!...Smile....</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help me get rid of my age spots on my hand.  As of two weeks of using the product, the spots are about half gone.</li>
            <li> Jst ordered dis product waiting to receive it thru amazon.have had less hair in my edges for years and believe me have used all sorts of products on my hair am hoping this one has a good story unlike the others</li>
            <li> This is great stuff !! It works on just about anything !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 3weeks, I&#x27;m starting to see a little bit of results but not tremendously.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell.  Might be a good brand of EMU Oil but I can&#x27;t take the rancid smell.</li>
            <li> As someone who makes her own lotion and has tested oils on the skin from regular olive oil to all natural shea butter, I will have to say that this product is overhyped. It doesn&#x27;t do anything that it claims it does and it&#x27;s moisturizing properties are not that good. While it is more moisturizing than olive oil, it pales in comparison to plain old pure unrefined shea butter. If you want ultimate moisture, this product is not it. Just go use shea butter.</li>
            <li> This stuff really work on my hair i can see new growth i order another bottle</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube (regarding it&#x27;s assistant with hair growth), and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try considering it&#x27;s low priced.  Best decision of my life.</li>
            <li> Product does not work</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about three weeks ago for my edges and it seems to be working. This product is amazing and I am really excited about the results so far. I will continue to use it and document the progress and keep you posted!</li>
