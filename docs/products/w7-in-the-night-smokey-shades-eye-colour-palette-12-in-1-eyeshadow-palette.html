            <li>This arrived very quickly and is a great product!</li>
            <li>Loved all of these colors</li>
            <li>The colors are good some</li>
            <li>I also was very pleased at the end of the day when I would wash my face and my eye makeup</li>
            <li>I did have to pat them on to get the best color rather that brush them on, but I do that with most shadows, so that is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I love this palette!</li>
            <li>Some colors need a bit of water to wear longer and better but for the most they all look great on.</li>
            <li>but I am absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>Really nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It is a nice palette and the colors are really nice.</li>
            <li>love it nice colors good pimentacion</li>
            <li>Really nice sets.</li>
            <li>These are nicely packed.</li>
            <li>really nice, great price and quick  delivery.</li>
            <li>As for the color pay-off, I was pleased with how nicely these shadows looked.</li>
            <li>It is very fine &amp; powdery &amp; ended up all over my face.</li>
            <li>They are pigmented really nicely and easy to blend and apply to eye area.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty, and they have good pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping the quality of the eye shadow would be a lot better.</li>
            <li>and I love that they have a shimmer to them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what they were going to look like from the picture it displayed</li>
            <li>And I love the metal case it comes in.</li>
            <li>I love this colors  </li>
            <li>They turn into more of a smokey gray, but again, that could just be on my skin.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all, I love it for the price, and will probably purchase another color palette.</li>
            <li>They look better at the end of a night than most of my palettes that are more than triple the price.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more :-)</li>
            <li>Oh, how I love this palette.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Love the pallet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok like drugstore eyeshadow</li>
            <li>this is similar but better because is more cheap!!!!</li>
            <li>Super cute colors!</li>
            <li>but this one id pretty good.</li>
            <li>As good as high end brands.</li>
            <li>I love more than others but the price was right.</li>
            <li>I love the shades of purple -- so bright and pretty, and they really compliment my brown eyes.</li>
            <li>Cheap eyeshadow, no pigment</li>
            <li>It makes it so secure</li>
            <li>chipped, so the shipping wasn&#x27;t all that great, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to raise a fuss about.  </li>
            <li>If you have a great eye primer, it only needs to be applied once.  </li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic for a night out and go on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>perfect if you dont want to spend too much money on product but need several colors for proms/bridal make up</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this pallet.  </li>
            <li>Colors are pretty pigmented love that they stay on</li>
            <li>Great palette to experiment with if you&#x27;re not normally into the smoky shades!</li>
            <li>I love these palettes so much I&#x27;ve bought all 3 of them.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get lucky with make-up and can find low priced, good quality dupes, and</li>
            <li>The packaging is strong, well made, and pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors are definitely a bit different than what you see in pictures but most of them are still quite beautiful but</li>
            <li>I bought this palette and it came quickly</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors but</li>
            <li>and they actually look better without the primer!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>I guess whatever chemical process is used for the tins sometimes has a lingering odor, but it disappeared pretty quickly after I unpacked it &amp; placed it in my makeup cabinet.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>The colors are right up my alley.</li>
            <li>Not what we all think but decent even cheap on price.</li>
            <li>This is the first pallette from W7 I purchased</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty...</li>
            <li>I first discovered W7 cosmetic products while watching Lisa Eldridge, a prolific makeup artist based in the UK, on Youtube.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>First, these are not high-end items, and I know that you get what pay for.</li>
            <li>Other reviews I saw were correct in that the colors go on lightly, but can easily be built up to a darker shade.  </li>
            <li>I noticed they don&#x27;t stay on a full day, even with setting spray, like some of the higher end palettes, but you can&#x27;t expect high end unless you are buying high end</li>
            <li>I can’t remember exactly, but I got them somewhere between 8-10 days, a much briefer arrival time than the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li>(they don&#x27;t last long and are rather muddy and unimpressive pigment-wise), but the set is priced fairly.</li>
            <li>I have experienced less fall out with these colors then some of my urban decay ones.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks GOD</li>
            <li>I really don’t get upset about this flaw in the packaging for two reasons.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the real one.</li>
            <li>The lighter shades are slightly less so, but still pretty good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Like the other metal tin palettes in this line, the darker shades are gorgeously pigmented, easy to blend, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love the black in this</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant</li>
            <li>A decent palette.</li>
            <li>For the price, product is decent.</li>
            <li>I got her two different other variants also that she liked.</li>
            <li>The shades are a bit crumbly so I&#x27;d recommend wetting the brush to have it sit a little better on the lid.</li>
            <li>I am in love with W7, I have all of the palettes minus In the Buff, that is next on my list!</li>
            <li>I used my regular primer first</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the pigmentation of all of the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to an 7 year old for play makeup.</li>
            <li>would look almost exactly the same way as when I put it on that morning, even in the 100 degree plus days that we have had recently.</li>
            <li>Mine did come in with the black (all the way at the end on the right)</li>
            <li>This product is highly pigmented and long wearing.  </li>
            <li>These shadows are very sparkly yet not much color payoff.</li>
            <li>I think it “off-gassed” within a few hours, if I remember right.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitate at first from some reviews saying the shadow didn&#x27;t stay on all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t compare to any of the actual naked palettes I have, but its fun to just mess around with.</li>

            <li> Second, I am simply not going to send this item back to the U.K. for a replacement, especially since a new one could arrive just as damaged, if not more so.</li>
            <li> does not last long on the eye.</li>
            <li> Really neat color but works better with a base under it so the colors stick and</li>
            <li> It even came in earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Usually comes early too!</li>
            <li> I found the shadow to be crumbly and not highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Little does she remember, I get the mail, and actually monitor my emails and bank account.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about your makeup getting crushed.</li>
            <li> The black is the only matte dark color.</li>
            <li> The purple shades look the same, at least on my skin, and they are not as purple on my face as in the palette.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to getting their other pallettes!</li>
            <li> Received in less than 1 week after ordering.</li>
            <li> and it is the black.</li>
            <li> Inside the eyeshadows sit in a hard foam type encasement and it also has a brush with a foam tip and small regular brush tip.</li>
            <li> Did take a little while to ship</li>
            <li> A couple of the colors are a little drier that I would like.</li>
            <li> Two of the 5 palettes arrived with one of the little hinge pins on the back either missing or broken.</li>
            <li> They blended out well and there was very little fall out.</li>
            <li> I usually dont care for the brushes that come with pallets</li>
            <li> and you have to apply it thickly, even with primer.</li>
            <li> With this palette the colors are also very hard to blend out .</li>
            <li> arrived broken but still usable</li>
            <li> The wonky lid is inconvenient, but no biggie to me.</li>
            <li> but the colors are very bad quality and don&#x27;t stay on too long, but then agian you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the colors would not be pigmented, but</li>
            <li> So I saw this was coming, and wasn&#x27;t too mad, because hey, it was on my wish list to begin with!  </li>

            <li> I love these palettes so much I&#x27;ve bought all 3 of them. Some colors need a bit of water to wear longer and better but for the most they all look great on. Who needs designer makeup prices after getting these.</li>
            <li> This is the first pallette from W7 I purchased and I&#x27;m so happy I got it! I was a little hesitate at first from some reviews saying the shadow didn&#x27;t stay on all day. I used my regular primer first and  they last all day! Beautiful colors at a great price! Shipped super fast! Received in less than 1 week after ordering. I&#x27;m looking forward to getting their other pallettes! 😊</li>
            <li> I bought this palette and it came quickly but the colors are very bad quality and don&#x27;t stay on too long, but then agian you get what you paid for. It doesn&#x27;t compare to any of the actual naked palettes I have, but its fun to just mess around with.</li>
            <li> Cheap eyeshadow, no pigment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty...does not last long on the eye.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the quality of the eye shadow would be a lot better. I kept having to reapply the eye shadow because it faded after wearing it for a couple hours but I do like the colors! I just wish the shadow would STAY on all day...</li>
            <li> I have experienced less fall out with these colors then some of my urban decay ones. Very impressed, love the affordability of it.</li>
            <li> I first discovered W7 cosmetic products while watching Lisa Eldridge, a prolific makeup artist based in the UK, on Youtube. She often uses W7 products  in her videos.  The product arrived within 7 days after I placed my order. I was pleasantly surprised by the pigmentation of all of the eye shadows. In addition, I got compliments on the various looks I created with these eye shadows. I will order again. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this pallet.  The colors are so vibrant and I love that they have a shimmer to them. I wasn&#x27;t sure what they were going to look like from the picture it displayed but I am absolutely loving it. It even came in earlier than expected. I will definitely be ordering more. And I love the metal case it comes in. It makes it so secure and you don&#x27;t have to worry about your makeup getting crushed.</li>
            <li> My teenager &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; ordered this off my wish list, and I think she was hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t notice.  Little does she remember, I get the mail, and actually monitor my emails and bank account.  So I saw this was coming, and wasn&#x27;t too mad, because hey, it was on my wish list to begin with!  The colors are very pretty, and they have good pigmentation.  I noticed they don&#x27;t stay on a full day, even with setting spray, like some of the higher end palettes, but you can&#x27;t expect high end unless you are buying high end, right?  Mine did come in with the black (all the way at the end on the right) chipped, so the shipping wasn&#x27;t all that great, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to raise a fuss about.  If you like these colors, and are looking for something affordable, definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> Really nice packaging. The colors are pigmented and very beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to do some youtube tutorials with it. Thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a case or palette of 12 eyeshadows. It has smokey eye shades from pinks to purples. It comes in a titanium case. Inside the eyeshadows sit in a hard foam type encasement and it also has a brush with a foam tip and small regular brush tip. Eleven of the twelve colors have glitter and some sheen to them. The black is the only matte dark color. They are pigmented really nicely and easy to blend and apply to eye area. The case size is comparable to the UD Naked palettes. It is a nice palette and the colors are really nice.</li>
            <li> This product is highly pigmented and long wearing.  As good as high end brands.</li>
            <li> A decent palette. Not what we all think but decent even cheap on price.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as shown in the picture</li>
            <li> perfect if you dont want to spend too much money on product but need several colors for proms/bridal make up</li>
            <li> I love this colors  will buy different one&#x27;s soon</li>
            <li> Never tried this brand before but it came on time and looked great. I can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> Like the other metal tin palettes in this line, the darker shades are gorgeously pigmented, easy to blend, and long lasting. The lighter shades are slightly less so, but still pretty good quality, especially for the price. I love the shades of purple -- so bright and pretty, and they really compliment my brown eyes. The packaging is strong, well made, and pretty. Overall, I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks GOD i i didn&#x27;t  pay 50 dollars for the naked palette this is similar but better because is more cheap!!!! love it nice colors good pimentacion</li>
            <li> arrived broken but still usable</li>
            <li> If you have a great eye primer, it only needs to be applied once.  If not, you may need a touch up.  Other reviews I saw were correct in that the colors go on lightly, but can easily be built up to a darker shade.  The purple shades look the same, at least on my skin, and they are not as purple on my face as in the palette.  They turn into more of a smokey gray, but again, that could just be on my skin.  All-in-all, I love it for the price, and will probably purchase another color palette.</li>
            <li> These palettes are actually perfection in a case.  I ever w7 palette I&#x27;ve purchased and this one is no exception! The colors are fantastic for a night out and go on so smooth.  They look better at the end of a night than most of my palettes that are more than triple the price.  Never going back!</li>
            <li> For the price, product is decent. Color payoff is meh and you have to apply it thickly, even with primer.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting such a bulky tin and was underwhelmed with the durability and opacity of eyeshadows within (they don&#x27;t last long and are rather muddy and unimpressive pigment-wise), but the set is priced fairly. Product arrived promptly and without any damage from shipping.</li>
            <li> Loved all of these colors</li>
            <li> These shadows are very sparkly yet not much color payoff. I tried to give this pallet to my daughter and she agreed they are horrid.</li>
            <li> Would buy againg ! In great shape when arrived!</li>
            <li> Really neat color but works better with a base under it so the colors stick and the pigment shows up as it should.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I will be ordering more :-)</li>
            <li> Worth the price. I ended up giving it to an 7 year old for play makeup.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and is a great product!</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty pigmented love that they stay on i am planning on buying every pallet they have. Did take a little while to ship but it cam in perfect condition. I usually dont care for the brushes that come with pallets but this one id pretty good.</li>
            <li> The product looks great until you try to apply it.  I found the shadow to be crumbly and not highly pigmented.  Sometimes you get lucky with make-up and can find low priced, good quality dupes, and sometimes $7 make-up is just that, $7 make-up.  I am not a fan.</li>
            <li> Oh, how I love this palette. The colors are right up my alley. One of them even has holographic glitter! There is only one truly matte color and it is the black. The others range from a bit shimmery to the one with all that holographic goodness. Can&#x27;t wait to play.</li>
            <li> color are brite and stay on all day</li>
            <li> The part I don&#x27;t like with any of these palettes is that there is only 2 or 3 matte shades out of 12. With this palette the colors are also very hard to blend out . The colors are definitely a bit different than what you see in pictures but most of them are still quite beautiful but not what I would consider a smokey palette. Start of a smokey eye yes.</li>
            <li> I use all four of these all the time.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful. A couple of the colors are a little drier that I would like. I&#x27;ve used this with a primer and it seem to last all day. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as i wanted them to be</li>
            <li> W7 is a British company and it shipped from the U.K. by the Royal Mail. I can’t remember exactly, but I got them somewhere between 8-10 days, a much briefer arrival time than the estimated arrival date. Price: A+ Although I like the cute tin, it is not the best quality. Two of the 5 palettes arrived with one of the little hinge pins on the back either missing or broken. I really don’t get upset about this flaw in the packaging for two reasons. First, these are not high-end items, and I know that you get what pay for. Second, I am simply not going to send this item back to the U.K. for a replacement, especially since a new one could arrive just as damaged, if not more so. The wonky lid is inconvenient, but no biggie to me. Some reviews mentioned an off smell, and I did notice that on one of the palettes (don’t remember which one). I guess whatever chemical process is used for the tins sometimes has a lingering odor, but it disappeared pretty quickly after I unpacked it &amp; placed it in my makeup cabinet. I think it “off-gassed” within a few hours, if I remember right. Again, these are not high-end items, and the odor didn’t bother me. Packaging: C- As for the color pay-off, I was pleased with how nicely these shadows looked. I did have to pat them on to get the best color rather that brush them on, but I do that with most shadows, so that is fine with me. They blended out well and there was very little fall out. I also was very pleased at the end of the day when I would wash my face and my eye makeup would look almost exactly the same way as when I put it on that morning, even in the 100 degree plus days that we have had recently. Color, ease of use, and lasting through the day: A</li>
            <li> She can do a lot with this palette. I got her two different other variants also that she liked.</li>
            <li> Super cute colors! The shades are a bit crumbly so I&#x27;d recommend wetting the brush to have it sit a little better on the lid. Ordered the 3rd palette and have the &#x27;In the Nude&#x27; as well. Big fan of the shadows and can&#x27;t beat the price! Usually comes early too!</li>
            <li> Great palette to experiment with if you&#x27;re not normally into the smoky shades!</li>
            <li> It was ok. I love the black in this</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> i bought several of this brand.  Color goes on and stays on.  Shimmer shades are beautiful</li>
            <li> Really nice sets. These are nicely packed. Eye shadows  really nice, great price and quick  delivery.</li>
            <li> Love the pallet. The colors are good some I love more than others but the price was right.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors but quality is different than naked palette. It is very fine &amp; powdery &amp; ended up all over my face. It&#x27;s ok like drugstore eyeshadow but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the real one.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I was afraid that the colors would not be pigmented, but wow! These colors are so pigmented! I tried them with and without primer and they actually look better without the primer! I am in love with W7, I have all of the palettes minus In the Buff, that is next on my list!</li>
