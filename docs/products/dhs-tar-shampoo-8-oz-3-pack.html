            <li> The tar smell is pungent and can take a while to get use to, which means that the shampoo contains sufficient of the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Bartell Drugs used to carry it, but discontinued it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> but it was not available.</li>
            <li> So, I checked with the manufacturer why the product was not available.  </li>
            <li> works fro about 12-15 hours and the itching returns and small scabs return as well.</li>
            <li> i suffer from moderate to severe plaque psorisis, DHS tar shampoo is the only shampoo i have found that works to relieve my worst symptoms of excessive plaque and iching on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Have been unable to find it in the stores</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was told two month ago to use this by my dermatologist along with a different medication for my psoriasis. I don&#x27;t really know how well it works on it&#x27;s own that is one of the reasons I took a star off the ratings, that and the smell. I can never quite get over the smell of tar shampoos, YUK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I am righting this is because a number of reviews here say they can&#x27;t find this in stores. Walmart caries this as a special order through the pharmacy. Other stores might too, it&#x27;s on my list to check but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet. You just go to the pharmacy and order how many you want and they call you when it is in. I have gotten mine there so far for $12.09 for each 8oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here because I wanted to see if I can find it cheaper online. At $33.23 for 3 bottles ($11.07 per) so far this is the cheapest listing I have currently found beating Walmart&#x27;s price if you buy enough for the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for three months now and i love it. My scalp has been clear ever since.</li>
            <li> This item is great for individuals who have scalp psoriasis.  Although the smell is a bit strong, it controls your psoriasis.  It does not necessarily help it too much, but it does stop the psoriasis from expanding and scaling too much.  I have tried several tar shampoos and this remains the best one so far.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  It really works on itchy scalp and dandruff. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good value!  Came in only a few days.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t found a shampoo that works better for me than dhs. Not the cheapest, or most feminine of products, but it is really effective.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Many thanks for supplying it.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted and needed. I expect to order again. What more can I say? Thank you</li>
            <li> Good product, price and fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff works when nothing else did.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the wonderful service.  Pleased with the product.  John</li>
            <li> After Neutrogena changed the formula on their extra strength T-Gel I had to find another solution for my ongoing psoriasis. This product really helps! Bartell Drugs used to carry it, but discontinued it a few months ago. I was thrilled to find it here!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually took care of the psoriasis on my mom&#x27;s scalp. We were never happier. Only wish it was available in stores, but will gladly get it online to keep it away- NO itching or flaky/dry scalp. One HAPPY customer!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works better that all others that I have tried to rid my scalp psoriasis but it still has not solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;It works fro about 12-15 hours and the itching returns and small scabs return as well.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the price, quality &amp; quick delivery service. i will continue to reorder in the future</li>
            <li> everything on time and as expected</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for cleaning up dermatitis it is recommended for anyone have itchy scalp, etc, also a good buy</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for people who suffer from skin conditions.  It does leave darkened stains on light colored towels.</li>
            <li> Because other brands have been taken off the market, I decided to give this tar shampoo a try.&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine for itchy scalp and general scalp cleaning.</li>
            <li> I start using this product three weeks ago to control dry scalp at the recommendation of my dermatologist. The shampoo did exactly what it was supposed to.

The tar smell is pungent and can take a while to get use to, which means that the shampoo contains sufficient of the active ingredient.</li>

I no longer have a problem with breaking out but feel this shampoo does a great job of getting my hair sqeeky clean.</li>
            <li> Solid price and received item promptly</li>
            <li> i suffer from moderate to severe plaque psorisis, DHS tar shampoo is the only shampoo i have found that works to relieve my worst symptoms of excessive plaque and iching on my scalp. i have been using the product for 4 years. it is the only shampoo i use.</li>
            <li> After using numerous other products for dandruff, I found that this product works the best.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been like a miracle. Had tried prescription shampoos and other medical recommendations for my husband&#x27;s  psoriasis of the scalp. This really works and keeps it in control.Great product.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, does the job.</li>
            <li> Great price. I tried this shampoo as a last effort before spending hundreds on prescription meds for my scalp psoriasis. It worked like a charm. Within three months my scalp was healed and now I just use it once a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I tried to get this shampoo from my local COSTCO but it was not available. I checked around town and stores were out.  So, I checked with the manufacturer why the product was not available.  The manufacturer said that they were changing the sudsing agent and recommended that I obtain the product on the web in the interim.  I got the old formula I wanted, at a good price and it arrived quickly. I did try another Tar Shampoo from a local store, but I had a reaction to it and was very happy to find my old shampoo</li>
            <li> recommended by my Dr.&lt;br /&gt;it is very helpful</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there for scalp problems</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo to use for scalp conditions that create flakey skin.  I have been using it for 33 years without a problem.</li>
            <li> The DHS Tar shampoo is a great value and with a three pack you don&#x27;t need to order it as often. The packaging was adequate and it arrived very quikly.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
