            <li>The Polish itself looked beautiful, but it came damaged so my daughter wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li>It is great as a sparkly top coat on any color of gel polish.</li>

            <li>i love iti love the gelish uv soak off gel polish silver sand perfect tanks for the product i love it</li>
            <li>but kind of a pain to get there.</li>
            <li>It is a nice glitter to have.</li>
            <li>There are some good web sites that show the Gelish colors available and Amazon has really good prices.</li>
            <li>and they are spectacular.</li>
            <li>Still nice, though.</li>
            <li>Loved the colors and how they sparkled in the light.  </li>
            <li>It will take two coats to get a nice glitter effect on top of your polish.</li>
            <li>I have many Gelish colors and it is by far the best gel polish.</li>

            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>Two coats still was cute, though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the way it turned out.</li>
            <li>Although if you shake it a lot you are able to apply it.</li>
            <li>I admit it, I love sparklies.</li>
            <li>But there are lots of glitter topcoats out there that are more saturated with glitter, this one is not.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love to use the Gelish products.  </li>
            <li>top coat (I apply 2 coats) setting each coat with the light&lt;br /&gt;wipe</li>
            <li>then applied 2 coats of top coat and it lasted about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I will make sure to never order from sparkle and shine beauty supply again.</li>
            <li>Love that glitter.</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the tittle and focussing more on the pic</li>
            <li>I have always used their nail polish and I am  satisfied with their  nail polish and will continue to buy them..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite polishes to add on top of my nails.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish products, but this color does not look like the picture at all.  </li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to try again with more coats</li>
            <li>I did add some craft glitter to it and it is better now</li>
            <li>Looks better over darker colors, but that&#x27;s just an opinion</li>
            <li>It is just like a top coat but not as shining as it should be</li>
            <li>I love a lot of glitter when I get my nails done so this glitter nail polish fits the bill.</li>
            <li>In 10 days, I was able to peel it off though, because it loosened around the edges.</li>
            <li>If you can get the glitter to stay on the brush, it okay.  </li>
            <li>I love glittery things</li>
            <li>:).  </li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it by itself just because the glitter is a little sparse, so you have to use 3 or 4 coats to get great coverage, but 1 or 2 coats over another color gives a great amount of life and sparkle.</li>
            <li>This polish is pretty, but you need 3 coats to get the glitter on good.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best way to go for natural nails.</li>
            <li>Silver Sand is great over pretty much any Gelish color!</li>
            <li>I like to the tips and using a brush and the prep liquid to clean it up, set it with the light, apply another coat and set then apply the top coat.....</li>
            <li>and they were fine.  </li>
            <li>The company is fine to order from I just don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li>This polish had a tremendous amount of shine even before I applied the Top</li>
            <li>Could use more glitter in nail polish that are very light in color, other wise it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>This polish is a very nice and simple glitter polish.  </li>
            <li>All though it does not look like the picture, it is a very cute color for a top coat over a solid color!!</li>
            <li>I was excited for all these colors.  </li>
            <li>This color is too much fun!  </li>
            <li>The polish is almost clear with a high gloss and the colors are beautiful accents to your nails.</li>
            <li>I expected to be able to see the colored spots well and that I would get a good amount on the nail.</li>
            <li>I was fine with the amount of glitter in it for my wants, but the odor of this polish is so so strong.</li>
            <li>This polish is really one that belongs as a top coat to another color.</li>
            <li>Which means that after 3 coats (in an attempt to get the intense sparkle I was hoping for),  it was more noticeable</li>
            <li>Will have to put many coats for it to be really glittery</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture, it&#x27;s glitter mostly gold in color and the glitter is really sparce</li>
            <li>She loves the results and we are getting ready to purchase more colors for her.</li>
            <li>Other Gelish glitters are great.</li>
            <li>Really quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This works as  top layer over a dark color and makes it very interesting.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was paying $15 for a mini and these are large sizes...ordering more from this company right now</li>
            <li>The colors in this glitter coat are very pretty.</li>
            <li>It has different size sparkle flakes in it which looks nice.</li>
            <li>the glitter specs weren&#x27;t as colorful as the picture.</li>
            <li>Many of the glitters out there have too much clear to get any glitter on your nail.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten other glitter from red carpet and I am much more happy with those.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;----Its sort of yellowish, right out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Need six coats for it to look right.</li>
            <li>Customer service from seller want right on time.</li>
            <li>My wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
            <li>I love to use this polish on top of some of my plain colors.  </li>
            <li>but it is iridescent Mylar...very pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The glitter is nice but not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li>I wore this over a turquoise polish and it was really pretty.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering from this seller a lot ; )</li>
            <li>the yellow undertone had intensified even more.</li>
            <li>You can take any solid color and then use this in a couple of coats before the top coat</li>
            <li>It is still pretty but not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish but this doesn&#x27;t have enough sparkle.</li>
            <li>It pretty shimmery</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty and sparkly in the picture and even in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love Gellish, this specific polish is not my fave.  </li>
            <li>r my absolute fav gelish color combo!</li>
            <li>Although this Gelish color is really pretty.</li>
            <li>I was able to find another brand, but same color.</li>
            <li>Either over other polish or on its own.  </li>
            <li>This polish is actually very nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>This is the large bottle</li>
            <li>I bought a big bottle of acetone for about $2.00 and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The sparkle in this policy is spread out, so the whole nail won&#x27;t be covered in sparkle (as compared to Vegas Nights which is an all over sparkle polish)</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with the one I received.</li>
            <li>It goes on very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line,  I absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li>The picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t ant too much flash.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have as much color as this picture shows.  </li>
            <li>You would need at least 3 applications to get more full sparkly coverage.</li>
            <li>Color is ok, came very clumpy and the brush was a mess like it had been used before.</li>
            <li>It is super yellow.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and doesn&#x27;t take up all the space on a short nail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to you as it is extremely high quality and it provides the look you want to have.</li>
            <li>Other than that the polish came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very light and plain glitter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very runny and almost clear.</li>
            <li>I normally apply 3 coats setting each coat with the light&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li>I was  contacting the seller for the replacement, first response was that they will not sent out the new one unless i sent it back</li>
            <li>does take a few layers, but looks great on colors or plain, just take your time with it</li>
            <li>Make sure that you shake the bottle thoroughly to get the colors particles mixed into the entire bottle before starting.</li>
            <li>I will continue to used this in french manicures or when I want to add a little fun sparkle on top of a solid color nail.</li>
            <li>The specks are large compared to the other glitters Gelish has and no where near as colorful as the photo shows.</li>
            <li>other reviewers are right, the sparkles are very sparse and understated.</li>
            <li>Great glitter polish, takes a little practice to try and get lots of glitter without making the coat too thick.  </li>
            <li>Originally thought it would be super sparkly and flashy but once applied it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is a clear polish with multi-glitter.  </li>
            <li>couple things about that clear \\&quot;base\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I tried this on my daughter (6 yrs) and didn&#x27;t get anything but the clear polish on her nails.</li>
            <li>The clear starts running everywhere.</li>
            <li>The polish is clear.</li>
            <li>The clear sets in a yellowish tint that is unattractive.</li>
            <li>The picture looks like it has color, but the polish is clear with silver sparkles.</li>
            <li>Seems like the product was old or used.  </li>
            <li>my manicures last about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks depending on how much I wash my hands at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they looked professional.</li>
            <li>product shipped the same day we ordered it and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>The use of this polish and the Gelish Kit makes your nails look professionally done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty but not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I really think it enhances a lot of the different solid colors.</li>
            <li>I painted it over a light blue and it turned green.</li>
            <li>It is very old and yellow.</li>
            <li>: if I&#x27;m using a dark color, I set the light timer TWICE between coats, I&#x27;ve had the color not quiet set with only once through the light*&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to add a coat of solid color down first and try and get as much glitter as possible.  </li>
            <li>Too much clear, not enough glitter.</li>
            <li>There was a tinge of yellow color to the clear coat part.</li>
            <li>Glitter BARELY shows up.</li>
            <li>There is barely any sparkle at all in this polish.</li>
            <li>The glitter just wants to float around and you get absolutely no consistency.  </li>
            <li>( I also attached the picture of the polish how it is so old and not the same as the product description)</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors in clear base will jazz up any color polish.</li>
            <li>The picture shows glitter with clear but it is actually yellow and gross looking.</li>
            <li>To get enough glitter you must be careful you don&#x27;t get too much polish.</li>
            <li>I keep my bottle upside down, so that I can get enough glitter on the first coat.  </li>
            <li>Just really wish we could&#x27;ve used this one since the glitter is a little bigger and noticeable.</li>
            <li>The polish is almost clear with a minimal amount of sparkle in it.</li>

            <li> and they were fine.  </li>
            <li> The company is fine to order from I just don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li> This polish had a tremendous amount of shine even before I applied the Top</li>
            <li> Could use more glitter in nail polish that are very light in color, other wise it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> This polish is a very nice and simple glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> All though it does not look like the picture, it is a very cute color for a top coat over a solid color!!</li>
            <li> I was excited for all these colors.  </li>
            <li> This color is too much fun!  </li>
            <li> The polish is almost clear with a high gloss and the colors are beautiful accents to your nails.</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to see the colored spots well and that I would get a good amount on the nail.</li>
            <li> I was fine with the amount of glitter in it for my wants, but the odor of this polish is so so strong.</li>
            <li> This polish is really one that belongs as a top coat to another color.</li>
            <li> Which means that after 3 coats (in an attempt to get the intense sparkle I was hoping for),  it was more noticeable</li>
            <li> Will have to put many coats for it to be really glittery</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture, it&#x27;s glitter mostly gold in color and the glitter is really sparce</li>
            <li> She loves the results and we are getting ready to purchase more colors for her.</li>
            <li> Other Gelish glitters are great.</li>
            <li> Really quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This works as  top layer over a dark color and makes it very interesting.  </li>
            <li> Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was paying $15 for a mini and these are large sizes...ordering more from this company right now</li>
            <li> The colors in this glitter coat are very pretty.</li>
            <li> It has different size sparkle flakes in it which looks nice.</li>
            <li> the glitter specs weren&#x27;t as colorful as the picture.</li>
            <li> Many of the glitters out there have too much clear to get any glitter on your nail.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten other glitter from red carpet and I am much more happy with those.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;----Its sort of yellowish, right out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Need six coats for it to look right.</li>
            <li> Customer service from seller want right on time.</li>
            <li> My wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
            <li> I love to use this polish on top of some of my plain colors.  </li>
            <li> but it is iridescent Mylar...very pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The glitter is nice but not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I wore this over a turquoise polish and it was really pretty.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering from this seller a lot ; )</li>
            <li> the yellow undertone had intensified even more.</li>
            <li> You can take any solid color and then use this in a couple of coats before the top coat</li>
            <li> It is still pretty but not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish but this doesn&#x27;t have enough sparkle.</li>
            <li> It pretty shimmery</li>
            <li> It looks so pretty and sparkly in the picture and even in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Gellish, this specific polish is not my fave.  </li>
            <li> r my absolute fav gelish color combo!</li>
            <li> Although this Gelish color is really pretty.</li>
            <li> I was able to find another brand, but same color.</li>
            <li> Either over other polish or on its own.  </li>
            <li> This polish is actually very nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> This is the large bottle</li>
            <li> I bought a big bottle of acetone for about $2.00 and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> The sparkle in this policy is spread out, so the whole nail won&#x27;t be covered in sparkle (as compared to Vegas Nights which is an all over sparkle polish)</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with the one I received.</li>
            <li> It goes on very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line,  I absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t ant too much flash.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as much color as this picture shows.  </li>
            <li> You would need at least 3 applications to get more full sparkly coverage.</li>
            <li> Color is ok, came very clumpy and the brush was a mess like it had been used before.</li>
            <li> It is super yellow.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and doesn&#x27;t take up all the space on a short nail.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to you as it is extremely high quality and it provides the look you want to have.</li>
            <li> Other than that the polish came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very light and plain glitter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very runny and almost clear.</li>
            <li> I normally apply 3 coats setting each coat with the light&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> I was  contacting the seller for the replacement, first response was that they will not sent out the new one unless i sent it back</li>
            <li> does take a few layers, but looks great on colors or plain, just take your time with it</li>
            <li> Make sure that you shake the bottle thoroughly to get the colors particles mixed into the entire bottle before starting.</li>
            <li> I will continue to used this in french manicures or when I want to add a little fun sparkle on top of a solid color nail.</li>
            <li> The specks are large compared to the other glitters Gelish has and no where near as colorful as the photo shows.</li>
            <li> other reviewers are right, the sparkles are very sparse and understated.</li>
            <li> Great glitter polish, takes a little practice to try and get lots of glitter without making the coat too thick.  </li>
            <li> Originally thought it would be super sparkly and flashy but once applied it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is a clear polish with multi-glitter.  </li>
            <li> couple things about that clear \\&quot;base\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I tried this on my daughter (6 yrs) and didn&#x27;t get anything but the clear polish on her nails.</li>
            <li> The clear starts running everywhere.</li>
            <li> The polish is clear.</li>
            <li> The clear sets in a yellowish tint that is unattractive.</li>
            <li> The picture looks like it has color, but the polish is clear with silver sparkles.</li>
            <li> Seems like the product was old or used.  </li>
            <li> my manicures last about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks depending on how much I wash my hands at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they looked professional.</li>
            <li> product shipped the same day we ordered it and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> The use of this polish and the Gelish Kit makes your nails look professionally done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty but not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I really think it enhances a lot of the different solid colors.</li>
            <li> I painted it over a light blue and it turned green.</li>
            <li> It is very old and yellow.</li>
            <li> : if I&#x27;m using a dark color, I set the light timer TWICE between coats, I&#x27;ve had the color not quiet set with only once through the light*&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to add a coat of solid color down first and try and get as much glitter as possible.  </li>
            <li> Too much clear, not enough glitter.</li>
            <li> There was a tinge of yellow color to the clear coat part.</li>
            <li> Glitter BARELY shows up.</li>
            <li> There is barely any sparkle at all in this polish.</li>
            <li> The glitter just wants to float around and you get absolutely no consistency.  </li>
            <li> ( I also attached the picture of the polish how it is so old and not the same as the product description)</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors in clear base will jazz up any color polish.</li>
            <li> The picture shows glitter with clear but it is actually yellow and gross looking.</li>
            <li> To get enough glitter you must be careful you don&#x27;t get too much polish.</li>
            <li> I keep my bottle upside down, so that I can get enough glitter on the first coat.  </li>
            <li> Just really wish we could&#x27;ve used this one since the glitter is a little bigger and noticeable.</li>
            <li> The polish is almost clear with a minimal amount of sparkle in it.</li>
            <li> and I love it, but this new Trends product is almost impossible to put on.  </li>
            <li> long as you follow the basic steps...</li>
            <li> applied regular nail polish like OPI (let it dry for 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> Like any product that has sparkles in it, it is a little more difficult to remove than regular colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear with a few sparkles.</li>
            <li> up your nail (I use a medium file and rough the entire surface)</li>
            <li> Also, the base is a kind of yellow tint and it makes your nail beds look yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is because her nails are so small or because in order to get a thin coat I have to scrape a good amount of the product off.</li>
            <li> It really was thick and did not go on as I had hoped....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong with this polish, but it is not even similar in consistency or smell to any other gel polish I own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands, Gelish, Red Carpet, Progel all with similar results as long as you follow the directions and prep the nail, apply a base and then the polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> Also it is extremely runny and very yellow.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s mostly clear with very little glitter.  </li>
            <li> This is very pretty, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the sparkles are a bit larger than I expected, and go on thinner than I expected, as well.</li>
            <li> The color was like yellow and had a little bit of glitter.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected since I have order others</li>
            <li> So without the sparkles, theres not much goingbon here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few short days, (like 4 or 5)</li>
            <li> Either way it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but when you put it on not much glitter.</li>
            <li> Overall, amazon has been a few cents cheaper</li>
            <li> I mean very yellow to where you can see its yellow even after cure it.</li>
            <li> However, it is very hard to get an even application, and you&#x27;ll have to apply 3 or 4 coats for it to look decent.</li>
            <li> and you will add a classy yet subtle glitter finish.</li>
            <li> I dont smoke, I didnt expose my nails to any chemicals like cleaning products, no hot tubbing or tanning.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my nails all the time, and it&#x27;s always due to topping off my gel nails with this glittery finish.</li>
            <li> The picture for this product must be an extreme close up.</li>
            <li> I ended up with about 4 or 5 single little pieces of glitter on each finger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what brand of base, color, top coat</li>
            <li> I do a base coat, two coats of color, two coats of the glitter, and one coat of a top coat.</li>
            <li> I even tried shaking it and storing it upside down, no luck.</li>
            <li> 2 thumbs down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but adds a bit of interest to my french manicures.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, theres not much sparkle in this one...which is unfortunate since the \\&quot;base\\&quot; is clear.</li>
            <li> This was a little too thixk when I got it.</li>
            <li> You would have to do 5 or 6 coats to get it to look like the little picture.</li>
            <li> but it would just come out clear with a faint hint of glitter.</li>
            <li> It was mostly dried out and rubbery on the inside and to clammy use</li>
            <li> A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just wasted $10 and my time.</li>
            <li> The top also leaked very bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when receiving this color, because it&#x27;s clear with glittery silver specks rather than the solid silver I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, and unfortunately cannot remember the specifics of it.</li>
            <li> and that hardly any glitter comes out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The glitters are an irradecent color but there is hardly any glitter when you apply the polish.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use.</li>
            <li> I think I would have needed at least four coats to get the density that is shown in the product picture.  </li>
            <li> The polish was like eating the brush, the bristles were all crazy and going different directions.</li>
            <li> I would have to put at least 5 coats on for it to look like it does in the pic.</li>
            <li> When I received this it was too thick to even use on your nails.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t rush and put on thick layers</li>
            <li> Very small specks of multi colored glitter adds shine.</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> This is a clear base with iridescent Mylar flakes.</li>
            <li> This is a clear base with multi-colored sparkly pieces as shown in the product picture.  </li>
            <li> Pretty colors, awful smell</li>
            <li> Plus, when I got this bottle from sparkle and shine beauty supply it was extremely dirty and look like half of it had been used.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the yellow tint</li>
            <li> I use this polish as my base and then draw in my french tips.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> This product was just not as glitter as it looks for the thin layers you have to use.</li>
            <li> It is VERY subtle when you pain it on.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong w my polish.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of stuff on amazon, but never experienced this bad of service.</li>
            <li> It was weird!</li>
            <li> The brush to the nail polish is all bent makes it very difficult to use</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;clean/purify with an alcohol/acetone prep&lt;br /&gt;apply base coat and set with LED or UV light&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> daughter did a prep, base coat,</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I was looking so forward to using this polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst glitter I have ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Polish does not look like this color at all.  I was excited for all these colors.  The polish is almost clear with a minimal amount of sparkle in it.</li>
            <li> This is a clear base with iridescent Mylar flakes. Lots of pics make it look like multi color glitter but it is iridescent Mylar...very pretty.</li>
            <li> the picture of the item makes this polish look like it is a white with glitter.....that&#x27;s not the case at all, it&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitter is nice but not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> When I received this it was too thick to even use on your nails.  The brush was bent and frayed.  Seems like the product was old or used.  Not at all what I expected since I have order others and they were fine.  I am trying to return this product now.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  I use this polish as my base and then draw in my french tips.  It&#x27;s subtle but adds a bit of interest to my french manicures.  So cute!</li>
            <li> The picture looks different from the actual polish and doesn&#x27;t look like what is shown. I tried to return it on here but it doesn&#x27;t give me the option to do that</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when receiving this color, because it&#x27;s clear with glittery silver specks rather than the solid silver I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I wore this over a turquoise polish and it was really pretty. But it took me 3 coats of the glitter polish to get enough glitter on my nails. It&#x27;s a great result but kind of a pain to get there. Nevertheless, I still like this polish.</li>
            <li> It is great to use on your nails and it was pretty. My sister loved it on her nails. I just like all the different colors so it matches anything you wear.</li>
            <li> This is a clear base with multi-colored sparkly pieces as shown in the product picture.  I purchased this as an alternative to a sheer for use in a french manicure (using Up in the Blue on my nail tips).  This polish had a tremendous amount of shine even before I applied the Top It Off coat.  The only reason I gave this a four-star rating instead of five is that while there are obviously a lot of sparkly pieces in the bottle, they wanted to stay on the brush instead of transferring to my nails.  I think I would have needed at least four coats to get the density that is shown in the product picture.  Two coats still was cute, though.  I will continue to used this in french manicures or when I want to add a little fun sparkle on top of a solid color nail.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves it. I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
            <li> I put this over It&#x27;s a Lilly and I am pleased with the way it turned out. However, you do have to put 2-3 coats on to get enough sparkle on the nail. It has different size sparkle flakes in it which looks nice. This is a completely different look compared to the Vegas Nights polish. The sparkle in this policy is spread out, so the whole nail won&#x27;t be covered in sparkle (as compared to Vegas Nights which is an all over sparkle polish)</li>
            <li> This was a little too thixk when I got it. Although if you shake it a lot you are able to apply it.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, awful smell</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with the one I received. It was mostly dried out and rubbery on the inside and to clammy use</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty, but you need 3 coats to get the glitter on good. Also, the base is a kind of yellow tint and it makes your nail beds look yellow. This polish is really one that belongs as a top coat to another color.</li>
            <li> I admit it, I love sparklies. But I like them understated, not blind-your-eyes glittery. So I like to sneak one coat of Silver Sand over my matte colors for a tiny bit of sparkle without looking too youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewers are right, the sparkles are very sparse and understated. You would need at least 3 applications to get more full sparkly coverage. But there are lots of glitter topcoats out there that are more saturated with glitter, this one is not. Plus I love the colors. I uploaded a picture of one coat of Silver Sands over China Glaze Gelaze Periwinkle.</li>
            <li> this color is beautiful and the price is amazing! At the beauty supply store you get a mini bottle for 12$  this is a FULL SIZE bottle of gelish which is one of the best brands for 10$!!!! I will be ordering from this seller a lot ; )</li>
            <li> I love to use the Gelish products.  This one looks good on.  The only problem is when you go to take it off.  Like any product that has sparkles in it, it is a little more difficult to remove than regular colors.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best way to go for natural nails. I&#x27;ve used several brands, Gelish, Red Carpet, Progel all with similar results as long as you follow the directions and prep the nail, apply a base and then the polish and top coat. I&#x27;ve mixed and matched brands without any issues and my manicures last about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks depending on how much I wash my hands at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow the basic steps...&lt;br /&gt;rough up your nail (I use a medium file and rough the entire surface) btw, I&#x27;ve never damaged my nails this way&lt;br /&gt;clean/purify with an alcohol/acetone prep&lt;br /&gt;apply base coat and set with LED or UV light&lt;br /&gt;apply color or glitter (DO NOT wipe off tacky coat between coats) I normally apply 3 coats setting each coat with the light&lt;br /&gt;apply top coat (I apply 2 coats) setting each coat with the light&lt;br /&gt;wipe off tacky coat with your prep or rubbing alcohol and you&#x27;re out the door. It takes me about 30 mins max for this.&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE: if I&#x27;m using a dark color, I set the light timer TWICE between coats, I&#x27;ve had the color not quiet set with only once through the light*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do a french manicure this way using a glitter coat then applying what ever color I like to the tips and using a brush and the prep liquid to clean it up, set it with the light, apply another coat and set then apply the top coat..... works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what brand of base, color, top coat I use the polish stays on and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For removal I bought a big bottle of acetone for about $2.00 and it works just fine. File the shine off, soak a cotton ball with acetone and wrap the tip with regular aluminum foil for 10 minutes then push off the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter did a prep, base coat, applied regular nail polish like OPI (let it dry for 10 minutes) then applied 2 coats of top coat and it lasted about 10 days.</li>
            <li> The sparkles look nothing like in the picture. Plus, when I got this bottle from sparkle and shine beauty supply it was extremely dirty and look like half of it had been used. I will make sure to never order from sparkle and shine beauty supply again.</li>
            <li> This polish is a very nice and simple glitter polish.  It is a clear polish with multi-glitter.  I love to use this polish on top of some of my plain colors.  I keep my bottle upside down, so that I can get enough glitter on the first coat.  It goes on very well.  Love that glitter.</li>
            <li> i love iti love the gelish uv soak off gel polish silver sand perfect tanks for the product i love it</li>
            <li> It was just as it stated.  Loved the colors and how they sparkled in the light.  It when twitch every outfit I wore.</li>
            <li> Glitter BARELY shows up. Not good</li>
            <li> I had been considering this polush for quite a while and just recently went for it. As others have stated, theres not much sparkle in this one...which is unfortunate since the \\&quot;base\\&quot; is clear. So without the sparkles, theres not much goingbon here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things about that clear \\&quot;base\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;----Its sort of yellowish, right out of the bottle.  Which means that after 3 coats (in an attempt to get the intense sparkle I was hoping for),  it was more noticeable that I liked.&lt;br /&gt;----After a few short days, (like 4 or 5) the yellow undertone had intensified even more. They looked like hideous,  nicotine stained nails. It was weird! I dont smoke, I didnt expose my nails to any chemicals like cleaning products, no hot tubbing or tanning.  Gross. Stained.  Yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line,  I absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This pic shows color glitter but its not its only silver glitter. Guess that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the tittle and focussing more on the pic</li>
            <li> Could use more glitter in nail polish that are very light in color, other wise it met my expectations. It did last about two week. I have always used their nail polish and I am  satisfied with their  nail polish and will continue to buy them..</li>
            <li> This color is too much fun!  I love it.  Either over other polish or on its own.  I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite polishes to add on top of my nails. I suppose you could use it separately but it would just come out clear with a faint hint of glitter. You can take any solid color and then use this in a couple of coats before the top coat and you will add a classy yet subtle glitter finish. I really think it enhances a lot of the different solid colors. I always get compliments when I glitter up my nails.</li>
            <li> The picture shows glitter with clear but it is actually yellow and gross looking. I do not recommend this item</li>
            <li> I wish I would of read the reviews on this glitter polish. Very unhappy with the yellow tint and that hardly any glitter comes out of the bottle.  I have gotten other glitter from red carpet and I am much more happy with those.</li>
            <li> There is barely any sparkle at all in this polish. The picture is very deceiving. It&#x27;s very runny and almost clear.</li>
            <li> The colors in this glitter coat are very pretty. However, it is very hard to get an even application, and you&#x27;ll have to apply 3 or 4 coats for it to look decent.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews that have been posted, but I think many people have missed this color&#x27;s greatest use. It is great as a sparkly top coat on any color of gel polish. It will take two coats to get a nice glitter effect on top of your polish. I get compliments on my nails all the time, and it&#x27;s always due to topping off my gel nails with this glittery finish. I do a base coat, two coats of color, two coats of the glitter, and one coat of a top coat.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong w my polish. I felt like the seller thought I was making it up. The polish was like eating the brush, the bristles were all crazy and going different directions. I tried four different brushes. Same thing happened every time. Very disappointed, I was looking so forward to using this polish.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products, but this color does not look like the picture at all.  It is okay. I won&#x27;t be reordering though.  It is a glitter but it does not have any colored sparkle what so ever.</li>
            <li> This color is not what it looks like in person compared to the picture online. It is still pretty but not what I was expecting at all. Very light and plain glitter. Not colored glitter.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the first time I used this. The specks are large compared to the other glitters Gelish has and no where near as colorful as the photo shows. Maybe I need to try again with more coats but I don&#x27;t ant too much flash. If you want flash, this is your polish.</li>
            <li> The company is fine to order from I just don&#x27;t like the color. The nail polish looks nothing like the picture. I wish I would of read the reviews before I ordered</li>
            <li> The picture for this product must be an extreme close up. I expected to be able to see the colored spots well and that I would get a good amount on the nail. I tried this on my daughter (6 yrs) and didn&#x27;t get anything but the clear polish on her nails. I&#x27;m not sure if it is because her nails are so small or because in order to get a thin coat I have to scrape a good amount of the product off. Either way it is not what I expected. When I get a chance to try this on bigger nails than my daughters I will come back to edit how it worked.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish but this doesn&#x27;t have enough sparkle. I would have to put at least 5 coats on for it to look like it does in the pic. I even tried shaking it and storing it upside down, no luck. I did add some craft glitter to it and it is better now but I wouldn&#x27;t order this color again.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and doesn&#x27;t take up all the space on a short nail. Looks better over darker colors, but that&#x27;s just an opinion</li>
            <li> The sample picture of the color of the polish was deceiving. The color was like yellow and had a little bit of glitter. The top also leaked very bad. Other than that the polish came very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. It is just like a top coat but not as shining as it should be</li>
            <li> It would take 10 coats to make it as dense as photo. Too much clear, not enough glitter. The clear starts running everywhere. Not happy.</li>
            <li> This does not look at all like what I got in the mail. Mine is yellow and doesn&#x27;t have big glitter chunks like this one has.</li>
            <li> I love a lot of glitter when I get my nails done so this glitter nail polish fits the bill. It pretty shimmery &amp; it looks good with any nail color you choose...</li>
            <li> This polish is actually very nice and subtle. Originally thought it would be super sparkly and flashy but once applied it really isn&#x27;t. Great color to wear day-to-day.</li>
            <li> It is gorgeous in the bottle. The glitters are an irradecent color but there is hardly any glitter when you apply the polish. It looks like there is glitter but when you put it on not much glitter. The polish is clear. June Bride, vegas nights and water field have plenty of glitter but not this one. Same with tumberline violet. 2 thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Seller did great.  I have everything Gelish and I love it, but this new Trends product is almost impossible to put on.  My daughter has the same problem.  The glitter just wants to float around and you get absolutely no consistency.  Need six coats for it to look right.</li>
            <li> This product was just not as glitter as it looks for the thin layers you have to use. Will have to put many coats for it to be really glittery</li>
            <li> Great product. Beautiful colors in clear base will jazz up any color polish. Customer service from seller want right on time. Will buy from them again</li>
            <li> I thought this would be gorgeous with a  lot of sparkle and some variable colors.  However, it&#x27;s mostly clear with very little glitter.  I ended up with about 4 or 5 single little pieces of glitter on each finger.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the glitter specs weren&#x27;t as colorful as the picture. There was a tinge of yellow color to the clear coat part.</li>
            <li> Silver Sand is great over pretty much any Gelish color! I don&#x27;t love it by itself just because the glitter is a little sparse, so you have to use 3 or 4 coats to get great coverage, but 1 or 2 coats over another color gives a great amount of life and sparkle. Very cute and colorful!</li>
            <li> It looks so pretty and sparkly in the picture and even in the bottle. But when I put it on I ended up with one or two pieces of glitter on each nail. A waste of money and time. Other Gelish glitters are great. Not this one.</li>
            <li> I love Gellish, this specific polish is not my fave.  You have to do a lot of coats if you want a lot of the sparkle on there.</li>
            <li> I thought this was different colored glitter when i bought it but it&#x27;s actually just iridescent glitter. It&#x27;s still pretty but not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture, it&#x27;s glitter mostly gold in color and the glitter is really sparce so you would need tons of coats!</li>
            <li> This is the worst glitter I have ever bought. Even with 2 to 3 coats I could count all the glitter on each nail. Shaking the bottle and globing it on still doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really quick shipping. I&#x27;ve been purchasing my gelish products thru amazon &amp; ebay. Overall, amazon has been a few cents cheaper &amp; I receive my items a day or so earlier than i have when purchased thru ebay. Product quality has been equal. Sea foam + silver sand r my absolute fav gelish color combo!</li>
            <li> This works as  top layer over a dark color and makes it very interesting.  In 10 days, I was able to peel it off though, because it loosened around the edges.</li>
            <li> I did read reviews and knew that the glitter in this polish is sparse. I was fine with the amount of glitter in it for my wants, but the odor of this polish is so so strong. I have about 30 gelish polishes and no others stink like this. Also it is extremely runny and very yellow. I painted it over a light blue and it turned green. It is super yellow. I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong with this polish, but it is not even similar in consistency or smell to any other gel polish I own.</li>
            <li> it is not same thing as it says on the web. It is very old and yellow. I mean very yellow to where you can see its yellow even after cure it. I was  contacting the seller for the replacement, first response was that they will not sent out the new one unless i sent it back (I need to pay the shipping). I have asked to create a return label,  ( I also attached the picture of the polish how it is so old and not the same as the product description) the seller had never contacted me back ever. I just wasted $10 and my time. I buy a lot of stuff on amazon, but never experienced this bad of service. This is definitely a scam trying to rip off peoples money selling damaged product that they cannot sell at a store.</li>
            <li> The brush to the nail polish is all bent makes it very difficult to use</li>
            <li> If you can get the glitter to stay on the brush, it okay.  Many of the glitters out there have too much clear to get any glitter on your nail.  The clear sets in a yellowish tint that is unattractive.</li>
            <li> It is a nice glitter to have. I have only used it once, and unfortunately cannot remember the specifics of it. Should dig it out next time I do my nails...</li>
            <li> Although this Gelish color is really pretty. It is hard to use. The glitters/sparkles don&#x27;t stick to the brush. You would have to do 5 or 6 coats to get it to look like the little picture. It is VERY subtle when you pain it on.</li>
            <li> These sparkles are beautiful!  I love glittery things :).  My nail tech loves it too because when the sunlight hits it, it spakles different colors,.</li>
            <li> This polish is 10x prettier online than what&#x27;s in the actual bottle. I will be purchasing in person vs. online from now on.</li>
            <li> does take a few layers, but looks great on colors or plain, just take your time with it don&#x27;t rush and put on thick layers</li>
            <li> My wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails so they looked professional. We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses at about $15 for a 0.3 ounce size and they were out of a lot of colors. We checked Amazon and the prices were lower for the 0.5 ounce size for the same product and you can find a broader selection of colors. Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the gel polishes so I purchased this multicolor polish as a surprise gift for her. The polish is almost clear with a high gloss and the colors are beautiful accents to your nails. Make sure that you shake the bottle thoroughly to get the colors particles mixed into the entire bottle before starting. She gave her nails two coats to get the look that she wanted. We had already purchased the Gelish Basix Kit and with the kit and this polish the results were perfect. She loves the results and we are getting ready to purchase more colors for her. Gelish has a great selection of colors and the product quality and the results you get are outstanding. There are some good web sites that show the Gelish colors available and Amazon has really good prices. This polish will last on your nails for over two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped the same day we ordered it and the delivery was fast. This vendor did a good job of handling our order. The use of this polish and the Gelish Kit makes your nails look professionally done and they are spectacular. I highly recommend this product to you as it is extremely high quality and it provides the look you want to have.</li>
            <li> Great glitter polish, takes a little practice to try and get lots of glitter without making the coat too thick.  But it makes a great sparkle for sure. There are different sizes and shapes.  I like to add a coat of solid color down first and try and get as much glitter as possible.  2-3 coats.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as much color as this picture shows.  It&#x27;s clear with a few sparkles.</li>
            <li> All though it does not look like the picture, it is a very cute color for a top coat over a solid color!!</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> The Polish itself looked beautiful, but it came damaged so my daughter wasn&#x27;t able to use it. Contacted the company and after some misunderstanding on my part, the issue was resolved and I was refunded my money. I was able to find another brand, but same color. Just really wish we could&#x27;ve used this one since the glitter is a little bigger and noticeable. Oh well, still a great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> It really was thick and did not go on as I had hoped....color good consistency was not as&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This is the large bottle</li>
            <li> The picture looks like it has color, but the polish is clear with silver sparkles.</li>
            <li> Color is ok, came very clumpy and the brush was a mess like it had been used before. Will be asking for a refund.</li>
            <li> Very happy considering i was paying $15 for a mini and these are large sizes...ordering more from this company right now</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the sparkles are a bit larger than I expected, and go on thinner than I expected, as well. Still nice, though.</li>
            <li> To get enough glitter you must be careful you don&#x27;t get too much polish. Very small specks of multi colored glitter adds shine.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Love this brand.  I have many Gelish colors and it is by far the best gel polish.</li>
