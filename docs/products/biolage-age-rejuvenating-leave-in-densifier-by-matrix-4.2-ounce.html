    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Biolage Age Rejuvenating Densifer is AWESOME...</li>
            <li>It has the perfect amount of weightless hold, providing curl definition.</li>
            <li>So now, it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom cabinet, a reminder that not all purchases prove to be successful!  </li>
            <li>Biolage makes great products</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>..works great for me....</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Saw a good friend and her husband tonight, and they asked if I&#x27;d just had my hair done/colored.</li>
            <li>I found this product on Good Housekeeping as it was rated Gold for aging hair.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it then.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and liked the texture.</li>
            <li>I first read about this product in Good Housekeeping magazine, where it won 1st place for tested products of its kind.</li>
            <li>It feels heavier and yes, more dense.</li>
            <li>I have used this densifier for a couple of years now, and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>It has volumized my hair the most out of all products that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to make my hair thicker with more body</li>
            <li>and when I searched the ususal places, it was not offered any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>and like I have more hair.  </li>
            <li>Love  the product</li>
            <li>and I was so excited; however, when I tried it, it made my hair sticky!  </li>
            <li>My husband has strong curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair is softer than typical and has a wonderful weight to it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference in using this versus a good moose as far as added body.  </li>
            <li>applied on clean damp hair have rejuvenated my aging hair.</li>
            <li>Works great at gently holding and making hair full and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better luck with the Redken thickening lotion 06, applied sparingly to damp hair, or the Toppik Hair Fattener, which can be applied to either damp or dry hair - an excellent thing for a last minute \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>made my hair feel soft and silky, nice product.</li>
            <li>It really gives my hair more body.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best out there for my naturally curly hair, it leaves my hair full and shiny without being weighted down!</li>
            <li>Great for hair with little body.  </li>
            <li>Natural does not bother me like so many do</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Adds just the right amount to texture to your hair  to make it appear fuller, thicker without sticky buildup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different conditioning products over the years, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is more for product styling with extra hold.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>After my first shampoo with the Biolage Shampoo for age reuvenating and this product, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>It really does give my long, straight, fine-textured, color-treated hair more volume.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my fine hair thicker.</li>
            <li>Really like this leave-in a lot.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I did not see much of a diffrence, howerer</li>
            <li>I have thinning, fine hair that has been single processed every 4-5 weeks for thirty years.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who want soft hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is very short and fine, and goes absolutely flat especially in the Southern humidity.  </li>
            <li>Be careful with application, using too much can make your hair feel &#x27;grabby&#x27; and a bit tacky, so you may have to experiment with it a bit to find the proper amount that works without being too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine to begin with, and damaged from years of color, with a fly-away, wavy natural texture; seriously, this stuff makes a major difference.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal product for thin, curly hair.</li>

            <li> This is a phenomenal product for thin, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough times yet to determine whether there are other benefits than just adding volume.</li>
            <li> I moved from the northeast to the dry southwest four years ago.  </li>
            <li> At 46 y/o my hair has very dry ends, oily and itchy scalp using pantene products.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for tight curls.</li>
            <li> I was careful about the amount I used</li>
            <li> Other reviewers (elsewhere) were correct; you can feel the difference as soon as you put this product in your hair.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned how drying this product is, but I figured if it makes my hair look thicker</li>
            <li> I have used WEN and other salon products.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> I have a thick head of long hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair look dry and thin, maybe no longer limp because now it&#x27;s dry and unruly.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product a few years ago</li>
            <li> I end up not shampooing my hair for at least three days after styling.</li>
            <li> Truly, it&#x27;s not a good item for thin, limp hair.</li>

            <li> Adds just the right amount to texture to your hair  to make it appear fuller, thicker without sticky buildup.</li>
            <li> Saw a review of this online and was persuaded to try it. Other reviewers (elsewhere) were correct; you can feel the difference as soon as you put this product in your hair. It feels heavier and yes, more dense. Saw a good friend and her husband tonight, and they asked if I&#x27;d just had my hair done/colored. No kidding - my hair must have looked that different to them. My hair is fine to begin with, and damaged from years of color, with a fly-away, wavy natural texture; seriously, this stuff makes a major difference. I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned how drying this product is, but I figured if it makes my hair look thicker I&#x27;d put up with the dryness. Truly, it&#x27;s not a good item for thin, limp hair. It makes your hair look dry and thin, maybe no longer limp because now it&#x27;s dry and unruly. I&#x27;ve had much better luck with the Redken thickening lotion 06, applied sparingly to damp hair, or the Toppik Hair Fattener, which can be applied to either damp or dry hair - an excellent thing for a last minute \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> made my hair feel soft and silky, nice product. Easy to use and liked the texture. Biolage makes great products</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Use it daily</li>
            <li> I have used this densifier for a couple of years now, and LOVE IT.  My hair is very short and fine, and goes absolutely flat especially in the Southern humidity.  This product ruffles up my hair, and puts just enough body into it to give it some lift.  I first read about this product in Good Housekeeping magazine, where it won 1st place for tested products of its kind.</li>
            <li> Works great at gently holding and making hair full and soft.  Natural does not bother me like so many do</li>
            <li> Biolage Age Rejuvenating Densifer is AWESOME...It has volumized my hair the most out of all products that I have used.  Will purchase as much as possible if it is decided that the product will be discontinued.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference in using this versus a good moose as far as added body.  I was careful about the amount I used so my hair wouldn&#x27;t feel sticky, so maybe I&#x27;m not using enough.  Haven&#x27;t used it enough times yet to determine whether there are other benefits than just adding volume.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  It leaves my hair &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and unmanageable.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who want soft hair.  This is more for product styling with extra hold.</li>
            <li> Great. It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Really like this leave-in a lot. It really does give my long, straight, fine-textured, color-treated hair more volume. Be careful with application, using too much can make your hair feel &#x27;grabby&#x27; and a bit tacky, so you may have to experiment with it a bit to find the proper amount that works without being too much. Don&#x27;t like being without this product so I buy a couple bottles at a time, and have several &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; bottles on my shelf.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product for thin, curly hair. It has the perfect amount of weightless hold, providing curl definition.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to make my hair thicker with more body and I found this on Amazon.  I had tried this product a few years ago and I liked it then.  For some reason, I hadn&#x27;t bought it in a while and when I searched the ususal places, it was not offered any more.  Found it on Amazon and I was so excited; however, when I tried it, it made my hair sticky!  So now, it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom cabinet, a reminder that not all purchases prove to be successful!  I don&#x27;t know what happened?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different conditioning products over the years, this one is by far the best. It actually makes my fine hair thicker. I end up not shampooing my hair for at least three days after styling. Does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I moved from the northeast to the dry southwest four years ago.  I have thinning, fine hair that has been single processed every 4-5 weeks for thirty years.  One pump of this Biolage product and one pump of L&#x27;anza Neem Healing Strength Silk Serum (both bought from Amazon) applied on clean damp hair have rejuvenated my aging hair. I also switched to a sulfate-free shampoo (AGEBeautiful Fullness &amp; Body Shampoo). I previously tried L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t understand the 2 star review, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different as are our perceptions. I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Shake bottle thoroughly before using.</li>
            <li> My husband has strong curls.  After stealing this product from me, he refuses to use anything else.  When I used this, it made my hair too tacky.  I definitely recommend this for tight curls.</li>
            <li> Great for hair with little body.  Was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and it&#x27;s the best out there for my naturally curly hair, it leaves my hair full and shiny without being weighted down!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It actually makes my hair look thicker and like I have more hair.  I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Good Housekeeping as it was rated Gold for aging hair.  I have a thick head of long hair.  At 46 y/o my hair has very dry ends, oily and itchy scalp using pantene products.  I have used WEN and other salon products.  After my first shampoo with the Biolage Shampoo for age reuvenating and this product, I noticed a difference. Three days later and my scalp does not itch, nor does it feel oily.  My hair is softer than typical and has a wonderful weight to it.  I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Love  the product ..works great for me....appreciate the prompt shipping too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It really gives my hair more body.  I would recommend this product.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like glue. I did not see much of a diffrence, howerer it made my hair &#x27;glop&#x27; together. Not the effect I was looking for.</li>
