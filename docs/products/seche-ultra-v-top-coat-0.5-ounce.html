            <li>Great product, price, &amp; delivery arrival timing!</li>
            <li>a C+ at best.</li>
            <li>Best top coat!!</li>
            <li>Good stuff !</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works great.</li>
            <li>According to my wife it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Best UV top coat i can find.</li>
            <li>This polish is the best UV Top Coat out there.</li>
            <li>I can make my own gel manicure with any polish!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is that it comes off easily</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>As of today, I love this product!</li>
            <li>which is a nice break from soaking off gel polish.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the top coat by Seche though!</li>
            <li>He said this was more for manicures.</li>
            <li>It dries with in 3.5 minute under the uv lamp however it does not come out glossy nor seal like a gel top coat</li>
            <li>I normally love this brand.</li>
            <li>pleased to see</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if this is a GEL top coat because it doesn&#x27;t behave like one.  </li>
            <li>My &#x27;go to&#x27; top coat when using my LED dryer.</li>
            <li>After letting my nails &amp;#34;cool down&amp;#34; for a couple of minutes, I was then able to move forward with stamping.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that if you use more than 2 coats of polish, the product doesn&#x27;t cure correctly.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better.  </li>
            <li>I touched them up &amp; applied this top coat &amp; cured for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>it works great and dries very fast under a LED light.</li>
            <li>I bought a 25 dollar gellish travel LED light and it is an amazing light for this top coat.</li>
            <li>Like most products, if you use it in the manner intended, it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I love the shine, but I don&#x27;t depend on it to be an out-the-door kind of top coat as I do when I actually do a real Shellac or Gel polish manicure.</li>
            <li>It removed with nail polish remover easily.</li>
            <li>It wipes off easily with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>short, while the idea of this top coat is great, it does not keep the promises it makes.</li>
            <li>Specially this UV top coat.</li>
            <li>I use 18G LED light and cured it for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Three minutes under the UV light and my manicure was set.</li>
            <li>However , i didnt even need a UV light to cure/dry it .</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t as steadfast as I had hoped, the edges still chipped.  </li>
            <li>So, this was nothing special.</li>
            <li>This was an add-on item, and requires special packaging</li>
            <li>I love that it cures in as fast as 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using it on natural nails under uv or led light for more than 3 minutes to cure.</li>
            <li>No sticky residue, super shiny, &amp; stronger.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s quick dey and high shine, and drys all the polish layers underneath</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the benefits like a normal gel/uv top coat.</li>
            <li>It also says that is cures in just 3 minutes with a UV light, and dries the layers of polish beneath it so that you nails are ready to go, also just like a gel/shellac polish manicure.</li>
            <li>So he put his clear gel top coat on it.</li>
            <li>As far as the finished shine, my Konad topcoat polish has more of a glassy finish than this polish.</li>
            <li>This top coat is shiny and pretty like the normal Seche.  </li>
            <li>Works as it says three min in the uv and your done nails come out shiny and new looking smooth</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this because I love doing my nails myself but after a day and a half my polish was flaking off.  </li>
            <li>Regular Seche Vite is better.</li>
            <li>top coats before, and manage to smudge my nails 20 minutes later.  </li>
            <li>My first issue with the product is the cure time.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a Gel Top Coat - it comes off instantly with any nail polish remover -</li>
            <li>Makes a manicure on the go very convenient!</li>
            <li>so I decided to look for a gel top coat for my regular polish.  </li>
            <li>You have to use a light to get the quick dry benefits.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>bought this to try because I really like their regular polish, however this product does not meet my standard of what a gel top coat should react like....</li>
            <li>I recieved it very quickly, but it was not what was expected.  </li>
            <li>My search for a fast completely drying topcoat continues!</li>
            <li>I typically try to let my layers of polish, usually 2 or 3, dry to a tacky finish before applying the UV top coat and curing it, but there have been a couple times where I was rushed and didn&#x27;t wait before applying the top coat and curing, only to smudge my nails after the curing process.</li>
            <li>I normally used OPI GelColor</li>
            <li>But it was also dry enough that I was able to put socks on and not ruin my polish.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve gotten the good stuff- going cheap was a bad idea.</li>
            <li>After I applied I could even bring my hands near my face without the urge to barf!</li>
            <li>For me it also lasted a shorter time than just an ordinary top coat.  </li>
            <li>It think ordinary seche vite or any ordinary top coat would be better than this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I also keep them pretty short.  </li>
            <li>But it has a bit of a funny smell, and didn&#x27;t last longer than a week.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hands nearly 20 times and did the dishes twice and the smell still did not go away.</li>
            <li>It dried before I cured it with the UV light, but it did not protect the nail polish immediately.</li>
            <li>The only down fall is that the smell is a bit too strong, I would wash my hands twice and still have the funky smell on my nails.</li>
            <li>The product does promise a high gloss shine similar to that which you&#x27;d get from a Gel or Shellac polish manicure, and it DOES deliver on that.</li>
            <li>But it really helps dry your polish underneath it.</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s super shiny!</li>
            <li>It is hard, fast drying, super shiny and last long.</li>
            <li>It simply dries by itself naturally like a regular polish.</li>
            <li>Additionally, even IF the polish felt semi-dry prior to curing the top coat, the Seche Ultra-V is not rock hard for several hours after curing (up to 24 hours at times), so if I painted my nails in the latter part of the evening and went to bed several hours later, I&#x27;d still wake up with crinkled nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> However, if you do a proper manicure, use the Seche base coat for your nail type, polish and let each coat dry and then apply the top coat and cure for 3 minutes under a 9 watt (less with a 36 and above); you will get a tough-wearing top coat.  </li>
            <li> A day and a half of red nails isn&#x27;t long enough and I am not hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Not just dry to the touch - as solid as can be.</li>
            <li> it smears art paint and regular nail polish as well and it takes 3-4 coats to get the minimum of glossy shine each dry time taking 3.5 minutes.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about trying to find ways to make dry times quicker for my regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> My polish was dry to touch.</li>
            <li> the bristles were not straight making smooth application difficult.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a tackiness, takes almost 10 mins to dry under UV.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the more expensive shellac, base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Smells very odd and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as Vinylux topcoat.</li>
            <li> The negative reviewers clearly misunderstand that this is just a UV curable topcoat, not a gel.  </li>
            <li> Not much a uv coat in my opinion, because it comes off with a cotton ball and polish remover, but</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it sinks and DOES NOT WORK AT ALL</li>
            <li> Then almost 48 hours after the application, I go to light a candle and low and behold my effing thumb nail literally caught on fire!!</li>
            <li> I will try again with different polish but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I found this to be thinner, so if you find regular Seche Vite to be too thick you may like this one.</li>
            <li> Typically I use 1 coat of base polish, 2 coats of color and a top coat.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone, first of all it has a very intense disgusting odor.</li>
            <li> I used the Seche base coat, 2 coats polish and this topcoat with my Royal Nails curing light.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money..</li>
            <li> No bubbles and no stringy mess after curing!</li>
            <li> This part is not true (at least not in my experience).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ignore the negative comments like I did and waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I chose to ignore the negative comments.  </li>
            <li> and I mean like brushing up against it.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is not good.  </li>
            <li> what a horrible product it did not work right.</li>
            <li> My nails are black this week &amp; have been chipping like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I used a base coat, two layers of regular nail polish (NOT GEL!!!), some nail art paint, and a coat of the Seche Ultra-V.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this topcoat.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was a bit skeptical - dries in three minutes?  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed</li>
            <li> sorry to say wont be ordering this product again :(</li>
            <li> maybe just a bad bottle...</li>
            <li> You  will never be disappointed with this brand.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> Terrible disappointment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, price, &amp; delivery arrival timing!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone, first of all it has a very intense disgusting odor. After I applied I could even bring my hands near my face without the urge to barf! I washed my hands nearly 20 times and did the dishes twice and the smell still did not go away. Then almost 48 hours after the application, I go to light a candle and low and behold my effing thumb nail literally caught on fire!! Please beware before buying this product, I&#x27;m currently trying to get it recalled.</li>
            <li> Regular Seche Vite is better. I found this to be thinner, so if you find regular Seche Vite to be too thick you may like this one. You don&#x27;t need a UV lamp. Its not as shiny at regular Seche Vite. I wont be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works great. Keeps my manicure and pedicure longer. The only down fall is that the smell is a bit too strong, I would wash my hands twice and still have the funky smell on my nails. I do not recommend using it on natural nails under uv or led light for more than 3 minutes to cure.</li>
            <li> I have acrylic nails I tried this on them a couple of days ago when I had a fill in. This polish, the nail tech said, wasn&#x27;t working. So he put his clear gel top coat on it. He said this was more for manicures.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a gel polish.  The negative reviewers clearly misunderstand that this is just a UV curable topcoat, not a gel.  It will not perform like a gel.  However, if you do a proper manicure, use the Seche base coat for your nail type, polish and let each coat dry and then apply the top coat and cure for 3 minutes under a 9 watt (less with a 36 and above); you will get a tough-wearing top coat.  Like most products, if you use it in the manner intended, it works just fine.  Read the instructions included.</li>
            <li> Not much a uv coat in my opinion, because it comes off with a cotton ball and polish remover, but I love that it&#x27;s quick dey and high shine, and drys all the polish layers underneath</li>
            <li> This works as directed</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this topcoat. But curiosity made me purchase it. I have only used it on my toes because I use gel polish on my nails. But it really helps dry your polish underneath it. You have to use a light to get the quick dry benefits. I use 18G LED light and cured it for 60 seconds. My polish was dry to touch. But it was also dry enough that I was able to put socks on and not ruin my polish. I am amazed! I had no cracking or chipping. It removed with nail polish remover easily. I will keep this in my bag of tricks.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was a bit skeptical - dries in three minutes?  Really?  I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; top coats before, and manage to smudge my nails 20 minutes later.  Not with this!  I used a base coat, two layers of regular nail polish (NOT GEL!!!), some nail art paint, and a coat of the Seche Ultra-V.  Three minutes under the UV light and my manicure was set. Not just dry to the touch - as solid as can be.</li>
            <li> bought this to try because I really like their regular polish, however this product does not meet my standard of what a gel top coat should react like.... It dries with in 3.5 minute under the uv lamp however it does not come out glossy nor seal like a gel top coat should.... it smears art paint and regular nail polish as well and it takes 3-4 coats to get the minimum of glossy shine each dry time taking 3.5 minutes..... sorry to say wont be ordering this product again :(</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Best UV top coat i can find.</li>
            <li> I normally love this brand. but in the bottle i got, the brush appeared damaged. the bristles were not straight making smooth application difficult. maybe just a bad bottle...</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! it works great and dries very fast under a LED light. I bought a 25 dollar gellish travel LED light and it is an amazing light for this top coat. Dries it within 45 seconds.</li>
            <li> I recieved it very quickly, but it was not what was expected.  It dried before I cured it with the UV light, but it did not protect the nail polish immediately.</li>
            <li> This polish is the best UV Top Coat out there. I couldnt find it out at beauty store retailers sonInwas pleased to see&lt;br /&gt;It on here! No bubbles and no stringy mess after curing! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works as it says three min in the uv and your done nails come out shiny and new looking smooth</li>
            <li> I hate it.  I&#x27;m not even sure if this is a GEL top coat because it doesn&#x27;t behave like one.  It wipes off easily with nail polish remover.  As one reviewer stated, it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions so I used my UV lamp for the standard 3 minutes.  For me it also lasted a shorter time than just an ordinary top coat.  It chipped the same day I put it on.  I like seche vite a lot so I chose to ignore the negative comments.  It think ordinary seche vite or any ordinary top coat would be better than this stuff.  Don&#x27;t ignore the negative comments like I did and waste your money.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;go to&#x27; top coat when using my LED dryer.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ! However , i didnt even need a UV light to cure/dry it . I bought the Epica UV machine off Amazon &amp; this UV gel topcoat. It simply dries by itself naturally like a regular polish. Dont kno if its supposed to be like that , but it works though . I just use it as an extra shiny topcoat(:</li>
            <li> So, this was nothing special. I&#x27;m all about trying to find ways to make dry times quicker for my regular nail polish. My first issue with the product is the cure time. I had to cure this topcoat for 6 minutes under my UV lamp. After letting my nails &amp;#34;cool down&amp;#34; for a couple of minutes, I was then able to move forward with stamping. I also noticed that if you use more than 2 coats of polish, the product doesn&#x27;t cure correctly. Typically I use 1 coat of base polish, 2 coats of color and a top coat. To use this, I have to cut out the second coat of color. As far as the finished shine, my Konad topcoat polish has more of a glassy finish than this polish. The best thing about this product is that it comes off easily which is a nice break from soaking off gel polish. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. My search for a fast completely drying topcoat continues!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this because I love doing my nails myself but after a day and a half my polish was flaking off.  I used the Seche base coat, 2 coats polish and this topcoat with my Royal Nails curing light.  I dislike gels because of the maintenence involved, so I thought this would be better.  A day and a half of red nails isn&#x27;t long enough and I am not hard on my nails.  I also keep them pretty short.  I will try again with different polish but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> According to my wife it is a great product. We have given away to fried to try them out.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as steadfast as I had hoped, the edges still chipped.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of the top coat by Seche though!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it sinks and DOES NOT WORK AT ALL... what a waste of money..</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  I&#x27;ve had gel topcoat before, I know how to use it, I know what to do- but this stuff is not good.  My polish began chipping off two days after I did my manicure.  This was an add-on item, and requires special packaging so I can&#x27;t return it.  I should&#x27;ve gotten the good stuff- going cheap was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> The bottle was sealed shut upon arrival! Terrible disappointment.</li>
            <li> This top coat is shiny and pretty like the normal Seche.  But it has a bit of a funny smell, and didn&#x27;t last longer than a week.  In fact I started having chipping by the 2nd day.  I didn&#x27;t see the benefits like a normal gel/uv top coat.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a Gel Top Coat - it comes off instantly with any nail polish remover - and I mean like brushing up against it. It&#x27;s not sturdy like a gel either.</li>
            <li> The name says it all!. You  will never be disappointed with this brand. Specially this UV top coat. I can make my own gel manicure with any polish!</li>
            <li> what a horrible product it did not work right.</li>
            <li> I love that it cures in as fast as 2 minutes. Makes a manicure on the go very convenient!</li>
            <li> The product does promise a high gloss shine similar to that which you&#x27;d get from a Gel or Shellac polish manicure, and it DOES deliver on that. I mean, it&#x27;s super shiny! It also says that is cures in just 3 minutes with a UV light, and dries the layers of polish beneath it so that you nails are ready to go, also just like a gel/shellac polish manicure. This part is not true (at least not in my experience). I typically try to let my layers of polish, usually 2 or 3, dry to a tacky finish before applying the UV top coat and curing it, but there have been a couple times where I was rushed and didn&#x27;t wait before applying the top coat and curing, only to smudge my nails after the curing process. Additionally, even IF the polish felt semi-dry prior to curing the top coat, the Seche Ultra-V is not rock hard for several hours after curing (up to 24 hours at times), so if I painted my nails in the latter part of the evening and went to bed several hours later, I&#x27;d still wake up with crinkled nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, while the idea of this top coat is great, it does not keep the promises it makes. I love the shine, but I don&#x27;t depend on it to be an out-the-door kind of top coat as I do when I actually do a real Shellac or Gel polish manicure. Overall, I&#x27;d give this product an A for effort, but realistically... a C+ at best.</li>
            <li> Best top coat!! It is hard, fast drying, super shiny and last long. AND do not need a UV lamp!</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the more expensive shellac, base and top coat.  Because this product chipped the following day.  I was not impressed</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a tackiness, takes almost 10 mins to dry under UV. But kept rhinestones on my nails for weeks!</li>
            <li> I normally used OPI GelColor but i have been changing my polish alot these days so I decided to look for a gel top coat for my regular polish.  My nails are black this week &amp; have been chipping like crazy.  I touched them up &amp; applied this top coat &amp; cured for 3 minutes.  No sticky residue, super shiny, &amp; stronger.  I will let you know how they hold up over the weekend since we will be doing some home improvements projects.  As of today, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Smells very odd and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as Vinylux topcoat.</li>
