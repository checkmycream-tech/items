            <li>I am still looking for the best combination of blade and.razor.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m red-haired with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I am biased against Gillette because they are a very good product management and a marketing company, none of which I want to buy.</li>
            <li>And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>For me and my face these lived up to every bit of the hype I&#x27;ve read here and in forums, just an incredible shave.</li>
            <li>Simply incredible.</li>
            <li>You know they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re feathers!</li>
            <li>These are great razor blades.  </li>
            <li>these work great.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>I thought that I would try Feather because of all the great reviews</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Those are great by them self.</li>
            <li>Great razors,</li>
            <li>Great product as probably anyone looking at this review already knows.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re great DE blades.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>and they work great.  </li>
            <li>The price was great for 30 blades.  </li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>SHAVENATION on utube has really great videos.</li>
            <li>Be sure  to shop around for the best price.</li>
            <li>I use the Feather with a good quality shaving cream, applied with a brush, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Test it yourself side by side and the Feather will not seem so superior.</li>
            <li>I must admit at once that it is a good blade</li>
            <li>the razors  are probably good</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the money to afford a good one</li>
            <li>no razor burn and i am not that good yet</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>BEST BLADES AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>Good product, will keep ordering as I need to refills these blades.</li>
            <li>The Feather blades do a good job.</li>
            <li>Four to five shaves per blade,what more can you say?these are the best blades I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>I use them in everything from my mild Edwin Jagger DE89LBL to my aggressive MÃ¼hle R41 and they perform flawlessly, but as with anything, YMMV.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t my favorite, I feel like I don&#x27;t always get a great shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the quality.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them I had the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>Sharper is better!</li>
            <li>I love these feathers!</li>
            <li>Perfect shave on first use, but these blades don&#x27;t hold an edge as well as I would like.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>and the difference is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Great razors for being so cheap.</li>
            <li>I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  </li>
            <li>I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact they beat their own scheduled delivery by one week.</li>
            <li>work nice  </li>
            <li>Many really good tips are found in DE shaving forums.</li>
            <li>Nice item, postage in two weeks from Thailand to France.&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li>They cut the hair nice</li>
            <li>More good news is that Amazon seems to be a reliable source.  </li>
            <li>Does provide a nice shave for three mornings.</li>
            <li>This prompted my amazon.com search for a more suitable replacement that I could order in quantity and keep good supply on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty sure these are the best blades</li>
            <li>All of which are decent blades but the Feather blades are the best.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use these, he finds them very easy to shave with</li>
            <li>Best blade I have used so far!</li>
            <li>they are still very good blades, but too much money.</li>
            <li>This product has the best edge that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if these are the sharpest DL blades or if they are necessarily the best, but they are the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I use them in an Edwin Jagger and am pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>and I probably caused it  very smooth blades</li>
            <li>Highly regarded and recommended elsewhere for good reason...!</li>
            <li>Just shave nice and easy without pressing (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway)</li>
            <li>I kept hearing how shaving with a DE razor is better and cheaper than shaving with the multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li>My shaving gear isn&#x27;t top of the line.  </li>
            <li>Sharper is better.</li>
            <li>so i thought they might be 3 times better.    </li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>I thought it was more myth than fact.  </li>
            <li>World&#x27;s sharpest razor blade - what more can I say?</li>
            <li>From the many reviews i have read you would think these are what the Wolverine uses</li>
            <li>Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you would be more than glad to dispose off and take another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until trying these, Derbys were my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>Dorcos have been mostly miss.</li>
            <li>Since switching to the world of safety razor shaving, I&#x27;ve been testing various products to see what works best for me.</li>
            <li>But razor blades are very personal and you just have to try a number of brands to find what works best for your face.</li>
            <li>Took a couple of shaves to figure out how to use the blade and love the closeness it brings.</li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>I have found Feather to be the sharpest and most aggressive blades I have tried.</li>
            <li>but most of the leading ones on the market.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have your DE shaving technique mastered before trying these or you will bleed, but once you know how to work with them</li>
            <li>Now on I just have to make sure the vendor in in USA.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was OK considering the package was coming from overseas.</li>
            <li>granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals...</li>
            <li>My experience has been off and on enjoyable.</li>
            <li>So if you order get the 30 or better count.</li>
            <li>(Derby and Shark) that were ok, but</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE BLADES.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t understand why I couldn&#x27;t get more than one shave to a blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun; but your picking all manner of (inexpensive) stuff to hopefully SET your prep and system (read everything and watch good videos)</li>
            <li>This brings you to the sharpest Feather blade, among many.</li>
            <li>You may not believe we are really able to get this close</li>
            <li>It does change your face for the better.</li>
            <li>More, the closer you shave.</li>
            <li>I felt confident to go ahead and get thirty more Feathers while I was still sampling and collecting data on the others.  </li>
            <li>If anything, the fact that you are shaving using the sharpest blade should force you to be more patient and focus on shaving more.</li>
            <li>Favorite blades along with personna lab blues.</li>
            <li>The sharper the blade the better performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have become my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>The feather blades are my favorite of all the DE Blades.</li>
            <li>Some cheaper  blades will do the job satisfactory and that is ok</li>
            <li>but , if you want a nice smooth 1 pass shave then these are the blades to use.</li>
            <li>Some guys love &#x27;em, some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure I get all the angles and everything.</li>
            <li>The best double edge razor I have used in 50 years.  </li>
            <li>Switched to DE shaving about 5 years ago and have tried many razor brands.  </li>
            <li>Much better then the Derby blades I used to purchase here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it must have come most of  the way by mule train.</li>
            <li>These shave as close in one pass and many others do in two or more passes.</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>These are the best double edge razor blades on the market.</li>
            <li>Brings many memories of days gone .</li>
            <li>for some reason I am more irritated after using these than with the astras..</li>
            <li>And get way more ingrown hairs...</li>
            <li>You can find many videos on utube for this...</li>
            <li>I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique</li>
            <li>The first shave with both were good</li>
            <li>Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
            <li>These are also perfect for the &amp;#34;night before&amp;#34; shaves because the shave is so close, my face is still smooth well into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is what I was doing with my Derby blades which deliver  perfectly smooth shave on my head and face with no irritation The feathers performed equally as well delivering a nearly perfect shave even with the rushed shave.</li>
            <li>These are the most fantastic blades I&#x27;ve tried to date.  </li>
            <li>you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\</li>
            <li>Much better the cheap disposables</li>
            <li>I went to a antique store and found a old school razor for $9.00 and these blades work great with it.</li>
            <li>They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li>stars because they&#x27;re a good bargain, much cheaper and better than cartridges, and they make me feel special.</li>
            <li>Dont listen to people who saw they are to sharp, they are perfect!!!</li>
            <li>That is true, but respect the blade and let the blade do the work with very light pressure and it will give you the closest shave you have ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the sound of the blade making that shh.. sound as it takes care of business.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way easily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to pack and easy for disposal.</li>
            <li>Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I did get distracted the first day or so and got a nice nick on the cheek</li>
            <li>Hands down Feathers are the best!  </li>
            <li>Both did a fine job.</li>
            <li>I started with Baili blades that came along with the razor and they were fine.</li>
            <li>The sharpest and most durable blades at a super price.</li>
            <li>In my limited experience, I do feel they are great blades, they gave a very smooth shave and one thing I noticed</li>
            <li>but I was extremely pleased with the results on the very first shave.  </li>
            <li>Super Max triple blade safety razor that is made in India and available at dollar stores gives a close shave but not as many number of shaves as you would like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also experiencing a cleaner shave with less irritation, and the QC has been excellent so far, with every blade as good as the one before.</li>
            <li>fantastic, glides so smooth, cuts so well.  </li>
            <li>and you will really enjoy shaving with these.  </li>
            <li>Nothing I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said; if you want to get rid of irritation and have smooth skin for days these are the razors for you.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you prepare your face for the shave by first showering and washing your face or by washing your face and placing a nice hot hand towel over your face for five minutes.  </li>
            <li>I got a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth shave with NO cuts or abrasions.  </li>
            <li>Pricier than most but well worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will enjoy shaving with this blade....</li>
            <li>some were cheaply made that nicked my face</li>
            <li>and I have never gotten a shave as smooth and irritation free.</li>
            <li>best blades I have tried so far, which have been many different brands.</li>
            <li>Best blades I&#x27;ve used so far, though I can only get three shaves at the most out of a blade.</li>
            <li>These blades are often recognized for being the sharpest available.</li>
            <li>works great for a double edge blade.  </li>
            <li>Baby smooth DE shaves can even be done faster, once setup correctly.</li>
            <li>After using these for only the briefest of time, I have great respect for their sharpness.  </li>
            <li>Glides and shaves smoothly.  </li>
            <li>They cost more but as for me they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I own Spydero stainless knives.  </li>
            <li>but I did manage to get some spots baby butt smooth with these blades, unlike the others.</li>
            <li>I thought the first shave with a new blade was great.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, you can get more and will, if you do it all right and put alcohol on it, so it doesn&#x27;t rust when you are done.</li>
            <li>While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with these razor&#x27;s my shave has been very close and works great with my other shaving products I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>blades, there very little loss to trying one, so put this on your list and if you like it, great, If not, keep searching!</li>
            <li>This blade is perfect for a course heavy beards or to put in a DE safety razor that gives mild shaves.</li>
            <li>Good blades only used them once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I guess a china razor $2.00 was the best sale, 89 cent Williams soap puck and 8 cent medium Dorco blade and free DIY brush (wife discarded, big makeup brush, or old paint brush regrouped, just to test?)</li>
            <li>You can buy better blades at much lower prices!</li>
            <li>clean shaves before I feel the need to replace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the first shave I will admit that I didn&#x27;t prepare my head and face as good as I normally do and was rushed during the shave.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a great new and so typically mild or milder razor then you are acclimating (subset to what you know) and to your new safety</li>
            <li>My face feels great, minimal to no burn</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that everyone is different, and products that work for one person might not be at all good for another.</li>
            <li>Every review that says these things are probably the sharpest blades out there - is true.</li>
            <li>I tried this Japanese brand because I own Japanese knives that are great.  </li>
            <li>Gives me the smoothest shaves of all, the sharpest of all and priced not bad if you buy in bulk (in my case about 28  USA cents per blade in pack of 30) .</li>
            <li>Electrics best takes MUCH longer, is a lot less close (than even passable work/speed shaves), and irritates comparatively with friction.</li>
            <li>sharp and great quality</li>
            <li>I will not order any other blades but these because they work great.</li>
            <li>These things are super sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ONLY TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE THEM WHEN I FIND TRUELY EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li>But if I want a super close shave these are the ones I use.</li>
            <li>And there is not one of them that degraded so quickly.</li>
            <li>you are experienced shaver, then I am sure you would have tried or at least heard of these.</li>
            <li>For best results, I run my electric razor over my face, especially around my upper lip and chin areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many many different brands of blades and none of them even get close to matching Feathers ability to give a close shave without pulling the hairs out.</li>
            <li>You have to be patient and try to make use of whatever is available such as good cream, brush, oil, lots of water etc to make it easier for the razor to glide as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SHAVE LIGHTLY with this blade, with the grain at first, and know that it is sharper than the sharpest samurai sword in Japan.</li>
            <li>Overall during this trial shave, I noticed that the blade had an exceptionally smooth glide against my skin and cut very easily.</li>
            <li>Astra was a pretty close second (good to try if your scared of these)</li>
            <li>:) You SHOULD really leave a (tiniest) bit of stubble your first week (of any changes) and not lust for it THEN.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, good shave.  </li>
            <li>But super sharp blades are not necessarily the best for some folks, and I&#x27;m one of them.</li>
            <li>(where you rarely nick yourself).  </li>
            <li>This blade is Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Actually I Rather Liked These Blades.....  </li>
            <li>We often forget it&#x27;s completely up to you to build it to any shaving way, that you need, or many way/razors.</li>
            <li>Some were better than others, but the Feather stood out (so far).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to a multi-blade disposable (although I do keep my electric Braun handy for shaving around my nose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard how good they are and how sharp they are.  </li>
            <li>Still not as sharp as I had hoped but still good</li>
            <li>they are sharp, just as any good tool should be.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and that is a good thing as it cuts right through the hair with ease, no tugging and no irratation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Feathers to experienced wet shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took away one star because I&#x27;ve had about two blades that weren&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li>the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll want to get to a point and not change stuff RIGHT NOW; but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been double edge shaving for more than 2 years, and this is the best alternative to using rip-off Gilette or BiC</li>
            <li>Very sharp and good shaves.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree, but honestly that didn&#x27;t really tell me if I should try the blade or not.</li>
            <li>Paired with a mild razor Feathers work very well, paired with an aggressive razor you may be wearing the marks for a while and everyone will call you Nick.</li>
            <li>Costs is good and get several shaves from quality old time blades.</li>
            <li>The hold up very well (about a week for me) and very consistent.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality and stay sharp being that I&#x27;m a daily shaver.</li>
            <li>This blades are very sharp and dont need to make much pressure, im happy with this feather blades i dont take take too much time shaving.</li>
            <li>No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews</li>
            <li>The second shave was also okay.  </li>
            <li>Before you shave, take a hot shower, use a pre-shave like Sharps Barber and Shop Kid Glove Oil-Free Pre-Shave Stick and a substantive shave cream like the one made by Aveda.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>many years, I&#x27;d been using store label brand blades from various drug stores and discount retailers.</li>
            <li>a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work.</li>
            <li>but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so.</li>
            <li>Possibly you&#x27;ll have better luck.  </li>
            <li>Tried many blades and these are second to none!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this blade to those interested.</li>
            <li>Used this blade for the first time in my Merkur 23C.</li>
            <li>Wow, extremely smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Awesome, but expensive blades.</li>
            <li>I made two separate passes and experienced  only a minor nick when I caught a place I had cut before.</li>
            <li>If you have read anything about Feather blades, the first thing you will hear is that they are the &amp;#34;sharpest&amp;#34; blades you will find.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the most likely reason.</li>
            <li>It will happen and it can be done as fast as 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>The first shave with the Feather gave me a BBS on a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li>I cut my self plenty on the first try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My 3rd and 4th blades each got about twice that many shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I tried some BlueBirds that came as a sample with my last order of Feather blades, and they&#x27;re much more forgiving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also interested in trying the Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well but thought that they might shave closer.  </li>
            <li>I am a first time safety razor user.</li>
            <li>BUT I put a small bit more of an angle that works better for me.</li>
            <li>After not shaving for a few days, I had a good amount of scruff.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that is easily irratated and to make matters worse, I&#x27;m 35 and have a grown mans beard with hair that is like wire.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted Feather blades because I figured I&#x27;d buy what many consider &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; and be done blade shopping, but other blades are far more forgiving, and, for me, provide a shave that is just as close as the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Best of all, they stay sharp much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t as good as normal razors, friend recommended these blades and WOW, all the other blades are pure garbage, these cut soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second Shave - Perfectly smooth with a little more ease than my Derby blades.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp blades</li>
            <li>And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with the Korean Dorcos, the Russian Gillettes, and the French Bics.</li>
            <li>I have a good knowledge of Japanese and American knives.  </li>
            <li>Be careful the firs few times and once you are use to the blades you will get the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t careful, you will cut yourself very easily.  </li>
            <li>Little stuff, like always wearing a balm (lotion, and a good, inexpensive one with sane ingredients, because many suck) and BEFORE your face ever gets dry, really do matter.</li>
            <li>I have relatively coarse hair, and sensitive skin, so shaving has always been a bit of an uphill battle for me, everything that improves the process is a great boon, which brings us back to the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell any difference between Feather and Astra after the first shave</li>
            <li>Super smooth, irritation free shave with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for experienced or new shavers, though the latter should take extra care until they get used to them.</li>
            <li>When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna...</li>
            <li>so my razor gets a lot of usage and my head is a bit tricky to shave with some peaks and valleys on tube back side and a neck that is easily irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of blades some were good but didn&#x27;t last long  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how many shaves I get from a single blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna]] and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the [[ASIN:B004LDCJV0 Feather]]; however, the end result is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am using an Edwin Jagged DE89 and decided to give the Feathers a try before purchasing a large order of blades to how these performed vs the Derby blades that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>but I think it just a BIT too sharp for my skin as even with a hot towel and a good thick layer of shaving soap and very light pressure on the razor it cut my skin PLENTY.  </li>
            <li>However, as long as I&#x27;m not careless or half asleep, these blades are great.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back, especially considering how phenomenally priced these are!</li>
            <li>I consistently get a better, smoother, closer shave with these than any other blade I have used.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you much more about the differences between these and other blades, because after I used my first feather I had what I was looking for and haven&#x27;t tried anything else since.</li>
            <li>The packaging must have gotten a little warm because my blades were stuck to the wrapper.</li>
            <li>Very sharp clean shave!!</li>
            <li>Super sharp and comfortable with my Merkur</li>
            <li>These are much nicer than the blades available at my local big-box drug store.</li>
            <li>this may very well be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li>With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals.</li>
            <li>Did I really want the sharpest blade?</li>
            <li>if it is, I question its stainless steel/platinum claims.</li>
            <li>This is DE wet shaving and nothing is better.</li>
            <li>Straight is slower.</li>
            <li>So you probably have not seen that much change yet.</li>
            <li>and Murker stainless are the ones that come closest to this.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought me a straight razor kit for Christmas about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They work very well for me while others complain of nicks.</li>
            <li>i really went on the recommendations of others</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I just made sure to be careful.</li>
            <li>Very pleasurable experience to use these.</li>
            <li>By far, for my skin, this blade results in the closest shave (beats out Astra, Shark, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock (my 2nd favorite), Personna, Merkur, etc....).</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t had a great experience with other blades, try the Feather before you give up on wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Feather blades are the most consistently sharp and reliable of DE blades.</li>
            <li>SHARP  :)</li>
            <li>I literally just got done with my first shave using these blades and WOW!</li>
            <li>They give a reasonably close shave at a decent price.</li>
            <li>the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But to the point: IF and only IF you STILL can&#x27;t get at your stubble enough (maybe older, and maybe Grey, or simply beard from hell), in two passes or less (most or ABOUT 90% in the first pass is ideal arguably; because that&#x27;s a HUGE amount gentler and NOT even slower than \\&quot;one\\&quot; buffing pass) and the third pass is then optional and little more than a touch up</li>
            <li>Sharp and clean,, right on time</li>
            <li>This bundle deal is pretty cheap compared to other crappy razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a three pass kind of guy.</li>
            <li>They last a full shave and can be reused if you store your DE in baby oil between uses.</li>
            <li>A little more than most other blades</li>
            <li>If your relatively new to wet shaving, proper face prep before shaving is very important!</li>
            <li>Super smooth, last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most.</li>
            <li>electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid some extra money to get an edwin jagger DE89 (one of the user friendliest razors) and an escali brush (good bang for the buck) with some proraso shaving cream (green puck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades make short work of any day&#x27;s worth of growth in short order, without the irritation I have often experienced with other DE blades or even the multiple blade systems.  </li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend these blades.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you try them yourself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting a sampler pack of these to try in your razor.</li>
            <li>I have tried many razor blades and these far surpass the quality and sharpness of other blades.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave and long lasting.</li>
            <li>If you are new to DE razors, or like me returning to them after a couple of decades, take it easy, and be careful.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a really good thing; TOUGH dense beard guys can get the stubble off, just by letting the weight of the razor head basically do all the work.</li>
            <li>if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most.</li>
            <li>I tend to cut myself skin more after they get dull no issue at first though.  </li>
            <li>I picked some of these up along with a cheap double edge razor from Feather, and find I get a much closer shave with lesser irritation than with any of the Mach 3&#x27;s or Fusions of the world.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to irritate my sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What that really means is you are not two years old.</li>
            <li>Ready to use Mach-3 etc cartridges employ &#x27;tug and cut&#x27; method and come fit at an ultra safe angle which makes it difficult to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>and I barely threw the first one away a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I bought a safety razor to save money on normal razors.</li>
            <li>Your experience may be totally different; certainly the Feathers are a favorite among other users.</li>
            <li>I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative,</li>
            <li>it cuts extremely close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was curious to check out these blades since everyone seems to agree that they are the sharpest blades and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>of stubble leaving closeness control angles, that&#x27;s now newly afforded to you, on newer, flatter shaving ways.</li>
            <li>i am new to the DE world, after 16 years of shaving with electric and multi razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I am new to shaving using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>This, tough guys way, is training wheels-up however, and only after a week or better practice (not a big deal, just real patience for one time only; but many fall away just for that!).</li>
            <li>So now you&#x27;re only week or two from really getting the PERFECT SHAVE they said was impossible and with the stubble off EFFICIENTLY *</li>
            <li>I picked up two old Stainless steel old adjustible razors at a  used trader shop 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Remember to use very little pressure - or else you may also shave the top of your skin off.</li>
            <li>If you use a shaving system that requires double edge blades, the Feather blades are exactly what you need.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not have to changed blades but once a week.</li>
            <li>this method, I found the shaves close and comfortable with only minor degradation until that one shaves that tells me the blade is finished.</li>
            <li>While its true that each different blade brand is going to shave differently in different razors, in my opinion these are the sharpest blades you will find.</li>
            <li>These razors are super sharp.  </li>
            <li>Well these are super sharp as everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Although they worked well enough, I often felt I was paying far too much for the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that they are a -QUALITY- item Bar none.  </li>
            <li>Halfway through the third shave the razor really started to pull.</li>

            <li>By far.</li>
            <li>Really like these razor blades, just started using my double edge again and</li>
            <li>As far as holding an edge, I can get around 5 or 6 shaves with them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an old hat at using a safety razor, and you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest blades out there, these are what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>week old beard doesn&#x27;t stand a chance after 2 passes with this blade.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect to use them unless I absolutely need to and then for only one shave per blade.  </li>
            <li>, as far as the &#x27;newbies-stay-away&#x27; advice here, I believe it is overdone.</li>
            <li>By far Feather blades are the sharpest and smoothest DE razor blades made.</li>
            <li>--much safer than the double edge).</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for someone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After doing some research I learned that old style safety razors were the way to go to fight the ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li>Men need to embrace the old style shaving and consider it a pleasure rather than a task.</li>
            <li>These are much nicer/sharper, and allow the user to simply focusing on the cleanness of the shave, as opposed to the resulting length produced.</li>
            <li>However, I have known people with sensitive skin to have irritation issues using these blades.</li>
            <li>These blades irritate my sensitive skin and don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>As far as rating them I would say... that the Feather blades are #1.</li>
            <li>These blades are good, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li>very sharp i use shark super chromes and these definitely surpass them with sharpness but not so much with durability</li>
            <li>Super sharp blades!</li>
            <li>But keep in mind that they are super freaking sharp!  </li>
            <li>They are MUCH more sharp than any other brand.  </li>
            <li>I usually get about 2 weeks out of one razor (with daily use), but 8 - 12 days may be more optimal.  </li>
            <li>In American I like D2 and also 1095 in high carbon blades.</li>
            <li>Having a much sharper edge than previously used blades, I experience a much cleaner shave with one stroke.</li>
            <li>But the 2nd pass (or 1st pass on a normal day)</li>
            <li>Be careful when you first start using them because they are the sharpest out there.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this blade to anyone, be they dissatisfied with their current blade or new to the experience of shaving with double edge safety blades.</li>
            <li>Outstanding far sharper than i was expecting if you like derby extra blades try this with very little pressure and you won&#x27;t go back</li>
            <li>They are super sharp, and they last forever.  </li>
            <li>I love these razors and it&#x27;s hard to beat these prices, especially if your a prime member!</li>
            <li>I found the same problem with every new blade.</li>
            <li>So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to using double edged razor blades, be warned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried a few different brands of safety razor blades, but so far these are just fine with me.  </li>
            <li>I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first</li>
            <li>Of course, you can choose to move the other direction, for some days and cut slightly less and comfort/safety for you (like a smaller gap Tech clone and less sharp blade for your beard type), for extreme speed, shaving twice a day or just for touch up passes, something like that, or for not having to think about it much at all, while doing it(half-asleep?), and also THE best for working around anything like moles(you</li>
            <li>But there are plenty of lazy days out there where that doesn&#x27;t happen, and I&#x27;m getting a much better shave in a single pass than I did with Derbys.</li>
            <li>Finally a decent shave and the edge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean to sound dramatic, but it really made a huge difference in the glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to a safety razor when Gillete finally went too far and put a battery in the razor to make it vibrate.</li>
            <li>The Feather does seem a little thinner and therefore more flexible but that doesn&#x27;t mean much because it locks into the razor anyhow.    </li>
            <li>also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues</li>
            <li>I can only assume that the blade&#x27;s edge is completely gone after one shave which</li>
            <li>No nicks on the second shave no irritation on my sensitive</li>
            <li>Perfect for cutting hair after letting it go for a few extra days.</li>
            <li>The first really big improvement to my shave was moving to a double-edged wet shave process.</li>
            <li>The Feathers are slightly more expensive than other brands, but they are worth it.    </li>
            <li>The embarrassing red splotches I lived with for years have nearly vanished entirely.</li>
            <li>they are more Expensive than other blades, but not sure if they are any better.  </li>
            <li>I could usually get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves with the BICs.</li>
            <li>I never used a sharper blade, but they dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Those products seem to promote a rushed and careless shave, while this seems to harken back to the day where a man took a little more time to do things right.    </li>
            <li>I have a thick, dark hairs, so my 5 o&#x27;clock is more of a 2 o&#x27;clock</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have a cleaner shave than with this blade as long as you practice and know EXACTLY how to use a double edged, very sharp blade and razor.</li>
            <li>I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty tough.</li>
            <li>These blades are no more dangerous than any other double edged razor, but the bevel is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive but high quality and extremely sharp!</li>
            <li>I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  </li>

            <li> I am still looking for the best combination of blade and.razor.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m red-haired with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I am biased against Gillette because they are a very good product management and a marketing company, none of which I want to buy.</li>
            <li> And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> For me and my face these lived up to every bit of the hype I&#x27;ve read here and in forums, just an incredible shave.</li>
            <li> Simply incredible.</li>
            <li> You know they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re feathers!</li>
            <li> These are great razor blades.  </li>
            <li> these work great.</li>
            <li> Great price</li>
            <li> Great value.  </li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would try Feather because of all the great reviews</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> Those are great by them self.</li>
            <li> Great razors,</li>
            <li> Great product as probably anyone looking at this review already knows.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re great DE blades.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> and they work great.  </li>
            <li> The price was great for 30 blades.  </li>
            <li> Worked great.</li>
            <li> SHAVENATION on utube has really great videos.</li>
            <li> Be sure  to shop around for the best price.</li>
            <li> I use the Feather with a good quality shaving cream, applied with a brush, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> Test it yourself side by side and the Feather will not seem so superior.</li>
            <li> I must admit at once that it is a good blade</li>
            <li> the razors  are probably good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the money to afford a good one</li>
            <li> no razor burn and i am not that good yet</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> BEST BLADES AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> Good product, will keep ordering as I need to refills these blades.</li>
            <li> The Feather blades do a good job.</li>
            <li> Four to five shaves per blade,what more can you say?these are the best blades I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> I use them in everything from my mild Edwin Jagger DE89LBL to my aggressive MÃ¼hle R41 and they perform flawlessly, but as with anything, YMMV.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t my favorite, I feel like I don&#x27;t always get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the quality.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them I had the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> Sharper is better!</li>
            <li> I love these feathers!</li>
            <li> Perfect shave on first use, but these blades don&#x27;t hold an edge as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> and the difference is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Great razors for being so cheap.</li>
            <li> I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  </li>
            <li> I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact they beat their own scheduled delivery by one week.</li>
            <li> work nice  </li>
            <li> Many really good tips are found in DE shaving forums.</li>
            <li> Nice item, postage in two weeks from Thailand to France.&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> They cut the hair nice</li>
            <li> More good news is that Amazon seems to be a reliable source.  </li>
            <li> Does provide a nice shave for three mornings.</li>
            <li> This prompted my amazon.com search for a more suitable replacement that I could order in quantity and keep good supply on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty sure these are the best blades</li>
            <li> All of which are decent blades but the Feather blades are the best.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these, he finds them very easy to shave with</li>
            <li> Best blade I have used so far!</li>
            <li> they are still very good blades, but too much money.</li>
            <li> This product has the best edge that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if these are the sharpest DL blades or if they are necessarily the best, but they are the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use them in an Edwin Jagger and am pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> and I probably caused it  very smooth blades</li>
            <li> Highly regarded and recommended elsewhere for good reason...!</li>
            <li> Just shave nice and easy without pressing (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway)</li>
            <li> I kept hearing how shaving with a DE razor is better and cheaper than shaving with the multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li> My shaving gear isn&#x27;t top of the line.  </li>
            <li> Sharper is better.</li>
            <li> so i thought they might be 3 times better.    </li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> I thought it was more myth than fact.  </li>
            <li> World&#x27;s sharpest razor blade - what more can I say?</li>
            <li> From the many reviews i have read you would think these are what the Wolverine uses</li>
            <li> Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you would be more than glad to dispose off and take another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until trying these, Derbys were my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> Dorcos have been mostly miss.</li>
            <li> Since switching to the world of safety razor shaving, I&#x27;ve been testing various products to see what works best for me.</li>
            <li> But razor blades are very personal and you just have to try a number of brands to find what works best for your face.</li>
            <li> Took a couple of shaves to figure out how to use the blade and love the closeness it brings.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.</li>
            <li> I have found Feather to be the sharpest and most aggressive blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> but most of the leading ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have your DE shaving technique mastered before trying these or you will bleed, but once you know how to work with them</li>
            <li> Now on I just have to make sure the vendor in in USA.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was OK considering the package was coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals...</li>
            <li> My experience has been off and on enjoyable.</li>
            <li> So if you order get the 30 or better count.</li>
            <li> (Derby and Shark) that were ok, but</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BLADES.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t understand why I couldn&#x27;t get more than one shave to a blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun; but your picking all manner of (inexpensive) stuff to hopefully SET your prep and system (read everything and watch good videos)</li>
            <li> This brings you to the sharpest Feather blade, among many.</li>
            <li> You may not believe we are really able to get this close</li>
            <li> It does change your face for the better.</li>
            <li> More, the closer you shave.</li>
            <li> I felt confident to go ahead and get thirty more Feathers while I was still sampling and collecting data on the others.  </li>
            <li> If anything, the fact that you are shaving using the sharpest blade should force you to be more patient and focus on shaving more.</li>
            <li> Favorite blades along with personna lab blues.</li>
            <li> The sharper the blade the better performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have become my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> The feather blades are my favorite of all the DE Blades.</li>
            <li> Some cheaper  blades will do the job satisfactory and that is ok</li>
            <li> but , if you want a nice smooth 1 pass shave then these are the blades to use.</li>
            <li> Some guys love &#x27;em, some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Just to make sure I get all the angles and everything.</li>
            <li> The best double edge razor I have used in 50 years.  </li>
            <li> Switched to DE shaving about 5 years ago and have tried many razor brands.  </li>
            <li> Much better then the Derby blades I used to purchase here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it must have come most of  the way by mule train.</li>
            <li> These shave as close in one pass and many others do in two or more passes.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.</li>
            <li> These are the best double edge razor blades on the market.</li>
            <li> Brings many memories of days gone .</li>
            <li> for some reason I am more irritated after using these than with the astras..</li>
            <li> And get way more ingrown hairs...</li>
            <li> You can find many videos on utube for this...</li>
            <li> I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique</li>
            <li> The first shave with both were good</li>
            <li> Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
            <li> These are also perfect for the &amp;#34;night before&amp;#34; shaves because the shave is so close, my face is still smooth well into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is what I was doing with my Derby blades which deliver  perfectly smooth shave on my head and face with no irritation The feathers performed equally as well delivering a nearly perfect shave even with the rushed shave.</li>
            <li> These are the most fantastic blades I&#x27;ve tried to date.  </li>
            <li> you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\</li>
            <li> Much better the cheap disposables</li>
            <li> I went to a antique store and found a old school razor for $9.00 and these blades work great with it.</li>
            <li> They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li> stars because they&#x27;re a good bargain, much cheaper and better than cartridges, and they make me feel special.</li>
            <li> Dont listen to people who saw they are to sharp, they are perfect!!!</li>
            <li> That is true, but respect the blade and let the blade do the work with very light pressure and it will give you the closest shave you have ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the sound of the blade making that shh.. sound as it takes care of business.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to pack and easy for disposal.</li>
            <li> Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I did get distracted the first day or so and got a nice nick on the cheek</li>
            <li> Hands down Feathers are the best!  </li>
            <li> Both did a fine job.</li>
            <li> I started with Baili blades that came along with the razor and they were fine.</li>
            <li> The sharpest and most durable blades at a super price.</li>
            <li> In my limited experience, I do feel they are great blades, they gave a very smooth shave and one thing I noticed</li>
            <li> but I was extremely pleased with the results on the very first shave.  </li>
            <li> Super Max triple blade safety razor that is made in India and available at dollar stores gives a close shave but not as many number of shaves as you would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also experiencing a cleaner shave with less irritation, and the QC has been excellent so far, with every blade as good as the one before.</li>
            <li> fantastic, glides so smooth, cuts so well.  </li>
            <li> and you will really enjoy shaving with these.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said; if you want to get rid of irritation and have smooth skin for days these are the razors for you.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you prepare your face for the shave by first showering and washing your face or by washing your face and placing a nice hot hand towel over your face for five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I got a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth shave with NO cuts or abrasions.  </li>
            <li> Pricier than most but well worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will enjoy shaving with this blade....</li>
            <li> some were cheaply made that nicked my face</li>
            <li> and I have never gotten a shave as smooth and irritation free.</li>
            <li> best blades I have tried so far, which have been many different brands.</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve used so far, though I can only get three shaves at the most out of a blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are often recognized for being the sharpest available.</li>
            <li> works great for a double edge blade.  </li>
            <li> Baby smooth DE shaves can even be done faster, once setup correctly.</li>
            <li> After using these for only the briefest of time, I have great respect for their sharpness.  </li>
            <li> Glides and shaves smoothly.  </li>
            <li> They cost more but as for me they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I own Spydero stainless knives.  </li>
            <li> but I did manage to get some spots baby butt smooth with these blades, unlike the others.</li>
            <li> I thought the first shave with a new blade was great.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, you can get more and will, if you do it all right and put alcohol on it, so it doesn&#x27;t rust when you are done.</li>
            <li> While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these razor&#x27;s my shave has been very close and works great with my other shaving products I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> blades, there very little loss to trying one, so put this on your list and if you like it, great, If not, keep searching!</li>
            <li> This blade is perfect for a course heavy beards or to put in a DE safety razor that gives mild shaves.</li>
            <li> Good blades only used them once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I guess a china razor $2.00 was the best sale, 89 cent Williams soap puck and 8 cent medium Dorco blade and free DIY brush (wife discarded, big makeup brush, or old paint brush regrouped, just to test?)</li>
            <li> You can buy better blades at much lower prices!</li>
            <li> clean shaves before I feel the need to replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the first shave I will admit that I didn&#x27;t prepare my head and face as good as I normally do and was rushed during the shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a great new and so typically mild or milder razor then you are acclimating (subset to what you know) and to your new safety</li>
            <li> My face feels great, minimal to no burn</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that everyone is different, and products that work for one person might not be at all good for another.</li>
            <li> Every review that says these things are probably the sharpest blades out there - is true.</li>
            <li> I tried this Japanese brand because I own Japanese knives that are great.  </li>
            <li> Gives me the smoothest shaves of all, the sharpest of all and priced not bad if you buy in bulk (in my case about 28  USA cents per blade in pack of 30) .</li>
            <li> Electrics best takes MUCH longer, is a lot less close (than even passable work/speed shaves), and irritates comparatively with friction.</li>
            <li> sharp and great quality</li>
            <li> I will not order any other blades but these because they work great.</li>
            <li> These things are super sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ONLY TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE THEM WHEN I FIND TRUELY EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li> But if I want a super close shave these are the ones I use.</li>
            <li> And there is not one of them that degraded so quickly.</li>
            <li> you are experienced shaver, then I am sure you would have tried or at least heard of these.</li>
            <li> For best results, I run my electric razor over my face, especially around my upper lip and chin areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many many different brands of blades and none of them even get close to matching Feathers ability to give a close shave without pulling the hairs out.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient and try to make use of whatever is available such as good cream, brush, oil, lots of water etc to make it easier for the razor to glide as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SHAVE LIGHTLY with this blade, with the grain at first, and know that it is sharper than the sharpest samurai sword in Japan.</li>
            <li> Overall during this trial shave, I noticed that the blade had an exceptionally smooth glide against my skin and cut very easily.</li>
            <li> Astra was a pretty close second (good to try if your scared of these)</li>
            <li> :) You SHOULD really leave a (tiniest) bit of stubble your first week (of any changes) and not lust for it THEN.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, good shave.  </li>
            <li> But super sharp blades are not necessarily the best for some folks, and I&#x27;m one of them.</li>
            <li> (where you rarely nick yourself).  </li>
            <li> This blade is Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Actually I Rather Liked These Blades.....  </li>
            <li> We often forget it&#x27;s completely up to you to build it to any shaving way, that you need, or many way/razors.</li>
            <li> Some were better than others, but the Feather stood out (so far).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a multi-blade disposable (although I do keep my electric Braun handy for shaving around my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard how good they are and how sharp they are.  </li>
            <li> Still not as sharp as I had hoped but still good</li>
            <li> they are sharp, just as any good tool should be.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and that is a good thing as it cuts right through the hair with ease, no tugging and no irratation.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Feathers to experienced wet shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took away one star because I&#x27;ve had about two blades that weren&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li> the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll want to get to a point and not change stuff RIGHT NOW; but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been double edge shaving for more than 2 years, and this is the best alternative to using rip-off Gilette or BiC</li>
            <li> Very sharp and good shaves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree, but honestly that didn&#x27;t really tell me if I should try the blade or not.</li>
            <li> Paired with a mild razor Feathers work very well, paired with an aggressive razor you may be wearing the marks for a while and everyone will call you Nick.</li>
            <li> Costs is good and get several shaves from quality old time blades.</li>
            <li> The hold up very well (about a week for me) and very consistent.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality and stay sharp being that I&#x27;m a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> This blades are very sharp and dont need to make much pressure, im happy with this feather blades i dont take take too much time shaving.</li>
            <li> No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews</li>
            <li> The second shave was also okay.  </li>
            <li> Before you shave, take a hot shower, use a pre-shave like Sharps Barber and Shop Kid Glove Oil-Free Pre-Shave Stick and a substantive shave cream like the one made by Aveda.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> many years, I&#x27;d been using store label brand blades from various drug stores and discount retailers.</li>
            <li> a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work.</li>
            <li> but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so.</li>
            <li> Possibly you&#x27;ll have better luck.  </li>
            <li> Tried many blades and these are second to none!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this blade to those interested.</li>
            <li> Used this blade for the first time in my Merkur 23C.</li>
            <li> Wow, extremely smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Awesome, but expensive blades.</li>
            <li> I made two separate passes and experienced  only a minor nick when I caught a place I had cut before.</li>
            <li> If you have read anything about Feather blades, the first thing you will hear is that they are the &amp;#34;sharpest&amp;#34; blades you will find.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the most likely reason.</li>
            <li> It will happen and it can be done as fast as 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> The first shave with the Feather gave me a BBS on a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> I cut my self plenty on the first try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My 3rd and 4th blades each got about twice that many shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I tried some BlueBirds that came as a sample with my last order of Feather blades, and they&#x27;re much more forgiving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also interested in trying the Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well but thought that they might shave closer.  </li>
            <li> I am a first time safety razor user.</li>
            <li> BUT I put a small bit more of an angle that works better for me.</li>
            <li> After not shaving for a few days, I had a good amount of scruff.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that is easily irratated and to make matters worse, I&#x27;m 35 and have a grown mans beard with hair that is like wire.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted Feather blades because I figured I&#x27;d buy what many consider &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; and be done blade shopping, but other blades are far more forgiving, and, for me, provide a shave that is just as close as the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Best of all, they stay sharp much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t as good as normal razors, friend recommended these blades and WOW, all the other blades are pure garbage, these cut soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second Shave - Perfectly smooth with a little more ease than my Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp blades</li>
            <li> And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with the Korean Dorcos, the Russian Gillettes, and the French Bics.</li>
            <li> I have a good knowledge of Japanese and American knives.  </li>
            <li> Be careful the firs few times and once you are use to the blades you will get the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful, you will cut yourself very easily.  </li>
            <li> Little stuff, like always wearing a balm (lotion, and a good, inexpensive one with sane ingredients, because many suck) and BEFORE your face ever gets dry, really do matter.</li>
            <li> I have relatively coarse hair, and sensitive skin, so shaving has always been a bit of an uphill battle for me, everything that improves the process is a great boon, which brings us back to the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell any difference between Feather and Astra after the first shave</li>
            <li> Super smooth, irritation free shave with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for experienced or new shavers, though the latter should take extra care until they get used to them.</li>
            <li> When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna...</li>
            <li> so my razor gets a lot of usage and my head is a bit tricky to shave with some peaks and valleys on tube back side and a neck that is easily irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of blades some were good but didn&#x27;t last long  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how many shaves I get from a single blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna]] and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the [[ASIN:B004LDCJV0 Feather]]; however, the end result is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am using an Edwin Jagged DE89 and decided to give the Feathers a try before purchasing a large order of blades to how these performed vs the Derby blades that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> but I think it just a BIT too sharp for my skin as even with a hot towel and a good thick layer of shaving soap and very light pressure on the razor it cut my skin PLENTY.  </li>
            <li> However, as long as I&#x27;m not careless or half asleep, these blades are great.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back, especially considering how phenomenally priced these are!</li>
            <li> I consistently get a better, smoother, closer shave with these than any other blade I have used.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you much more about the differences between these and other blades, because after I used my first feather I had what I was looking for and haven&#x27;t tried anything else since.</li>
            <li> The packaging must have gotten a little warm because my blades were stuck to the wrapper.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clean shave!!</li>
            <li> Super sharp and comfortable with my Merkur</li>
            <li> These are much nicer than the blades available at my local big-box drug store.</li>
            <li> this may very well be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li> With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals.</li>
            <li> Did I really want the sharpest blade?</li>
            <li> if it is, I question its stainless steel/platinum claims.</li>
            <li> This is DE wet shaving and nothing is better.</li>
            <li> Straight is slower.</li>
            <li> So you probably have not seen that much change yet.</li>
            <li> and Murker stainless are the ones that come closest to this.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought me a straight razor kit for Christmas about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They work very well for me while others complain of nicks.</li>
            <li> i really went on the recommendations of others</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I just made sure to be careful.</li>
            <li> Very pleasurable experience to use these.</li>
            <li> By far, for my skin, this blade results in the closest shave (beats out Astra, Shark, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock (my 2nd favorite), Personna, Merkur, etc....).</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t had a great experience with other blades, try the Feather before you give up on wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the most consistently sharp and reliable of DE blades.</li>
            <li> SHARP  :)</li>
            <li> I literally just got done with my first shave using these blades and WOW!</li>
            <li> They give a reasonably close shave at a decent price.</li>
            <li> the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But to the point: IF and only IF you STILL can&#x27;t get at your stubble enough (maybe older, and maybe Grey, or simply beard from hell), in two passes or less (most or ABOUT 90% in the first pass is ideal arguably; because that&#x27;s a HUGE amount gentler and NOT even slower than \\&quot;one\\&quot; buffing pass) and the third pass is then optional and little more than a touch up</li>
            <li> Sharp and clean,, right on time</li>
            <li> This bundle deal is pretty cheap compared to other crappy razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a three pass kind of guy.</li>
            <li> They last a full shave and can be reused if you store your DE in baby oil between uses.</li>
            <li> A little more than most other blades</li>
            <li> If your relatively new to wet shaving, proper face prep before shaving is very important!</li>
            <li> Super smooth, last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most.</li>
            <li> electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid some extra money to get an edwin jagger DE89 (one of the user friendliest razors) and an escali brush (good bang for the buck) with some proraso shaving cream (green puck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades make short work of any day&#x27;s worth of growth in short order, without the irritation I have often experienced with other DE blades or even the multiple blade systems.  </li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY recommend these blades.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you try them yourself.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting a sampler pack of these to try in your razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried many razor blades and these far surpass the quality and sharpness of other blades.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave and long lasting.</li>
            <li> If you are new to DE razors, or like me returning to them after a couple of decades, take it easy, and be careful.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a really good thing; TOUGH dense beard guys can get the stubble off, just by letting the weight of the razor head basically do all the work.</li>
            <li> if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most.</li>
            <li> I tend to cut myself skin more after they get dull no issue at first though.  </li>
            <li> I picked some of these up along with a cheap double edge razor from Feather, and find I get a much closer shave with lesser irritation than with any of the Mach 3&#x27;s or Fusions of the world.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to irritate my sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What that really means is you are not two years old.</li>
            <li> Ready to use Mach-3 etc cartridges employ &#x27;tug and cut&#x27; method and come fit at an ultra safe angle which makes it difficult to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> and I barely threw the first one away a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I bought a safety razor to save money on normal razors.</li>
            <li> Your experience may be totally different; certainly the Feathers are a favorite among other users.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative,</li>
            <li> it cuts extremely close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was curious to check out these blades since everyone seems to agree that they are the sharpest blades and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> of stubble leaving closeness control angles, that&#x27;s now newly afforded to you, on newer, flatter shaving ways.</li>
            <li> i am new to the DE world, after 16 years of shaving with electric and multi razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I am new to shaving using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> This, tough guys way, is training wheels-up however, and only after a week or better practice (not a big deal, just real patience for one time only; but many fall away just for that!).</li>
            <li> So now you&#x27;re only week or two from really getting the PERFECT SHAVE they said was impossible and with the stubble off EFFICIENTLY *</li>
            <li> I picked up two old Stainless steel old adjustible razors at a  used trader shop 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Remember to use very little pressure - or else you may also shave the top of your skin off.</li>
            <li> If you use a shaving system that requires double edge blades, the Feather blades are exactly what you need.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not have to changed blades but once a week.</li>
            <li> this method, I found the shaves close and comfortable with only minor degradation until that one shaves that tells me the blade is finished.</li>
            <li> While its true that each different blade brand is going to shave differently in different razors, in my opinion these are the sharpest blades you will find.</li>
            <li> These razors are super sharp.  </li>
            <li> Well these are super sharp as everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Although they worked well enough, I often felt I was paying far too much for the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear that they are a -QUALITY- item Bar none.  </li>
            <li> Halfway through the third shave the razor really started to pull.</li>

            <li> By far.</li>
            <li> Really like these razor blades, just started using my double edge again and</li>
            <li> As far as holding an edge, I can get around 5 or 6 shaves with them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an old hat at using a safety razor, and you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest blades out there, these are what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> week old beard doesn&#x27;t stand a chance after 2 passes with this blade.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect to use them unless I absolutely need to and then for only one shave per blade.  </li>
            <li> , as far as the &#x27;newbies-stay-away&#x27; advice here, I believe it is overdone.</li>
            <li> By far Feather blades are the sharpest and smoothest DE razor blades made.</li>
            <li> --much safer than the double edge).</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for someone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After doing some research I learned that old style safety razors were the way to go to fight the ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li> Men need to embrace the old style shaving and consider it a pleasure rather than a task.</li>
            <li> These are much nicer/sharper, and allow the user to simply focusing on the cleanness of the shave, as opposed to the resulting length produced.</li>
            <li> However, I have known people with sensitive skin to have irritation issues using these blades.</li>
            <li> These blades irritate my sensitive skin and don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> As far as rating them I would say... that the Feather blades are #1.</li>
            <li> These blades are good, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> very sharp i use shark super chromes and these definitely surpass them with sharpness but not so much with durability</li>
            <li> Super sharp blades!</li>
            <li> But keep in mind that they are super freaking sharp!  </li>
            <li> They are MUCH more sharp than any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I usually get about 2 weeks out of one razor (with daily use), but 8 - 12 days may be more optimal.  </li>
            <li> In American I like D2 and also 1095 in high carbon blades.</li>
            <li> Having a much sharper edge than previously used blades, I experience a much cleaner shave with one stroke.</li>
            <li> But the 2nd pass (or 1st pass on a normal day)</li>
            <li> Be careful when you first start using them because they are the sharpest out there.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this blade to anyone, be they dissatisfied with their current blade or new to the experience of shaving with double edge safety blades.</li>
            <li> Outstanding far sharper than i was expecting if you like derby extra blades try this with very little pressure and you won&#x27;t go back</li>
            <li> They are super sharp, and they last forever.  </li>
            <li> I love these razors and it&#x27;s hard to beat these prices, especially if your a prime member!</li>
            <li> I found the same problem with every new blade.</li>
            <li> So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to using double edged razor blades, be warned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few different brands of safety razor blades, but so far these are just fine with me.  </li>
            <li> I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first</li>
            <li> Of course, you can choose to move the other direction, for some days and cut slightly less and comfort/safety for you (like a smaller gap Tech clone and less sharp blade for your beard type), for extreme speed, shaving twice a day or just for touch up passes, something like that, or for not having to think about it much at all, while doing it(half-asleep?), and also THE best for working around anything like moles(you</li>
            <li> But there are plenty of lazy days out there where that doesn&#x27;t happen, and I&#x27;m getting a much better shave in a single pass than I did with Derbys.</li>
            <li> Finally a decent shave and the edge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to sound dramatic, but it really made a huge difference in the glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to a safety razor when Gillete finally went too far and put a battery in the razor to make it vibrate.</li>
            <li> The Feather does seem a little thinner and therefore more flexible but that doesn&#x27;t mean much because it locks into the razor anyhow.    </li>
            <li> also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues</li>
            <li> I can only assume that the blade&#x27;s edge is completely gone after one shave which</li>
            <li> No nicks on the second shave no irritation on my sensitive</li>
            <li> Perfect for cutting hair after letting it go for a few extra days.</li>
            <li> The first really big improvement to my shave was moving to a double-edged wet shave process.</li>
            <li> The Feathers are slightly more expensive than other brands, but they are worth it.    </li>
            <li> The embarrassing red splotches I lived with for years have nearly vanished entirely.</li>
            <li> they are more Expensive than other blades, but not sure if they are any better.  </li>
            <li> I could usually get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves with the BICs.</li>
            <li> I never used a sharper blade, but they dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Those products seem to promote a rushed and careless shave, while this seems to harken back to the day where a man took a little more time to do things right.    </li>
            <li> I have a thick, dark hairs, so my 5 o&#x27;clock is more of a 2 o&#x27;clock</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have a cleaner shave than with this blade as long as you practice and know EXACTLY how to use a double edged, very sharp blade and razor.</li>
            <li> I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty tough.</li>
            <li> These blades are no more dangerous than any other double edged razor, but the bevel is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but high quality and extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and high quality.</li>
            <li> Not bad to where i can&#x27;t use them, just irritating because it takes longer to put a new blade in and i have to be extra careful</li>
            <li> They are thin, sharp and better quality than any American or German brand.  </li>
            <li> I have the unfortunate combination of hard-to-shave facial hair and more sensitive than average skin.</li>
            <li> Other brands seem to dull significantly after 3 or 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> On the other hand I find really sharp blades to be very forgiving, because they require no pressure, they will cut the hair, all you must do is guide.  </li>
            <li> I have always been open to trying options and have not used the big G in a long time.</li>
            <li> While everybody&#x27;s skin is different, I get a solid week out of a single razor with a daily shave.</li>
            <li> Works about the same as other brands for first few shaves but</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned earlier in the review, you really need to have your DE shaving technique down for any really sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I find myself cutting myself far too easily with these blades.  </li>
            <li> They are nice for a few shaves but for whatever reason after a few shaves they get dull and they don&#x27;t cut as well.</li>
            <li> With those garbage cartridge razors I could not shave everyday because it would irritate my face and just down right hurt.</li>
            <li> only downside to the Feather blades are that they seem to be a bit more expensive and harder to find.</li>
            <li> However: Don&#x27;t see how long one can last at this stage1.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and nothing beats their sharpness.</li>
            <li> You really should have your technique down for ANY of the really sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I have tested Derby, Astra, SuperMax, Blue Bird, Shark, Lord, Wilkinson Sword (German and Indian), Sharp, Dorco, and even the Ying Jili blade that came with a Chinese razor.</li>
            <li> As a result, my neck is far less irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li> You should already know, some peoples skin just scrapes extremely easy and can&#x27;t use these; but you should also know you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong</li>
            <li> After washing and blotting dry, I wiped the blades with hand sanitizer, leaving the blade coated and using it \\&quot;as-is\\&quot; for the next shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like these blades, but since I recently got back into wet shaving, I need to work with them a while longer then may raise my rating.</li>
            <li> Those one-size-fits-all cartridges can never do this, and you can go closer on your dense spots, that can take it and use great self-control, cutting less on trouble spots</li>
            <li> They are 3 times more expensive than other safety blades</li>
            <li> Third shave was not a decent shave until a &amp;#34;3 1/2&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> It had been a long time since I had used a double edge to shave with, so it brought back the memory of razor burn but also an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> woudln&#x27;t worry about them somehow being more dangerous since they are sharper.</li>
            <li> If my stubble is long from missing a few days it sometimes grabs a bit on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and a few passes with these in a Merker Slanthammer leaves no whiskers or irritation.</li>
            <li> I mean really, It&#x27;s a razor.</li>
            <li> These are definitely well made and as sharp as a surgeon&#x27;s scalpel.</li>
            <li> The other side of the coin being that THIS blade is definitely not for me as it simply is just -TOO- sharp period.  </li>
            <li> just hop them, no big deal), than *any* other thing</li>
            <li> Been searching for a really sharp, double edge blade for some time.  </li>
            <li> They last longer than other brands too.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, but I don&#x27;t have a similar problem with other ones.  </li>
            <li> I lay them on a piece of tissue paper to dry them, coat the edges with olive oil, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was initially guided to these blades, as ones I had previously tried (Derby) left a rough, unclean shave.</li>
            <li> This is a single package of 10 blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not happy with the first two blades.  </li>
            <li> I have very soft skin on my face and neck, but a very hard, coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s dead wrong to think of a Feather as the most expensive one; because we&#x27;re talking about 27 cent and most guys get at least 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> I had them for over a year and still got like half left.</li>
            <li> I previously used Derby DE blades, but this will now be my one and only blade that I use.</li>
            <li> I typically have to do a 2-3 pass shave and still need some extra passes.  </li>
            <li> The blade is so sharp that your face will not start bleeding, where you nicked yourself, until you realize you nicked yourself in several other places.</li>
            <li> even when I nick myself the blade is so sharp , it&#x27;s a minor annoyance</li>
            <li> I see the little red dot.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and well above all the other blades on the market.</li>
            <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already.</li>
            <li> but if you have a careful hand, these blades will be the sharpest.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using them after only a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for over fifty years</li>
            <li> Since then, I have tried a few different brands of DE razor blades.  </li>
            <li> got a 100-blade sampler pack a few years back, and tried every blade in it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I still feel some rough patches.  </li>
            <li> (search wet shaving.)</li>
            <li> This was what I was hoping for when I made the switch to DE wet shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick beard growth and my skin is on the sensitive side...</li>
            <li> Feather is the ultimate blade... very sharp!</li>
            <li> I can shave with the same razor for a month and a half!  </li>
            <li> VERY SHARP AND LASTS A LONG TIME.  </li>
            <li> Also remember that different razors may have different cutting angles, guards/combs etc, and trying a new razor with a new blade may mean relearning your shaving angles.  </li>
            <li> The secret was the blade and razor gap customized for you (and all that other stuff absolutely matters.</li>
            <li> (I will admit the minimal burn is from where I have shaved against the grain on my neck which I don&#x27;t even dare to do with other blades.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, they are really, really sharp.</li>
            <li> But do be careful here and let caution be your guide as these are just a BIT on the sharp side.....  </li>
            <li> It is sharp, provides the smoothest shave, no tugging, and minimal razor burn and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> shaves out of a single Feather blade, and I have coarse thick hair of the Mediterranean variety.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other brand of blades except Feather from now on.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for extended periods of time</li>
            <li> These blades are EXTREMELY sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shopping around you will probably hear that these Platinum coated FEATHER blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re as sharp as everyone says they are, and they make for a truly effortless shave.</li>
            <li> ... the fact some say they&#x27;re too sharp.</li>
            <li> So I must advise -EXTREME CAUTION- in the use of this blade.  </li>
            <li> None of the other brands are even close.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, this came from  Thailand and it took over six weeks to be delivered, in my opinion that is unacceptable by today&#x27;s standards</li>
            <li> MY OTHER REVIEWS...</li>
            <li> Based on recommendations from other sites, I decided to try the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> sharp like a navy seal Steven hawking on tiger blood fighting surry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sharp?</li>
            <li> I had gone through 2 other blades when I started  </li>
            <li> A bit too sharp.</li>
            <li> it is sharp, really sharp.</li>
            <li> Ordered and these are may past regular blade.</li>
            <li> Based on some other reviews, I gave these a try and doubt I will ever go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are really sharp</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t cut myself with this ninja sharp blade.</li>
            <li> I promise you will not be disappointed and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues with other blades tugging my stubble and just not quite preforming to my preference.</li>
            <li> Some reviews suggested not to use these blades as they&#x27;re extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> - Grate blades, as sharp as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and no glue on them.  </li>
            <li> These blades are too sharp.  </li>
            <li> Consistently sharp blade after blade.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s good because like a dull knife can be dangerous in the kitchen; a dull DE razor can be deadly to your face.  </li>
            <li> I had not really done a serious comparison on these Feather blades, with my other samples of blades, until I tested each one in my recently acquired Futur.</li>
            <li> Sharp and stay sharp!</li>
            <li> but he doesn&#x27;t feel like he gets as close a shave as with other brands despite the fact that they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the Feather blades at first.  </li>
            <li> My only &#x27;negative&#x27; comment (if it is one) is that these took WEEKS to arrive.</li>
            <li> (I find this oil to be a bit thick, and am currently just using it up)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t loose respect for anything sharp, even after you used it and are past this and know that.</li>
            <li> For a couple days I did half of my face and head with Derby and the other half of my face and head with Feather.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a little nervous about trying these blades because of how sharp everyone said they were</li>
            <li> These blades are awesomely sharp!</li>
            <li> last and frankly these are the only blades that failed to work for me as they are way too sharp for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cut pretty bad by the Feathers, and I&#x27;ve even been cut on the flat of my cheak where I&#x27;ve never been cut by another blade.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I have tried the variety pack of DE blades and have found Feather and BIC to be very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and aggressive on the skin.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Even the slight mole on my neck, which I have resigned to just get nicked when I shave has come through unscathed.  </li>
            <li> Thus, the sharpest the blade the less pressure it will take to achieve that close shave - and the less chance of getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically do two passes, one with a cream and one with a gel...</li>
            <li> I typically use Personna &amp;#34;Lab Blues&amp;#34; with a shim, the Feather I used sans/shim</li>
            <li> I get less cuts with these blades.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This has not always been the case with previous purchases of feather blades.</li>
            <li> Makes for an easier shave with less scraping.  </li>
            <li> - Used Jack Black Face Buff for pre-shave and Jack Black Beard Lube for shave cream.</li>
            <li> I did however get a really bad nick on he grove in the back of my head which was definitely caused by carelessness from the rushed shave without proper pre-shave preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First let me say that if you were like me, you are eager but afraid to try these blades out.  </li>
            <li> Seems simple enough but people are always saying these are to sharp, they will cut the crap out of you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I use Proraso shaving cream which is above average but not great and a medium quality badger hair brush</li>
            <li> After doing a little reading I tried some Feathers.</li>
            <li> It takes few days to get used to these again.  </li>
            <li> Just started using a safety razor a few weeks ago and used blades that came with it.</li>
            <li> This is not a 1 day thing and if you say BS, you will learn and it will take a few days longer.</li>
            <li> but if you take your time and pay attention, they won&#x27;t give you any trouble.  </li>
            <li> Finding the correct angle of holding your razor may take a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Very sharp as advertised!</li>
            <li> Unless you already have a known, really extreme and delicate skin issue.</li>
            <li> You have to partner them with a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; razor, or it&#x27;s just too plain</li>
            <li> I know that seems like a ridiculous thing to say regarding a razor blade, but I don&#x27;t know how to put it any other way.  </li>
            <li> There is something atavistic in putting raw blade to your face every morning.</li>
            <li> To much pressure or a bad angle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these were definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I shave just about every day, and although they get duller after 4 or 5 shaves, i can usually get 10 out of them, just gotta change up the technique</li>
            <li> but you can usually get 3 or 4 shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> No more razor bumps.</li>
            <li> One gripe is that the paper they&#x27;re packaged in usually leaves a residue from the glue on the blade.</li>
            <li> If you have a small blemish or bump, these blades will slice it off at skin level without me ever noticing until  </li>
            <li> Other blades are not as sharp as these, yet still shave well without cutting my face.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson to dull.  </li>
            <li> Some of the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve ever used but seem to dull faster than I&#x27;m used to but still a pleasure</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;M a HARD person to impress but the quality of the steel, The Gleam of the Blade revealed at once to me both the workmanship and the quality of the Blade.  </li>
            <li> if you 45 degree like your supposed to and press too hard, you will cut chunks of skin out of your neck and face.</li>
            <li> I only attempted to use them twice, and I couldn&#x27;t take anymore face cutting or hair ripping</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I could hear the blade cutting hair I couldn&#x27;t tell that blade was actually shaving (in some areas).  </li>
            <li> but the suplyer sucks</li>
            <li> I can use the Feather for at least five shaves.</li>
            <li> sum these up, all I can say is, you owe it to yourself to at least try them.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick I must use conditioner in the shower on my face and neck before I can use any blade.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a cruddy disposable razor feeling like it&#x27;s yanking your whiskers out by the roots at 0530 to start the day right.</li>
            <li> the nicest cutting Feather (even on grown-out and dense beards or those areas) when shimmed, now does not scrape your skin off your face *and* also requires less passes and/or buffing, so way less time and friction.</li>
            <li> and I do mean discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Unless you mean the cash you are wasting now.</li>
            <li> These blades are seriously, almost scary, sharp.</li>
            <li> It will throw you into bad techniques even worse and bite you on a newly opened blade.</li>
            <li> I am not able to shave very quickly as I am afraid how sharp this is.</li>
            <li> Yet the case being if you have a thick and tough beard that nothing else seemed to cut through then</li>
            <li> It is also possible (as with any brand) that you have just gotten a bad blade.  </li>
            <li> AND* if you&#x27;re \\&quot;digging\\&quot;, pressing-in, swooping, raking the razor into bad angles, to basically a similar friction inducing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with a tough beard and tender skin, and I&#x27;ve learned that the really sharp blades, like these Feathers, cut me up like crazy.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin, Tough beard</li>
            <li> the Derbys worse than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> blade takes very little effort in cutting through the toughest beard stubble-</li>
            <li> I splashed a little alcohol on the face to gauge how bad the razor burn was, and to my amazement, I felt nothing.  </li>
            <li> I switched over to DE (double edge safety razor) shaving because I really hated shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed that mine don&#x27;t say, &amp;#34;Hi-Stainless&amp;#34; on them.</li>
            <li> Very Slow!</li>
            <li> Was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Now, compare that to the cost of shaving with those flashy and overhyped</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I made a switch from the expensive multi-bladed cartridge razors, to a DE razor.  </li>
            <li> They are on the expensive side for blades.</li>
            <li> I know they are expensive</li>
            <li> It was quite expensive but came with Merkur,  Gillette,  Bic,  Kings, Swordsman, etc.  </li>
            <li> Sorry folks,</li>
            <li> The difficult step is to move from a Gillette Proglide to a safety razor and not from one safety razor blade to another.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with buying these.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not like they are expensive.</li>
            <li> They are the sharpest I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t be afraid of them.</li>
            <li> Before you buy a closer cutting razor, you can keep with your testing and just shim it to increase the gap</li>
            <li> When I began shaving, I couldn&#x27;t even feel it cutting my stubble, it just glided through it.</li>
            <li> Word of warning, they do require a experianced shaver to use without cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> Using no pressure  and letting the weight of the razor lay against your skin is the way to avoid cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I figured generations of men shaved and didn&#x27;t have these [expensive!]</li>
            <li> cartridge-like shaving action(s) you&#x27;re doing it all wrong, and I have a SOLUTION!</li>
            <li> You WILL have CHANGE and go LIGHTER and STOP raking, than you have trained yourself th wrong way!</li>
            <li> The razor burn I got when I tried these was atrocious.</li>
            <li> Yes Virgina there is a Santa Claus, for tough guys!!!</li>
            <li> I hate when they come in 5 packs, its annoying.</li>
            <li> I would probably have to pull a blade out of a soap dish after a month, in order to find something that bad!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad from the people using them!</li>
            <li> have not been disappointed by the Feather brand at all!</li>
            <li> and I consider it to be a bit of self indulgence rather than a brutal and dreadful task.</li>

            <li> fantastic, glides so smooth, cuts so well.  Just shave nice and easy without pressing (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway) and you will really enjoy shaving with these.  Tried astra, wilkinson.  Wilkinson to dull.  Astra was a pretty close second (good to try if your scared of these)</li>
            <li> I kept hearing how shaving with a DE razor is better and cheaper than shaving with the multi-blade razors.  So a couple of weeks ago I purchased a Feather DE razor and 60 Feather blades. I thought the first shave with a new blade was great.  The second shave was also okay.  Halfway through the third shave the razor really started to pull. I found the same problem with every new blade. Prior to the Feather razor and blades I was using BIC&#x27;s three blade disposable razors.  I could usually get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves with the BICs. I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of to extend the life of the Feather blades. I lay them on a piece of tissue paper to dry them, coat the edges with olive oil, etc.  But nothing seems to make them last longer.  I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;ll just change the blades every two shaves until the blades are gone, then I&#x27;ll go back to the BIC.</li>
            <li> Nothing I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said; if you want to get rid of irritation and have smooth skin for days these are the razors for you.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a little nervous about trying these blades because of how sharp everyone said they were but I was extremely pleased with the results on the very first shave.  They are sharp and that is a good thing as it cuts right through the hair with ease, no tugging and no irratation.  Just make sure you prepare your face for the shave by first showering and washing your face or by washing your face and placing a nice hot hand towel over your face for five minutes.  I have fair skin that is easily irratated and to make matters worse, I&#x27;m 35 and have a grown mans beard with hair that is like wire.  The blade goes through my whiskers like they&#x27;re not even there.  I love the sound of the blade making that shh.. sound as it takes care of business.  My shaving gear isn&#x27;t top of the line.  I use Proraso shaving cream which is above average but not great and a medium quality badger hair brush but I get excellent results.  These are the blades I will be using from now on.  Don&#x27;t be scared to try them because they work great!  Sharper is better.</li>
            <li> I switched to a safety razor when Gillete finally went too far and put a battery in the razor to make it vibrate. I figured generations of men shaved and didn&#x27;t have these [expensive!] vibrating razors with 5 blades on them.    I have been using Derby blades at about $20 per 100 blades. I got the Feather to test them out. They are 3 times more expensive than other safety blades so i thought they might be 3 times better.    For a couple days I did half of my face and head with Derby and the other half of my face and head with Feather. I cannot tell a difference at all. Both did a fine job. Test it yourself side by side and the Feather will not seem so superior. The Feather does seem a little thinner and therefore more flexible but that doesn&#x27;t mean much because it locks into the razor anyhow.    Of course all of these safety razor blades beat using the gimick razors that are out there on the market today.</li>
            <li> Very good blades for safety razor! Works about the same as other brands for first few shaves but what I&#x27;ve found sets these apart is I can use them daily for about 2 weeks with no noticeable loss of sharpness. Other brands seem to dull significantly after 3 or 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades. Be sure  to shop around for the best price.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the Feather blades at first.  I&#x27;ve heard how good they are and how sharp they are.  I thought it was more myth than fact.  Was I wrong.  These are the most fantastic blades I&#x27;ve tried to date.  They are MUCH more sharp than any other brand.  And that&#x27;s good because like a dull knife can be dangerous in the kitchen; a dull DE razor can be deadly to your face.  These blades just glide across the skin and whack off anything in it&#x27;s way easily. The first time I used them I had the best shave of my life.  No nicks or cuts.  I splashed a little alcohol on the face to gauge how bad the razor burn was, and to my amazement, I felt nothing.  I got a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth shave with NO cuts or abrasions.  Amazing.  I will never use any other brand of blades except Feather from now on.</li>
            <li> I only started shaving with double edged razor blades a week ago and decided to keep using these blades. Very good quality and stay sharp being that I&#x27;m a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> World&#x27;s sharpest razor blade - what more can I say? You can shave frog-hair with these things! I&#x27;ve been using Feathers and Astras for a couple of years now and I HIGHLY recommend these blades.  My only &#x27;negative&#x27; comment (if it is one) is that these took WEEKS to arrive. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the mice-type in the description or I was simply unaware, but these shipped from Thailand (I have zero idea why) and they took a loooong time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I picked some of these up along with a cheap double edge razor from Feather, and find I get a much closer shave with lesser irritation than with any of the Mach 3&#x27;s or Fusions of the world. Those products seem to promote a rushed and careless shave, while this seems to harken back to the day where a man took a little more time to do things right.    Before you shave, take a hot shower, use a pre-shave like Sharps Barber and Shop Kid Glove Oil-Free Pre-Shave Stick and a substantive shave cream like the one made by Aveda. You&#x27;ll like the result.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance</li>
            <li> If you use a shaving system that requires double edge blades, the Feather blades are exactly what you need.  They stay sharp for extended periods of time (I replace based on the feel of the blade rather than number of shaves or time in use).  Always a close shave!</li>
            <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already. Very sharp and high quality. Pricier than most but well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Do not be intimidated to use them. From the many reviews i have read you would think these are what the Wolverine uses&lt;br /&gt;as his claws. I mean really, It&#x27;s a razor. I haven&#x27;t lost life or limb yet so shave away.</li>
            <li> These blades are EXTREMELY sharp.  It took me a while to get used to them.  If you aren&#x27;t careful, you will cut yourself very easily.  However, as long as I&#x27;m not careless or half asleep, these blades are great.  I took away one star because I&#x27;ve had about two blades that weren&#x27;t quite right.  I only attempted to use them twice, and I couldn&#x27;t take anymore face cutting or hair ripping so I ended up tossing them.  I would definitely recommend these over the blades you can pick up at the local supercenter or grocery store.</li>
            <li> Still not as sharp as I had hoped but still good</li>
            <li> First let me say that if you were like me, you are eager but afraid to try these blades out.  I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  \\&quot;if you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\&quot;  I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first (where you rarely nick yourself).  You really should have your technique down for ANY of the really sharp blades.  I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative, the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say there is a reason for the number of reviews on these blades.  They are amazing!!!  I have never had a smoother shave, not just in how it cuts but how the blade glides over the skin.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I could hear the blade cutting hair I couldn&#x27;t tell that blade was actually shaving (in some areas).  I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique and I have yet to suffer a nick with this blade (knock on wood).  Even the slight mole on my neck, which I have resigned to just get nicked when I shave has come through unscathed.  My face feels great, minimal to no burn (I will admit the minimal burn is from where I have shaved against the grain on my neck which I don&#x27;t even dare to do with other blades.  This is now my go to blade.  My search for my best blade has ended here. Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different I do believe this is a blade to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues, that may or may not apply to every user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Price.  While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  My feeling on this is just a matter of priority.  If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Butchering the face while shaving.  Like I mentioned earlier in the review, you really need to have your DE shaving technique down for any really sharp blades.  To much pressure or a bad angle and I can see these blades doing some damage.  On the other hand I find really sharp blades to be very forgiving, because they require no pressure, they will cut the hair, all you must do is guide.  Also remember that different razors may have different cutting angles, guards/combs etc, and trying a new razor with a new blade may mean relearning your shaving angles.  Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave so please keep that in mind as well.  It is also possible (as with any brand) that you have just gotten a bad blade.  So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of what I am using at the time of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  [[ASIN:B000FGWTZ8 The Art of Shaving Pre-Shave Oil, Lemon Essential Oil, for All Skin Types, 2 fl oz (60 ml)]]  (I find this oil to be a bit thick, and am currently just using it up)&lt;br /&gt;2.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years, I&#x27;d been using store label brand blades from various drug stores and discount retailers. Although they worked well enough, I often felt I was paying far too much for the quality of the blades. Additionally, not every store kept this style blade in regular supply. This prompted my amazon.com search for a more suitable replacement that I could order in quantity and keep good supply on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been disappointed by the Feather brand at all! Having a much sharper edge than previously used blades, I experience a much cleaner shave with one stroke. As a result, my neck is far less irritated after shaving. The embarrassing red splotches I lived with for years have nearly vanished entirely. (I&#x27;m red-haired with very fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much to irritate my sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this blade to anyone, be they dissatisfied with their current blade or new to the experience of shaving with double edge safety blades.</li>
            <li> Best Blade made.....handle with care....You will enjoy shaving with this blade....the closest shave you will ever get. Order them you wont be dissapointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of blades some were good but didn&#x27;t last long  some were cheaply made that nicked my face but these blades are nearly perfect. This blades are very sharp and dont need to make much pressure, im happy with this feather blades i dont take take too much time shaving.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and comfortable with my Merkur 34C.  If my stubble is long from missing a few days it sometimes grabs a bit on the first pass.  But the 2nd pass (or 1st pass on a normal day) it cuts extremely close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am biased against Gillette because they are a very good product management and a marketing company, none of which I want to buy. I want to buy the steel. I have always been open to trying options and have not used the big G in a long time. What if they become too big to fail and get my tax dollars for a bail out when their 8 blades shaver does not do well in 2018?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of shaving options and below are my top 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1&gt; Feather - when I have a lot of time and not traveling. I am not able to shave very quickly as I am afraid how sharp this is. I dare not use this blade once and put it in my luggage and ruin the edge. This blade is Totally worth the price. This is indeed gold standard of shaving blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2&gt; Super Max triple blade safety razor that is made in India and available at dollar stores gives a close shave but not as many number of shaves as you would like. For the price, you would be more than glad to dispose off and take another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3&gt; Panasonic 8103s when I dont want to bother about foam etc and am traveling.</li>
            <li> The best blades..even when I nick myself the blade is so sharp , it&#x27;s a minor annoyance and I probably caused it  very smooth blades and it saved my experiment with DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most. There is something atavistic in putting raw blade to your face every morning. And when it comes to making blades, the Japanese are still unsurpassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping around you will probably hear that these Platinum coated FEATHER blades are extremely sharp. Yes they are. They are the sharpest. By far. And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When shaving with a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work. Thus, the sharpest the blade the less pressure it will take to achieve that close shave - and the less chance of getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on one&#x27;s bristles but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so. This is a single package of 10 blades. I bought the [[ASIN:B002YTRJ4K 3-pack]]. Thus, these 30 blades will probably last me well over 6 months. Now, compare that to the cost of shaving with those flashy and overhyped Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna]] and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the [[ASIN:B004LDCJV0 Feather]]; however, the end result is well worth it. And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself to the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!</li>
            <li> Some of the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve ever used but seem to dull faster than I&#x27;m used to but still a pleasure</li>
            <li> While its true that each different blade brand is going to shave differently in different razors, in my opinion these are the sharpest blades you will find. They will be the sharpest blade no matter which razor you use them in. Of course, that may not be what you are going for or what your face can stand but if you have a careful hand, these blades will be the sharpest. Frankly, I&#x27;d rather shave my whiskers off rather than pull them out. Sharper is better!</li>
            <li> Highly regarded and recommended elsewhere for good reason...! Until trying these, Derbys were my favorite blades. My experience with Merkur and Personna has been hit or miss. Dorcos have been mostly miss. I have relatively coarse hair, and sensitive skin, so shaving has always been a bit of an uphill battle for me, everything that improves the process is a great boon, which brings us back to the Feather blades. The first really big improvement to my shave was moving to a double-edged wet shave process. The next biggest step has probably been these blades. They&#x27;re as sharp as everyone says they are, and they make for a truly effortless shave. I typically do two passes, one with a cream and one with a gel... But there are plenty of lazy days out there where that doesn&#x27;t happen, and I&#x27;m getting a much better shave in a single pass than I did with Derbys. I&#x27;m also experiencing a cleaner shave with less irritation, and the QC has been excellent so far, with every blade as good as the one before. Cannot recommend enough...!</li>
            <li> Since switching to the world of safety razor shaving, I&#x27;ve been testing various products to see what works best for me. One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that everyone is different, and products that work for one person might not be at all good for another. I&#x27;m stuck with a tough beard and tender skin, and I&#x27;ve learned that the really sharp blades, like these Feathers, cut me up like crazy. These are definitely well made and as sharp as a surgeon&#x27;s scalpel. But super sharp blades are not necessarily the best for some folks, and I&#x27;m one of them. I had to stop using them after only a few shaves. Other blades are not as sharp as these, yet still shave well without cutting my face. Your experience may be totally different; certainly the Feathers are a favorite among other users. But razor blades are very personal and you just have to try a number of brands to find what works best for your face. I&#x27;ve had good luck with the Korean Dorcos, the Russian Gillettes, and the French Bics. Unfortunately, these were definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp. Best blade I have used so far!</li>
            <li> Good blades only used them once, but so far so good. No complaints.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be shaving with a safety razor, then this is the perfect amount and quality of blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for over fifty years and these are the best blades that I have ever used bar none. Sharp and stay sharp!</li>
            <li> These blades are awesomely sharp! I have been using these for over a month now and I have never gotten a shave as smooth and irritation free. With those garbage cartridge razors I could not shave everyday because it would irritate my face and just down right hurt. Not so with these babies! I shave every day now and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back, especially considering how phenomenally priced these are!</li>
            <li> Four to five shaves per blade,what more can you say?these are the best blades I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great razor blades.  Took a while to arrive but no problems</li>
            <li> best blades I have tried so far, which have been many different brands. Just be careful, they are really, really sharp. recommend...</li>
            <li> ... the fact some say they&#x27;re too sharp. Took a couple of shaves to figure out how to use the blade and love the closeness it brings.</li>
            <li> Actually I Rather Liked These Blades.....  It&#x27;s clear that they are a -QUALITY- item Bar none.  Now I&#x27;M a HARD person to impress but the quality of the steel, The Gleam of the Blade revealed at once to me both the workmanship and the quality of the Blade.  The other side of the coin being that THIS blade is definitely not for me as it simply is just -TOO- sharp period.  I must admit at once that it is a good blade but I think it just a BIT too sharp for my skin as even with a hot towel and a good thick layer of shaving soap and very light pressure on the razor it cut my skin PLENTY.  So I must advise -EXTREME CAUTION- in the use of this blade.  Yet the case being if you have a thick and tough beard that nothing else seemed to cut through then this may very well be the blade for you.  I tried these in a sample pack I just bought and I left these for last and frankly these are the only blades that failed to work for me as they are way too sharp for me.  Possibly you&#x27;ll have better luck.  But do be careful here and let caution be your guide as these are just a BIT on the sharp side.....  Nuff Said!.  Indiana ED</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I made a switch from the expensive multi-bladed cartridge razors, to a DE razor.  Since then, I have tried a few different brands of DE razor blades.  The Feathers are without doubt, the sharpest blades I have used.  None of the other brands are even close.  The Feathers are slightly more expensive than other brands, but they are worth it.    I use the Feather with a good quality shaving cream, applied with a brush, and the results are great.  I usually get about 2 weeks out of one razor (with daily use), but 8 - 12 days may be more optimal.  I have not tried this with shaving foam from a can.    If you are new to DE razors, or like me returning to them after a couple of decades, take it easy, and be careful.  It takes few days to get used to these again.  Remember to use very little pressure - or else you may also shave the top of your skin off.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but high quality and extremely sharp! I&#x27;ve been using one blade a week for about a year now. Seems like I can get about 5-7 clean shaves before I feel the need to replace.</li>
            <li> they are more Expensive than other blades, but not sure if they are any better.  they are still very good blades, but too much money.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these razor&#x27;s my shave has been very close and works great with my other shaving products I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I never used a sharper blade, but they dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li> These are the &amp;#34;Darth Vader&amp;#34; of razor blades.  You have to partner them with a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; razor, or it&#x27;s just too plain aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Astra--more forgiving...</li>
            <li> Have used them before so no surprises. Very sharp and good shaves.</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve used so far, though I can only get three shaves at the most out of a blade.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these, he finds them very easy to shave with but he doesn&#x27;t feel like he gets as close a shave as with other brands despite the fact that they are very sharp. I do like that these blades have a space in the packaging for used blades.</li>
            <li> Tried many blades and these are second to none! Feather has a the best ratings for a reason. Very smooth shave and long lasting.</li>
            <li> You know they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re feathers!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Love these blades.</li>
            <li> Really like these razor blades, just started using my double edge again and these work great. Great price and they arrived ahead of stated schedule.</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have found Feather to be the sharpest and most aggressive blades I have tried. I have not tried all the DE blades out there but most of the leading ones on the market. This blade is perfect for a course heavy beards or to put in a DE safety razor that gives mild shaves. As far as holding an edge, I can get around 5 or 6 shaves with them. I would recommend this blade to those interested.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, good shave.  It had been a long time since I had used a double edge to shave with, so it brought back the memory of razor burn but also an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to using double edged razor blades, be warned.  Every review that says these things are probably the sharpest blades out there - is true. If you&#x27;re an old hat at using a safety razor, and you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest blades out there, these are what you are looking for.  I can get about 4-5 shaves out of a single Feather blade, and I have coarse thick hair of the Mediterranean variety.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the best. Be careful when you first start using them because they are the sharpest out there.</li>
            <li> These blades work well. They aren&#x27;t my favorite, I feel like I don&#x27;t always get a great shave. They are on the expensive side for blades. Not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> These blades are often recognized for being the sharpest available. They are the sharpest I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t be afraid of them. I have really sensitive skin and a few passes with these in a Merker Slanthammer leaves no whiskers or irritation.</li>
            <li> The best razor blades out there. A little more than most other blades but you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> For me, the best DE blades, bar none. they are sharp, just as any good tool should be. They are also forgiving if you use them correctly.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the most consistently sharp and reliable of DE blades. I have trusted their quality for some time now. You will not regret purchasing this DE blade.&lt;br /&gt;Have a wonderful shave!&lt;br /&gt;Have a wonderful day.</li>
            <li> i never recived the razors. it has been about 2 months. the razors  are probably good but the suplyer sucks</li>
            <li> Gives me the smoothest shaves of all, the sharpest of all and priced not bad if you buy in bulk (in my case about 28  USA cents per blade in pack of 30) . I like it a lot. Make sure you have your DE shaving technique mastered before trying these or you will bleed, but once you know how to work with them you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the other hand, this came from  Thailand and it took over six weeks to be delivered, in my opinion that is unacceptable by today&#x27;s standards but that is a reflection on amazons not on the blade. Now on I just have to make sure the vendor in in USA.</li>
            <li> SHARPEST BLADES EVER USED.  I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS WITH NICKS AND CUTS.  USING OVER TWO YEARS.  MY PROFESSION BARBER LOVES THEM AND SWITCHED.</li>
            <li> I got the 30 pack in June, it&#x27;s now january and still have about 9 left. I shave just about every day, and although they get duller after 4 or 5 shaves, i can usually get 10 out of them, just gotta change up the technique a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because they&#x27;re a good bargain, much cheaper and better than cartridges, and they make me feel special.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was OK considering the package was coming from overseas. In fact they beat their own scheduled delivery by one week. Used this blade for the first time in my Merkur 23C. Wow, extremely smooth shaving experience. For me and my face these lived up to every bit of the hype I&#x27;ve read here and in forums, just an incredible shave. NOTE: I typically use Personna &amp;#34;Lab Blues&amp;#34; with a shim, the Feather I used sans/shim and the difference is just amazing. These blades will be my &amp;#34;go to&#x27;s&amp;#34; from here on out.</li>
            <li> I used to only use electric shavers since i started shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moved to double edge safety razors because it always felt like i was spending a lot of time shaving over the same area with my electric razors. I didn&#x27;t have the money to afford a good one so i always bought the cheapo norelco rotary electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid some extra money to get an edwin jagger DE89 (one of the user friendliest razors) and an escali brush (good bang for the buck) with some proraso shaving cream (green puck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final piece of the puzzle is the feather razor. These things are super sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My week old beard doesn&#x27;t stand a chance after 2 passes with this blade. I know they are expensive but you can usually get 3 or 4 shaves out of them. I get less cuts with these blades. Personally - these are a winner.</li>
            <li> Great value.  works great for a double edge blade.  I use them all the time.  Much better the cheap disposables</li>
            <li> When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna... or you can just cut and paste the revised link @ the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a 100-blade sampler pack a few years back, and tried every blade in it. No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews and it wasn&#x27;t in my sampler. I made the mistake of buying 30 Feathers rather than just trying 5... granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crystal Platinums shave noticably closer and don&#x27;t cut me like the Feather brand... I&#x27;ve been cut pretty bad by the Feathers, and I&#x27;ve even been cut on the flat of my cheak where I&#x27;ve never been cut by another blade. With the Crystals, I would only get nicked when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention at all. With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals. It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals... if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most. I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty tough.

            <li> Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Awesome, but expensive blades.</li>
            <li> Just started using a safety razor a few weeks ago and used blades that came with it. My experience has been off and on enjoyable. Some days no blood and some days blood. Based on recommendations from other sites, I decided to try the Feather blades. After not shaving for a few days, I had a good amount of scruff. I made two separate passes and experienced  only a minor nick when I caught a place I had cut before. In all, this was the best shave yet and I credit the blades. Can&#x27;t wait to see how many shaves I get from a single blade.</li>
            <li> sharp like a navy seal Steven hawking on tiger blood fighting surry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the work nice  no razor burn and i am not that good yet</li>
            <li> I have tried the variety pack of DE blades and have found Feather and BIC to be very sharp blades. I can use the Feather for at least five shaves. My only problem is that it took a month to get it from some Asian country. So if you order get the 30 or better count.</li>
            <li> I love these feathers! They are super sharp, and they last forever.  I can shave with the same razor for a month and a half!  I bought a 30pk in june and I barely threw the first one away a couple weeks ago. I have saved a lot of money switching to DE shaving.  I went to a antique store and found a old school razor for $9.00 and these blades work great with it. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have read anything about Feather blades, the first thing you will hear is that they are the &amp;#34;sharpest&amp;#34; blades you will find. I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree, but honestly that didn&#x27;t really tell me if I should try the blade or not. Did I really want the sharpest blade? Would it be &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; sharp? Let me help out and say that whether or not these are the sharpest blades, yes, you should try them. I had gone through 2 other blades when I started  (Derby and Shark) that were ok, but I was sold on the DE shaving when I switched to the feather blades. I don&#x27;t mean to sound dramatic, but it really made a huge difference in the glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the Feather blades are that they seem to be a bit more expensive and harder to find. I woudln&#x27;t worry about them somehow being more dangerous since they are sharper. I also have had no issue using them 5-7 time a blade, but that is shaving daily also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With blades, there very little loss to trying one, so put this on your list and if you like it, great, If not, keep searching!</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Good value.</li>
            <li> Great quality. A bit too sharp. Cautions when shaving.</li>
            <li> Sharp and clean,, right on time</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BLADES.  VERY SHARP AND LASTS A LONG TIME.  HAVE BOUGHT THESE BEFORE AND WORK AS ADVERTISED.  BEST BLADES AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> If you use a safety razors and have moderate skill, in my opinion, these are the only razors you need.</li>
            <li> it is sharp, really sharp.</li>
            <li> FEATHER!!!! sharp and great quality</li>
            <li> These razors are super sharp.  They are nice for a few shaves but for whatever reason after a few shaves they get dull and they don&#x27;t cut as well. I tend to cut myself skin more after they get dull no issue at first though.  But if I want a super close shave these are the ones I use.</li>
            <li> prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.</li>
            <li> I will not order any other blades but these because they work great. They are the best that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered (30) Feather blades and stopped after using after only two of the (30) blades.  The first shave with both were good but I couldn&#x27;t get a second shave with either one without a lot of discomfort and I do mean discomfort.  I threw the remaining (28) into a drawer and I don&#x27;t expect to use them unless I absolutely need to and then for only one shave per blade.  I thought that I would try Feather because of all the great reviews so I don&#x27;t understand why I couldn&#x27;t get more than one shave to a blade.  I can only assume that the blade&#x27;s edge is completely gone after one shave which if it is, I question its stainless steel/platinum claims.</li>
            <li> Ordered and these are may past regular blade. I will update if any issue on arrival...    If you&#x27;ve got a great new and so typically mild or milder razor then you are acclimating (subset to what you know) and to your new safety *RANGE* of stubble leaving closeness control angles, that&#x27;s now newly afforded to you, on newer, flatter shaving ways. It&#x27;s fun; but your picking all manner of (inexpensive) stuff to hopefully SET your prep and system (read everything and watch good videos) so you&#x27;ll want to get to a point and not change stuff RIGHT NOW; but the blade. This brings you to the sharpest Feather blade, among many. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s dead wrong to think of a Feather as the most expensive one; because we&#x27;re talking about 27 cent and most guys get at least 4 shaves. Yeah, you can get more and will, if you do it all right and put alcohol on it, so it doesn&#x27;t rust when you are done. However: Don&#x27;t see how long one can last at this stage1. It will throw you into bad techniques even worse and bite you on a newly opened blade. You should already know, some peoples skin just scrapes extremely easy and can&#x27;t use these; but you should also know you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong and that&#x27;s the most likely reason. Unless you already have a known, really extreme and delicate skin issue. But to the point: IF and only IF you STILL can&#x27;t get at your stubble enough (maybe older, and maybe Grey, or simply beard from hell), in two passes or less (most or ABOUT 90% in the first pass is ideal arguably; because that&#x27;s a HUGE amount gentler and NOT even slower than \\&quot;one\\&quot; buffing pass) and the third pass is then optional and little more than a touch up *AND* if you&#x27;re \\&quot;digging\\&quot;, pressing-in, swooping, raking the razor into bad angles, to basically a similar friction inducing cartridge-like shaving action(s) you&#x27;re doing it all wrong, and I have a SOLUTION! Before you buy a closer cutting razor, you can keep with your testing and just shim it to increase the gap and so the razor safety range. (cutthe shinny part off of used blades with scissors, use one or two) WARNING: You WILL have CHANGE and go LIGHTER and STOP raking, than you have trained yourself th wrong way! You&#x27;ll get nicked if you do not realize this is counter intuitive, that&#x27;s all. You might survive it. :) You SHOULD really leave a (tiniest) bit of stubble your first week (of any changes) and not lust for it THEN. Shave for no redness or any pain (that stuff is VISUAL and can set you back a day healing), not for stubble gone-ness! That will happen. It will happen and it can be done as fast as 2 minutes! That takes experience(2 weeks or 1 month); but it&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t do this all the freaking time, you know? This is not a 1 day thing and if you say BS, you will learn and it will take a few days longer. You will not die and Feathers will NOT kill you. LOL. Just don&#x27;t loose respect for anything sharp, even after you used it and are past this and know that. Well meaning folks warn about Feathers, simply because you can not shave like plow cartridges with them. That&#x27;s a really good thing; TOUGH dense beard guys can get the stubble off, just by letting the weight of the razor head basically do all the work. What that actually means is the nicest cutting Feather (even on grown-out and dense beards or those areas) when shimmed, now does not scrape your skin off your face *and* also requires less passes and/or buffing, so way less time and friction. Yes Virgina there is a Santa Claus, for tough guys!!! The secret was the blade and razor gap customized for you (and all that other stuff absolutely matters. Do it all correctly.) So now you&#x27;re only week or two from really getting the PERFECT SHAVE they said was impossible and with the stubble off EFFICIENTLY *and* doing it with ZERO kinds of irritations. No more razor bumps. No burn. No acne either. No nicks, cuts or even a weeper once you&#x27;re setup. NO REDNESS. Smoother skin, noticeably. This, tough guys way, is training wheels-up however, and only after a week or better practice (not a big deal, just real patience for one time only; but many fall away just for that!). What that really means is you are not two years old. Those one-size-fits-all cartridges can never do this, and you can go closer on your dense spots, that can take it and use great self-control, cutting less on trouble spots; that can&#x27;t take it (like below the jawline) on the same face/shave. You may not believe we are really able to get this close and that&#x27;s why custom levels are required. This is DE wet shaving and nothing is better. Straight is slower. Electrics best takes MUCH longer, is a lot less close (than even passable work/speed shaves), and irritates comparatively with friction. Baby smooth DE shaves can even be done faster, once setup correctly. Not that I don&#x27;t still use the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; part.    Of course, you can choose to move the other direction, for some days and cut slightly less and comfort/safety for you (like a smaller gap Tech clone and less sharp blade for your beard type), for extreme speed, shaving twice a day or just for touch up passes, something like that, or for not having to think about it much at all, while doing it(half-asleep?), and also THE best for working around anything like moles(you just hop them, no big deal), than *any* other thing etc... We often forget it&#x27;s completely up to you to build it to any shaving way, that you need, or many way/razors. Also who says you can&#x27;t mix or match with having a beard or not, foil electric (like on ears), just for the summer or whatever? It&#x27;s not set in stone; but you do want to have the skill and be setup, custom just for you. I guess a china razor $2.00 was the best sale, 89 cent Williams soap puck and 8 cent medium Dorco blade and free DIY brush (wife discarded, big makeup brush, or old paint brush regrouped, just to test?) would set you back all of $2.97. It&#x27;s not about cost. Unless you mean the cash you are wasting now. It does change your face for the better. More, the closer you shave. So you probably have not seen that much change yet. Even if you&#x27;ve been shaving all your life. Little stuff, like always wearing a balm (lotion, and a good, inexpensive one with sane ingredients, because many suck) and BEFORE your face ever gets dry, really do matter. Many really good tips are found in DE shaving forums. Those are great by them self.</li>
            <li> Great razors, very sharp i use shark super chromes and these definitely surpass them with sharpness but not so much with durability I can only get one shave out of these.</li>
            <li> Outstanding far sharper than i was expecting if you like derby extra blades try this with very little pressure and you won&#x27;t go back</li>
            <li> i am new to the DE world, after 16 years of shaving with electric and multi razor cartridges.  I tried a sample pack of 16 different blades (Derby, Astra, Gillette Nacet, BlueBird, etc.). Some were better than others, but the Feather stood out (so far).  It is sharp, provides the smoothest shave, no tugging, and minimal razor burn and ingrown hairs.  I felt confident to go ahead and get thirty more Feathers while I was still sampling and collecting data on the others.  It is my standard upon which I judge the others.  For me, the Gillette 7-O-Clock  and Murker stainless are the ones that come closest to this.  Remember, technique is king.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me a straight razor kit for Christmas about 5 years ago.  The Feather Hi-Stainless Plat. Ct. Blades are what came as part of the kit for the safety razor.  I used all 5 of them, then ordered a variety pack from Royal Shave.  It was quite expensive but came with Merkur,  Gillette,  Bic,  Kings, Swordsman, etc.  I used all of them, but none of them came close to the shave of the Feather razors!!!  I love these razors and it&#x27;s hard to beat these prices, especially if your a prime member!</li>
            <li> Nice item, postage in two weeks from Thailand to France.&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I had not really done a serious comparison on these Feather blades, with my other samples of blades, until I tested each one in my recently acquired Futur. The first shave with the Feather gave me a BBS on a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting. Second shave gave me an almost BBS with a &amp;#34;1 1/2&amp;#34; setting. Third shave was not a decent shave until a &amp;#34;3 1/2&amp;#34; setting. There is no setting that would work for a (finally aborted) fourth shave. I have tested Derby, Astra, SuperMax, Blue Bird, Shark, Lord, Wilkinson Sword (German and Indian), Sharp, Dorco, and even the Ying Jili blade that came with a Chinese razor. And there is not one of them that degraded so quickly. I would probably have to pull a blade out of a soap dish after a month, in order to find something that bad! These blades are nothing but overpriced hype! Sorry folks, but that&#x27;s what my testing turned up. You can buy better blades at much lower prices!</li>
            <li> Super smooth, last a long time.  30 blades should last me over a year!  Best shave ever with Merkur handle.</li>
            <li> After using these for only the briefest of time, I have great respect for their sharpness.  Paired with a mild razor Feathers work very well, paired with an aggressive razor you may be wearing the marks for a while and everyone will call you Nick.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving using a safety razor. I started with Baili blades that came along with the razor and they were fine. I was curious to check out these blades since everyone seems to agree that they are the sharpest blades and I was not disappointed. In my limited experience, I do feel they are great blades, they gave a very smooth shave and one thing I noticed is that even at 4-5PM I did not see a shadow on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as the &#x27;newbies-stay-away&#x27; advice here, I believe it is overdone. I have been shaving with a safety razor for less than 2 weeks. So I do qualify as a newbie and these blades did not eat my face and spit it into the bathroom sink. Ready to use Mach-3 etc cartridges employ &#x27;tug and cut&#x27; method and come fit at an ultra safe angle which makes it difficult to cut yourself. Newbies need to understand that a safety razor blade, irrespective of which one they use, are different when compared to Mach-3s or Proglides. You have to be patient and try to make use of whatever is available such as good cream, brush, oil, lots of water etc to make it easier for the razor to glide as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experienced shaver, then I am sure you would have tried or at least heard of these. If you are a noob like me, I would say try it. The difficult step is to move from a Gillette Proglide to a safety razor and not from one safety razor blade to another. If anything, the fact that you are shaving using the sharpest blade should force you to be more patient and focus on shaving more.</li>
            <li> Great gift! Fast shipping. I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad from the people using them! I have been told that they have been durable.</li>
            <li> Best razors ever used.</li>
            <li> For me, the blades for a week of once-a-day shaving. They&#x27;re easy to pack and easy for disposal. I recommend this blade if you&#x27;re starting out with safety razors.</li>
            <li> By far Feather blades are the sharpest and smoothest DE razor blades made. I use them in everything from my mild Edwin Jagger DE89LBL to my aggressive MÃ¼hle R41 and they perform flawlessly, but as with anything, YMMV.</li>
            <li> Got a double edge razor for Christmas and have used it daily now for 3 months.  I started out with a sample pack of 10 different blades to see which ones I like.  Based on some other reviews, I gave these a try and doubt I will ever go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really sharp but if you take your time and pay attention, they won&#x27;t give you any trouble.  I did get distracted the first day or so and got a nice nick on the cheek but no worries since then.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a multi-blade disposable (although I do keep my electric Braun handy for shaving around my nose--much safer than the double edge).</li>
            <li> Super sharp blades! No razor burn. Glides and shaves smoothly.  Very satisfied with the quality.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with buying these.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades.  Can&#x27;t really tell any difference between Feather and Astra after the first shave</li>
            <li> Favorite blades along with personna lab blues. Learned valuable lesson with these blades. The sharper the blade the better performance. Seems simple enough but people are always saying these are to sharp, they will cut the crap out of you if you are not careful. That is true, but respect the blade and let the blade do the work with very light pressure and it will give you the closest shave you have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;They have become my favorite blades. Would give it five stars but do not like the packaging. I hate when they come in 5 packs, its annoying. With 30 count you get 6 packs of 5.</li>
            <li> These are aggressive blades and they can bite.  I bought these but switched to a gentler blade since.  Would not recommend for someone with sensitive skin but if you can handle it, these blades provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp. I cut my self plenty on the first try. I though maybe they were just longer and intern closer to the skin but no they are the size of regular DE blades. These are very sharp and aggressive on the skin. They cut the hair nice but i still cant get a close shave with this used with Merkur 34c HD. I still feel some rough patches.  When i press the razor to get a closer shave i end up getting nicks.</li>
            <li> One word.... SHARP  :)</li>
            <li> This bundle deal is pretty cheap compared to other crappy razors. I use these with my 30 dollar merkur or  murker double edge razor. I had them for over a year and still got like half left. If you use double edge, then this is definitely for you</li>
            <li> I ordered the Concord DE razor and these blades based on reviews on Amazon.  As soon as I got the delivery, I had to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy with the first two blades.  Basically, they only lasted 5 or 6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3rd and 4th blades each got about twice that many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is found when cleaning the blade.  After washing and blotting dry, I wiped the blades with hand sanitizer, leaving the blade coated and using it \\&quot;as-is\\&quot; for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol seems to drive the water away and the glycerine protects the blade for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this method, I found the shaves close and comfortable with only minor degradation until that one shaves that tells me the blade is finished.</li>
            <li> Great product as probably anyone looking at this review already knows. So I&#x27;ll rate shipping and packaging. The shipping was on time with Prime. The packaging must have gotten a little warm because my blades were stuck to the wrapper. This has not always been the case with previous purchases of feather blades. Not bad to where i can&#x27;t use them, just irritating because it takes longer to put a new blade in and i have to be extra careful so i don&#x27;t cut myself with this ninja sharp blade.</li>
            <li> The feather blades are my favorite of all the DE Blades. I get the best shave of all when I use these. They are very sharp and well above all the other blades on the market. They cost more but as for me they are well worth the money. Some cheaper  blades will do the job satisfactory and that is ok but , if you want a nice smooth 1 pass shave then these are the blades to use. Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend 20 minutes shaving, but these blades often leave me with cuts, and they only last between 1-2 shaves before they start tugging at my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted Feather blades because I figured I&#x27;d buy what many consider &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; and be done blade shopping, but other blades are far more forgiving, and, for me, provide a shave that is just as close as the Feather blades. I so have to shave with two passes, regardless of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I tried some BlueBirds that came as a sample with my last order of Feather blades, and they&#x27;re much more forgiving. Ordered 50, giving them a shot. I&#x27;m also interested in trying the Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
            <li> Some guys love &#x27;em, some don&#x27;t. I think they&#x27;re great DE blades. They work very well for me while others complain of nicks.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Arrived on time. Perfect condition. Great price.</li>
            <li> Finally a decent shave and the edge lasts for a long time. I usually do not have to changed blades but once a week. Also, I was fighting shaving bumps and irritations but no longer. After doing some research I learned that old style safety razors were the way to go to fight the ingrown hairs and bumps. I no longer have this malady after using the Feather blades as well as the alum blocks and Tend Skin. Shaving is now a pleasure and I consider it to be a bit of self indulgence rather than a brutal and dreadful task. Men need to embrace the old style shaving and consider it a pleasure rather than a task.</li>
            <li> By far, for my skin, this blade results in the closest shave (beats out Astra, Shark, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock (my 2nd favorite), Personna, Merkur, etc....).</li>
            <li> I bought these blades after hearing nothing but glowing reviews on them. I figured, what the heck, might as well see what all the hype is about. I literally just got done with my first shave using these blades and WOW! I previously used Derby DE blades, but this will now be my one and only blade that I use. The difference is beyond description. These blades are seriously, almost scary, sharp. When I began shaving, I couldn&#x27;t even feel it cutting my stubble, it just glided through it. I&#x27;m usually a three pass kind of guy. Just to make sure I get all the angles and everything. After my second pass with these, there was no reason for a third. My face is baby&#x27;s butt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum these up, all I can say is, you owe it to yourself to at least try them. I promise you will not be disappointed and will be buying more. Simply incredible.</li>
            <li> The best double edge razor I have used in 50 years.  I picked up two old Stainless steel old adjustible razors at a  used trader shop 15 years ago.  I cleaned them up and they work great.  I just got my order of Feather double edge blades.  They are thin, sharp and better quality than any American or German brand.  The price was great for 30 blades.  I tried this Japanese brand because I own Japanese knives that are great.  I have a good knowledge of Japanese and American knives.  I own Spydero stainless knives.  In American I like D2 and also 1095 in high carbon blades.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades!!! Very sharp clean shave!!</li>
            <li> Switched to DE shaving about 5 years ago and have tried many razor brands.  Hands down Feathers are the best!  While everybody&#x27;s skin is different, I get a solid week out of a single razor with a daily shave.</li>
            <li> Much better then the Derby blades I used to purchase here on Amazon. They last a full shave and can be reused if you store your DE in baby oil between uses.</li>
            <li> I have tried various blades and have never some across anything quite like these Feather blades. They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life. I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues with other blades tugging my stubble and just not quite preforming to my preference. Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
            <li> I think I am going to try to some Merkur blades.  These work pretty well but thought that they might shave closer.  I typically have to do a 2-3 pass shave and still need some extra passes.  I assume this is the norm in relation to a safety razor.  I use them in an Edwin Jagger and am pretty happy.  One gripe is that the paper they&#x27;re packaged in usually leaves a residue from the glue on the blade.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are about the thinnest and sharpest double-edge blades you are likely to ever get your hands on.  The hold up very well (about a week for me) and very consistent.  If you haven&#x27;t had a great experience with other blades, try the Feather before you give up on wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wilkinson sword and Astra. This product has the best edge that I&#x27;ve tried so far. I only use them once so I can&#x27;t speak for how well it hold it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> Great blades! Last a long time and nothing beats their sharpness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if these are the sharpest DL blades or if they are necessarily the best, but they are the best I&#x27;ve tried. I have the unfortunate combination of hard-to-shave facial hair and more sensitive than average skin. But I choose feather blades every time because the sharpness of the blade prevents me from the necessity of making multiple passes over the same area. I highly recommend them for experienced or new shavers, though the latter should take extra care until they get used to them.</li>
            <li> Been searching for a really sharp, double edge blade for some time.  Stumbled upon these during a trip to Eastern Europe and was sold on them.  More good news is that Amazon seems to be a reliable source.  I have very soft skin on my face and neck, but a very hard, coarse beard.  These blades make short work of any day&#x27;s worth of growth in short order, without the irritation I have often experienced with other DE blades or even the multiple blade systems.  But as someone else said, they are unforgiving.  If you have a small blemish or bump, these blades will slice it off at skin level without me ever noticing until  I see the little red dot.  For best results, I run my electric razor over my face, especially around my upper lip and chin areas.  Makes for an easier shave with less scraping.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I was initially guided to these blades, as ones I had previously tried (Derby) left a rough, unclean shave. These are much nicer/sharper, and allow the user to simply focusing on the cleanness of the shave, as opposed to the resulting length produced.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp. I have a thick, dark hairs, so my 5 o&#x27;clock is more of a 2 o&#x27;clock so I like to have as close a shave as possible. I switch to these blades when I am not in a hurry as you definitely do not want to cut yourself with these aggressive blades. These are also perfect for the &amp;#34;night before&amp;#34; shaves because the shave is so close, my face is still smooth well into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you try them yourself. However, I have known people with sensitive skin to have irritation issues using these blades. Buy a sampler and try for yourself. I do not recommend for beginners.</li>
            <li> These feather blades are without a doubt the best blades I have ever shaven with. Super smooth, irritation free shave with very little effort. These blades are no more dangerous than any other double edged razor, but the bevel is just perfect. No whisker stands a chance.</li>
            <li> i really went on the recommendations of others so I have ntothing to compare it to. Does provide a nice shave for three mornings.</li>
            <li> Very close shave. these are my go to blades.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few different brands of safety razor blades, but so far these are just fine with me.  I order in bulk, so I only have to purchase them about twice a year.  They give a reasonably close shave at a decent price.</li>
            <li> These blades are good, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  But keep in mind that they are super freaking sharp!  They will not forgive at all if you make a mistake.  You will get cut! If your an expert in shaving with a DE blade, then these are for you.  If you&#x27;re not, then I would recommend something else like Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> The sharpest and most durable blades at a super price.</li>
            <li> I am a first time safety razor user. Some reviews suggested not to use these blades as they&#x27;re extremely sharp. I had no issues. I just made sure to be careful. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp as advertised! I am using an Edwin Jagged DE89 and decided to give the Feathers a try before purchasing a large order of blades to how these performed vs the Derby blades that came with the razor. I shave my head and face so my razor gets a lot of usage and my head is a bit tricky to shave with some peaks and valleys on tube back side and a neck that is easily irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;During the first shave I will admit that I didn&#x27;t prepare my head and face as good as I normally do and was rushed during the shave. Overall during this trial shave, I noticed that the blade had an exceptionally smooth glide against my skin and cut very easily. I did a one pass shave against the grain on my which is what I was doing with my Derby blades which deliver  perfectly smooth shave on my head and face with no irritation The feathers performed equally as well delivering a nearly perfect shave even with the rushed shave. I did however get a really bad nick on he grove in the back of my head which was definitely caused by carelessness from the rushed shave without proper pre-shave preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Shave - Perfectly smooth with a little more ease than my Derby blades. The shave actually lasted longer than the Derby&#x27;s before I felt stubble. No nicks on the second shave no irritation on my sensitive neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview - Grate blades, as sharp as advertised. Be careful the firs few times and once you are use to the blades you will get the best shave of your life. I highly recommend the Feathers to experienced wet shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - Used Jack Black Face Buff for pre-shave and Jack Black Beard Lube for shave cream.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with these blades.</li>
            <li> I had been using Derby and Personna razor blades before these, both I could feel hang on the hairs... the Derbys worse than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not an expert shaver by any means but I did manage to get some spots baby butt smooth with these blades, unlike the others. So I&#x27;m pretty sure these are the best blades I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may update this review in the future, but for now, I like these blades.</li>
            <li> Perfect shave on first use, but these blades don&#x27;t hold an edge as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> These are much nicer than the blades available at my local big-box drug store. Who knew there were varying qualities?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed that mine don&#x27;t say, &amp;#34;Hi-Stainless&amp;#34; on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many many different brands of blades and none of them even get close to matching Feathers ability to give a close shave without pulling the hairs out. Best of all, they stay sharp much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I realize its coming from China but it must have come most of  the way by mule train. Very Slow!</li>
            <li> I bought a safety razor to save money on normal razors. Got a sample pack that didn&#x27;t include feather blades and was starting to give up on safety razors. The shave wasn&#x27;t as good as normal razors, friend recommended these blades and WOW, all the other blades are pure garbage, these cut soooo smooth. Very pleasurable experience to use these. Dont listen to people who saw they are to sharp, they are perfect!!!</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest, longest lasting blades I have ever used. These shave as close in one pass and many others do in two or more passes. I highly recommend getting a sampler pack of these to try in your razor.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. I have tried many razor blades and these far surpass the quality and sharpness of other blades. Word of warning, they do require a experianced shaver to use without cutting yourself. As they have a low threshold for error.</li>
            <li> Just got another of 30 blades. These are the best double edge razor blades on the market. I consistently get a better, smoother, closer shave with these than any other blade I have used. They last longer than other brands too.</li>
            <li> I keep switching back to Feather Platinum coated because I always get a close, effortless shave. My hair is so thick I must use conditioner in the shower on my face and neck before I can use any blade. I&#x27;ve been double edge shaving for more than 2 years, and this is the best alternative to using rip-off Gilette or BiC razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade takes very little effort in cutting through the toughest beard stubble- BUT WARNING... if you 45 degree like your supposed to and press too hard, you will cut chunks of skin out of your neck and face. And you will NOT realize it until you are half-way finished shaving. The blade is so sharp that your face will not start bleeding, where you nicked yourself, until you realize you nicked yourself in several other places. SHAVE LIGHTLY with this blade, with the grain at first, and know that it is sharper than the sharpest samurai sword in Japan. You won&#x27;t have a cleaner shave than with this blade as long as you practice and know EXACTLY how to use a double edged, very sharp blade and razor.</li>
            <li> I do like these blades, but since I recently got back into wet shaving, I need to work with them a while longer then may raise my rating. I bought them with the Edwin Jagger DE89LBl which cam with 5 Derby blades. I also like the Derbys and am switching off to see if either lasts longer or shaves easier.</li>
            <li> These blades irritate my sensitive skin and don&#x27;t work for me.  The razor burn I got when I tried these was atrocious.</li>
            <li> Good product, will keep ordering as I need to refills these blades. Costs is good and get several shaves from quality old time blades. Brings many memories of days gone .</li>
            <li> Well these are super sharp as everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;But for some reason I am more irritated after using these than with the astras.. And get way more ingrown hairs... Wont buy again...&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin, Tough beard</li>
            <li> Feather is the ultimate blade... very sharp! I use Derby and Murker as well. All of which are decent blades but the Feather blades are the best. I use all three in a rotation sequence. As far as rating them I would say... that the Feather blades are #1. The Murker blades #2. and The Derby blades #3. Only my opion of course. This will vary for each person because everyone has different skin and beard growth. I have medium to thick beard growth and my skin is on the sensitive side... which is why I rotate blades. I use The Murker HD 34C and The Edwin Jagger DE98BL razors. If your relatively new to wet shaving, proper face prep before shaving is very important! You can find many videos on utube for this... (search wet shaving.) SHAVENATION on utube has really great videos. Finding the correct angle of holding your razor may take a few shaves. A 30 degree angle is standard... BUT I put a small bit more of an angle that works better for me. Using no pressure  and letting the weight of the razor lay against your skin is the way to avoid cutting yourself. Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> Sharp, and no glue on them.  Perfect for cutting hair after letting it go for a few extra days.</li>
            <li> The Feather blades do a good job. Performance varies with the razor selected. I am still looking for the best combination of blade and.razor.</li>
            <li> These blades are too sharp.  I know that seems like a ridiculous thing to say regarding a razor blade, but I don&#x27;t know how to put it any other way.  I find myself cutting myself far too easily with these blades.  Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, but I don&#x27;t have a similar problem with other ones.  Give them a try and see for yourself - it&#x27;s not like they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Great razors for being so cheap.</li>
            <li> I switched over to DE (double edge safety razor) shaving because I really hated shaving in the morning. Nothing like a cruddy disposable razor feeling like it&#x27;s yanking your whiskers out by the roots at 0530 to start the day right. The blades that came with the razor I bought were an improvement, but not the radical change I had envisioned. After doing a little reading I tried some Feathers. This was what I was hoping for when I made the switch to DE wet shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you much more about the differences between these and other blades, because after I used my first feather I had what I was looking for and haven&#x27;t tried anything else since.</li>
            <li> The only blades I&#x27;ve used for 4 or 5 years. Consistently sharp blade after blade.</li>
