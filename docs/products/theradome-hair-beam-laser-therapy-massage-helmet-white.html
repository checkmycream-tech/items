    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best investment we made this year!!</li>
            <li>so you do not shed so much, great product</li>
            <li>We are happy and will continue using our Theradome.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be working good.</li>
            <li>I included a picture of my helmet to prove I own one.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at the Theradome Quality control and Amazon&#x27;s superb customer service.</li>
            <li>I lost more hairs after using this helmet than before.  </li>
            <li>It is not fuller or more manageable -- like they claimed it would be.</li>
            <li>Although the Theradome may have been invented with the best of intentions, it simply has not worked as they said and claimed it would.</li>
            <li>On top of that glaring coincidence, many on the internet forums believe Theradome employees are writing glowing reviews for this product themselves.</li>
            <li>Everything seems OK.</li>
            <li>so you have to keep it more than thirty days to find out if it will work for you.</li>
            <li>+ times per week as directed and have lost SO much more hair than when I started.  </li>
            <li>My barber was impressed with the results as my frontal hairline is coming back, and the bald spot is gone.</li>
            <li>and i will surely recommend it to many friends</li>
            <li>We have been using it over 2 months every 24-48 hours, mostly, as directed.  </li>
            <li>It did nothing but the most important thing to note</li>
            <li>What is most striking about the fact that so many bald and/or hair loss sufferers must live in Pleasanton is that Theradome, Inc. JUST so happens to be located in Pleasanton, California too.</li>
            <li>Most things worth having aren&#x27;t cheap or easy to accomplish.</li>
            <li>Another huge \\&quot;coincidence\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>I noticed how cheaply it was</li>
            <li>This product is a fantastic development in the hair loss treatment market.</li>
            <li>the more i read into it the more i started to realize this is a very well constructed scam product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month and have made significant hair gains.</li>
            <li>friendly and each time after i finish my treatment</li>
            <li>It has NOT worked after a full year of treatment.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to ride out the full minimum length of recommended usage time (135 days) hoping to see results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s taken me 2 full months since receiving it, and its still not working like it</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t turn on even on full charge.</li>
            <li>An improvement to this product for me would be if there was noticeable regrowth in the very front, where I need it most.    </li>
            <li>let them know I didn&#x27;t receive the full refund</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and hair loss problem and give me a full grown hair on my bald spot</li>
            <li>The top of my head no longer looks like a &#x27;combover&#x27;--it&#x27;s not flat on top, it&#x27;s got some volume again and the volume holds up during the day.  </li>
            <li>This product is a fraud it is cheaply made and the lights don&#x27;t output enough power to be clinically effective.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this product again because I&#x27;m confident that if I hadn&#x27;t used THeradome I&#x27;d still be losing my hair AND because of being able to style my hair again without it looking flat.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and my scalp seems very stimulated after my twice weekly usage.  </li>
            <li>If this thing breaks again, I am completely on my own whether its in the next year or not.</li>
            <li>The recommended is 2 times a week, but can be used more frequently for quicker results.  </li>
            <li>The item has a two years warranty right??</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and hope the Theradome will work and give me back my confidence with full grown and healthy hair??</li>
            <li>Theradome will not provide any support and offered nothing in return for not being able to fulfill their warranty for the year, not a partial refund, nothing.</li>
            <li>That is MORE than enough time to expect ANY results, right?</li>
            <li>The first time I used the helmet it said it was treatment</li>
            <li>Used this for almost 4 months an no hair growth and actually think I might have lost even more hair.</li>
            <li>Theradome sent me a helmet, and the first one slipped through customs.</li>
            <li>If the 1-800 number had worked in the first place, they would have resolve it without the need to speak to the CEO.</li>
            <li>was pretty troubling.  </li>
            <li>Today for the first time since I started, when I washed my hair, there were almost no hairs on my hands or in the sink.  </li>
            <li>Usually there are is a fair amount of hairs visible on my hands, but there was maybe one that I saw today.  </li>
            <li>Although I have a legal warranty document stating they will refund the product (which they have in fact changed so if you buy one now yours will not say this), there are loopholes and they will never refund anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Of course, I was hopeful that over time, and with patience, my hair would become thicker and I would not have to spend so much time attempting to hide my scalp and covering my diffused hair loss.  </li>
            <li>thanks alot for this product</li>
            <li>I am losing way too much hair, i used to lose 10 to 20 strands in the shower ,</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Bought this product and used it for about 8 months, skeptically, even though i was considered an ideal candidate.</li>
            <li>I paid $695 for mine last year right after they first started selling it.</li>
            <li>Very interesting coincidence to say the least.</li>
            <li>I have had it now and used it religiously for 1 full year and, as of today, have had 137 treatments.</li>
            <li>i read up about Tamim Hamid (one of the founders of this product) and began to ask around within friends in cali, and the extent of my research led me to a secretary that worked for a Dr that preformed hair transplants for celebrities and people of high profile.</li>
            <li>and it was done on the same exact day too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I noticed on one site that nearly every single positive review for the Theradome helmet was written by \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; customers who all lived in the same place!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a normal consumer looking for a remedy to my hair loss, and I think I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li>this is when i decided to chuck my theradome away, he claimed to have had all his his grow back from his own product, wherein reality he simply had a hair transplant and benefited from peoples wish to have theirs grow back too.</li>
            <li>The helmet came promptly on time and I began using it right away at a rate of one treatment every 36 hours or so for the last 3 weeks since I started.  </li>
            <li>I had to install a new one myself.</li>
            <li>My hairfall has stopped and new hair is growing again.</li>
            <li>If they were confident, at least going back to last year, they would have offered a full 6-month guarantee to those of us who purchased it first.</li>
            <li>I used the helmet for more than 6 months regularly as per their guidelines and there is no positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>After about the first month of use I started noticing after I washed my hair that there were only maybe 15-25 hairs in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>Its still early but after 35 sessions with this I do not see any thicker hair or regrowth of any new hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine direct from Theradome in July 2014 and have just starting seeing some positive results.</li>
            <li>This company clearly took no care in developing this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I also bought this directly through Theradome website when they were promoting in Oct/ Nov 2013.  </li>
            <li>I bought this direct from the mfg.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to not be falling out as much as it did prior to using Thermadore.  </li>
            <li>Purchased directly from the manufacturer in Dec. 2013.</li>
            <li>But I personally wasn&#x27;t ready to go the route of The Rock and Vin Diesel.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a pretty long wait??&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and customer who experience the same problem or if not worse.</li>
            <li>I am a 45 yo African American male, who had some recession in the frontal hair line and was developing a bald spot in the center of the top of my head.</li>
            <li>you need patience to get results, and if you do it daily, or even twice daily and take vivaksal or other anti DHT pills; you will notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Since Theradome my individual hairs don&#x27;t seem more thick to me, but overall my hair looks more thick after it&#x27;s styled.</li>
            <li>The reviews are obviously in and the product is junk so they are not standing behind their own product.</li>
            <li>Theradome is the major piece to the hair restoration puzzle.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Theradome directly from the manufacturer last year.</li>
            <li>If you are in the early stages of male pattern balding and want to save your hair, make the investment.</li>
            <li>Especially considering two different reviewers gave the same exact review -- down to the very letter and word</li>
            <li>they cannot really fulfill their warranty in Canada, certainly not to replace it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were very smart to target the female audience with slick marketing, most of who aren&#x27;t as technically inclined as some of the die hard mens hairloss community.</li>
            <li>some other users have submitted their stories, and have pointed out the fake reviews about how good the product is, when you read the positive reviews its quite easy to tell that theyre fake, or endorsed by theradome itself.</li>
            <li>Since I posted my review -- in less than 24 hours both Lucho and Henry&#x27;s 5-star reviews have since been revised and changed and they are no longer the same exact review.</li>
            <li>Slick marketing is all this company has no cutting edge sciences just snake oil</li>
            <li>My hair has been steadily falling out for a couple of years due to hormone changes and medications I take.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the product directly from the manufacturer and have had absolutely no new hair growth or increased density after 16 months and 147 treatments.  </li>
            <li>I have spent enough time at the post office only to receive a NEW helmet which doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> While researching the product, I read the instructions which said not to expect any results for at least 18 weeks after first usage.</li>
            <li> 4-1/2 months to see expected results, but a money-back guarantee for only 30 days.</li>
            <li> And at that point, you&#x27;re screwed because the return guarantee is long expired by over 100 days.</li>
            <li> This took a long time to happen--I think about 10 months of Theradome usage.</li>
            <li> We took photos of our most thin sections and we are amazed at the hair growth we have plus the small amount of hair loss during shampooing and combing hair.  </li>
            <li> 4 months in, still losing hair, no new growth to speak of.</li>
            <li> Every single 5-star review for this product here on Amazon does not have the Amazon \\&quot;Verified Purchase\\&quot; banner beneath the reviewer.</li>
            <li> The charger they sent was broken, which ruined the first battery.</li>
            <li> Big let down!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely NO measureable regrowth on my head whatsoever -- as they said would happen.</li>
            <li> I got a partial refund through PAYPAL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been 6 months now and absolutely no progress</li>
            <li> Absolutely no results after 118 treatments, 41-42 weeks, using 2x week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this thing religiously for a year, and so far not only has it not stimulated growth but it has failed to improve hair loss.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, and shame on these people for giving us women hope that we could at least arrest our hair loss, even if we did not benefit from new growth.  </li>
            <li> I would again resume showers at my athletic club, which I had ceased taking due to the embarrassment of my balding head.  </li>
            <li> It works as described but will take a few months before I can judge the long tern benefits</li>
            <li> make my wallet short a few hundred dollars!</li>
            <li> The customer service reps are polite, but unable to do much to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female in her late 50s.  </li>
            <li> turned it on and noticed about half the laser diodes were faulty</li>
            <li> for much less in January 2014.  </li>
            <li> I would like to give half a star or no star if I could.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> What a waste of almost $1,000.</li>
            <li> It was not working out of the box, and when they tried to send another, Health Canada blocked it as an unapproved product and is destroying it.</li>
            <li> I believe that Theradome stopped my hair loss dead in its tracks.  </li>
            <li> The money back return period decreased from 120 days to 30 to now 7 days.  </li>
            <li> its extremely unfortunate, i do hope this goes public one day and that people at least get their money back..</li>
            <li> as for the secretary, i am putting her in touch with some magazines and news papers that will offer her money for her story, all she is worried about now is getting in trouble as shes not meant to speak out about customers.</li>
            <li> Previously i was having excessive hairfall.</li>
            <li> I have lost almost half my hair over the past 10 years with severe crown and hairline thinning and changes.  </li>
            <li> So much so that it was frightening!</li>
            <li> Regarding people complaining that their shipments were late, mine was late too, but I think one has to keep in mind that this company was just starting to manufacture and ship this product during that time (late 2013-early 2014).  </li>
            <li> is that this product is made SO poorly it will not work for you long term.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;ve amended that or not,</li>
            <li> not sure if i should stop or continue</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I mean from seeing probably 50 hairs every time I wash down to 3 is a miracle!  </li>
            <li> I could not walk without feeling hair fall onto my shoulders and now very few hairs fall.  </li>
            <li> Because unfortunately I have not noticed ONE single difference at ALL in my hair.</li>
            <li> --this had been happening for at least a year.</li>
            <li> now im losing at least 8 times that amount  ..</li>
            <li> I am female and the prospect of baldness is extremely depressing.  </li>
            <li> I now follow many of the internet hair loss forums and websites and the majority of them had serious issues with the Theradome and gave it bad reviews and bad word-of-mouth.</li>
            <li> I mean geez, cut them some slack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the pathetic customer service I must say the helmet appears to be a terrible design.&lt;br /&gt;The diodes are to far from the scalp, too few, and too diffused to really achieve the power density (mw/cm2) that has been used in LLLT</li>
            <li> Whereas before Theradome I was seeing 100+ with every shampoo and worse yet, quite a bit of hair was coming out in my hands while shampooing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the poor reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it seems like predatory false advertising.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working and the helmet is too expensive to try/ invest.</li>
            <li> It was wishful thinking on my part and an expensive lesson learned.</li>
            <li> That is TWO I have received that never worked at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am sad that this company is exploiting people&#x27;s sadness.</li>
            <li> One rep referred me to the CEO, who ultimately failed to provide any info or resolution and told me to call the 1-800 line.</li>
            <li> I was unable to control it and it was increasing day after  day.</li>
            <li> So disappointed and wish these negative reviews were posted before I decided to buy months ago.</li>
            <li> Depressing, depressing, depressing.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product as it did nothing at all to help with my hair loss.</li>
            <li> My husband has receded terribly and thinned</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am of the opinion that it helps. I purchased mine direct from Theradome in July 2014 and have just starting seeing some positive results. And I feel like i&#x27;m in the movie TRON when I&#x27;m wearing it!</li>
            <li> I also bought this directly through Theradome website when they were promoting in Oct/ Nov 2013.  I got the helmet in Dec 2013.  I used the helmet for more than 6 months regularly as per their guidelines and there is no positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact I lost more hairs after using this helmet than before.  It&#x27;s not working and the helmet is too expensive to try/ invest.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Theradome directly from the manufacturer last year. I have had it now and used it religiously for 1 full year and, as of today, have had 137 treatments. That is MORE than enough time to expect ANY results, right? Wrong! Because unfortunately I have not noticed ONE single difference at ALL in my hair. It is not fuller or more manageable -- like they claimed it would be. No increase in my hair count -- like they stated would happen. The Theradome has not produced a thicker, fuller head of hair for me as they said it would. Absolutely NO measureable regrowth on my head whatsoever -- as they said would happen. And NO discernible thickness difference in my hair at all -- as they said would happen! It has NOT worked after a full year of treatment. Simply put, I feel duped and I DO NOT recommend purchasing this product!  Although the Theradome may have been invented with the best of intentions, it simply has not worked as they said and claimed it would. I should have listened to my inner-voice! While researching the product, I read the instructions which said not to expect any results for at least 18 weeks after first usage. But, Theradome only offered a 30-day money back guarantee back at my time of purchase. Not sure if they&#x27;ve amended that or not, but that was/is ridiculous, right? 4-1/2 months to see expected results, but a money-back guarantee for only 30 days. Of course you aren&#x27;t going to return it after 30 days! You&#x27;re going to ride out the full minimum length of recommended usage time (135 days) hoping to see results. And at that point, you&#x27;re screwed because the return guarantee is long expired by over 100 days. If they were confident, at least going back to last year, they would have offered a full 6-month guarantee to those of us who purchased it first. They did not. Now I know why.  I now follow many of the internet hair loss forums and websites and the majority of them had serious issues with the Theradome and gave it bad reviews and bad word-of-mouth. It was wishful thinking on my part and an expensive lesson learned. I don&#x27;t want anyone else to make the same mistake I did and spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I paid $695 for mine last year right after they first started selling it. Now they jacked it up to $895! Incredulous!  One thing I have noticed: Every single 5-star review for this product here on Amazon does not have the Amazon \\&quot;Verified Purchase\\&quot; banner beneath the reviewer. That&#x27;s a red flag to me. A BIG one! Especially considering two different reviewers gave the same exact review -- down to the very letter and word and it was done on the same exact day too! Very interesting coincidence to say the least. Don&#x27;t believe me? Look up \\&quot;Lucho\\&quot; and \\&quot;Henry&#x27;s\\&quot; 5-star reviews from January 30, 2015.  On top of that glaring coincidence, many on the internet forums believe Theradome employees are writing glowing reviews for this product themselves. I guess in an attempt to cash in on the sorrows of fellow hair loss sufferers. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I noticed on one site that nearly every single positive review for the Theradome helmet was written by \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; customers who all lived in the same place!! -- Pleasanton, California. What is most striking about the fact that so many bald and/or hair loss sufferers must live in Pleasanton is that Theradome, Inc. JUST so happens to be located in Pleasanton, California too. Another huge \\&quot;coincidence\\&quot;?  I included a picture of my helmet to prove I own one.  +++Update+++  Since I posted my review -- in less than 24 hours both Lucho and Henry&#x27;s 5-star reviews have since been revised and changed and they are no longer the same exact review.</li>
            <li> you need patience to get results, and if you do it daily, or even twice daily and take vivaksal or other anti DHT pills; you will notice a huge difference.  People have no patience but hair only grows 1/2 inch a month, but this doubles the size of shaft so you do not shed so much, great product</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have received THREE different helmets. All of which were faulty. This company clearly took no care in developing this piece of junk. They also will NOT REFUND YOU! Do not be deceived. Although I have a legal warranty document stating they will refund the product (which they have in fact changed so if you buy one now yours will not say this), there are loopholes and they will never refund anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for almost a year with the 2nd helmet I received. It did nothing but the most important thing to note is that this product is made SO poorly it will not work for you long term. I have spent enough time at the post office only to receive a NEW helmet which doesn&#x27;t work. That is TWO I have received that never worked at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am sad that this company is exploiting people&#x27;s sadness. If there were a cure for hair loss we wouldnt know about it.</li>
            <li> Everything seems OK. The first time I used the helmet it said it was treatment #3 but maybe I bumped it while was travelling.</li>
            <li> This product is a fraud it is cheaply made and the lights don&#x27;t output enough power to be clinically effective.  Slick marketing is all this company has no cutting edge sciences just snake oil</li>
            <li> Used this for almost 4 months an no hair growth and actually think I might have lost even more hair. So disappointed and wish these negative reviews were posted before I decided to buy months ago. What a waste of almost $1,000.</li>
            <li> 1) This product is not approved for sale in Canada. Theradome sent me a helmet, and the first one slipped through customs. It was not working out of the box, and when they tried to send another, Health Canada blocked it as an unapproved product and is destroying it. That means 2) they cannot really fulfill their warranty in Canada, certainly not to replace it. Which leads to 3) it&#x27;s taken me 2 full months since receiving it, and its still not working like it should out of the box. The charger they sent was broken, which ruined the first battery. I had to install a new one myself. Theradome will not provide any support and offered nothing in return for not being able to fulfill their warranty for the year, not a partial refund, nothing. The customer service reps are polite, but unable to do much to help. None could give me an answer about the product&#x27;s status in Canada, despite my asking in several emails. One rep referred me to the CEO, who ultimately failed to provide any info or resolution and told me to call the 1-800 line. If the 1-800 number had worked in the first place, they would have resolve it without the need to speak to the CEO. One would think a CEO would be savvy enough to get that. If this thing breaks again, I am completely on my own whether its in the next year or not. If you are in Canada - do not buy this product. You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, and shame on these people for giving us women hope that we could at least arrest our hair loss, even if we did not benefit from new growth.  Of course, I was hopeful that over time, and with patience, my hair would become thicker and I would not have to spend so much time attempting to hide my scalp and covering my diffused hair loss.  I would again resume showers at my athletic club, which I had ceased taking due to the embarrassment of my balding head.  I purchased the product directly from the manufacturer and have had absolutely no new hair growth or increased density after 16 months and 147 treatments.  My hair continues to fall out, and I am dreading the day I have to &amp;#34;throw&amp;#34; on a wig.  Depressing, depressing, depressing.</li>
            <li> Hair seems healthier and growth seems to have improved.</li>
            <li> Previously i was having excessive hairfall. I was unable to control it and it was increasing day after  day.I was worried that i would become blad one day. But after using this product everything changed.My hairfall has stopped and new hair is growing again. thanks alot for this product</li>
            <li> Received this product in the mail and it does not even turn on and this thing is actually made in USA. It won&#x27;t turn on even on full charge. I am surprised at the Theradome Quality control and Amazon&#x27;s superb customer service. I will think twice before buying anything from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a year and no results seem, instead my hair keeps falling.</li>
            <li> Its still early but after 35 sessions with this I do not see any thicker hair or regrowth of any new hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact it takes months to see results (if any) so you have to keep it more than thirty days to find out if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female in her late 50s.  I believe that Theradome stopped my hair loss dead in its tracks.  I received my Theradome helmet in January 2014. I used it twice weekly for over a year, and 1-2 times weekly since then.  After about the first month of use I started noticing after I washed my hair that there were only maybe 15-25 hairs in the shower drain. Whereas before Theradome I was seeing 100+ with every shampoo and worse yet, quite a bit of hair was coming out in my hands while shampooing--this had been happening for at least a year. The hair loss and resulting problems I was having styling my hair was pretty troubling.  Since Theradome my individual hairs don&#x27;t seem more thick to me, but overall my hair looks more thick after it&#x27;s styled. It&#x27;s a noticable improvement. This took a long time to happen--I think about 10 months of Theradome usage. The top of my head no longer looks like a &#x27;combover&#x27;--it&#x27;s not flat on top, it&#x27;s got some volume again and the volume holds up during the day.  I would buy this product again because I&#x27;m confident that if I hadn&#x27;t used THeradome I&#x27;d still be losing my hair AND because of being able to style my hair again without it looking flat. An improvement to this product for me would be if there was noticeable regrowth in the very front, where I need it most.    Regarding people complaining that their shipments were late, mine was late too, but I think one has to keep in mind that this company was just starting to manufacture and ship this product during that time (late 2013-early 2014).  I mean geez, cut them some slack.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the operation of the unit or with the charger.  I like the 5-minute-interval voice countdown feature a lot. Customer support has been responsive when I&#x27;ve had questions.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Theradome at the beginning of Dec and was assured it would arrive by xmas.&lt;br /&gt;It finally came on Feb 5th. I was on a business trip and couldn&#x27;t try it for several week when I returned.&lt;br /&gt;Upon unpacking and testing it I noticed how cheaply it was built.&lt;br /&gt;Who cares if it works?&lt;br /&gt;I turned it on and noticed about half the laser diodes were faulty (dead).&lt;br /&gt;After going back with support I decided to take advantage of the money back guarantee which I was well within.&lt;br /&gt;Theradome support became dodgy telling trying to get out of a return.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I threatened a chargeback and they issued a return which they told me would take two months to process.&lt;br /&gt;After shipping it in and some hassle I got a partial refund through PAYPAL.&lt;br /&gt;I let them know I didn&#x27;t receive the full refund, they never replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the pathetic customer service I must say the helmet appears to be a terrible design.&lt;br /&gt;The diodes are to far from the scalp, too few, and too diffused to really achieve the power density (mw/cm2) that has been used in LLLT studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were very smart to target the female audience with slick marketing, most of who aren&#x27;t as technically inclined as some of the die hard mens hairloss community. Unfortunately it seems like predatory false advertising.</li>
            <li> I am 8 weeks into the treatment .. I am losing way too much hair, i used to lose 10 to 20 strands in the shower , now im losing at least 8 times that amount  .. not sure if i should stop or continue</li>
            <li> I bought this direct from the mfg. for much less in January 2014.  I use it 2+ times per week as directed and have lost SO much more hair than when I started.  I am back on the Rogaine now WHILE still using the unit.  I hope it starts to do what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been 6 months now and absolutely no progress whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do your research, this may work for you.  Not me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the poor reviews here.  I am thrilled!  My hair has been steadily falling out for a couple of years due to hormone changes and medications I take.  I thought if it continues I will soon be bald. I am female and the prospect of baldness is extremely depressing.  The helmet came promptly on time and I began using it right away at a rate of one treatment every 36 hours or so for the last 3 weeks since I started.  The recommended is 2 times a week, but can be used more frequently for quicker results.  Today for the first time since I started, when I washed my hair, there were almost no hairs on my hands or in the sink.  Usually there are is a fair amount of hairs visible on my hands, but there was maybe one that I saw today.  And I saw maybe three all told during the entire washing process!  I mean from seeing probably 50 hairs every time I wash down to 3 is a miracle!  I can&#x27;t wait to see if my hair thickens up after further!  And no, I don&#x27;t work for this company nor do I have any affiliation with it whatsoever.  I&#x27;m just a normal consumer looking for a remedy to my hair loss, and I think I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and my scalp seems very stimulated after my twice weekly usage.  My hair seems to not be falling out as much as it did prior to using Thermadore.  My hair appears to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I would not even give it 1 STAR.  The product does not work. Theradome knows that it does not work. The money back return period decreased from 120 days to 30 to now 7 days.  The reviews are obviously in and the product is junk so they are not standing behind their own product.</li>
            <li> It works as described but will take a few months before I can judge the long tern benefits</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from the manufacturer in Dec. 2013. Absolutely no results after 118 treatments, 41-42 weeks, using 2x week. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product as it did nothing at all to help with my hair loss. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I would like to give half a star or no star if I could. I have been using this thing religiously for a year, and so far not only has it not stimulated growth but it has failed to improve hair loss. In the beginning it also caused an increase in shed. So much so that it was frightening! Theradome people said to continue using it. Big let down!  Has done nothing except make my wallet short a few hundred dollars!</li>
            <li> This product is a fantastic development in the hair loss treatment market. I have been using this product for a month and have made significant hair gains. I am a 45 yo African American male, who had some recession in the frontal hair line and was developing a bald spot in the center of the top of my head. I will say that you will have to use the laser as part of a multi pronged approach. I also use lipogaine/minoxidil 5%,biotin 5000 daily, and 4 HLCC products (Max Growth Therapy, DHT Inhibiting Hair Nutrition Vitamins, Biotherapy Shampoo, and Scalp Therapy). My barber was impressed with the results as my frontal hairline is coming back, and the bald spot is gone. Theradome is the major piece to the hair restoration puzzle. My hair is thicker and softer than ever. If you are in the early stages of male pattern balding and want to save your hair, make the investment. Most things worth having aren&#x27;t cheap or easy to accomplish. It takes a time and money commitment. But I personally wasn&#x27;t ready to go the route of The Rock and Vin Diesel.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Theradome on the 2nd Feb and only received it on the 16th Feb 2015.... that&#x27;s a pretty long wait??&lt;br /&gt;Anyway i have tried it according to instruction and hope it works well.... Let&#x27;s see after 60 days if there is&lt;br /&gt;a change on my scalp??? If not i will have to take the offer of money back guarantee if this item does not work?&lt;br /&gt;From what i have seen and the technology that is put in to invent this Theradome i hope it will solve my scalp&lt;br /&gt;and hair loss problem and give me a full grown hair on my bald spot and i will surely recommend it to many friends&lt;br /&gt;and customer who experience the same problem or if not worse. The item has a two years warranty right?? I find it&lt;br /&gt;user friendly and each time after i finish my treatment i will charge according to instruction.... so again i wish&lt;br /&gt;and hope the Theradome will work and give me back my confidence with full grown and healthy hair?? Thanks</li>
            <li> I have lost almost half my hair over the past 10 years with severe crown and hairline thinning and changes.  Shower drain was always covered with hair lost during shampooing.  I have used every product on the market and continued loosing hair while feeling drpressed after each shampoo.  My husband has receded terribly and thinned so we decided to invest in the Theradome.  We have been using it over 2 months every 24-48 hours, mostly, as directed.  We took photos of our most thin sections and we are amazed at the hair growth we have plus the small amount of hair loss during shampooing and combing hair.  I could not walk without feeling hair fall onto my shoulders and now very few hairs fall.  My hair stylist has noticed as have friends.  We also use a known hair growth shampoo to keep follicles cleaned of sweat and build-up but adding Theradome has given us visible results.  We are happy and will continue using our Theradome.  We keep it charged and inside its bag and carrier at all times when not in use.  Best investment we made this year!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product and used it for about 8 months, skeptically, even though i was considered an ideal candidate. the more i read into it the more i started to realize this is a very well constructed scam product. i read up about Tamim Hamid (one of the founders of this product) and began to ask around within friends in cali, and the extent of my research led me to a secretary that worked for a Dr that preformed hair transplants for celebrities and people of high profile. we met up and said she no longer works at the place, she couldnt give me the name but a simple online search got me her cv and name of the clinic! anyway.. she admitted to taking tamim hamids phone call personally to reserve his appointment for something like 3000 grafts. this is when i decided to chuck my theradome away, he claimed to have had all his his grow back from his own product, wherein reality he simply had a hair transplant and benefited from peoples wish to have theirs grow back too. its extremely unfortunate, i do hope this goes public one day and that people at least get their money back.. some other users have submitted their stories, and have pointed out the fake reviews about how good the product is, when you read the positive reviews its quite easy to tell that theyre fake, or endorsed by theradome itself. as for the secretary, i am putting her in touch with some magazines and news papers that will offer her money for her story, all she is worried about now is getting in trouble as shes not meant to speak out about customers. spread the word if you like.</li>
            <li> well i didn&#x27;t work had it for almost 1 year</li>
            <li> I only had the helmet for about a month and it seems to be working good. The only issue at this time would be the price. It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
