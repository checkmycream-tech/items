            <li>Very comfortable to wear with a shoe on.</li>
            <li>this has solved the problem and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This stays in place much better</li>
            <li>I would need a combination of the better features of both.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the return policy.</li>
            <li>It said in the product description fits most.</li>
            <li>sure.</li>
            <li>Product is okay.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable problem solvers!</li>
            <li>But is better with it than without.</li>
            <li>of course better than nothing</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need the two,toes wrapped,...mostly looking for more cushion.</li>
            <li>I put it on most days</li>
            <li>Going to order some more</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>Better material would make this a much better product.</li>
            <li>I wear them periodically which is fine because in the summer i mostly wear sandals.  </li>
            <li>Weâ€™re ordered many more Profoot tapes so that we always have clean ones on hand.  </li>
            <li>Buddy is more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to put on and take off, and are reusable.  </li>
            <li>They are working fine for me.</li>
            <li>It wears well and washes easily and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>This product may work fine for someone else, but it was too moist and kept my toe from healing</li>
            <li>This product really works effectively to keep toes separated comfortably.</li>
            <li>Not so comfortable for me in between my toes where the spacer hits my foot.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>There is some nice contouring on the material that goes between the toes that conforms well to the shape of the toes and does help them separate without a lot of bulkiness or forcing, so it is very comforting.  </li>
            <li>These feel fantastic yet for longer term wear that would provide enduring relief</li>
            <li>they are fairly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>yet it was comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>The spacers are extremely comfortable and you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing them.  </li>
            <li>This works great unless you have fractured your second toe as I did.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not quite as comfortable as the first one I sent for, but still makes foot more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They do stay on without any problem and the thinness of the band around the smaller toe is good; however the band around the outer toe is more exposed to friction and pressure, so does wear away quickly.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the most comfortable and they seem to be doing a better job.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the original Toe Buddy.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the Toe Buddy from my podiatrist.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable and help achy toes.  </li>
            <li>item is very helpful and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Service good, product somewhat helpful for short periods.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>and I quickly could see a change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and with care they&#x27;all last a while.</li>
            <li>like them--they are comfortable, but they get stretched out easily and can tear easily.</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable and really helps.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit very well.  </li>
            <li>Really make a difference, what a relief to be pain free.  </li>
            <li>These are comfortable enough to wear around the clock through any activity but cannot withstand that amount of wear for more than a day or so.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and buying</li>
            <li>Comfortable &amp; can stretch enough for more than one toe.  </li>
            <li>but it still worth wearing.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than other types I&#x27;ve tried so am pleased with it - probably would recommend it for others</li>
            <li>They are comfortable especially if my shoes fit well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable when worn inside shoes and it helps my crooked toes.</li>
            <li>Very comforting!  </li>
            <li>First one was a gel like this one</li>
            <li>It is a cheap piece of soft plastic.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more though as solves the problem</li>
            <li>OK on the big toe</li>
            <li>since I wear flip-flops a lot, I have ordered 2 more sets, just to have on hand to keep in my cars and golf bag, when I have to wear regular shoes.</li>
            <li>soft, comfortable, washable.  </li>
            <li>Super soft &amp; can&#x27;t feel them while wearing shoes.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly and painlessly</li>
            <li>A bit too large for me</li>
            <li>They are way to large for my toes.</li>
            <li>I really like this toe buddy.  </li>
            <li>Work better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Wish the price was lower because there really isn&#x27;t my h to it.</li>
            <li>It works very well in her shoe.  </li>
            <li>This product makes it possible for me to keep doing things I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I like these because they don&#x27;t bind and restrict as much as the toe tapes.</li>
            <li>But I wish they didn&#x27;t stretch so much</li>
            <li>Great idea, but perhaps poor execution.</li>
            <li>but it does not add much support if you want to shift your toes a bit.</li>
            <li>It had enough structure to secure the crossed over toe in place and</li>
            <li>I like them so much and,</li>
            <li>For my grandson really helps</li>
            <li>Great idea, but not great in reality.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I have used other  products that were much better.  </li>
            <li>These work much better than any other toe spreaders that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s no material on the underside and outside of the big toe and the material is thicker, those are wearing better, while the shaping and reduced thickness on material between the toes on the Toe</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like the toe buddy.</li>
            <li>My second toe has crawled upon the top of my big toe ever since foot surgery in 1979.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more rigidity.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, but the middle piece could be a little bigger to separate more efficiently.</li>
            <li>However, on the other foot it is perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li>and it is like a giant piece of calamari that didn&#x27;t even fit my husband&#x27;s big feet and toes.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and silky product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite understand it because the silicone is very soft and pliable,  </li>
            <li>This toe spacer is easy to put on but takes a little practice putting a sock over.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective they will be overall.</li>
            <li>Ok but hard to put shoes over this</li>
            <li>Great little product; wish I had them for the past 5 years!  </li>
            <li>When I ordered it from amazon, it said it will take about a month to receive since it comes directly from China,</li>
            <li>I wore it for several days straight, day and night, and the spongy material started to create rash on both toes and remove layers of skin.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li>It even arrived early.</li>
            <li>My wife has developed arthritis in her feet and toes and this helps keep them &#x27;in place&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it will not sit straight on 2nd toe.  </li>
            <li>The second seemed to work and was comfortable in the beginning, but now I have a massive blister on my second toe.  </li>
            <li>the softness makes it nicer to wear and offers cushioning</li>
            <li>I own correct toes, but not all of my shoes are wide enough for me to were them, so I got these to wear on with not so wide shoes.</li>
            <li>The only product that did work is the Profoot Toe Straight.  </li>
            <li>helps eliminate friction between the second toe and my footware while providing separation between the first and second toes.</li>
            <li>While the toe buddy separates first and second toes, it does not align the second toe with the others, which limits its usefulness.</li>
            <li>It fit my big toe well but was to big, and it constantly slipped off my second toe.  </li>
            <li>I only am giving these three stars because they do work and separate the toes, but I can only wear them 4-5 hours before they start constricting my large toe.  </li>
            <li>A little big, but comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>well I was surprised to see it only took two weeks.</li>
            <li>Not firm enough to keep toes separated.</li>
            <li>works pretty well but does tend to work its way down and doesn&#x27;t hold the toe off the other one for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>The gel is soft and flexible which is good and bad b/c</li>
            <li>My husbandâ€™s second toe has completely crossed over his big toe.  </li>

            <li> A bit too large for me</li>
            <li> They are way to large for my toes.</li>
            <li> I really like this toe buddy.  </li>
            <li> Work better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Wish the price was lower because there really isn&#x27;t my h to it.</li>
            <li> It works very well in her shoe.  </li>
            <li> This product makes it possible for me to keep doing things I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I like these because they don&#x27;t bind and restrict as much as the toe tapes.</li>
            <li> But I wish they didn&#x27;t stretch so much</li>
            <li> Great idea, but perhaps poor execution.</li>
            <li> but it does not add much support if you want to shift your toes a bit.</li>
            <li> It had enough structure to secure the crossed over toe in place and</li>
            <li> I like them so much and,</li>
            <li> For my grandson really helps</li>
            <li> Great idea, but not great in reality.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I have used other  products that were much better.  </li>
            <li> These work much better than any other toe spreaders that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s no material on the underside and outside of the big toe and the material is thicker, those are wearing better, while the shaping and reduced thickness on material between the toes on the Toe</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like the toe buddy.</li>
            <li> My second toe has crawled upon the top of my big toe ever since foot surgery in 1979.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more rigidity.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, but the middle piece could be a little bigger to separate more efficiently.</li>
            <li> However, on the other foot it is perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li> and it is like a giant piece of calamari that didn&#x27;t even fit my husband&#x27;s big feet and toes.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and silky product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand it because the silicone is very soft and pliable,  </li>
            <li> This toe spacer is easy to put on but takes a little practice putting a sock over.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective they will be overall.</li>
            <li> Ok but hard to put shoes over this</li>
            <li> Great little product; wish I had them for the past 5 years!  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it from amazon, it said it will take about a month to receive since it comes directly from China,</li>
            <li> I wore it for several days straight, day and night, and the spongy material started to create rash on both toes and remove layers of skin.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> It even arrived early.</li>
            <li> My wife has developed arthritis in her feet and toes and this helps keep them &#x27;in place&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but it will not sit straight on 2nd toe.  </li>
            <li> The second seemed to work and was comfortable in the beginning, but now I have a massive blister on my second toe.  </li>
            <li> the softness makes it nicer to wear and offers cushioning</li>
            <li> I own correct toes, but not all of my shoes are wide enough for me to were them, so I got these to wear on with not so wide shoes.</li>
            <li> The only product that did work is the Profoot Toe Straight.  </li>
            <li> helps eliminate friction between the second toe and my footware while providing separation between the first and second toes.</li>
            <li> While the toe buddy separates first and second toes, it does not align the second toe with the others, which limits its usefulness.</li>
            <li> It fit my big toe well but was to big, and it constantly slipped off my second toe.  </li>
            <li> I only am giving these three stars because they do work and separate the toes, but I can only wear them 4-5 hours before they start constricting my large toe.  </li>
            <li> A little big, but comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> well I was surprised to see it only took two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not firm enough to keep toes separated.</li>
            <li> works pretty well but does tend to work its way down and doesn&#x27;t hold the toe off the other one for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> The gel is soft and flexible which is good and bad b/c</li>
            <li> My husbandâ€™s second toe has completely crossed over his big toe.  </li>
            <li> Visco-Gel toe buddy was not effective as the right foot triple toe straightener.</li>
            <li> Its not too bad but its important to make sure that it stays flat under the sock or it can be pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My only reservation is how long they will last.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much I will wear them in the winter with shoes and socks.</li>
            <li> so the third toe could get a little room but its too soft to do that</li>
            <li> , it kept slipping out of my foot especially at night, it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time</li>
            <li> The strap for the small toe is on same plane as the large one which puts it on the joint of small toe plus the corners of the separator are not properly rounded, which hurts after a few hours, so I continue to use my old strapless well rounded separator.</li>
            <li> My second toe has a a little bunion and it is bending at a faster rate than the big toe</li>
            <li> and it helps to cushion the big toe due to bursitis caused by the bunion.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other people, everyone&#x27;s toes are different I guess.</li>
            <li> Stopped wearing them, apply A &amp; D Ointment between the toes at night and so far no more problem.</li>
            <li> Loose rubber piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loose after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> When I stretched it to my other toes it hurt.  </li>
            <li> My husband has trouble getting down to put anything on his feet and winding the athletic tape in a loop around the crooked toe and then binding that toe to the next toe was too much effort and often not successful.  </li>
            <li> and too close is very annoying, causes chafing , these work great.</li>
            <li> The product was not as expected.  </li>
            <li> It did not fit properly, and I will not order again.  </li>
            <li> for me the space between should be longer it does not really work well for me</li>
            <li> The toe loops kept sliding off because they were too wide for my toes.</li>
            <li> They almost do the job that they were intended for, but they stretch to much and are poorly made, so think twice before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Other than this</li>
            <li> It is a little bit too loose and often slides off</li>
            <li> The first kept folding in half on my big toe and was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> it says a 2 pack which is not right.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 6 different brands of toe separators.  </li>
            <li> Its not worth my time returning the product.</li>
            <li> This one did not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;It was not very comfortable either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have large toes and wear a women size 9 shoe, but after a few hours, they become so uncomfortable I have to take them off.  </li>
            <li> I have much less pain</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They did not fit me.</li>
            <li> I do not enjoy wearing this item.  </li>
            <li> she wears it everyday</li>
            <li> Maybe I have small toes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if my toes are too small, or this is just a faulty product.  </li>
            <li> Like hardly even there, but help with my toe spread!</li>
            <li> It is so thin and flimsy that I couldn&#x27;t put socks over it because it would rub up.</li>
            <li> but it had poor design</li>
            <li> Then the others looked durable but they were too hard to put on and too painful to wear.  </li>
            <li> but it was uncomfortable and would move around in my shoe.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible bunions so short of surgery</li>
            <li> The failed products are:  Pedifix Hammer Toe Cushion,</li>
            <li> At that point, the Profoot became uncomfortable to wear and he&#x27;s abandoned it.</li>
            <li> It was too stretchy and didn&#x27;t align the toes  sorry to say!</li>
            <li> Sadly a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed in this Visco-Gel Toe Buddy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this toe buddy.  I was using the business splint but it was uncomfortable and would move around in my shoe.  This stays in place much better and I am not inconvenienced by feeling it on my toe.</li>
            <li> Work better than I expected.</li>
            <li> These did not prevent my toes from overlapping.</li>
            <li> like them--they are comfortable, but they get stretched out easily and can tear easily.</li>
            <li> Not so comfortable for me in between my toes where the spacer hits my foot.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product as a toe separator.  It is comfortable and the price is right.  When I ordered it from amazon, it said it will take about a month to receive since it comes directly from China, well I was surprised to see it only took two weeks. Great service. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a spacer. Comfortable. Affordable. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> There is some nice contouring on the material that goes between the toes that conforms well to the shape of the toes and does help them separate without a lot of bulkiness or forcing, so it is very comforting.  They do stay on without any problem and the thinness of the band around the smaller toe is good; however the band around the outer toe is more exposed to friction and pressure, so does wear away quickly.  These are comfortable enough to wear around the clock through any activity but cannot withstand that amount of wear for more than a day or so.  I am also trying the Cerko Gel Toe Separators that have the metatarsal gel band.  Since there&#x27;s no material on the underside and outside of the big toe and the material is thicker, those are wearing better, while the shaping and reduced thickness on material between the toes on the Toe Buddy is more comfortable.  These feel fantastic yet for longer term wear that would provide enduring relief I would need a combination of the better features of both.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. It is so thin and flimsy that I couldn&#x27;t put socks over it because it would rub up. I needed it to keep my toes separated and it could not do that.</li>
            <li> I liked these and I already lost my pair.</li>
            <li> This is great handling two issues with one appliance . . . helps eliminate friction between the second toe and my footware while providing separation between the first and second toes.</li>
            <li> Since having foot surgery, these help keep them separated and toe wraps keep them in place.</li>
            <li> It works! But take it off at night or in swimming. I wore it for several days straight, day and night, and the spongy material started to create rash on both toes and remove layers of skin. Stopped wearing them, apply A &amp; D Ointment between the toes at night and so far no more problem. Will use the Toe Buddy when pain recurs but be smarter about it. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> This does not separate overlapping toes.</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s very comfortable when worn inside shoes and it helps my crooked toes.</li>
            <li> Ok but hard to put shoes over this</li>
            <li> It is awesome saved me from toe surgery.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for me</li>
            <li> These work well to keep toes in line</li>
            <li> Very soft and silky product.  A bit too large for me but I use them.  Super comfortable and help achy toes.  These came in one week from China.  Great little product; wish I had them for the past 5 years!  Very comforting!  Well worth the money, and buying though Amazon makes it easy and reliable!</li>
            <li> I have been through several toe separators.  First one was a gel like this one but it had poor design, it kept slipping out of my foot especially at night, it didn&#x27;t last long.  Then the others looked durable but they were too hard to put on and too painful to wear.  This one solve all those issues.  Easy to put on and take off.  Very comfortable, I can even wear them with socks and shoes.  My only reservation is how long they will last.  I have been wearing them day and night for a wee now.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 6 different brands of toe separators.  These are by far the most comfortable and they seem to be doing a better job.</li>
            <li> Works well but has tendency to roll or twist even putting on hosiery.</li>
            <li> It does provide space in between but its not sturdy enough</li>
            <li> Sturdy, easy-to-put-on, and effective. A longer middle piece for separation nearer ends of toes would be a welcome improvement.</li>
            <li> It was too stretchy and didn&#x27;t align the toes  sorry to say!</li>
            <li> While the toe buddy separates first and second toes, it does not align the second toe with the others, which limits its usefulness.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than other types I&#x27;ve tried so am pleased with it - probably would recommend it for others</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the return policy. They are way to large for my toes. It said in the product description fits most. They did not fit me. So I&#x27;m out $14.99</li>
            <li> It helps my pain from the toe overlapping. I will order again fir sure. Wish the price was lower because there really isn&#x27;t my h to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother.  It works very well in her shoe.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> This product is a joke! It is a cheap piece of soft plastic. A rubber band could do the job better!</li>
            <li> These are easy to put on and take off, and are reusable.  They not only protect my hammertoe joint from rubbing, but also have the separator between the toes.  It&#x27;s not meant to straighten the hammertoe, but does keep them in place.  Good value, and easy to use over again.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.  They took forever to get here from China and it is like a giant piece of calamari that didn&#x27;t even fit my husband&#x27;s big feet and toes.  Sadly a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I only am giving these three stars because they do work and separate the toes, but I can only wear them 4-5 hours before they start constricting my large toe.  I don&#x27;t have large toes and wear a women size 9 shoe, but after a few hours, they become so uncomfortable I have to take them off.  I don&#x27;t quite understand it because the silicone is very soft and pliable,  Also at times I find they fold up and make a bump which increases the pressure.  I wear them periodically which is fine because in the summer i mostly wear sandals.  Not sure how much I will wear them in the winter with shoes and socks.</li>
            <li> These feel terrific. Like hardly even there, but help with my toe spread!</li>
            <li> I have used other  products that were much better.  This one did not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;It was not very comfortable either.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Bought several times.</li>
            <li> Product is okay.  One doesn&#x27;t like to have to wear something like this but it does help.</li>
            <li> I received the Visco-GEL Toe Buddy promptly.  It even arrived early. The product was not as expected.  It was entirely to big. It fit my big toe well but was to big, and it constantly slipped off my second toe.  When I stretched it to my other toes it hurt.  Maybe I have small toes.  It did not fit properly, and I will not order again.  Its not worth my time returning the product.</li>
            <li> Works alright and durable.  When wearing shoes, remember there is extra pressure on a bunion if you should have one.</li>
            <li> These work great  except don&#x27;t last long..maybe 3 or 4 weeks.  Will definitely buy more though as solves the problem</li>
            <li> Comfortable problem solvers! Works great inside hiking boots,  tennis shoes and wading boots. This product makes it possible for me to keep doing things I enjoy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have overlapping toes and bunions on the same foot.  works pretty well but does tend to work its way down and doesn&#x27;t hold the toe off the other one for the whole day.  But is better with it than without.</li>
            <li> I like these because they don&#x27;t bind and restrict as much as the toe tapes. But I wish they didn&#x27;t stretch so much</li>
            <li> for me the space between should be longer it does not really work well for me&lt;br /&gt;but of course better than nothing</li>
            <li> I have tried several toe separators which didn&#x27;t work.  This Visco-GEL Toe Buddy is perfect and I now can walk without pain.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to believe that such a simple thing can work so well.  It also washes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FGR</li>
            <li> Excellent for night time use.</li>
            <li> It did not work no tension to help my moms hammer toe. Loose rubber piece of junk. No value what so ever. Do not buy need to be re designed.</li>
            <li> For my situation, it did not work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like the toe buddy. They were sticky and lost their shape. The idea was good, but made from another material.</li>
            <li> These spacers work well for my bunion problem.  They are comfortable especially if my shoes fit well.  I&#x27;m very pleased and with care they&#x27;all last a while.</li>
            <li> This broke after wearing it only during the day after 2 weeks.....wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  There is actually only 1 in the pack as well..it says a 2 pack which is not right.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toe separator I have found. It is so comfortable and really helps.</li>
            <li> This spacer stays in place and protects toes from rubbing.  I am very pleased with it and will order more.</li>
            <li> they help with her hammer toe</li>
            <li> Product works great.  If needed would buy it again. Would advise others to buy it. Thank you for your product.</li>
            <li> My second toe has crawled upon the top of my big toe ever since foot surgery in 1979.  This is the only thing that has worked for me to hold it in place next to the big toe, and it also provides a gel cushion on the second toe to prevent it from rubbing against my sock when I walk.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the two,toes wrapped,...mostly looking for more cushion.</li>
            <li> My wife has developed arthritis in her feet and toes and this helps keep them &#x27;in place&#x27;. Not for open toe shoes of course.</li>
            <li> Not quite as comfortable as the first one I sent for, but still makes foot more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit very well.  OK on the big toe but it will not sit straight on 2nd toe.  Other than this they are fairly comfortable.  Not sure how effective they will be overall.</li>
            <li> Not firm enough to keep toes separated. Would prefer a firmer or larger piece to keep and hold the toes apart.</li>
            <li> Stsys in place good.Nice size.</li>
            <li> Generic, smaller, not PediFlex brand</li>
            <li> I have terrible bunions so short of surgery only say the product gave some needed relief.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Comfortable &amp; can stretch enough for more than one toe.  Super soft &amp; can&#x27;t feel them while wearing shoes.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. The first kept folding in half on my big toe and was very uncomfortable.  The second seemed to work and was comfortable in the beginning, but now I have a massive blister on my second toe.  Don&#x27;t know if my toes are too small, or this is just a faulty product.  Great idea, but perhaps poor execution.</li>
            <li> This toe spacer is easy to put on but takes a little practice putting a sock over. Its not too bad but its important to make sure that it stays flat under the sock or it can be pretty uncomfortable. The gel is soft and flexible which is good and bad b/c the softness makes it nicer to wear and offers cushioning but it does not add much support if you want to shift your toes a bit. My second toe has a a little bunion and it is bending at a faster rate than the big toe so I was hoping that this would help pull the second toe back into position so the third toe could get a little room but its too soft to do that but it still worth wearing. I put it on most days b/c it does shift the second toe over a tiny bit and it helps to cushion the big toe due to bursitis caused by the bunion.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it slips and cuts into the toe.</li>
            <li> these are great!!!! Really make a difference, what a relief to be pain free.  Going to order some more</li>
            <li> Works great for bunion toes .Overlapping and too close is very annoying, causes chafing , these work great.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize the strain on your toes until you get them back in alignment. These work well for me. I own correct toes, but not all of my shoes are wide enough for me to were them, so I got these to wear on with not so wide shoes. They are working fine for me. My feet feel so good with the pressue off that I never realized I had.</li>
            <li> These work much better than any other toe spreaders that I have ever purchased. They do not twist and they stay in place. They do rub on my toes so I only gave 4 stars for now</li>
            <li> Service good, product somewhat helpful for short periods.</li>
            <li> Beware! This is NOT the original Toe Buddy. This is a flimsy copy, too big for any toes.</li>
            <li> They work great..... I was looking for just 2 each but I got 4 each which was a surprise. Makes a great  bargin.</li>
            <li> thanx, they came very quickly and I plan to wear them today!</li>
            <li> I do not enjoy wearing this item.  It is a very good idea.</li>
            <li> My husbandâ€™s second toe has completely crossed over his big toe.  We tried many products and all but one failed to straighten the crooked toe because there was not enough structure or because they cut off circulation.  The failed products are:  Pedifix Hammer Toe Cushion, Visco Gel Stay Put Toe Spacer, Visco Gel Toe Buddy and Cerkos Gel Toe Separator.  The only product that did work is the Profoot Toe Straight.  It had enough structure to secure the crossed over toe in place and yet it was comfortable to wear.  One reviewer commented that athletic tape worked just as well but it didnâ€™t work well for my husband.  My husband has trouble getting down to put anything on his feet and winding the athletic tape in a loop around the crooked toe and then binding that toe to the next toe was too much effort and often not successful.  Weâ€™re ordered many more Profoot tapes so that we always have clean ones on hand.  We havenâ€™t yet washed the used ones but people said each one lasts several months.  Update 9/15:  The Profoot stopped working for my husband when his crossed over toe became too deformed.  At that point, the Profoot became uncomfortable to wear and he&#x27;s abandoned it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have found that helps keep toes apart.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  The one size fits all is a misnomer. The toe loops kept sliding off because they were too wide for my toes.</li>
            <li> The spacers are extremely comfortable and you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing them.  I like them so much and, since I wear flip-flops a lot, I have ordered 2 more sets, just to have on hand to keep in my cars and golf bag, when I have to wear regular shoes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quickly and painlessly this toe buddy helped realign my toes. I have much less pain and I quickly could see a change. It wears well and washes easily and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this item for quite awhile. So glad I ordered them. A little big, but comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Great for your toes, keeps a space between them.</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about - I think I need to see a Dr. instead!</li>
            <li> For my grandson really helps</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect something like this to solve already existing toe problems that may be beyond the help of this device.</li>
            <li> Too flexible..not adjustable. ..too big  for my toes.  Great idea, but not great in reality.</li>
            <li> Visco-Gel toe buddy was not effective as the right foot triple toe straightener.</li>
            <li> They almost do the job that they were intended for, but they stretch to much and are poorly made, so think twice before buying this product. Better material would make this a much better product.</li>
            <li> This works great unless you have fractured your second toe as I did.  However, on the other foot it is perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> They seem to be doing what they are supposed to do. Very comfortable to wear with a shoe on.</li>
            <li> item is very helpful and very comfortable. I has helped my wife and provide a welcome relief. Have purchased a second set</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed in this Visco-Gel Toe Buddy.  It is a little bit too loose and often slides off</li>
            <li> my mom was complaining about her toes trying to cross.  this has solved the problem and is very comfortable.  she wears it everyday</li>
            <li> Person purchased for loves them.</li>
            <li> This product may work fine for someone else, but it was too moist and kept my toe from healing</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; excellent service !! 5 STARS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loose after using it for a while. It didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the Toe Buddy from my podiatrist. This product really works effectively to keep toes separated comfortably. Until I decide it is time for surgery, I will keep using the Toe Buddy.</li>
            <li> It works. Feels flimsy but does the trick!  I was expecting a little more rigidity.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe it works for other people, everyone&#x27;s toes are different I guess.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, but the middle piece could be a little bigger to separate more efficiently.</li>
            <li> soft, comfortable, washable.  wear with or without shoes; it will do the job.</li>
            <li> For my part the design needs work. The strap for the small toe is on same plane as the large one which puts it on the joint of small toe plus the corners of the separator are not properly rounded, which hurts after a few hours, so I continue to use my old strapless well rounded separator.</li>
            <li> best thing I have found to keep my toes apart!</li>
