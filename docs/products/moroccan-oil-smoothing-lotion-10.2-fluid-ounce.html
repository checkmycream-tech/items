            <li>I normally have very fine/oily roots</li>
            <li>I assumed that the product would be brand new, however, after using it just once, I noticed an offensive odor while blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice but subtle sent.</li>
            <li>Like to use this product when I blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t like the product, as it made my hair feel dry, which is unusual for Moroccanoil products, so I will not be purchasing again.</li>

            <li> My hair is curly, thin and with fine highlights.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it for anyone with curly or  wavy hair that needs a little taming.</li>
            <li> This product is tricky because if you use too much it make hair too hard</li>
            <li> dry ends hair....</li>
            <li> Like I said apply it to damp, not soaking wet nor bone dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product left my daughters hair a mess.</li>
            <li> I expected to feel / see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive my order, since I already knew what it would do for my hair because of the fact that my hair dresser uses it on my hair on a regular basis.....</li>
            <li> This does not make my hair smooth! :(</li>
            <li> It controls you hair without weighing it down or making it greasy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I apply it everyday on dry hair just before straightening it.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Not a good feeling or scent left in my hair....</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, coarse and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Use your blow dryer &amp; a round brush.</li>
            <li> and if you like heavily perfumed products you will like this product.</li>
            <li> Work in small sections, and wrap the hair around the hair as your applying heat.</li>
            <li> Sorry that I didn&#x27;t just purchase it through my hairdresser at the regular price!</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount of the smoothing lotion or your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find, but works well before styling.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because  now , it&#x27;s simply taking up space in my cabinet ...</li>
            <li> No more frizz...not even in the rain!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on September 15 and started using it as soon as I received it, however, I just had to stop because of the unpleasant odor and texture of my hair.....</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me that it&#x27;s probably a bad batch of the product or it could have been tampered with...</li>

            <li> Love this smoothing lotion. No matter what type of hair you have this is a great smoothing lotion. I use about a dime sized amount of the product, and apply it to damp hair. Like I said apply it to damp, not soaking wet nor bone dry hair. Like to use this product when I blow dry my hair straight. It&#x27;s also great to use if you use a flat iron. After applying the lotion to your hair make sure to come it through from roots to end. Use your blow dryer &amp; a round brush.

            <li> Bought this for a friend and she told me it doesn&#x27;t really do much for her hair. And that it actually makes her hair a bit puffier, but softer. I&#x27;m sure it would work fine on my hair though.I probably would love this for myself.</li>

            <li> Works well and if you like heavily perfumed products you will like this product. Mine is going in the trash however because I find the odor to be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This product does work really good for frizzy, curly hair. I love this brand line. I perfer the hydrating cream better. Just use a small amount of the smoothing lotion or your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Very timely, product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only smells amazing, but it makes your hair so soft! I can&#x27;t stop touching it!! I normally have very fine/oily roots dry ends hair....This does a great job at smoothing the ends too, but use sparingly.</li>
            <li> This product give hair a lovely shine and softness.</li>
            <li> The packaging and delivery of this item was first class and I have no complaints with the company that supplied it.  However, I didn&#x27;t like the product, as it made my hair feel dry, which is unusual for Moroccanoil products, so I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Great price for a great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> works well like all their products. would highly recommend it for anyone with curly or  wavy hair that needs a little taming.</li>
