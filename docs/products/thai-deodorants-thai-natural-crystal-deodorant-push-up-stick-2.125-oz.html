            <li>We have ordered lots of these and they work great.  </li>
            <li>and it works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no scent to the product, which is great, and it takes care of odor and perspiration.  </li>
            <li>This product is great although you have to get used to the sensation that you&#x27;re not putting on ANY deodorant because there is no slick/oily feel to it.</li>
            <li>Great promise, but just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>Worked very effectively for me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for killing underarm odor!</li>
            <li>For those of you who do not develop body odor, great, good for you.</li>
            <li>Compact &amp; effective!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li>Good question.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s good for the health because no chemicals at all.</li>
            <li>Easily superior to roll-ons and sticks.</li>
            <li>so I perspire a good bit.</li>
            <li>works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful at keeping me stench free for over 24 hours if I&#x27;m stationary or leisurely walking.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Works so good</li>
            <li>That said, I loved my RightGuard.</li>
            <li>This is good for  people who have had breast cancer or breast cancer in the family.</li>
            <li>A good product, though.</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the product works great for blocking any stench, though if you&#x27;re into skipping showers you probably won&#x27;t want to use it more than one day in a row.</li>
            <li>He has been very pleased</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I need to order some more!</li>
            <li>but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use the clinical strength deodorant on her tender underams but needed something effective.  </li>
            <li>Buy the pop up kind.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t cause under-arm stains on your clothing.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Thai spray, but the stone is nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li>still this product would wear out after a couple of hours, i guess it would be nice to re-apply, but i don&#x27;t have time to take off my shirt or dress to always reapply it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 10 years and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>If you sweat easily and work up a stink easily, good luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Going to be using this kind of product for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the most popular crystal deodorant brand for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did because this is amazing.</li>
            <li>And most amazingly, this stuff lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>Not being astute and just applying it, I wondered why it didnt work so well.  </li>
            <li>One of the most effective and unobtrusive deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Jungleman Naturals, and found it to be the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li>This new stone with the handy applicator is perfect and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Works great until the first time you drop it.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact our products are so safe they are used in the purification of water in some countries.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I have been very happy with it&#x27;s ability to keep my armpits smelling neutral all day.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out, and as my title says, the Thai stick works even better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>I was a teenager, many deodorants did not seem to work for me until I started using Degree for women.  </li>
            <li>I tried Arid, Mitchum, and a roll-on product (can&#x27;t remember the name) that I found at Whole Foods which supposedly was supposed to be great, but nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It works and It works best than the regular aluminum ones.</li>
            <li>Recommend applying liberally to the entire underarm area for best results.</li>
            <li>and they both work fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I really love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>and i will probably need to reapply more during the summer,</li>
            <li>They say never say never, but I am sure of this one thing.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel size option.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>At most, I&#x27;ll reapply once as the day goes on, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it works, its like Jipsey magic, works all day, plus im a fat guy</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found a better alternative.</li>
            <li>This sure does.</li>
            <li>Love it because 1.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>

            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>the conspiracy theorists think will kill you :)</li>
            <li>It works, no odor, healthy</li>
            <li>sure I cover all areas that won&#x27;t breathe throughout the day.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Baking soda by itself works better than this.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week to see if it got any better; it did not.</li>
            <li>I had been experiencing issues with irritation from my deodorant - tried many types.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have used this product for seven years and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I glad</li>
            <li>I like this brand more than the Crystal that can be found in Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>a better solution?</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I have been allergic to most deodorants but this one works well with no break outs.</li>
            <li>sure you use plenty of water to soak your armpits before applying and apply generously in circle motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did have a period where I sweated more, but I think my body has adjusted to not having chemical prevention there.</li>
            <li>i read all the great reviews about this product and i made sure that i applied it on my whole underarm, including part of the arms and lower part of my under arm.</li>
            <li>safe and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It is the PERFECT deodorant for men who get smelly after a limited amount of time because they sweat a lot.  </li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s most important, it does not clog the skin pores which sometimes leads to irritation and bumps.</li>
            <li>great, all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to what we have all been brainwashed to believe is the norm - rubbing poison under your arms and clogging up the body&#x27;s natural process of elimination.</li>
            <li>I have used to it for eight years with No irritation it is great for me![[ASIN:B000S83JR0 Thai Deodorants Thai Natural Crystal Deodorant Push-Up Stick 2.125 oz]]</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirants so much (you will still sweat), but that is actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Alum is good for absorbing wetness and shrinking pores.</li>
            <li>Best spent $2 ever!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that scraping your underarms with sharp edges and then applying salt to the wound is not the best thing.  </li>
            <li>For the $5 that I spent on this you could call this one of the best bargains of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important part.  </li>
            <li>well and is easy use.</li>
            <li>The deodorants break easily if you drop it on the sink or cabinet.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m please with the performance and very pleased to be using something without so many chemicals!</li>
            <li>After a full week I have to say this is just fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t put it to a true sweaty test yet, but I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>This gives it a good bit of extra lubrication and makes it go on very easily.</li>
            <li>I did not realize I was ordering the travel size, but am fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>And they are easy to travel with because they are light.  </li>
            <li>and I will be fine.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, and I have strong body odor.</li>
            <li>There is also a spray available which I&#x27;m considering trying.  </li>
            <li>so it stays smooth.</li>
            <li>You stay odor free all day, apply liberally.</li>
            <li>it gave me a rash the salt really irrates the skin so that kind of sucked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the feel of not having deodorant gooped up on my pits.</li>
            <li>It feels great not to be contaminating my body with traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li>but fortunately, this product works and appears to be the safest bet as well.</li>
            <li>The salt crystal is great though, never going back to stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>KEY POINT - using a lotion afterwards, for some reason, really is a great combination.  </li>
            <li>This smaller size is great for travelling.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective when used in combination with a dab of cologne, much moreso than any OTC deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly for 24 whole hours.</li>
            <li>After a significant bit of research and scouring the web, I found that these deodorant stones are the ticket.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I have the original and travel size too.</li>
            <li>a proper anti-perspirant, but suspect that would be most effective &amp; comfortable of all.</li>
            <li>So if the effects wear off or anything significant changes, I&#x27;ll try and update the review.</li>
            <li>Keeps the smell away, goes on clean, and does not ruin shirts.  </li>
            <li>You need to use it on clean skin.</li>
            <li>This product is odorless and goes on clean.  </li>
            <li>No odor and leaves a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have to wipe my underarms clean before reapplying for it to be</li>
            <li>Thus far I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, works great if you are careful.</li>
            <li>Just as a test, I did not apply it one day, and worked a full day.</li>
            <li>By day&#x27;s end, her underarm odor woud be full strength.  </li>
            <li>No body odor for a full day after applying.</li>
            <li>The crystal itself is more homogeneous, and much smoother feeling.</li>
            <li>I made sure I was really smelly before I used it.</li>
            <li>Be good for future use.</li>
            <li>If you eat healthily, you will be very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s totally invincible in the more extreme sweat-inducing situations (nothing is, in my experience), but for the most part it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>first great thing about the Thai Deodorant Crystal is that it lasts a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sweaty but this wears off so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The design is smarter, and even though they should be mostly the same I think this one works better.</li>
            <li>My stone came apart from the plastic shell rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I especially love that my white shirts no longer get yellow stains under the arms.</li>
            <li>Well, more than a decade after as successful kidney transplant and a return to perfect health, and having switched back to regular commercial deodorant, I read several accounts of the incredible garbage in typical products ... in truth a lot of poison.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable as one stick lasts and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li>I find that if I apply it, let it dry, and then put a lotion over it, I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, and lasts pretty much all day!</li>
            <li>This deodorant stone really works!!  </li>
            <li>probably most safe chemicals to put on the body - and it works if you are consistent and use it daily after bathing</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described and delivered promptly!  </li>
            <li>I received this product in the mail yesterday (super quick delivery) and used it for the first time right before heading out to a couple of clubs.</li>
            <li>Its smaller than I thought but works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>chlorohydrate is in cationic form, however aluminium in alum is found in anionic form, this is supposed to be the reason why in the case of alum it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>You apply it on wet armpit and good to go.</li>
            <li>I saw it while shopping online, and figured it was worth a shot to remove some chemicals from my life.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural way to deodorize my underarms.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I think I will purchasing or making my own with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li>Normal sweat stains will easily come out in the wash cycle, so it is nothing to worry about.    </li>
            <li>I have always had a body odor issue but this cleared that right up.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works fine without ever creating the putrid sweet odor that most deodorants will.</li>
            <li>This little block of mineral salts works remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>I use this as my daily deodorant (the large stick) since I am not a heavy sweater; it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really small, so great for travel, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, my 8-year old daughter has needed deodorant since she was 6 &amp; I was using Tom&#x27;s organic deodorant for her, but because of the strong lavendar smell, wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li>Make sure your underarms are clean and don&#x27;t dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>This allows the toxins out by our natural process, while keeping you socialy fit and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, and not messy at all,</li>
            <li>Sure, if all I did that day was sit in the house and play around on the computer or do homework (full time student 40yr old single mother), it was fine.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and it gets real hot here</li>
            <li>I do not have many lymph nodes left under my arm</li>
            <li>I checked out the website for this product and this is what the company has to say about those of us who are concerned about exactly what their putting into and onto their bodies;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I felt like there was no way it would work,</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you would expect.  </li>
            <li>At first, it looked as if the stick was not reducing in size but after some months of usage, you&#x27;ll notice.</li>
            <li>I love the smaller size for traveling.  </li>
            <li>But this last more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work, but it did!</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it was a) smaller and b) better container.  </li>
            <li>Haha just don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li>First off, it will take some getting use to if you sweat because this is not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>If you like scented, you can get a natural lotion with oil extracts to give a light scent.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I figured it wasn&#x27;t that hot</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this was one of the first products I bought.</li>
            <li>It does stop odors, but if this is all you are using, you would most likely need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Combined with another deodorant it seems to amplify it but other than that it can&#x27;t do nothing on its own.</li>
            <li>The thai stone is environmentally much friendlier and better for the body than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use: just wet it, swipe underarm, and then lift your arm throughout the rest of the day and evening with confidence.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found several good ones, but when I saw this product at a certain local raw vegan store, I knew it had to be good.</li>
            <li>Not good for athletes but great for desk jockeys.</li>
            <li>great all natural deodorant, I still use my Pink Sugar natural spray deodorant over it though.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, did not stain clothes like many more expensive deodorants, and I thought it worked</li>
            <li>It is amazing how it holds down order plus its safer to use.</li>
            <li>less effective than another brand i tried.  </li>
            <li>If you tend to be pretty non-stinky anyway and need just a little extra protection, I bet it would work great for you.</li>
            <li>I will not be able to use this, especially not in the subtropical climate I live in.</li>
            <li>If I am going to a wedding or job interview where I am wearing a suit and may be in the heat, I will wear a regular antiperspirant, but I suspect this product would be fine.  </li>
            <li>Overall, seems to work fine for the office, and has virtually no smell.</li>
            <li>one day, the rightGuard was feeling a little light, I was making an order on Amazon, and I needed a few bucks more to get my super saver free shipping.</li>
            <li>There have been a couple times when I still got a slight bit of odor after an intense workout, but it was very slight and aside from those couple occasions, it&#x27;s worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like this productvery much.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it requires to use it for about a week to start really working.     </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>This product really does work.  </li>
            <li>So really 0 stars for me, 5 stars for her.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>But for folks like me, you might find this to be very ineffective.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>It really really works.</li>
            <li>HaHa,</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s free off all the chemicals in regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s just salt, so</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>marginally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very generous when applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li>I try to limit chemical products as much as I can</li>
            <li>Make sure to put on while wet though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some wetness/moisture but no smell!</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>It works on odor very well</li>
            <li>Say, after the shower and getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is a hassel to have to wet it to be able to put it on.</li>
            <li>Even at the end of the day, you can hug someone or get very close and not have to worry about underarm odor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are claims that Alum crystals cannot be absorbed into the skin because of there molecular size which is just completely unproven.  </li>
            <li>Take a spray bottle and mix some Bobs Red Mill aluminium free baking soda along with lemon juice under your arms.  </li>
            <li>I work in a VERY sweaty environment and I run 40-50 miles a week...</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I might have to reapply if I do something real strenuous, but then again, I&#x27;d probably need a shower anyway.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve really put it to the test.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply when skin is wet.</li>
            <li>I was instructed to wet the top before applying so</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell whether or not it was working, either.</li>
            <li>size is pretty small, but nice for a \\&quot;trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants, and this is the ONLY ONE that does not irritate me or cause me to stink.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has it limits, but I would recommend it to someone who needs an effective deodorant when they are not physically active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salt deodorants only work to prevent odor.</li>
            <li>Recently, in an attempt to find a more natural product I bought this Thai crystal deodorant and also bought a bottle of Milk of Magnesia to test both out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out in a rash as I do with so many other chemically laden products and 2.</li>
            <li>and they are a lot better than other sticks or spray deodorants.</li>
            <li>and I smell better than I did with rightGuard, even after a full day of work, or a hard workout.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>A bit of hokey medicine, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me (maybe i just sweat and stink more than the average person?).</li>
            <li>I used to have a shower and put on a normal deodorant or antiperspirant, go to work and stank the whole office.</li>
            <li>Keeps up very well on a normal day.</li>
            <li>and this has been a nice addition to my lifestyle for the past four years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, it works MUCH BETTER than any previous deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I bought mine when I was pregnant with my son and still have quite a bit left</li>
            <li>I rarely experience smell, the only time I do is when I am doing intense exercise or manual labor.</li>
            <li>Technically, not a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; since it has no perfumes; more of a bio-inhibitor in actual use.</li>
            <li>Works as well as the main stream products.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturers cleverly omit an list ingredients on the packaging but if you do your research, you will learn of the aluminium crystal content.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been a pleasure so far, no stains and white marks, very effective and long lasting.</li>
            <li>My wife has a very sensitive nose ant it absolutely works (according to her.)</li>
            <li>All my dress shirts and t-shirts had not only yellow stains, but white crusted gunk from some of the more powerful antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would place this on the \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot; list for alternative deodorant control.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for odor.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend that you go ahead and buy a stick.</li>
            <li>If you are a heavy sweater or doing a lot of physical labor this might not be the thing for you, but for everyday light work it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I really like that this is so natural and doesn&#x27;t get anything on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Some people worry about alum containing aluminium like normal antiperspirants, in my understanding the aluminium in aluminium  </li>
            <li>The small size makes it much easier to handle without dropping, and the container itself looks much more resilient.</li>
            <li>I kind of like the absence of the potpourri smells of conventional deodorant.</li>
            <li>It is the same stuff as the Art Of Shaving and other brands, but with a more convenient form factor and MUCH lower price.</li>
            <li>With regular deodorant I m stinky right after 4 hours.</li>
            <li>You will certainly need to keep up with regular applications, likely more than once a day (and daily showers, of course) to even stand a chance of staying stink-free.</li>
            <li>I am an \\&quot;average\\&quot; deodorant/anti perspirant user I suppose who has dabbled into natural deodorants and I can honestly say this was the most useless thing I tried for me PERSONALLY.</li>
            <li>the other hand, I was using the cheap MoM I got, just rubbed a bit on my armpits twice a day</li>
            <li>And since this crystal is so cheap and so long lasting, it really saves me money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no better health wise than your regular old stick of Degree.  </li>
            <li>or you will have to get a new one because it shatters everywhere.</li>
            <li>live in the Phoenix area and am testing it during the summer, so if it works here</li>
            <li>My husband asked for a new type of deodorant as his just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks like new.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all, but it actually eats the odor.</li>
            <li>I went to Whole Foods attempting to find something natural for my 10 year old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I moved to the desert, I noticed that Degree wasn&#x27;t working all day anymore, even in the winter when it wasn&#x27;t hot outside.  </li>
            <li>Love the small size.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using such a product</li>
            <li>I cleaned the house slept went outside in high humidity, no smell and no sweat!!  </li>
            <li>I did not realize it was a small travel size, but that is okay.</li>
            <li>it keeps me fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>My first stick lasted me almost 3 years using it daily.  </li>
            <li>I have used their \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; solid for many years (did not use clear because it didn&#x27;t seem to help with perspiration), with the only problems up until recently being stains on my clothing, and the deodorant clumping in the summertime.  </li>
            <li>I decided to venture into this new world of crystal and am SO pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My old favorite was Lady&#x27;s Speedstick, but I think the Thai deodorant stone does a better job of controlling odor - and without leaving behind the yellow stains on my white shirts.</li>
            <li>I do support natural remedies and am interested in probiotic deodorants which I am going to try next.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to standard deodorant/antiperspirant which have been linked to negative health issues with long term use.  </li>
            <li>After trying this for a few days I went back to try another natural deodorant (supposedly mineral/crystal based liquid) and the difference in effectiveness was huge!  </li>
            <li>When on Dialysis, your body just cannot clear out all of the toxins.</li>
            <li>and it worked for others clearly,</li>
            <li>My father introduced me to the idea of Deodorant Crystals when I was young.  </li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant stone for only about a week now, and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>This is a natural solution that works.  </li>
            <li>(I use a natural lotion of my choice).  </li>
            <li>All natural no aluminum or parabens...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well it works</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural deodorant, this is it.</li>
            <li>Odorless and seemingly natural.</li>
            <li>it is all natural.</li>
            <li>about as much time as applying regular roll</li>
            <li>At some point the stick will part from its &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; (every one has thus far)</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that this a natural deodorant, and not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Switched onto natural products a couple of months ago</li>
            <li>In fact, I had to wash the armpit area of my tops to get the old stuff</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it won&#x27;t stop you from sweating (like anti-perspirant) and that is a good thing, unless you&#x27;re worried about sweating through clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From looking at it right now I estimate that it might last another 4 years with daily usage.  </li>
            <li>However, it does very little when I&#x27;m performing strenuous, physical activities for more than a hour.</li>
            <li>A side by side comparision shows this is EXACTLY the same product with a different brand affixed.  </li>
            <li>Molecular makeup changes upon becoming wet (you have to wet this stick to us it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>I have made multiple different recipes for homemade deodorant, and bought numerous natural ones trying to find an aluminum free deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li>Just apply vigorously with water and this will last you for a long time and will work better than every other deodorant without the aluminum</li>
            <li>It even stood up to high heat and humidity while touring in Greece and Israel last summer.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish it had little to no fragrance for health reasons, but it does smell great.</li>
            <li>After using DeoGo (look this product up) to bring them back to normal, I decided to change antiperspirant so that it wouldn&#x27;t happen again.    </li>
            <li>It gives me protection while not subjecting me to potentially harmful chemicals which are present in most other regular deodorants and antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this you will never go back to normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Even with heavy sweating, I get no bad odor.  </li>
            <li>But at least this is a completely natural product free of aluminum.</li>
            <li>I only applied it 3 times the entire night and it really masked the odor--</li>
            <li>I have only found ONE natural deodorant to work - ALVERA&#x27;s natural deodorant - aloe and almonds.</li>
            <li>I use the salt deodorant to avoid unhealthy additives in mainstream deodorants, and this brand is not only cost-effective, it is also unusually effective.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a terrific and natural deodorant !</li>
            <li>Thai was the first &#x27;non conventional&#x27; deodorant I ever used.  </li>
            <li>As I have used it only in the UK where the summer have not been much present this year, I cannot comment on how it would cope with high temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of natural products and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants before (sprays, sticks, roll-ons) and figured that this would be on the same level.  </li>
            <li>But if it works out for you as well as it has for me so far, your only regret will be not having discovered it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do need to get the stone wet and apply it liberally to the whole underarm</li>
            <li>apparently (I was warned that this might be the case)</li>
            <li>Full size is only a few cents</li>
            <li>Fast delivery with my other Amazon items.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll never go back to the white or clear deodorants.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s looking like it will last several months at the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your like me and you&#x27;ve tried all sorts of deodorants and everyone either left you an irritating rash or just didn&#x27;t work, then you will love this.  </li>
            <li>When you first put this on, it can smell a little like BO itself, but that passes once the product dries.</li>
            <li>But really, this stuff is pretty weak.</li>
            <li>the record, it&#x27;s not much safer than normal deodorant, either, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t spend my entire day with my arms straight down my sides so being this generous makes</li>
            <li>&quot; That&#x27;s an extreme example, but I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth your while and as the product may be small,  it will last for a</li>
            <li>I was using a strong \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorant but found after a while that it somehow wasn&#x27;t helping or even made me smell worse.  </li>
            <li>Just run it under hot water and rub the sharp areas with a rough rag</li>
            <li>It is a bit weird to get to a new routine of applying it wet and for more &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; than a traditional deodorant.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it works best when I run the Crystal under water before applying it to each armpit.  </li>

            <li> This product is great although you have to get used to the sensation that you&#x27;re not putting on ANY deodorant because there is no slick/oily feel to it.</li>
            <li> Great promise, but just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Worked very effectively for me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for killing underarm odor!</li>
            <li> For those of you who do not develop body odor, great, good for you.</li>
            <li> Compact &amp; effective!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> Good question.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s good for the health because no chemicals at all.</li>
            <li> Easily superior to roll-ons and sticks.</li>
            <li> so I perspire a good bit.</li>
            <li> works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful at keeping me stench free for over 24 hours if I&#x27;m stationary or leisurely walking.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Works so good</li>
            <li> That said, I loved my RightGuard.</li>
            <li> This is good for  people who have had breast cancer or breast cancer in the family.</li>
            <li> A good product, though.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the product works great for blocking any stench, though if you&#x27;re into skipping showers you probably won&#x27;t want to use it more than one day in a row.</li>
            <li> He has been very pleased</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I need to order some more!</li>
            <li> but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use the clinical strength deodorant on her tender underams but needed something effective.  </li>
            <li> Buy the pop up kind.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t cause under-arm stains on your clothing.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Thai spray, but the stone is nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li> still this product would wear out after a couple of hours, i guess it would be nice to re-apply, but i don&#x27;t have time to take off my shirt or dress to always reapply it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 10 years and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> If you sweat easily and work up a stink easily, good luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Going to be using this kind of product for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the most popular crystal deodorant brand for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did because this is amazing.</li>
            <li> And most amazingly, this stuff lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> Not being astute and just applying it, I wondered why it didnt work so well.  </li>
            <li> One of the most effective and unobtrusive deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Jungleman Naturals, and found it to be the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li> This new stone with the handy applicator is perfect and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Works great until the first time you drop it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact our products are so safe they are used in the purification of water in some countries.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I have been very happy with it&#x27;s ability to keep my armpits smelling neutral all day.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out, and as my title says, the Thai stick works even better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> I was a teenager, many deodorants did not seem to work for me until I started using Degree for women.  </li>
            <li> I tried Arid, Mitchum, and a roll-on product (can&#x27;t remember the name) that I found at Whole Foods which supposedly was supposed to be great, but nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It works and It works best than the regular aluminum ones.</li>
            <li> Recommend applying liberally to the entire underarm area for best results.</li>
            <li> and they both work fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> and i will probably need to reapply more during the summer,</li>
            <li> They say never say never, but I am sure of this one thing.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel size option.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> At most, I&#x27;ll reapply once as the day goes on, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how it works, its like Jipsey magic, works all day, plus im a fat guy</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found a better alternative.</li>
            <li> This sure does.</li>
            <li> Love it because 1.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this product is better for my skin and 2)</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> the conspiracy theorists think will kill you :)</li>
            <li> It works, no odor, healthy</li>
            <li> sure I cover all areas that won&#x27;t breathe throughout the day.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Baking soda by itself works better than this.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week to see if it got any better; it did not.</li>
            <li> I had been experiencing issues with irritation from my deodorant - tried many types.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this product for seven years and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I glad</li>
            <li> I like this brand more than the Crystal that can be found in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> a better solution?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to most deodorants but this one works well with no break outs.</li>
            <li> sure you use plenty of water to soak your armpits before applying and apply generously in circle motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did have a period where I sweated more, but I think my body has adjusted to not having chemical prevention there.</li>
            <li> i read all the great reviews about this product and i made sure that i applied it on my whole underarm, including part of the arms and lower part of my under arm.</li>
            <li> safe and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It is the PERFECT deodorant for men who get smelly after a limited amount of time because they sweat a lot.  </li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s most important, it does not clog the skin pores which sometimes leads to irritation and bumps.</li>
            <li> great, all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Great alternative to what we have all been brainwashed to believe is the norm - rubbing poison under your arms and clogging up the body&#x27;s natural process of elimination.</li>
            <li> I have used to it for eight years with No irritation it is great for me![[ASIN:B000S83JR0 Thai Deodorants Thai Natural Crystal Deodorant Push-Up Stick 2.125 oz]]</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirants so much (you will still sweat), but that is actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Alum is good for absorbing wetness and shrinking pores.</li>
            <li> Best spent $2 ever!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that scraping your underarms with sharp edges and then applying salt to the wound is not the best thing.  </li>
            <li> For the $5 that I spent on this you could call this one of the best bargains of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important part.  </li>
            <li> well and is easy use.</li>
            <li> The deodorants break easily if you drop it on the sink or cabinet.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m please with the performance and very pleased to be using something without so many chemicals!</li>
            <li> After a full week I have to say this is just fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put it to a true sweaty test yet, but I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> This gives it a good bit of extra lubrication and makes it go on very easily.</li>
            <li> I did not realize I was ordering the travel size, but am fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> And they are easy to travel with because they are light.  </li>
            <li> and I will be fine.</li>
            <li> So far, so good, and I have strong body odor.</li>
            <li> There is also a spray available which I&#x27;m considering trying.  </li>
            <li> so it stays smooth.</li>
            <li> You stay odor free all day, apply liberally.</li>
            <li> it gave me a rash the salt really irrates the skin so that kind of sucked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feel of not having deodorant gooped up on my pits.</li>
            <li> It feels great not to be contaminating my body with traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> but fortunately, this product works and appears to be the safest bet as well.</li>
            <li> The salt crystal is great though, never going back to stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> KEY POINT - using a lotion afterwards, for some reason, really is a great combination.  </li>
            <li> This smaller size is great for travelling.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective when used in combination with a dab of cologne, much moreso than any OTC deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly for 24 whole hours.</li>
            <li> After a significant bit of research and scouring the web, I found that these deodorant stones are the ticket.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have the original and travel size too.</li>
            <li> a proper anti-perspirant, but suspect that would be most effective &amp; comfortable of all.</li>
            <li> So if the effects wear off or anything significant changes, I&#x27;ll try and update the review.</li>
            <li> Keeps the smell away, goes on clean, and does not ruin shirts.  </li>
            <li> You need to use it on clean skin.</li>
            <li> This product is odorless and goes on clean.  </li>
            <li> No odor and leaves a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have to wipe my underarms clean before reapplying for it to be</li>
            <li> Thus far I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, works great if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Just as a test, I did not apply it one day, and worked a full day.</li>
            <li> By day&#x27;s end, her underarm odor woud be full strength.  </li>
            <li> No body odor for a full day after applying.</li>
            <li> The crystal itself is more homogeneous, and much smoother feeling.</li>
            <li> I made sure I was really smelly before I used it.</li>
            <li> Be good for future use.</li>
            <li> If you eat healthily, you will be very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s totally invincible in the more extreme sweat-inducing situations (nothing is, in my experience), but for the most part it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> first great thing about the Thai Deodorant Crystal is that it lasts a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sweaty but this wears off so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The design is smarter, and even though they should be mostly the same I think this one works better.</li>
            <li> My stone came apart from the plastic shell rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I especially love that my white shirts no longer get yellow stains under the arms.</li>
            <li> Well, more than a decade after as successful kidney transplant and a return to perfect health, and having switched back to regular commercial deodorant, I read several accounts of the incredible garbage in typical products ... in truth a lot of poison.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable as one stick lasts and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> I find that if I apply it, let it dry, and then put a lotion over it, I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, and lasts pretty much all day!</li>
            <li> This deodorant stone really works!!  </li>
            <li> probably most safe chemicals to put on the body - and it works if you are consistent and use it daily after bathing</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and delivered promptly!  </li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail yesterday (super quick delivery) and used it for the first time right before heading out to a couple of clubs.</li>
            <li> Its smaller than I thought but works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> chlorohydrate is in cationic form, however aluminium in alum is found in anionic form, this is supposed to be the reason why in the case of alum it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> You apply it on wet armpit and good to go.</li>
            <li> I saw it while shopping online, and figured it was worth a shot to remove some chemicals from my life.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural way to deodorize my underarms.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I think I will purchasing or making my own with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li> Normal sweat stains will easily come out in the wash cycle, so it is nothing to worry about.    </li>
            <li> I have always had a body odor issue but this cleared that right up.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works fine without ever creating the putrid sweet odor that most deodorants will.</li>
            <li> This little block of mineral salts works remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> I use this as my daily deodorant (the large stick) since I am not a heavy sweater; it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small, so great for travel, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my 8-year old daughter has needed deodorant since she was 6 &amp; I was using Tom&#x27;s organic deodorant for her, but because of the strong lavendar smell, wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li> Make sure your underarms are clean and don&#x27;t dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> This allows the toxins out by our natural process, while keeping you socialy fit and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, and not messy at all,</li>
            <li> Sure, if all I did that day was sit in the house and play around on the computer or do homework (full time student 40yr old single mother), it was fine.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and it gets real hot here</li>
            <li> I do not have many lymph nodes left under my arm</li>
            <li> I checked out the website for this product and this is what the company has to say about those of us who are concerned about exactly what their putting into and onto their bodies;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I felt like there was no way it would work,</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you would expect.  </li>
            <li> At first, it looked as if the stick was not reducing in size but after some months of usage, you&#x27;ll notice.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size for traveling.  </li>
            <li> But this last more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work, but it did!</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was a) smaller and b) better container.  </li>
            <li> Haha just don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li> First off, it will take some getting use to if you sweat because this is not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> If you like scented, you can get a natural lotion with oil extracts to give a light scent.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I figured it wasn&#x27;t that hot</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this was one of the first products I bought.</li>
            <li> It does stop odors, but if this is all you are using, you would most likely need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Combined with another deodorant it seems to amplify it but other than that it can&#x27;t do nothing on its own.</li>
            <li> The thai stone is environmentally much friendlier and better for the body than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use: just wet it, swipe underarm, and then lift your arm throughout the rest of the day and evening with confidence.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found several good ones, but when I saw this product at a certain local raw vegan store, I knew it had to be good.</li>
            <li> Not good for athletes but great for desk jockeys.</li>
            <li> great all natural deodorant, I still use my Pink Sugar natural spray deodorant over it though.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, did not stain clothes like many more expensive deodorants, and I thought it worked</li>
            <li> It is amazing how it holds down order plus its safer to use.</li>
            <li> less effective than another brand i tried.  </li>
            <li> If you tend to be pretty non-stinky anyway and need just a little extra protection, I bet it would work great for you.</li>
            <li> I will not be able to use this, especially not in the subtropical climate I live in.</li>
            <li> If I am going to a wedding or job interview where I am wearing a suit and may be in the heat, I will wear a regular antiperspirant, but I suspect this product would be fine.  </li>
            <li> Overall, seems to work fine for the office, and has virtually no smell.</li>
            <li> one day, the rightGuard was feeling a little light, I was making an order on Amazon, and I needed a few bucks more to get my super saver free shipping.</li>
            <li> There have been a couple times when I still got a slight bit of odor after an intense workout, but it was very slight and aside from those couple occasions, it&#x27;s worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like this productvery much.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it requires to use it for about a week to start really working.     </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> This product really does work.  </li>
            <li> So really 0 stars for me, 5 stars for her.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> But for folks like me, you might find this to be very ineffective.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> It really really works.</li>
            <li> HaHa,</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s free off all the chemicals in regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s just salt, so</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> marginally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very generous when applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I try to limit chemical products as much as I can</li>
            <li> Make sure to put on while wet though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some wetness/moisture but no smell!</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> It works on odor very well</li>
            <li> Say, after the shower and getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a hassel to have to wet it to be able to put it on.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of the day, you can hug someone or get very close and not have to worry about underarm odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are claims that Alum crystals cannot be absorbed into the skin because of there molecular size which is just completely unproven.  </li>
            <li> Take a spray bottle and mix some Bobs Red Mill aluminium free baking soda along with lemon juice under your arms.  </li>
            <li> I work in a VERY sweaty environment and I run 40-50 miles a week...</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I might have to reapply if I do something real strenuous, but then again, I&#x27;d probably need a shower anyway.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve really put it to the test.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply when skin is wet.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to wet the top before applying so</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell whether or not it was working, either.</li>
            <li> size is pretty small, but nice for a \\&quot;trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants, and this is the ONLY ONE that does not irritate me or cause me to stink.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has it limits, but I would recommend it to someone who needs an effective deodorant when they are not physically active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salt deodorants only work to prevent odor.</li>
            <li> Recently, in an attempt to find a more natural product I bought this Thai crystal deodorant and also bought a bottle of Milk of Magnesia to test both out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out in a rash as I do with so many other chemically laden products and 2.</li>
            <li> and they are a lot better than other sticks or spray deodorants.</li>
            <li> and I smell better than I did with rightGuard, even after a full day of work, or a hard workout.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A bit of hokey medicine, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me (maybe i just sweat and stink more than the average person?).</li>
            <li> I used to have a shower and put on a normal deodorant or antiperspirant, go to work and stank the whole office.</li>
            <li> Keeps up very well on a normal day.</li>
            <li> and this has been a nice addition to my lifestyle for the past four years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it works MUCH BETTER than any previous deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought mine when I was pregnant with my son and still have quite a bit left</li>
            <li> I rarely experience smell, the only time I do is when I am doing intense exercise or manual labor.</li>
            <li> Technically, not a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; since it has no perfumes; more of a bio-inhibitor in actual use.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the main stream products.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturers cleverly omit an list ingredients on the packaging but if you do your research, you will learn of the aluminium crystal content.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a pleasure so far, no stains and white marks, very effective and long lasting.</li>
            <li> My wife has a very sensitive nose ant it absolutely works (according to her.)</li>
            <li> All my dress shirts and t-shirts had not only yellow stains, but white crusted gunk from some of the more powerful antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would place this on the \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot; list for alternative deodorant control.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for odor.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend that you go ahead and buy a stick.</li>
            <li> If you are a heavy sweater or doing a lot of physical labor this might not be the thing for you, but for everyday light work it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I really like that this is so natural and doesn&#x27;t get anything on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Some people worry about alum containing aluminium like normal antiperspirants, in my understanding the aluminium in aluminium  </li>
            <li> The small size makes it much easier to handle without dropping, and the container itself looks much more resilient.</li>
            <li> I kind of like the absence of the potpourri smells of conventional deodorant.</li>
            <li> It is the same stuff as the Art Of Shaving and other brands, but with a more convenient form factor and MUCH lower price.</li>
            <li> With regular deodorant I m stinky right after 4 hours.</li>
            <li> You will certainly need to keep up with regular applications, likely more than once a day (and daily showers, of course) to even stand a chance of staying stink-free.</li>
            <li> I am an \\&quot;average\\&quot; deodorant/anti perspirant user I suppose who has dabbled into natural deodorants and I can honestly say this was the most useless thing I tried for me PERSONALLY.</li>
            <li> the other hand, I was using the cheap MoM I got, just rubbed a bit on my armpits twice a day</li>
            <li> And since this crystal is so cheap and so long lasting, it really saves me money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better health wise than your regular old stick of Degree.  </li>
            <li> or you will have to get a new one because it shatters everywhere.</li>
            <li> live in the Phoenix area and am testing it during the summer, so if it works here</li>
            <li> My husband asked for a new type of deodorant as his just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> and it still looks like new.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all, but it actually eats the odor.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods attempting to find something natural for my 10 year old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I moved to the desert, I noticed that Degree wasn&#x27;t working all day anymore, even in the winter when it wasn&#x27;t hot outside.  </li>
            <li> Love the small size.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using such a product</li>
            <li> I cleaned the house slept went outside in high humidity, no smell and no sweat!!  </li>
            <li> I did not realize it was a small travel size, but that is okay.</li>
            <li> it keeps me fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> My first stick lasted me almost 3 years using it daily.  </li>
            <li> I have used their \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; solid for many years (did not use clear because it didn&#x27;t seem to help with perspiration), with the only problems up until recently being stains on my clothing, and the deodorant clumping in the summertime.  </li>
            <li> I decided to venture into this new world of crystal and am SO pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My old favorite was Lady&#x27;s Speedstick, but I think the Thai deodorant stone does a better job of controlling odor - and without leaving behind the yellow stains on my white shirts.</li>
            <li> I do support natural remedies and am interested in probiotic deodorants which I am going to try next.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to standard deodorant/antiperspirant which have been linked to negative health issues with long term use.  </li>
            <li> After trying this for a few days I went back to try another natural deodorant (supposedly mineral/crystal based liquid) and the difference in effectiveness was huge!  </li>
            <li> When on Dialysis, your body just cannot clear out all of the toxins.</li>
            <li> and it worked for others clearly,</li>
            <li> My father introduced me to the idea of Deodorant Crystals when I was young.  </li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant stone for only about a week now, and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> This is a natural solution that works.  </li>
            <li> (I use a natural lotion of my choice).  </li>
            <li> All natural no aluminum or parabens...</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well it works</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural deodorant, this is it.</li>
            <li> Odorless and seemingly natural.</li>
            <li> it is all natural.</li>
            <li> about as much time as applying regular roll</li>
            <li> At some point the stick will part from its &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; (every one has thus far)</li>
            <li> Also, keep in mind that this a natural deodorant, and not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Switched onto natural products a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> In fact, I had to wash the armpit area of my tops to get the old stuff</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it won&#x27;t stop you from sweating (like anti-perspirant) and that is a good thing, unless you&#x27;re worried about sweating through clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From looking at it right now I estimate that it might last another 4 years with daily usage.  </li>
            <li> However, it does very little when I&#x27;m performing strenuous, physical activities for more than a hour.</li>
            <li> A side by side comparision shows this is EXACTLY the same product with a different brand affixed.  </li>
            <li> Molecular makeup changes upon becoming wet (you have to wet this stick to us it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> I have made multiple different recipes for homemade deodorant, and bought numerous natural ones trying to find an aluminum free deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li> Just apply vigorously with water and this will last you for a long time and will work better than every other deodorant without the aluminum</li>
            <li> It even stood up to high heat and humidity while touring in Greece and Israel last summer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it had little to no fragrance for health reasons, but it does smell great.</li>
            <li> After using DeoGo (look this product up) to bring them back to normal, I decided to change antiperspirant so that it wouldn&#x27;t happen again.    </li>
            <li> It gives me protection while not subjecting me to potentially harmful chemicals which are present in most other regular deodorants and antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this you will never go back to normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Even with heavy sweating, I get no bad odor.  </li>
            <li> But at least this is a completely natural product free of aluminum.</li>
            <li> I only applied it 3 times the entire night and it really masked the odor--</li>
            <li> I have only found ONE natural deodorant to work - ALVERA&#x27;s natural deodorant - aloe and almonds.</li>
            <li> I use the salt deodorant to avoid unhealthy additives in mainstream deodorants, and this brand is not only cost-effective, it is also unusually effective.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a terrific and natural deodorant !</li>
            <li> Thai was the first &#x27;non conventional&#x27; deodorant I ever used.  </li>
            <li> As I have used it only in the UK where the summer have not been much present this year, I cannot comment on how it would cope with high temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of natural products and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants before (sprays, sticks, roll-ons) and figured that this would be on the same level.  </li>
            <li> But if it works out for you as well as it has for me so far, your only regret will be not having discovered it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do need to get the stone wet and apply it liberally to the whole underarm</li>
            <li> apparently (I was warned that this might be the case)</li>
            <li> Full size is only a few cents</li>
            <li> Fast delivery with my other Amazon items.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll never go back to the white or clear deodorants.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s looking like it will last several months at the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your like me and you&#x27;ve tried all sorts of deodorants and everyone either left you an irritating rash or just didn&#x27;t work, then you will love this.  </li>
            <li> When you first put this on, it can smell a little like BO itself, but that passes once the product dries.</li>
            <li> But really, this stuff is pretty weak.</li>
            <li> the record, it&#x27;s not much safer than normal deodorant, either, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t spend my entire day with my arms straight down my sides so being this generous makes</li>
            <li> &quot; That&#x27;s an extreme example, but I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Totally worth your while and as the product may be small,  it will last for a</li>
            <li> I was using a strong \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorant but found after a while that it somehow wasn&#x27;t helping or even made me smell worse.  </li>
            <li> Just run it under hot water and rub the sharp areas with a rough rag</li>
            <li> It is a bit weird to get to a new routine of applying it wet and for more &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; than a traditional deodorant.  </li>
            <li> And then it&#x27;s kind of weird that you have to wet the stick before applying.</li>
            <li> overall, i&#x27;m not really helped by the salt deodorants in general.</li>
            <li> I imagine that the spray won&#x27;t last as long as the actual Crystal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is pure and I am having absolutely no more issues.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product totally control underarm odor for 24+ hours, but the stone itself lasts for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> one and be happy that you are not putting aluminum and other dangerous chemicals into your bloodstream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about how much of an antiperspirant effect it has, because I don&#x27;t sweat a lot</li>
            <li> The stick seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and it seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> (High Street shops for instance or small, privately owed natural/organic online and &#x27;off-line&#x27; shops).</li>
            <li> I have used it liberally everyday and it looks almost like it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li> It does last quite a while, but I am certainly seeing it slowly wear (other reviews claim it barely changed in 4 mos...</li>
            <li> the only difference is this product might keep you dry , but it will still leave you musky smelling.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t keep me that dry</li>
            <li> I suggest checking the size carefully -- there is a smaller travel size and a larger size.</li>
            <li> Surprised actually to find that this stick does prevent perspiration from turning odorous...saves the clothing from yellow rings and excessive laundering</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I tried the Thai Crystal, because I knew of a friend who used it, and honestly I was skeptical due to my luck with other brands but thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> hard to use, doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> This stick of deodorant is smaller than what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> After using it for this long, the stick and cover smells of armpit odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove, Dial, Arm and Hammer, etc., and none of them worked for her for long.  </li>
            <li> I have long been seeking a deodorant or antiperspirant that works like this one.</li>
            <li> I will save tons of money because I won&#x27;t have to buy deordorant/antiperspirants for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a face toner as part of a traditional wet shaving routine.</li>
            <li> Only problem is you have to be by water to wet the stone.</li>
            <li> Not much but definitely visible.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works as well, if not better than, normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this and it lasts a long time .</li>
            <li> I switched to this Thai Natural Crystal and at first I was skeptical as it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything when applying.  </li>
            <li> and I can see a single stick lasting a very very long!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s barely worn down at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading that and the other reviews here on Amazon about this product, my fears were laid to rest about any possible hazards of the \\&quot;Mineral Salts\\&quot; used in this deodorant crystal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other crystals but only the &amp;#34;Thai&amp;#34; one works for me.  </li>
            <li> Apply in a larger area then you would for other chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> but this stuff definitely works and you don&#x27;t get that gooey feeling that you would get from other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> all i give a 3 because it lasts very long</li>
            <li> Also, it lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> So, it truly lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> stay dry for hours.</li>
            <li> That means you have to put it on immediately after your shower and let it dry.</li>
            <li> i do admit it will keep you dry to an extent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to worry about any aluminum poisoning and/or other unknown chemical we place into our bodies on a daily bases.  </li>
            <li> Takes a couple or few days of consecutive use to reach full effectiveness, as it makes your pits an inhospitable environment for the bacteria that causes B.O. Remember that you need to use it while you&#x27;re still at least slightly damp from the bath or shower, as it won&#x27;t transfer to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Typically, this type of thing (natural, homeopathic) ends up being less that satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I would have spent at least half of this amount on non-natural products so it is worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be around the house and/or clear of enclosed spaces with other people, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d trust it in an office space, bar, or any other setting where other people are near by (at least not people I like).</li>
            <li> There is only one ingredient listed on the small plastic case and it simply says \\&quot;Mineral Salts\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and then I would have a slight reaction to regular deodorant that would cause itching.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this as nothing that I have made or purchased has worked as good as basic Secret.  </li>
            <li> little guy seems to last too.</li>
            <li> I found out by reading the directions(duh), that you had to get it a little wet running it under the faucet for a second, then applying.  </li>
            <li> With traditional deodorant I smelled bad by the next morning, now my arm pits are fresh shower to shower and there is no sticky residue to stain my clothes or clog you pores.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no Aluminum Chlorohydrate in our deodorants.</li>
            <li> Wet your arm instead of the stick, it begins to smell.</li>
            <li> you want to test if anything is going on your armpit, wet it then rub against your arm,</li>
            <li> Works as well as a salt stick can be expected to.</li>
            <li> There is another alum stick that is widely sold on a shaving website, which I have used.  </li>
            <li> Armpits must be wet when applied, or it will not work.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop it</li>
            <li> you do is run it under water a bit to get it wet, then apply a couple dozen strokes to each armpit.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of having wet armpits when applying deodorant.</li>
            <li> It is only 2.125 oz which is half the size of the previous stick I purchased.</li>
            <li> a single &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; lasts for months and months and months!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the raw crystal, as well as the \\&quot;roll-on\\&quot; solid crystal.  </li>
            <li> I wet the stone and apply generously over a larger area than with an ordinary deodorant stick.</li>
            <li> someone told me that they had tried this but that they found it uncomfortable to apply and that the crystal dragged on the skin however, remember that you must wet the crystal first before applying.  </li>
            <li> but I know this product has no chemicals that will effect my condition since I have lymphedema and am careful what I use after having breast cancer!</li>
            <li> Practically every other product I tried gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Secret clinical strength deodorant but because of all the alzheimer&#x27;s links with anti-perspirant, I wanted to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Different than my usual brand.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant (without dangerous aluminum salts) that actually works for me.  </li>
            <li> But once I started vaccuumming, doing other housework, or gods forbid, mow the grass, stink city.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a deodorant you can keep in your purse for touchups.</li>
            <li> Just wet it &amp; rub it on!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was using it wrong</li>
            <li> I have used other crystals and they do not work as well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone is different, so I&#x27;d buy a small one and try it out and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat, just kills the bacteria that causes the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves no scent or film like other products.</li>
            <li> just BE CAREFUL and do not drop it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also use this product to stop bleeding from small cuts such as shaving cuts.</li>
            <li> but I had to stop using this after about 3-4 weeks due to a rash that started to develop on my under arms.</li>
            <li> or I wasn&#x27;t that active</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction to conventional deodorant and my brother suggested I try this Thai Crystal.</li>
            <li> and that was why there was no odor as I typically had a bit at the end of the day with other options.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s less slippery, but other than that, it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Getting another for my other half to work on foot odor.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the plastic is hard and fragile and always seems to break.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to have to wet the stone first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for the cost and you&#x27;d probably have about as much luck with a river stone you picked up off the ground.</li>
            <li> I still have at least 50% of the stone left.</li>
            <li> Take a nail file and sand it down</li>
            <li> It does not keep the odor down at all for me.</li>
            <li> This might be TMI, but to the guys who use corn starch or powder on the privates, try it down south.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had kidney failure and this was the ONLY deodorant I could use that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on prescription deodorant since high school and was very very skeptical at how this thing could possibly bring me any value.</li>
            <li> I had my bigger one for a few years and hardly used any of it up.</li>
            <li> Thankfully not full of chemicals and no overpowering coverup smell.</li>
            <li> No residue or any other gunk left behind after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the products for two months, use everyday and don&#x27;t see any signs of less product</li>
            <li> Even if I sweat a little, no odor.</li>
            <li> Gym time starts to get a little stinky</li>
            <li> I saw this little guy, took a chance and boy am</li>
            <li> This little size has lasted all that time</li>
            <li> Every little bit adds up.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it because it&#x27;s all natural &amp; regular deodorant/antiperspirant is so bad for you.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it could keep up on the days when I am sweating heavily.  </li>
            <li> husband uses this everyday and it works for him.</li>
            <li> I shower everyday so that isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for my body to get used to it, bu No chemicals, and no stinkage.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a man and a heavy sweater).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a heavy sweater who has battled with sweating all my life I am truly amazed at how well this thing works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pissed I wasted my money on this crystal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> waste your time and money on this stuff.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for the body to get used to it</li>
            <li> Stopped working, and now smells worse than regular BO when I use it.</li>
            <li> We are each built differently, so I do not believe it fails for everyone but for me, it&#x27;s a big failure.</li>
            <li> It is simply a very hard block of mineral salt that you apply to wet underarms as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> DAH Unlimited was a little slow.  </li>
            <li> Products manufactured overseas have very little health and safety codes</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not magic</li>
            <li> once it dries, you&#x27;ll see a faint white residue.</li>
            <li> use this small version in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I have no more allergic reactions, and no body odor.</li>
            <li> Guessed I didn&#x27;t realize size would be so small for the price.</li>
            <li> I have not dropped the small one yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Has been working well for me for the past three years or so.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and lasts forever (unless you drop it  like i did and it breaks into a 100 pieces).</li>
            <li> and we have had a heatwave in the past couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I have noticed that on days when I am sweating a lot that there comes a time about mid-day where I will have to re-apply the deodorant crystal, but those days are very few in number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is simply a small cylinder of hard salt.  </li>
            <li> I had a habit of dropping the bigger one because of its awkward weight balance, and then I&#x27;d get sharp edges from the broken parts.  </li>
            <li> I work hard and don&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> Lasts for at least a year.</li>
            <li> It does work, at least for me.</li>
            <li> This is not effective at all.</li>
            <li> For $4, you get at least a year of odor</li>
            <li> Can also use it kinda as a base under other products for extra non-smelliness.</li>
            <li> But after using this product for the past 4 months, it WORKS!</li>
            <li> I mean i used it</li>
            <li> Have been uncomfortable with the aluminum in the roll on as well as the other chemicals.</li>
            <li> body odor is not sexy!</li>
            <li> You could well be spreading some serious toxins onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there was some weird chemical interaction going on with my body or what.  </li>
            <li> It also has to be reapplied if you sweat too much (I mean a lot!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried really really hard to make this thing fail.</li>
            <li> So for now, I guess I&#x27;m stuck with the health risks of clinical strength secret.</li>
            <li> I got annoyed with it and stopped using it all together.</li>
            <li> After putting it on my armpits were sore from the rubbing and they would just smell worse than before, while the stick itself would also smell like BO.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> you eat unhealthy, your sweat will stink, so this will not work as well for you.</li>
            <li> I hate using the regular stick deodorants from the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> so when that happens, I just turn the stick upside down and use the base as a holder;</li>
            <li> I have used all the regular commercial-brand antiperspirants and deodorants, but have found them to be terrible in one respect: they ruined my shirts.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical using the stone deodorant but didn&#x27;t have anything to lose</li>
            <li> This stuff works where all the others fail.</li>
            <li> This is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> No chemicals or scary warnings on the label about your kidneys or not applying it to &amp;#34;broken skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could relate to the 5-star reviews; unfortunately, this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Calculation of cost per ounce ($0.21/oz) is wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews as it is not excellent by any means.</li>
            <li> I eventually resorted to using it as a base &amp; then adding my Secret clinical strength deodorant hoping it might at least reduce the amount of aluminum my body is exposed to.</li>
            <li> unpleasant to apply.  </li>
            <li> so I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Skeptical,  I applied as directed and holy crap</li>
            <li> I have bad B.O.</li>
            <li> This stick comes lose from the base and is impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I have to buy another one now (hopefully with a stronger base) and try my damn hardest to not drop it.</li>
            <li> But how the crap is this stuff supposed to work?</li>
            <li> They are so sticky and nasty and there always seems to be a film under the arms that will never wash away.  </li>

            <li> This product was recommended by a breast cancer survivor on a women&#x27;s breast cancer website. It&#x27;s safe and long lasting! I do not have many lymph nodes left under my arm but I know this product has no chemicals that will effect my condition since I have lymphedema and am careful what I use after having breast cancer! Thank you for a terrific and natural deodorant !</li>
            <li> My father introduced me to the idea of Deodorant Crystals when I was young.  I didn&#x27;t understand how an odorless \\&quot;rock\\&quot; could stop my armpits from smelling but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of natural products and this fits the bill.  There is only one ingredient listed on the small plastic case and it simply says \\&quot;Mineral Salts\\&quot;.  I checked out the website for this product and this is what the company has to say about those of us who are concerned about exactly what their putting into and onto their bodies;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What is Alum? Is it the same as Aluminum?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alum is a salt. Aluminum is a mineral. Alum is taken from Bauxite ore. Alum is in no way harmful to your body. Aluminum has been suspected, although not proven, to be harmful. There is absolutely no Aluminum Chlorohydrate in our deodorants. In fact our products are so safe they are used in the purification of water in some countries.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading that and the other reviews here on Amazon about this product, my fears were laid to rest about any possible hazards of the \\&quot;Mineral Salts\\&quot; used in this deodorant crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first great thing about the Thai Deodorant Crystal is that it lasts a LONG time.  I bought the one I&#x27;m currently using in June of 2012.  I have used it liberally everyday and it looks almost like it&#x27;s brand new.  From looking at it right now I estimate that it might last another 4 years with daily usage.  For the $5 that I spent on this you could call this one of the best bargains of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important part.  How well does it do against odor?  Overall I have been very happy with it&#x27;s ability to keep my armpits smelling neutral all day.  There aren&#x27;t any perfumes to worry about and I like that.  I have noticed that on days when I am sweating a lot that there comes a time about mid-day where I will have to re-apply the deodorant crystal, but those days are very few in number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this productvery much.  I would give it 5 stars if it could keep up on the days when I am sweating heavily.  There is also a spray available which I&#x27;m considering trying.  I imagine that the spray won&#x27;t last as long as the actual Crystal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it works best when I run the Crystal under water before applying it to each armpit.  This gives it a good bit of extra lubrication and makes it go on very easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> I am never buying the stick or spray on deoderants again ... the crystal deo sticks works great for me.  The spray deoderants did not last for even a couple of hours for me, this crystal deo keeps the smell away for almost a day</li>
            <li> I have been a user of alternative deodorants for awhile. I&#x27;ve found several good ones, but when I saw this product at a certain local raw vegan store, I knew it had to be good. I tried it out, and as my title says, the Thai stick works even better than I could have imagined. Just as a test, I did not apply it one day, and worked a full day. At the end of the day, I definately had an odor. I then applied it, and the smell was instantly gone. I invited someone to smell my armpit. They commented, \\&quot;It smells good.\\&quot; That&#x27;s an extreme example, but I would highly recommend this product. It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all, but it actually eats the odor.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not magic it&#x27;s science but it is amazing. Its smaller than I thought but works amazingly well. I&#x27;ve even tested letting one underarm get ripe by only putting this under one just to see. Amazing</li>
            <li> I will never use commercial deodorant ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager, many deodorants did not seem to work for me until I started using Degree for women.  I have used their \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; solid for many years (did not use clear because it didn&#x27;t seem to help with perspiration), with the only problems up until recently being stains on my clothing, and the deodorant clumping in the summertime.  When I moved to the desert, I noticed that Degree wasn&#x27;t working all day anymore, even in the winter when it wasn&#x27;t hot outside.  I tried Arid, Mitchum, and a roll-on product (can&#x27;t remember the name) that I found at Whole Foods which supposedly was supposed to be great, but nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I tried the Thai Crystal, because I knew of a friend who used it, and honestly I was skeptical due to my luck with other brands but thought I would give it a try.  And lo and behold, it works perfectly.  When I first put it on, I felt like there was no way it would work, but by the end of the day I was amazed to find that there was still no odor.  The Thai Crystal kills the bacteria which cause odor.  And it doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum which you will find in commercial deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This stick of deodorant is smaller than what I expected it to be.  It is only 2.125 oz which is half the size of the previous stick I purchased. My error for not checking prior to ordering.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses this everyday and it works for him.</li>
            <li> I have used all the regular commercial-brand antiperspirants and deodorants, but have found them to be terrible in one respect: they ruined my shirts.  All my dress shirts and t-shirts had not only yellow stains, but white crusted gunk from some of the more powerful antiperspirants.  After using DeoGo (look this product up) to bring them back to normal, I decided to change antiperspirant so that it wouldn&#x27;t happen again.    After a significant bit of research and scouring the web, I found that these deodorant stones are the ticket.  It does exactly what you would expect.  Keeps the smell away, goes on clean, and does not ruin shirts.  It doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirants so much (you will still sweat), but that is actually a good thing.  Normal sweat stains will easily come out in the wash cycle, so it is nothing to worry about.    Going to be using this kind of product for many years to come.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m not even sweaty but this wears off so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love the small size. Used this product 5 years.  The best deodorant I have ever found.  No white marks on my skin or shirts.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.  Dust don&#x27;t drop it. It could break.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had kidney failure and this was the ONLY deodorant I could use that would not send me into orbit with itching. When on Dialysis, your body just cannot clear out all of the toxins. Well, more than a decade after as successful kidney transplant and a return to perfect health, and having switched back to regular commercial deodorant, I read several accounts of the incredible garbage in typical products ... in truth a lot of poison. And I remembered the &amp;#34;Thai Stick&amp;#34; and ordered again. Why did I ever stop using it? Good question. So I ordered a bunch for home and travel. My wife has a very sensitive nose ant it absolutely works (according to her.) Just buy it ... use it.</li>
            <li> Wet your arm instead of the stick, it begins to smell. Take a nail file and sand it down so it stays smooth. You stay odor free all day, apply liberally.</li>
            <li> You will not smell that&#x27;s guaranteed but don&#x27;t think that this is an antiprespirent .. You will sweat as if you are not putting deodorants but with no odor.. Also doesn&#x27;t stain clothes</li>
            <li> This was my first time using such a product so I was very skeptical. Some said it works, some said it doesn&#x27;t. And then it&#x27;s kind of weird that you have to wet the stick before applying. But after using this product for the past 4 months, it WORKS! No armpit odor whatsoever....Even if I sweat a little, no odor. I think the way it works is it takes out the bacteria from your armpits while the odor remains on the stick. After using it for this long, the stick and cover smells of armpit odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to test if anything is going on your armpit, wet it then rub against your arm, once it dries, you&#x27;ll see a faint white residue. So it goes to show it works. At first, it looked as if the stick was not reducing in size but after some months of usage, you&#x27;ll notice. The only downside is since it&#x27;s not anti-perspirant, you&#x27;ll sweat. But at least this is a completely natural product free of aluminum. Leaves no stains on your shirts. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Used this product for a month now and its great!  I would place this on the \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot; list for alternative deodorant control. Don&#x27;t need to worry about any aluminum poisoning and/or other unknown chemical we place into our bodies on a daily bases.  Definitely works as described.  I&#x27;ll be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> This product, this brand or others, was my \\&quot;salvation\\&quot;. I used to have a shower and put on a normal deodorant or antiperspirant, go to work and stank the whole office. I have been using this type for several years now and I don&#x27;t smell at all. Sometimes it requires to use it for about a week to start really working.     Some people worry about alum containing aluminium like normal antiperspirants, in my understanding the aluminium in aluminium  chlorohydrate is in cationic form, however aluminium in alum is found in anionic form, this is supposed to be the reason why in the case of alum it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the travel size Thai Stone. Works as well as a salt stick can be expected to. Can also use it kinda as a base under other products for extra non-smelliness.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods attempting to find something natural for my 10 year old who&#x27;s underarm odor is a killer.  I didn&#x27;t want to use the clinical strength deodorant on her tender underams but needed something effective.  I&#x27;ve used Dove, Dial, Arm and Hammer, etc., and none of them worked for her for long.  By day&#x27;s end, her underarm odor woud be full strength.  I was skeptical using the stone deodorant but didn&#x27;t have anything to lose so I gave it a try.  To my amazement, it works!  Only issue is, it doesn&#x27;t work to control wetness.  I highly recommend it for odor.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant stone for only about a week now, and it has worked very well. My old favorite was Lady&#x27;s Speedstick, but I think the Thai deodorant stone does a better job of controlling odor - and without leaving behind the yellow stains on my white shirts. I&#x27;m not sure about how much of an antiperspirant effect it has, because I don&#x27;t sweat a lot and I work in an air conditioned facility.   I wet the stone and apply generously over a larger area than with an ordinary deodorant stick. The 2.125 oz. size is pretty small, but nice for a \\&quot;trial\\&quot;. I think I&#x27;ll buy the larger size next time.  Thus far I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!  I have long been seeking a deodorant or antiperspirant that works like this one. I have tried so many kinds from Degree, Suave, Secret, Dove, Tom&#x27;s...even clinical strength!  I decided to venture into this new world of crystal and am SO pleasantly surprised.  I cleaned the house slept went outside in high humidity, no smell and no sweat!!  This stuff works where all the others fail.</li>
            <li> Great product, convenient size. Arrived unbroken.</li>
            <li> unpleasant to apply.  doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well</li>
            <li> I love this. I have always had a body odor issue but this cleared that right up. Thankfully not full of chemicals and no overpowering coverup smell.</li>
            <li> Keeps up very well on a normal day. Gym time starts to get a little stinky but overall I&#x27;m please with the performance and very pleased to be using something without so many chemicals!</li>
            <li> It works and It works best than the regular aluminum ones. It do not leave residues like the regular brands, thus no yellow stains.</li>
            <li> Purchased the larger size in June 2011 and I&#x27;m still using the same stick in March 2012--long lasting.  Worked very effectively for me.  Highly recommended!  Recommend applying liberally to the entire underarm area for best results.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I use and will only use..</li>
            <li> This deodorant stone really works!!  I love it!  I live in Arizona and it gets real hot here and this product is a life saver...don&#x27;t have to worry about offending odor anymore.  It isn&#x27;t advertised as a anti-perspirant, but it works like one for me.  I bought the stone and the spray and they both work fantastic!  I will save tons of money because I won&#x27;t have to buy deordorant/antiperspirants for a long time.  I&#x27;ve had the products for two months, use everyday and don&#x27;t see any signs of less product...looks like I just got it.  You have to try this stone...I like the fact that there isn&#x27;t any chemicals that your body can absorb.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face toner as part of a traditional wet shaving routine. It is the same stuff as the Art Of Shaving and other brands, but with a more convenient form factor and MUCH lower price.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size for traveling.  Works as well as the bigger ones. I have been using it for more than 10 years and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant. With regular deodorant I m stinky right after 4 hours. But this last more than 24 hours. I think it will also last longer because it a salt. You apply it on wet armpit and good to go. No residue nothing to hide. And it&#x27;s good for the health because no chemicals at all.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work, but it did! It works for my husband too. I&#x27;m amazed. You need to use it on clean skin. I shower everyday so that isn&#x27;t a problem. If you&#x27;re a shower-every-other-day person then this may not be for you. However, it does last longer than 24hours so no worries.</li>
            <li> I use this as my daily deodorant (the large stick) since I am not a heavy sweater; it works great. It gives me protection while not subjecting me to potentially harmful chemicals which are present in most other regular deodorants and antiperspirants.  If I am going to a wedding or job interview where I am wearing a suit and may be in the heat, I will wear a regular antiperspirant, but I suspect this product would be fine.  I just don&#x27;t like to take chances.&lt;br /&gt;I use this small version in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction to conventional deodorant and my brother suggested I try this Thai Crystal. Works great. I have no more allergic reactions, and no body odor. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, you just don&#x27;t stink and that&#x27;s the point. I kind of like the absence of the potpourri smells of conventional deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is not like others.  It works to kill the bacteria that causes the smell!</li>
            <li> Ingredients:  100% mineral salts.  Practically every other product I tried gave me a rash.  Not this.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.  im very impressed. I know its winter and i will probably need to reapply more during the summer, but i dont smell.</li>
            <li> I have never found a deodorant that has worked for me all day - and especially not in the summer.  This product is great and I&#x27;m so happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> u have to use water to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it gave me a rash the salt really irrates the skin so that kind of sucked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all i give a 3 because it lasts very long</li>
            <li> I normally use Secret clinical strength deodorant but because of all the alzheimer&#x27;s links with anti-perspirant, I wanted to give this a try. It did not work at all for me. I would use it at home, where my activity level was low &amp; still after a short time, there would be odor. I eventually resorted to using it as a base &amp; then adding my Secret clinical strength deodorant hoping it might at least reduce the amount of aluminum my body is exposed to. HOWEVER, my 8-year old daughter has needed deodorant since she was 6 &amp; I was using Tom&#x27;s organic deodorant for her, but because of the strong lavendar smell, wanted to try something else. This works perfectly for her. No odor. So really 0 stars for me, 5 stars for her.</li>
            <li> I bought these, after trying a sample. I really enjoy the feel of not having deodorant gooped up on my pits.</li>
            <li> I did not realize I was ordering the travel size, but am fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;Works well and is easy use.</li>
            <li> Surprised actually to find that this stick does prevent perspiration from turning odorous...saves the clothing from yellow rings and excessive laundering</li>
            <li> There is another alum stick that is widely sold on a shaving website, which I have used.  A side by side comparision shows this is EXACTLY the same product with a different brand affixed.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> This has lasted me over a year and I still have some left.  It kills odor but doesn&#x27;t stop sweat.  No residue or any other gunk left behind after application.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I suggest checking the size carefully -- there is a smaller travel size and a larger size. I ordered twice and paid about the same for both sizes. Still - one of the best products on the market!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to standard deodorant/antiperspirant which have been linked to negative health issues with long term use.  This product works great if used according to directions.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years.  Will continue to come to Amazon for the product.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This one is TINY! I didn&#x27;t know they came in two sizes. Will only by the larger size from here on.</li>
            <li> Different than my usual brand. Very smooth. Works perfectly well. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Pros: No scents from the deodorants. No body odor for a full day after applying. This stick seems like it&#x27;s going to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This doesn&#x27;t always happen, but sometimes after applying this, my armpits feel like they&#x27;re a bit chafed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I highly recommend that you go ahead and buy a stick.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I will never wear traditional deodorant again.  They say never say never, but I am sure of this one thing.  With traditional deodorant I smelled bad by the next morning, now my arm pits are fresh shower to shower and there is no sticky residue to stain my clothes or clog you pores.  Trying to get all my friends and family to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant (without dangerous aluminum salts) that actually works for me.  No worries with this, and I love the travel size option.</li>
            <li> For those of you who do not develop body odor, great, good for you. But for folks like me, you might find this to be very ineffective. It did nothing for me on any day where I actually did something. Sure, if all I did that day was sit in the house and play around on the computer or do homework (full time student 40yr old single mother), it was fine. Of course, on days like that, a shower is sufficient. But once I started vaccuumming, doing other housework, or gods forbid, mow the grass, stink city. I&#x27;ve tried several of these crystal deodorants, they are just alum. Alum is good for absorbing wetness and shrinking pores. It does nothing for bacteria that cause body odor. We are each built differently, so I do not believe it fails for everyone but for me, it&#x27;s a big failure. I do support natural remedies and am interested in probiotic deodorants which I am going to try next. So for now, I guess I&#x27;m stuck with the health risks of clinical strength secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the most popular crystal deodorant brand for over a year now.  I&#x27;ve tried the raw crystal, as well as the \\&quot;roll-on\\&quot; solid crystal.  Both of these work great also, but I have accidentally dropped and smashed both kinds well before they ran out. I bought this one because it was a) smaller and b) better container.  I was not disappointed.  The small size makes it much easier to handle without dropping, and the container itself looks much more resilient. The crystal itself is more homogeneous, and much smoother feeling. I will definitely buy Thai Deodorants brand again!</li>
            <li> I love this. Works great until the first time you drop it. Then you might as well throw it in the trash. If you try to use it it&#x27;ll cut up your under arms. 😕</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I used it for about two weeks along with deodorant.  I rub it in my armpits every morning (just like deodorant).  It has been over a week since I&#x27;ve used traditional deodorant and I&#x27;ve had no body odor at all, whatsoever.  Even with heavy sweating, I get no bad odor.  It feels great not to be contaminating my body with traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in February. I saw it while shopping online, and figured it was worth a shot to remove some chemicals from my life. I&#x27;ve found the product works great for blocking any stench, though if you&#x27;re into skipping showers you probably won&#x27;t want to use it more than one day in a row. It doesn&#x27;t stop any perspiration for me, but I prefer sweaty armpits to white marks on all my tops.</li>
            <li> This is difficult to use.  It requires moisture to glide on.  I got annoyed with it and stopped using it all together.</li>
            <li> Great product. Only problem is you have to be by water to wet the stone. It&#x27;s not exactly a deodorant you can keep in your purse for touchups.</li>
            <li> Guessed I didn&#x27;t realize size would be so small for the price. If I had realized would have just purchased the larger size at health food store.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me, EXCEPT for the fact that I&#x27;m a total klutz and dropped it a few times. I have to buy another one now (hopefully with a stronger base) and try my damn hardest to not drop it. It broke off in pretty small pieces that could cut you. Don&#x27;t be alarmed! Haha just don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have purchased this stuff. It really really works. I have bad B.O. It is a fact. I have tried so many natural deodorants, and this is the ONLY ONE that does not irritate me or cause me to stink.  Get the smaller size, the larger one kept dropping and cracking. I have not dropped the small one yet.  It is just easier to grip and use and transport if we go somewhere overnight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drop it!  Mine shattered and left jagged edges...  obviously not something I want to rake against my skin...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this works but after reading all of the reviews, I decided to try it. I am so glad I did because this is amazing. I received this product in the mail yesterday (super quick delivery) and used it for the first time right before heading out to a couple of clubs. I only applied it 3 times the entire night and it really masked the odor-- I was sweating profusely because the clubs were PACKED. I asked my friend to do the sniff test and she said there was no scent at all. I didn&#x27;t apply anything this morning and it still has no odor!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as travel deodorants as they do not need to be in the liquids bag. (I don&#x27;t check luggage). However since they work so well for me, I have one at home, one in my travel kit and one in my gym bag.  Just an FYI - someone told me that they had tried this but that they found it uncomfortable to apply and that the crystal dragged on the skin however, remember that you must wet the crystal first before applying.  Then this is not an issue.</li>
            <li> Works great and the size is perfect for travel and lasts for over a year. Only complaint is that the plastic is hard and fragile and always seems to break.</li>
            <li> This is about the only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works for me. At most, I&#x27;ll reapply once as the day goes on, but that&#x27;s it. Some of the competitors simply did not work for me ... and no one appreciates that. HaHa, but fortunately, this product works and appears to be the safest bet as well.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this. I made sure I was really smelly before I used it. It feels like nothing and then IT WORKS! Totally mind blown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It is more difficult to apply than a regular deodorant. It also has to be reapplied if you sweat too much (I mean a lot!). Other than that, it works fine without ever creating the putrid sweet odor that most deodorants will. Also, if deodorant makes your skin inflamed after several days of use, this stone can give it time to recover.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Armpits must be wet when applied, or it will not work. Lasts for at least a year. Easily superior to roll-ons and sticks.</li>
            <li> If your like me and you&#x27;ve tried all sorts of deodorants and everyone either left you an irritating rash or just didn&#x27;t work, then you will love this.  I have no idea how it works, its like Jipsey magic, works all day, plus im a fat guy so I perspire a good bit.</li>
            <li> probably most safe chemicals to put on the body - and it works if you are consistent and use it daily after bathing</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a friend, and I went for it since it doesn&#x27;t have anti-per spirants and doesn&#x27;t use animal testing. It does last quite a while, but I am certainly seeing it slowly wear (other reviews claim it barely changed in 4 mos... Mine is used about 1/8th of the way. Not much but definitely visible.) It seems to work, I haven&#x27;t noticed any BO personally, but it seems like the stick itself is starting to smell! Despite that it still seems to work. It&#x27;s a little weird and I&#x27;m not totally sold on it yet, but I haven&#x27;t found a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful for this product. Wish I&#x27;ve found this miracle thing sooner. After I&#x27;ve had my baby my hormones changed and no deodorant would work. This sure does. Plus it&#x27;s free off all the chemicals in regular deodorants. Best spent $2 ever!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Love it because 1. I don&#x27;t break out in a rash as I do with so many other chemically laden products and 2. a single &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; lasts for months and months and months!!</li>
            <li> hard to use, doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> works surprisingly well. stay dry for hours. have to put on 20-30 times though, and the skin has to be damp</li>
            <li> This product is odorless and goes on clean.  Works great for me.  The stick seems to last a long time.  Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have only found ONE natural deodorant to work - ALVERA&#x27;s natural deodorant - aloe and almonds. Skip the rest. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all (Tom&#x27;s, Weleda, et al)</li>
            <li> I really like this product. First off, it will take some getting use to if you sweat because this is not an antiperspirant. However, it lasts forever. I bought mine when I was pregnant with my son and still have quite a bit left and he is almost two! I rarely experience smell, the only time I do is when I am doing intense exercise or manual labor. I do sweat, quite a bit, always have but I don&#x27;t mind because 1) this product is better for my skin and 2) it lasts a lot longer than one tube of deodorant and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Simply put - I still stink. But really, this stuff is pretty weak. If you tend to be pretty non-stinky anyway and need just a little extra protection, I bet it would work great for you. If you sweat easily and work up a stink easily, good luck with this stuff. You will certainly need to keep up with regular applications, likely more than once a day (and daily showers, of course) to even stand a chance of staying stink-free. I use it on days I&#x27;ll be around the house and/or clear of enclosed spaces with other people, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d trust it in an office space, bar, or any other setting where other people are near by (at least not people I like).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works, but it works for me. If you are a person who perspires a lot, Thai deodorants may not work for you. It is amazing how it holds down order plus its safer to use. The deodorants break easily if you drop it on the sink or cabinet.</li>
            <li> Buy the pop up kind. This stick comes lose from the base and is impossible to use. The salt crystal is great though, never going back to stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me. Great for travel!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I was using a strong \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorant but found after a while that it somehow wasn&#x27;t helping or even made me smell worse.  I&#x27;m not sure if there was some weird chemical interaction going on with my body or what.  So I switched to this.  I really like that it&#x27;s just salt, so I&#x27;m not adding chemicals to my body.  It works pretty well.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s totally invincible in the more extreme sweat-inducing situations (nothing is, in my experience), but for the most part it does a great job.  I also like the smaller size because it&#x27;s easier to handle.  I had a habit of dropping the bigger one because of its awkward weight balance, and then I&#x27;d get sharp edges from the broken parts.  Let&#x27;s just say that scraping your underarms with sharp edges and then applying salt to the wound is not the best thing.  So with these smaller ones, I don&#x27;t drop them.  And they are easy to travel with because they are light.  And most amazingly, this stuff lasts forever.  I had my bigger one for a few years and hardly used any of it up.</li>
            <li> The product looks and smells as advertised, but it does not work with my body type. It does not keep the odor down at all for me.</li>
            <li> This is a natural solution that works.  Not being astute and just applying it, I wondered why it didnt work so well.  I found out by reading the directions(duh), that you had to get it a little wet running it under the faucet for a second, then applying.  Works great!  I think any complaints about it not working properly were because of this.  DAH Unlimited was a little slow.  It took like 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural way to deodorize my underarms. Thai was suggested. It took a few days for my body to get used to it, bu No chemicals, and no stinkage.  Great!</li>
            <li> If you buy this you will never go back to normal deodorant.  It is the PERFECT deodorant for men who get smelly after a limited amount of time because they sweat a lot.  Just apply vigorously with water and this will last you for a long time and will work better than every other deodorant without the aluminum the conspiracy theorists think will kill you :)</li>
            <li> I think this stuff made me stinkier. TMI I know. But how the crap is this stuff supposed to work?</li>
            <li> It works, no odor, healthy</li>
            <li> It works very well. Does not prevent perspiration but it does prevent the odor to build up on me or my clothes. Has been working well for me for the past three years or so. And what&#x27;s most important, it does not clog the skin pores which sometimes leads to irritation and bumps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they came in different sizes, I guess that was my fault. Would be helpful if it was noted in the title instead of just the product weight (there&#x27;s nothing to compare it to). Full size is only a few cents more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As for the product itself, works great if you are careful. Make sure your underarms are clean and don&#x27;t dry with a towel. I always rub the crystal with my hand, under running water before use. If you smell the crystal before hand, there should be no odor, if there is, it won&#x27;t work. These are just tips that have helped it work great!</li>
            <li> Long-lasting and works well.  One of the most effective and unobtrusive deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  No odor and leaves a clean feeling.  I use the salt deodorant to avoid unhealthy additives in mainstream deodorants, and this brand is not only cost-effective, it is also unusually effective.</li>
            <li> Always use this type of deodorant at home but chose this size for travel &amp; it is perfect!  Compact &amp; effective!</li>
            <li> This stuff has it limits, but I would recommend it to someone who needs an effective deodorant when they are not physically active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salt deodorants only work to prevent odor. That means you have to put it on immediately after your shower and let it dry. Applying the deodorant does nothing after my armpits smell. I have to wipe my underarms clean before reapplying for it to be marginally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very generous when applying the deodorant. I rub it it under my arm, from my pits to inches from my elbow, halfway to my nipple, and up to an inch on the side of my back. I generally don&#x27;t spend my entire day with my arms straight down my sides so being this generous makes sure I cover all areas that won&#x27;t breathe throughout the day. It&#x27;s wonderful at keeping me stench free for over 24 hours if I&#x27;m stationary or leisurely walking. However, it does very little when I&#x27;m performing strenuous, physical activities for more than a hour. I my underarms always smell after workout and mowing the lawn, but the scent isn&#x27;t as pungent.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  I try to limit chemical products as much as I can and this has been a nice addition to my lifestyle for the past four years.  It&#x27;s awkward to have to wet the stone first and you almost feel like it&#x27;s not going to do anything.  I still sweat, but that&#x27;s the point!  The point is to not clog your pores.  SO, if you are looking for an antiperspirant, this is not for you.  I find that if I apply it, let it dry, and then put a lotion over it, I&#x27;m good to go.  I will not use anything else!!  I gave it four stars for those of you who want to stop the sweat.  It will not do that.  I love it because I don&#x27;t smell!!!  :)  That&#x27;s a good thing.  KEY POINT - using a lotion afterwards, for some reason, really is a great combination.  (I use a natural lotion of my choice).  If you like scented, you can get a natural lotion with oil extracts to give a light scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It is simply a very hard block of mineral salt that you apply to wet underarms as a deodorant.  Contrary to the description it is not a \\&quot;push up stick.\\&quot;  It is simply a small cylinder of hard salt.  Needless to say, it won&#x27;t stop you from sweating (like anti-perspirant) and that is a good thing, unless you&#x27;re worried about sweating through clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well, if not better than, normal deodorant.  Rather than having a smell masking B.O., you simply can&#x27;t smell anything and for me it lasts all day (I&#x27;m a man and a heavy sweater).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this stuff lasts forever.  The last one I had, I&#x27;d been using for almost a year before I dropped and cracked it.</li>
            <li> Great item! Great experience!</li>
            <li> Did not think this would actually work. It does work, at least for me. Make sure to put on while wet though.</li>
            <li> great, all natural deodorant.  This smaller size is great for travelling.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  NOTE it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, just a deodorant but it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t cause under-arm stains on your clothing.  Also, it lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> I did not realize it was a small travel size, but that is okay. Be good for future use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. As a heavy sweater who has battled with sweating all my life I am truly amazed at how well this thing works. I&#x27;ve been on prescription deodorant since high school and was very very skeptical at how this thing could possibly bring me any value. Well, it did! Not an ounce of stink comes from these pits anymore! I&#x27;ve tried really really hard to make this thing fail. I still do get all gross and sweaty but there still is no stink! It&#x27;s really incredible how well this thing works. Also, it lasts FOREVER. I&#x27;ve been using this thing for about six months and the stick is still basically the same size. Needless to say, I&#x27;m pleased. Just try it, and you&#x27;ll be too.</li>
            <li> This is not effective at all. Baking soda by itself works better than this.</li>
            <li> A bit of hokey medicine, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me (maybe i just sweat and stink more than the average person?). It&#x27;s expensive for the cost and you&#x27;d probably have about as much luck with a river stone you picked up off the ground.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants before (sprays, sticks, roll-ons) and figured that this would be on the same level.  After the first use, I figured it wasn&#x27;t that hot or I wasn&#x27;t that active and that was why there was no odor as I typically had a bit at the end of the day with other options.  After a full week I have to say this is just fantastic!  It is a bit weird to get to a new routine of applying it wet and for more &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; than a traditional deodorant.  But it has been really great and I can see a single stick lasting a very very long!  After trying this for a few days I went back to try another natural deodorant (supposedly mineral/crystal based liquid) and the difference in effectiveness was huge!  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some wetness/moisture but no smell!</li>
            <li> Made in China not in Thailand like the larger 4.25 oz version. I don&#x27;t trust Chinese manufacturing on health and beauty goods.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural deodorant and I really wanted to like this but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for me. I started to sweat and stink about two hours after using it. I used it for a week to see if it got any better; it did not. I will not be able to use this, especially not in the subtropical climate I live in.</li>
            <li> Just wet it &amp; rub it on! All natural no aluminum or parabens... Works so good I forget that you can use it on the feet, too. Basically controls odor anywhere you sweat! I have the original and travel size too. Lasts over a year!</li>
            <li> Recently, in an attempt to find a more natural product I bought this Thai crystal deodorant and also bought a bottle of Milk of Magnesia to test both out. This deodorant cost me around 7 dollars while the MoM cost me only 2.50. At first I thought I was using it wrong but then I watched a video on its correct application, but it still didn&#x27;t work. After putting it on my armpits were sore from the rubbing and they would just smell worse than before, while the stick itself would also smell like BO.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I was using the cheap MoM I got, just rubbed a bit on my armpits twice a day and it WORKS! I still use it and I&#x27;m pissed I wasted my money on this crystal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;For the record, it&#x27;s not much safer than normal deodorant, either, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. It is still made out of aluminum, just not powdered.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would! I was pleasantly surprised how well it works and it seems like it will last a long time. If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural deodorant, this is it.</li>
            <li> Odorless and seemingly natural.</li>
            <li> Technically, not a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; since it has no perfumes; more of a bio-inhibitor in actual use. Takes a couple or few days of consecutive use to reach full effectiveness, as it makes your pits an inhospitable environment for the bacteria that causes B.O. Remember that you need to use it while you&#x27;re still at least slightly damp from the bath or shower, as it won&#x27;t transfer to dry skin. Surprisingly effective when used in combination with a dab of cologne, much moreso than any OTC deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Haven&#x27;t gotten around to trying it in combination w/ a proper anti-perspirant, but suspect that would be most effective &amp; comfortable of all.</li>
            <li> It works on odor very well but i still get a tiny bit of sweat under my arms.  I will continue using it because it&#x27;s all natural &amp; regular deodorant/antiperspirant is so bad for you.  I&#x27;ve tried other crystals but only the &amp;#34;Thai&amp;#34; one works for me.  Be careful not to drop it or you will have to get a new one because it shatters everywhere.</li>
            <li> I use it and I do not smell.  Works great.  Been using for about a month and no signs of wear.  This might be TMI, but to the guys who use corn starch or powder on the privates, try it down south.</li>
            <li> This works great if you aren&#x27;t planning to do anything that makes you sweat. Say, after the shower and getting ready for bed. I tried to use before going to work and either my job is too stressful or the product cant hang with traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the point of this product- I mean i used it and I don&#x27;t  feel like its going what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;My expectations for this product was so not meant!!!!</li>
            <li> I had been experiencing issues with irritation from my deodorant - tried many types.  Have been uncomfortable with the aluminum in the roll on as well as the other chemicals. this is pure and I am having absolutely no more issues.  Works as well as the main stream products.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this product for seven years and we love it.  I prefer the Thai spray, but the stone is nice for traveling.  I have used other crystals and they do not work as well for me.</li>
            <li> I give it five stars because it work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some time, I&#x27;d been looking to move away from chemical deodorants. That said, I loved my RightGuard. It was cheap, did not stain clothes like many more expensive deodorants, and I thought it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day, the rightGuard was feeling a little light, I was making an order on Amazon, and I needed a few bucks more to get my super saver free shipping. I saw this little guy, took a chance and boy am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it works MUCH BETTER than any previous deodorant I&#x27;ve used. And I&#x27;ve used a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;It last all day and I smell better than I did with rightGuard, even after a full day of work, or a hard workout.&lt;br /&gt;This little guy seems to last too. So far, it&#x27;s looking like it will last several months at the least.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t itch or burn if you have a scratch.&lt;br /&gt;And it is all natural. No chemicals or scary warnings on the label about your kidneys or not applying it to &amp;#34;broken skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you do is run it under water a bit to get it wet, then apply a couple dozen strokes to each armpit.&lt;br /&gt;Take about as much time as applying regular roll on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, so I&#x27;d buy a small one and try it out and see if it works for you. But if it works out for you as well as it has for me so far, your only regret will be not having discovered it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: people&#x27;s chemistry changes. So if the effects wear off or anything significant changes, I&#x27;ll try and update the review.</li>
            <li> i read all these reviews thinkin this product was going to be a miracle product . . wrong.&lt;br /&gt;it is a hassel to have to wet it to be able to put it on. and the slimy feeling is kinda akward. i do admit it will keep you dry to an extent. it wears off just as regular deodorant will. the only difference is this product might keep you dry , but it will still leave you musky smelling.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well and lasts forever. - - - - - - - - - - - - -</li>
            <li> I have been using this for five months.  It truly works.  I do sweat, but I don&#x27;t stink!  This little size has lasted all that time and I still have lots left.  It will probably last a year.  I can&#x27;t even stand the smell of regular deodorants anymore.</li>
            <li> Typically, this type of thing (natural, homeopathic) ends up being less that satisfactory.  This stone works actually quite well.  I&#x27;d design it so it&#x27;s less slippery, but other than that, it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product totally control underarm odor for 24+ hours, but the stone itself lasts for a very long time.  My last one has last three years.   This product is very easy to use: just wet it, swipe underarm, and then lift your arm throughout the rest of the day and evening with confidence.  Even at the end of the day, you can hug someone or get very close and not have to worry about underarm odor.  At some point the stick will part from its &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; (every one has thus far) so when that happens, I just turn the stick upside down and use the base as a holder; no problem.  Also, keep in mind that this a natural deodorant, and not an antiperspirant. If you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant only, this is the one!</li>
            <li> It works amazingly for 24 whole hours. (I actually tested it.) However, it gives me a rash. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, because I think I&#x27;m at fault. I&#x27;m a redhead and have very sensitive skin. I am going to keep it for occasions when I might \\&quot;need\\&quot; it. It doesn&#x27;t give me a rash until the 3rd day of use.</li>
            <li> I use this to stay away from deodorants with chemicals. This is good for  people who have had breast cancer or breast cancer in the family.</li>
            <li> I like this brand more than the Crystal that can be found in Walgreens. The design is smarter, and even though they should be mostly the same I think this one works better.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. It works great for me. It lasts FOREVER (unless you drop it and break it as I did). Packaged and shipped well. Fast delivery with my other Amazon items.</li>
            <li> Works great! We&#x27;ve used these for years!</li>
            <li> Yes it works, why? Because it&#x27;s made of aluminium crystals (or Alum). It&#x27;s no better health wise than your regular old stick of Degree.  The manufacturers cleverly omit an list ingredients on the packaging but if you do your research, you will learn of the aluminium crystal content.  Products manufactured overseas have very little health and safety codes so there&#x27;s no telling what else is in this stick of deodorant.  You could well be spreading some serious toxins onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are claims that Alum crystals cannot be absorbed into the skin because of there molecular size which is just completely unproven.  Molecular makeup changes upon becoming wet (you have to wet this stick to us it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want a better solution? Take a spray bottle and mix some Bobs Red Mill aluminium free baking soda along with lemon juice under your arms.  You won&#x27;t have further underarm problems.</li>
            <li> I wish I could relate to the 5-star reviews; unfortunately, this did not work for me. I bought the Herban Cowboy deodorant and it works (see below link). My only complaint is that I wish it had little to no fragrance for health reasons, but it does smell great. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004153MG4/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> It is not for me ........0 star...........</li>
            <li> the best deodorant ever. it&#x27;s small and lasts forever (unless you drop it  like i did and it breaks into a 100 pieces). there is no fragrance and does not leave any residue at all. i&#x27;ll never go back to the white or clear deodorants.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to what we have all been brainwashed to believe is the norm - rubbing poison under your arms and clogging up the body&#x27;s natural process of elimination. This allows the toxins out by our natural process, while keeping you socialy fit and feeling fresh. I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> less effective than another brand i tried.  overall, i&#x27;m not really helped by the salt deodorants in general.</li>
            <li> Different, but don&#x27;t need regular deodorant anymore, which is the point</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6 months. I work in a VERY sweaty environment and I run 40-50 miles a week... and I never stink. As other reviewers have said, it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat, just kills the bacteria that causes the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same stone for six months, with a once daily application. I still have at least 50% of the stone left. So, it truly lasts a very long time. For $4, you get at least a year of odor protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two warnings: 1.) As others have said, it is breakable! If you drop it, it will chip. Just run it under hot water and rub the sharp areas with a rough rag and you can continue using it, 2.) as I said above, it does not stop you sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you eat unhealthy, your sweat will stink, so this will not work as well for you. If you eat healthily, you will be very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one and be happy that you are not putting aluminum and other dangerous chemicals into your bloodstream!</li>
            <li> Like the product. Not good for athletes but great for desk jockeys. My stone came apart from the plastic shell rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for killing underarm odor! It leaves no scent or film like other products. The price is very reasonable as one stick lasts and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> Calculation of cost per ounce ($0.21/oz) is wrong. Please check the math!</li>
            <li> Its a great product if you can&#x27;t use the chemical laden products. Yes you still sweat but you won&#x27;t stink. Apply in a larger area then you would for other chemical stuff. I work hard and don&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> not sure yet - first time user, but if it works this is a perfect travel size and I will buy the bigger size for home</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have used this for years. It even stood up to high heat and humidity while touring in Greece and Israel last summer. I especially love that my white shirts no longer get yellow stains under the arms.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff it keeps me fresh for a long time. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t keep me that dry that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars</li>
            <li> Really great deodorant. I have been allergic to most deodorants but this one works well with no break outs.</li>
            <li> I hate using the regular stick deodorants from the grocery store.  They are so sticky and nasty and there always seems to be a film under the arms that will never wash away.  If you are a heavy sweater or doing a lot of physical labor this might not be the thing for you, but for everyday light work it&#x27;s great.  I never have any odor.  I&#x27;ve used the stone before, but it was cumbersome and I broke it from repeated drops.  This new stone with the handy applicator is perfect and so easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a non-chemical alternative to deodorants.</li>
            <li> Thai was the first &#x27;non conventional&#x27; deodorant I ever used.  My first stick lasted me almost 3 years using it daily.  The only caution with them is not to drop them... they don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Every now and then I would have a slight reaction to regular deodorant that would cause itching. I switched to this Thai Natural Crystal and at first I was skeptical as it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything when applying.  but this stuff definitely works and you don&#x27;t get that gooey feeling that you would get from other deodorants.  just BE CAREFUL and do not drop it! one of my cats knocked it off the counter and when it hit the floor it shattered even inside the cover.</li>
            <li> Switched onto natural products a couple of months ago and this was one of the first products I bought. Paid £7.20 on Amazon at the time to realise later that cheaper alternatives can be found elsewhere (High Street shops for instance or small, privately owed natural/organic online and &#x27;off-line&#x27; shops). On the other hand, I would have spent at least half of this amount on non-natural products so it is worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it over 6 months ago and haven&#x27;t used a fifth of it yet. As I have used it only in the UK where the summer have not been much present this year, I cannot comment on how it would cope with high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a pleasure so far, no stains and white marks, very effective and long lasting. I had to reapply it before and after gym but it has been flawless on a day-to-day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use plenty of water to soak your armpits before applying and apply generously in circle motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite recommendation for those looking for an alternative to chemical based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this product to stop bleeding from small cuts such as shaving cuts.</li>
            <li> We have ordered lots of these and they work great.  Leave no residue and they are a lot better than other sticks or spray deodorants.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  A friend told me about it and it works great just like she said.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Phoenix area and am testing it during the summer, so if it works here I&#x27;m thinking it will work anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent to the product, which is great, and it takes care of odor and perspiration.  It doesn&#x27;t leave residue or stains like chemical products either.  In fact, I had to wash the armpit area of my tops to get the old stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to get the stone wet and apply it liberally to the whole underarm area- not just a couple of swipes.  The directions say 30 times.... just rub it around a lot.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I switched over from antiperspirants to this and have been very impressed. I did have a period where I sweated more, but I think my body has adjusted to not having chemical prevention there. I can go all day without any odor with low activity. I might have to reapply if I do something real strenuous, but then again, I&#x27;d probably need a shower anyway. And since this crystal is so cheap and so long lasting, it really saves me money. Every little bit adds up.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the last size I had but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and it&#x27;s barely worn down at all.  So far, so good, and I have strong body odor.</li>
            <li> great all natural deodorant, I still use my Pink Sugar natural spray deodorant over it though. It does stop odors, but if this is all you are using, you would most likely need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Super easy to apply, and lasts pretty much all day! No odor at all when you sweat.</li>
            <li> LO ÚNICO MALO ES QUE EL ENVASE ES MUY PEQUEÑO, DE RESTO TODO BIEN TAL CUAL LO ANUNCIA EL VENDEDOR</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and it lasts a long time . He needed something unscented . Works well.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is so natural and doesn&#x27;t get anything on your clothes.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is that I need to reapply sometimes.  A good product, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having some issues with the name brand drugstore deodorant I&#x27;ve used for a while. My armpits were red and if I sweat at all it definitely did not smell anything like lavender. I ordered this after reading the  comments. Skeptical,  I applied as directed and holy crap this stuff really works! Getting another for my other half to work on foot odor. Totally worth your while and as the product may be small,  it will last for a</li>
            <li> The thai stone is environmentally much friendlier and better for the body than regular deodorant. It took a few days for the body to get used to it apparently (I was warned that this might be the case) but now it works perfectly. No smell at all and we have had a heatwave in the past couple of weeks, I exercise a lot and ride my bike almost every day so I&#x27;ve really put it to the test. Very happy I found this! It also seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life by a lot.....I just need to keep up with this and I will be fine. I need to order some more!</li>
            <li> Combined with another deodorant it seems to amplify it but other than that it can&#x27;t do nothing on its own. I don&#x27;t understand the reviews as it is not excellent by any means.</li>
            <li> i read all the great reviews about this product and i made sure that i applied it on my whole underarm, including part of the arms and lower part of my under arm. still this product would wear out after a couple of hours, i guess it would be nice to re-apply, but i don&#x27;t have time to take off my shirt or dress to always reapply it. I went back to my dove deodorant. body odor is not sexy!</li>
            <li> I have made multiple different recipes for homemade deodorant, and bought numerous natural ones trying to find an aluminum free deodorant that actually works.  I was very skeptical of this as nothing that I have made or purchased has worked as good as basic Secret.  This stuff is awesome.  I have never smelled with it.  Easy to put on, and not messy at all, safe and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> My husband asked for a new type of deodorant as his just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  He has been very pleased and I think I might buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> I have used to it for eight years with No irritation it is great for me![[ASIN:B000S83JR0 Thai Deodorants Thai Natural Crystal Deodorant Push-Up Stick 2.125 oz]]</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Make sure you apply when skin is wet.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and delivered promptly!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well. No odor all day after use.</li>
            <li> I am an \\&quot;average\\&quot; deodorant/anti perspirant user I suppose who has dabbled into natural deodorants and I can honestly say this was the most useless thing I tried for me PERSONALLY. I can&#x27;t say why it didn&#x27;t work for me and it worked for others clearly, but for me it just literally did nothing except burn my armpits and leave a rash.</li>
            <li> Its lasts for ever, does the job</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This size is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to wet the top before applying so it goes on easier. I am not a fan of having wet armpits when applying deodorant. I think I will purchasing or making my own with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product is great although you have to get used to the sensation that you&#x27;re not putting on ANY deodorant because there is no slick/oily feel to it. I like this!</li>
            <li> When you first put this on, it can smell a little like BO itself, but that passes once the product dries. Overall, seems to work fine for the office, and has virtually no smell. I haven&#x27;t put it to a true sweaty test yet, but I&#x27;m pleased so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/10/13. I&#x27;ve stopped using this and tossed it in the trash. Stopped working, and now smells worse than regular BO when I use it. Great promise, but just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I switched to Jungleman Naturals, and found it to be the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me but I had to stop using this after about 3-4 weeks due to a rash that started to develop on my under arms. I couldn&#x27;t really tell whether or not it was working, either. Maybe. Definitely not something I&#x27;ll use again.</li>
            <li> I got this product out of curiosity while I was looking for an alternative to regular deodorant.  This little block of mineral salts works remarkably well.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to hold up, but it does. It&#x27;s really small, so great for travel, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and it still looks like new.  There have been a couple times when I still got a slight bit of odor after an intense workout, but it was very slight and aside from those couple occasions, it&#x27;s worked perfectly.</li>
