            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>works nice</li>
            <li>So I researched different sites to find out what they used and what was the best and this product really did turn out to the best.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m a better braider, I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the hair.</li>
            <li>i am really happy with how fast the shipping was.</li>
            <li>I was looking for braiding/loose weaving hair for a cosplay costume, I thought this would be great since it was cheap, but I really needed the \\&quot;silky\\&quot; kanekalon.  </li>
            <li>it didnt cost much and whoever sent it wrote a nice note and shipped it.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>so much so that I just bought more :)</li>
            <li>I did my poetic justice braids with these</li>
            <li>I ordered about 6 or 7 just to be sure, and the purple with white tips were the best because they resembled the cosplay wigs I see on ebay, amazon, or any other cosplay online site.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really great, especially the price for so much material.</li>
            <li>These arrived very fast, and all arrived together!</li>
            <li>Very good for such a low price!</li>
            <li>its nice and long.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, it took literally 2 business days to get here.</li>
            <li>First time customer for these</li>
            <li>(water first, then heat, then repeat)</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be going through this company again!!     </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more soon for my tails.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Which is perfect, I love these, I am still waiting for my package of Jet Black, due to buying it from a different seller.</li>
            <li>My dreads did turn out fairly decent, because again first timer and all, though I would buy more in the future and even recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li>Well I recently discovered what cyber goth was a few months ago, and I&#x27;ve always loved dreads and whatnot, but both my mother and I had an issue with actual dreads in my own hair, because I want to grow mine out.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to say other than it&#x27;s perfect for cosplaying!</li>
            <li>i was using the hair for a costume it was fast with shipping</li>
            <li>it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Despite the negative reviews I still purchased this hair and it was a good choice and came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought they would be smaller, but they are really long even when braided sent to you.</li>
            <li>Straightened before hand, while extremely soft I considered looking for certain cosplay wigs from them.</li>
            <li>The Kanekalon is softer than I expected and the colors are super vibrant.</li>
            <li>Another thing was the colour Hyacinth didn&#x27;t really match the photo sample, I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to be as bright.</li>
            <li>But boy, was I wrong, It was BRIGHT.</li>
            <li>the hair was dealivered to mu house teo days early.</li>
            <li>ALL arrived at the same time and since I had never ordered this sort of thing before I was surprised by the amount of hair to each package!</li>
            <li>This one is nice, but it&#x27;s the wrong texture for me to use for my costume.&lt;br /&gt;:/</li>
            <li>I was expecting a long braid to add to my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I was a little bit skeptical about buying Dark Purple, because I wasn&#x27;t sure how dark it could&#x27;ve been, but I love it.</li>

            <li> I bought two; Hyacinth, Dark Purple, both for a set of Halloween dreads</li>
            <li> recommend for any black synthetic hair needed for any project.</li>
            <li> so I recommend order a few packs depending on what you want to do with it.</li>

            <li> Will purchase it again it came with a tracking number and i love it i still have my hair braided</li>
            <li> Hair gets everywhere but it&#x27;s to be expected. Once I&#x27;m a better braider, I&#x27;ll buy again. Would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li> totally not what I was expecting. I was expecting a long braid to add to my natural hair. It was shipped in two bunches of loose hair. idk how i can actually attach that to my hair. There as no instructions on how to actually get this braid on the road....It was cheap so whatever...</li>
            <li> I had ordered 4 different types of kanekalon jumbo hair. ALL arrived at the same time and since I had never ordered this sort of thing before I was surprised by the amount of hair to each package! Very good for such a low price! I will most definitely be going through this company again!!     Thanks!</li>
            <li> this hair is good for braids,locks,twists,whatever. works nice its nice and long. i loved it. good product and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I did my poetic justice braids with these</li>
            <li> Despite the negative reviews I still purchased this hair and it was a good choice and came in a timely manner. Im currently deployed so snail mail is all I understand but I am pleased with the hair. Not much comes in the package so I recommend order a few packs depending on what you want to do with it.</li>
            <li> I love these! I bought two; Hyacinth, Dark Purple, both for a set of Halloween dreads I am currently making. These arrived very fast, and all arrived together! I was a little bit skeptical about buying Dark Purple, because I wasn&#x27;t sure how dark it could&#x27;ve been, but I love it. Another thing was the colour Hyacinth didn&#x27;t really match the photo sample, I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to be as bright. But boy, was I wrong, It was BRIGHT. Probably even brighter than the photo. Which is perfect, I love these, I am still waiting for my package of Jet Black, due to buying it from a different seller. Hopefully it&#x27;ll come soon, and I&#x27;m definitely buying from them again.</li>
            <li> Great for synthetic dreads!!!! Was really impressed with it for my use.</li>
