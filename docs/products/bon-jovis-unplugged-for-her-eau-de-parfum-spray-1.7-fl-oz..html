            <li> I really like this. It smells so good. My husband likes it on me too. And even cooler is its from Bon Jovi! This seller is really good too. She was really good about getting to me and communicating with me when there was a problem and was really good abou taking care of it and getting me my product. Would defiantly buy from her again and recommend her to others,</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me a headache but somehow I&#x27;m pretty tolerant of this one. Love the scent - to me it&#x27;s sensual and confident in a laid back, totally non-cloying way.

            <li> Love it! I get complements all the time on how I smell good!</li>
            <li> Arrived WELL ahead of estimated shipping date. Bought it for my wife, she adores it. I think she smells great in it, so it&#x27;s a win-win. She was heartbroken that it&#x27;s discontinued though.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, but the way it was pictured and worded, was supposed to be a 3 piece set. Got totally ripped off.Would not recommend buying from this person</li>
            <li> Very great product and totally worth the price. It arrived within 2 days once I ordered it. I am so happy this is apart of my new collection!</li>
            <li> omg it smells Great!! And i got it quicker than i thought it would. I didnt need to wait long to smell good lol</li>
            <li> Be careful, the picture shows three items but you only receive the perfume. and are paying more than the add selling just the perfume.</li>
            <li> This was cheaper than the actual Avon price which I was very happy about. It arrived on time and actually quicker. I bought it as a Christmas gift and my mom loves Bon Jovi. It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful.  The smell of the perfume is delightful.  The price is reasonable.  The name BonJovi clinches it for me!</li>
            <li> you only receive the bottle..not the 3 piece set as pictured... the bottle alone can be purchased elsewhere for less money.. shop around.</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance to have a very nice, light scent. it is not overpowering. the cover is somewhat hard to get off. overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> Great smell and of course it&#x27;s from Bon jovi</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves this scent, it could be because she loves bon jovi though!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much i am so glad i found this. I never thought i would be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> Love it and so do other people that smell me! Men and women.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with seller.  Product a little more powerful than I would have liked, but love the fragrance.  I wear it only for evenings.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sisters birthday and she was so happy</li>
            <li> You will NOT get the items shown. You only get the bottle of perfume. Misleading on the sellers part. You will not get the lotions.</li>
