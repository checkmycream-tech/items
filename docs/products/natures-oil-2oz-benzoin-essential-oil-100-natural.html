            <li>So this product was the best deal on Benzoin that I could find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>I use it in an oil diffuser and it fills the room up with great calming energy.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more of this one!</li>
            <li>However, it does cloud the oil somewhat, but adds a really nice bouquet to it.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product Thanks</li>
            <li>Benzoin is a remarkable and useful tool.</li>
            <li>Love this oil..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but you can add a dropper top for 80 cents if you buy from Bulk Apothecary.</li>
            <li>One of those ingredients is called &amp;#34;Stacte&amp;#34;, and one of the best suggestions I could find about what Stacte actually is (or was in Moses&#x27; day) was &amp;#34;Styrax Benzoin&amp;#34;, or perhaps Bezoin blended with Myrrh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this stuff</li>
            <li>and I look forward to experimenting with it and enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>Great smell and one of the most affordable essential oils (not a fragrance oil)</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell, but is very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experimented with diluting it yet, but I have found that it does blend well with light olive oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick like honey and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Pretty good, is a thick syrupy liquid that is easy to dilute.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving it, my first impression was &amp;#34;What a lovely-smelling pancake syrup!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This stuff is thick and very strong smelling!</li>
            <li>I had to throw away my bath bombs as using them made me and the tub very sticky.  </li>
            <li>As far as essential oils are concerned, this one is ok.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it yet (hence the 4 stars), although the smell is heavenly and the oil is nice and thick, like syrup.  </li>
            <li>it is very useful in applying long term bandages or even treating foot blisters, or providing second skin for hikers, etc.</li>
            <li>I was searching for the ingredients in Ketoret, the holy anointing oil that is described in the T&#x27;nach (Old Testament Bible).  </li>

            <li> ;  I really do like the fragrance, but the thick consistency is a bit of a surprise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if is is because the water is not hot using Ultrasonic Diffuser, so this oil remain in the cup, or this is just normal?</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of Benzoin Essential Oil, I&#x27;m not sure is that normal, it is very very hard to get a drop of oil from the bottle, so I used a liquid dropper to get the oil, but it&#x27;s so hard to squeeze one drop out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly thick and clearly doesn&#x27;t have an alcohol base, as its more of a syrup than an oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a sturdy really dark amber bottle, doesn&#x27;t have a dropper</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this oil.. I use it in an oil diffuser and it fills the room up with great calming energy. Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this oil to use in the making of bath bombs.  It does have a nice smell, but is very sticky.  I had to throw away my bath bombs as using them made me and the tub very sticky.  I had to take a second bath just to scrub off all Benzoin Oil.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> Tincture of Benzoin and Benzoin oil should be in every home. Besides the off shelf use for croup like cough it is very useful in applying long term bandages or even treating foot blisters, or providing second skin for hikers, etc. Benzoin is a remarkable and useful tool.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s thick like honey and smells wonderful! I&#x27;m using it in home made lotions and creams. I&#x27;ll buy more of this one!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I add it to almost all of my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> Great smell and one of the most affordable essential oils (not a fragrance oil) you can buy. The bottle is a sturdy really dark amber bottle, doesn&#x27;t have a dropper but you can add a dropper top for 80 cents if you buy from Bulk Apothecary.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I plan on adding it to my homemade soap, soaks, lotions and balms.  I have not used it yet (hence the 4 stars), although the smell is heavenly and the oil is nice and thick, like syrup.  I may need to come back and amend this rating once I get to finally use it.</li>
            <li> As far as essential oils are concerned, this one is ok.  It&#x27;s incredibly thick and clearly doesn&#x27;t have an alcohol base, as its more of a syrup than an oil.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, is a thick syrupy liquid that is easy to dilute. I do not believe it is diluted with alcohol, but what concerns me is the bottle does not list what it is diluted with.</li>
            <li> I was searching for the ingredients in Ketoret, the holy anointing oil that is described in the T&#x27;nach (Old Testament Bible).  One of those ingredients is called &amp;#34;Stacte&amp;#34;, and one of the best suggestions I could find about what Stacte actually is (or was in Moses&#x27; day) was &amp;#34;Styrax Benzoin&amp;#34;, or perhaps Bezoin blended with Myrrh.

            <li> This is my first bottle of Benzoin Essential Oil, I&#x27;m not sure is that normal, it is very very hard to get a drop of oil from the bottle, so I used a liquid dropper to get the oil, but it&#x27;s so hard to squeeze one drop out.  I use the Now Foods Ultrasonic Oil Diffuser which I bought here on Amazon.com http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Ultrasonic-Oil-Diffuser/dp/B00GLO7M00/ ,  I added 3 drops of this Benzoin Essential Oil plus 2 drops of another essential oil into the water in the oil diffuser and turn the diffuser on.  I checked the diffuser next morning, and found that there this Benzoin Essential oil still inside the diffuser cup.  I&#x27;m not sure if is is because the water is not hot using Ultrasonic Diffuser, so this oil remain in the cup, or this is just normal?</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and very strong smelling! Very cloying heavy sweetness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product Thanks</li>
