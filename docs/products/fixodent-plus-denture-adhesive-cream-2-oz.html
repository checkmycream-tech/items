            <li>It was great.  </li>

            <li>glad to find this on Amazon, it works great</li>
            <li>great price for this item and so nice to be able to order 4 at once.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
            <li>Fixodent Control was the best product ever for upper denture wearers.</li>
            <li>I received 6 more tubes but they were scope flavored</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I would recommended this product for sure</li>
            <li>Keeps the food out and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Much better that the fixodent you get in a grocery store.</li>
            <li>It is better than most fixodent denture product, but the one I&#x27;m looking for is the very first denture product</li>
            <li>After trying two other products I have found Fixodent Control the best denture cream for me.  </li>
            <li>I use this with a lite dusting of polident powder on my uppers, wait about an hour before eating or drinking, and I&#x27;m set up fine for the day.</li>
            <li>Excellent food seal, precision nozzle prevents mess with some practice.</li>
            <li>I got this free from BzzAgent to try.  </li>
            <li>Lets be honest, your not biting apples and eating corn on the cob all day with dentures, but you will get thru a normal day of eating with this stuff...</li>
            <li>just says original not original/complete.  </li>
            <li>this is absolute proof that I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you seller for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Super product</li>
            <li>I believe him since he is hard to please on a good day!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how: Circle your top denture with Food Seal (with two extra stripes as shown on the tube).</li>
            <li>I think this one works better then several others offered</li>
            <li>It comes out in a very narrow nozzle and holds really good.  </li>
            <li>This food seal really works good,I&#x27;VE BEEN USING fIXODENT for over 30 years,</li>
            <li>Thanks you Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its not what I really ordered but it works</li>
            <li>It has been working very well</li>
            <li>Cleans off of the plate and gums pretty easily compared to some other adhesives.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to clean the extra cream from my gum line and taste cream for an hour.  </li>
            <li>been using this version for a couple of years, no complaint at all,,</li>
            <li>I love the small opening and absolute control I get with this nozzle.</li>
            <li>The small nozel at the tip of the opening helps you to be able to put the Fixident just where it is needed and you don&#x27;t over fill the dentures to overflowing in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I love the small nozzle.  </li>
            <li>No better than most.</li>
            <li>Now, tip off the water while squeezing the powder to completely cover the denture (and the paste).</li>
            <li>There is no waste.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the dentures tight enough that they feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Totally waste of money and not sure this product is genuine!</li>

            <li> While Fixodent Food Seal is not great, you can get a super hold if you combine it with Fixodent Extra Hold Powder.</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> The only thing i am not wild about it that its a paste would rather have powder.</li>
            <li> This particular one is not sold at my local store so buying in a small builk of 4</li>
            <li> Next, turn on a LIGHT STREAM OF COLD WATER, run your denture under the water for a few seconds, carry the denture (with the remaining water) over to the toilet.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not very strong anyway.</li>
            <li> I find I use less.  </li>
            <li> I like the \\&quot;stick\\&quot;, and the small amount I need to use.    </li>
            <li> I have used Fixodent in the past, and will definetly use it again.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in our neck of the woods.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze</li>
            <li> Sorry about that!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the purchase.</li>

            <li> Perfect! Everything i needed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the purchase. You&#x27;ll notice on the picture it says Fixodent CONTROL, which is what my mother wanted. I received the regular Fixodent. I&#x27;m not returning it just because of the hassle involved, but won&#x27;t be ordering from this source again.</li>
            <li> It did not perform as advertised</li>
            <li> Been using Fixodent for several years. Although they have changed the name several times the product still does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in our neck of the woods. This is a great deal - 4 for a lower price than 2 around here if found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best adhesive I ever tried.  It comes out in a very narrow nozzle and holds really good.  My one complaint is that it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze but I&#x27;m not very strong anyway.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest denture adhesive I&#x27;ve found.  I like the \\&quot;stick\\&quot;, and the small amount I need to use.    Clint.</li>
            <li> Fixodent Control was the best product ever for upper denture wearers. For some reason, Proctor &amp; Gamble took it off the market. Fear not. While Fixodent Food Seal is not great, you can get a super hold if you combine it with Fixodent Extra Hold Powder. Here&#x27;s how: Circle your top denture with Food Seal (with two extra stripes as shown on the tube). Next, turn on a LIGHT STREAM OF COLD WATER, run your denture under the water for a few seconds, carry the denture (with the remaining water) over to the toilet. Now, tip off the water while squeezing the powder to completely cover the denture (and the paste). Turn the denture over and shake of the access. Put your denture in your mouth and hold in place with your thumbs for 2 to 3 minutes and you have a hold comparable to Fixodent Control (still wish P &amp; G would bring it back though). Keep smiling!</li>
            <li> Sent 2 tubes instead of 8,  I sent message. I received 6 more tubes but they were scope flavored and I wanted unflavored. I sent 2 messages and did not hear back.</li>
            <li> ADHESIVE IS GREAT, WIDER DISPENSER TIP NEEDED THO</li>
            <li> Father still swears by this as the best out there....I believe him since he is hard to please on a good day!</li>

The small nozel at the tip of the opening helps you to be able to put the Fixident just where it is needed and you don&#x27;t over fill the dentures to overflowing in your mouth. A great product.

            <li> This food seal really works good,I&#x27;VE BEEN USING fIXODENT for over 30 years, been using this version for a couple of years, no complaint at all,,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this version of Fixodent has vanished from the shelves where I shop. I love the small opening and absolute control I get with this nozzle. I was so happy to find it again. Thanks you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent food seal, precision nozzle prevents mess with some practice. I use this with a lite dusting of polident powder on my uppers, wait about an hour before eating or drinking, and I&#x27;m set up fine for the day. Cleans off of the plate and gums pretty easily compared to some other adhesives. Lets be honest, your not biting apples and eating corn on the cob all day with dentures, but you will get thru a normal day of eating with this stuff...</li>
            <li> Its not what I really ordered but it works okay. I would not recommend this to a friend. Sorry about that!</li>
            <li> glad to find this on Amazon, it works great</li>
            <li> After trying two other products I have found Fixodent Control the best denture cream for me.  I love the small nozzle.  I find I use less.  There is no waste.  I don&#x27;t have to clean the extra cream from my gum line and taste cream for an hour.  Thank you for the extra touch of scope.      Beege</li>

            <li> It is better than most fixodent denture product, but the one I&#x27;m looking for is the very first denture product just says original not original/complete.  I don&#x27;t know why they keep changing things</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and the seal does not stick on at all! Totally waste of money and not sure this product is genuine!</li>
