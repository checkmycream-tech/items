            <li>The best thing is that it comes with an oil so that it does not stick to your skin.  </li>

            <li>I have tried a lot of the home hair removal products and have never been impressed.</li>

            <li>An excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is the best home wax I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff!</li>
            <li>also think this was an excellent buy since there are 3 jars of wax included in the purchase.</li>
            <li>but the wax was not the greatest at removing the hair.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>

            <li>This wax IS the BEST at home wax for bikini, underarm and even legs!</li>

            <li>If you want to remove hair from this area, I&#x27;d say the best approach is laser hair removal.  </li>

            <li>An awesome product!  </li>
            <li>Ok.....this wax is wonderful......</li>
            <li>it works excellent for me....</li>
            <li>but nevertheless i&#x27;ve had the best luck with this.</li>
            <li>Best wax around!</li>
            <li>The best way I found to wax is this: I sit on a towel in my bathroom (because it&#x27;s so well-lit) with a mirror in front of me.  </li>
            <li>Is the best.</li>
            <li>practice makes perfect (almost with anything!)</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE YOU USE THE OIL!!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good waxing product.  </li>
            <li>This product is very good at removing all of my pubic hair.</li>
            <li>After reading (mostly) very good reviews about this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell very good and didn&#x27;t grip the hair as well...</li>
            <li>and it is very good quality.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>Good luck waxing!</li>
            <li>Once you heat it up just throw it on the wax warmer and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>It does a good job!  </li>
            <li>Get a good rip, tighten the skin, and rip it fasssst!</li>
            <li>but I was blown away by how much I loved it!  </li>
            <li>but once I did, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>lol)...</li>
            <li>It works great for your bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I think it looks great (on me and on women).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a brazillian yet, but I thought I could try this wax out on my armpits and it works great.</li>
            <li>its great...</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The armpits were great, as well as the &#x27;stache....</li>
            <li>The provided Oil is great for conditioning the skin and helping to protect it  </li>
            <li>Price is great too.</li>
            <li>The oil that comes with the kit is great to use before and after waxing.</li>
            <li>Surgi-wax is a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>the experienced - you will rate this a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Waxing.</li>
            <li>Either way it turned out great.</li>
            <li>The best part about sugar wax is that if you make a mistake, the sugar rinses off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>The wax also heats up great in the microwave as intended-</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I purchased 5 jars of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just started waxing- great for a beginner</li>
            <li>Great at home wax.  </li>

            <li>Worked great on bikini area.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is great for any part of your body.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and I will recommend it to people who are looking for microwaveale waxes WITHOUT STRIPS.</li>
            <li>Now, and this is a great tip ladies, I use a candle warmer to heat the wax.</li>
            <li>I liked the results, but knew that wasn&#x27;t the best method</li>
            <li>This is great priced wax.</li>
            <li>so this makes a great kit for all you at home users.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy about that.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The price is great, it is a quality product.</li>
            <li>Truly a great product.</li>
            <li>STILL wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a great product</li>
            <li>A happy wife is a happy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on your pits too.</li>
            <li>this wax is great.</li>
            <li>Once they stopped selling it in stores I was so happy to find Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li>This wax is great for bikini waxing or Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li>great product i felt no pain</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>SURE YOU USE THE OIL!!</li>

            <li>Love this wax!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>it is very effective for removing hair by the root.  </li>
            <li>works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>it is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This wax was amazing!</li>
            <li>I am loving it!</li>
            <li>hear from my friends that Gigi is really the best, but for this price, and for what a great job it does, I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have to say this stuff is amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li>It is excellent, way better than the Nad&#x27;s brazilian wax.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely thrilled to find that Amazon had it listed for a pack of 3!</li>
            <li>i am happy again!:)</li>
            <li>What works best for me is trim the area to about 1/4\\&quot;, the longer hair you have, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li>Very happy and will be buying more of this once I use the leftover jar &amp; the two unopened boxes.</li>
            <li>:o)  </li>
            <li>nice product!</li>
            <li>This wax is very strong, and at the subscribe and save price, a very good deal.  </li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found out there and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This wax is easy to use and does a great job!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and has great results!</li>
            <li>Awesome product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>this wax works very good and the price was even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very good with most beauty things ..</li>
            <li>Very easy and save you lots of money!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product I can no longer find anywhere in stores, so I was happy to find this 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>you have to have a good treshold for pain if you want to try brazilian wax yourself.  </li>
            <li>I started with a Sally Hansen product, and it was good, however, it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that it removed everything.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>This wax is good for all types of waxing, not just Brazillian.</li>
            <li>(good thing this</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it seemed like a good idea for hard-to-reach areas that are not flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This box costs about $6 and all you need is some time and a good mirror.</li>
            <li>So just say goodbye to your jankiest towel and put it to good use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I found baby oil to be a good substitute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You are on your way to looking good once you get over the intimidation factor of brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I know how great this product works, this requires microwave which I don&#x27;t own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works about as good as you&#x27;d expect it to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll need a good mirror.</li>
            <li>Really good buy for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always suspicious of good reviews but this one is legit.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>The brazilian went relatively smoothly, though there is a learning curve of how to do it best, depending on your preferences, skin type, and sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Always a good price</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>If you want a perfect wax you will still have to fork over the $60 at a salon, but for a good, basic wax this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>That said, I am very pleased witht the result and use this for legs, and eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li>Sooooo happy to have it here, love amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this product works great make</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and the instructions were very detailed!</li>
            <li>lol  works much better..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Good luckay to get nice even applications,</li>
            <li>Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt a bit more on non-oiled parts, so beware!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>think if I&#x27;d ever been waxed before, this product would work a lot better, but after almost 2 hours (it took me 2 hours just to find this stuff - it was sold out in every store I went to!)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the pretreatment oil that comes with it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I Love this wax!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>After trying it - I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did though!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I tried this for my first try at at-home waxing and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>Love this wax!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>so make sure you put the oil all over, including in any hair you want to keep!</li>
            <li>Will buy more!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Will use Tend Skin product (see link below) to make sure ingrowns stay at bay!</li>
            <li>Will keep ordering more!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It works great as it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>and I just used it; it is easy to use and the results are GREAT.</li>
            <li>Gives great results and easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Gives great results and easy to do.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, easy to use</li>
            <li>Do not forget to apply the pretreatment oil first!!!!</li>
            <li>The three pack is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>Now when I say amazing, keep in mind, you are still pulling hair out of your body...still hurts.    </li>
            <li>My results were amazing-</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and the packaging is great.  </li>
            <li>This 3pack for Brazilian is great because its cheap, and it comes with the oil to use beforehand.  </li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good idea to re-apply oil there to make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do not need fabric strips to use it which is nice.</li>
            <li>I have always liked this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better with practice, but after you get the hang of it, it works as good as being at the salon and paying 60 bucks.</li>
            <li>I also liked the smell of the wax</li>
            <li>There is so much \\&quot;junk\\&quot; on the market, so I am compelled to comment on great products!  </li>
            <li>but I bet it was my own fault.</li>
            <li>so believe me when I tell you, once you learn how to do your own waxing, the time and money you save is substantial.</li>
            <li>The wax smells good, like i&#x27;m burning some exotic candle.</li>
            <li>and honestly this is the cheapest place my wife has found to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Had to find my own way of waxing after moving to a town that didn&#x27;t offer Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li>I end up throwing those out each time and using my own tongue depressor for application.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best brazilian waxing kit.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was three separate jars.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll be honest with you-</li>
            <li>A warm shower beforehand helps.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t even melt like it suppose to when you warm it up in the microwave for 60seconds as directed...</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the work I was able to accomplish in the lower areas.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a lost art for my generation</li>
            <li>It is so gentle, and best of all....easy!!</li>
            <li>Warm it if until it is runny and stringy</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too.  </li>
            <li>Its kind of cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have twizers handy because after you wax, if there are some hairs still there, you can easyly take them out because the heat from the wax has opened the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i sit when waxing with a mirror propped up nice and close.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own Brazilian for years...</li>
            <li>i use it to make a nice line</li>
            <li>I used to pay a lot of money at the salon for waxing, now I can do it on my own.</li>
            <li>you never used this before, a warm bath or shower helps.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used Surgi products before, I was fairly confident this would be good as well...</li>
            <li>Do your own waxing.</li>
            <li>It works great and the price is right!</li>
            <li>I ended up with great results, and most importantly my new husband LOVED it!</li>
            <li>Trial and error will kind of help you out because it will vary by how course or fine your hair is, but this is a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews in so many places.  </li>
            <li>Just received today and practiced with my armpits and it was easy and fairly painless.</li>
            <li>work great and a good price too thanks</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and</li>
            <li>and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy and virtually painless.</li>
            <li>and is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use...</li>
            <li>far as the temperature is concerned, you just have to experiment with what works best for you.</li>
            <li>This magical Surgi stuff is reeeeally weirdly effective--</li>
            <li>This is the best wax by far.</li>
            <li>One of the more effective and affordable waxes.</li>
            <li>So far, my boyfriend says this is the best waxing job I&#x27;ve done on myself.  </li>
            <li>it is by far the best product i have found.</li>
            <li>This wax is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>As far as the wax itself goes, it did an awesome job removing hair!</li>
            <li>this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>I even brought the coffee pot warmer in my room to try to keep the wax warm, but I still needed to micro many times.  </li>
            <li>This lady teaches you a BRILLIANT trick on how to \\&quot;flick\\&quot; the wax to get it ready to pull up.  </li>
            <li>Surgi Wax is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>I love all surgi wax products which by far i think is the best brand for waxing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many a wax and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Love this product, very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s great value for the quantity you get (still haven&#x27;t finished my first box)</li>
            <li>this is a great product &amp; with that being said make sure that when you warm up the wax there is a whole in it so it can come out.</li>
            <li>Very important.</li>
            <li>The oil is very important though because if you do not use it the wax will stick to your skin.</li>
            <li>I will never change the wax that I use because it is easy and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and it makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li>The good thing is this stuff is cheap, and relatively easy to use.  </li>
            <li>However, after I showered and exfoliated the area (exfoliating afterwards is very important to avoid ingrown hairs), I applied more of the oil to the area, and also rubbed some into my hands.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for this product and people seemed to love it.</li>
            <li>I have to go over areas more than once</li>
            <li>Instead I have bumpy skin with a lot of sporadic hairs, not that sexy.</li>
            <li>If you can trust your partner to help you, it might work out better.</li>
            <li>I find with the cooler consistency, I use more wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(yeah you may laugh, I&#x27;m a good sport,</li>
            <li>It became more of a project that took about a week, than a before shower thing.   </li>
            <li>and then I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it in stores.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon.com has it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since tried the strips and like them so much more.</li>
            <li>, I know women are more tolerable to pain</li>
            <li>sure you follow the directions</li>
            <li>i think its a hundred times better than shaving).</li>
            <li>The more times you use it, the easier and faster it</li>
            <li>I started using it in August of &#x27;09 and have repurchased it many times.  </li>
            <li>) Make sure you use the oil and re-apply if you need to.  </li>
            <li>it is perfectly safe as babies put it inside their mouths &amp; is used for tatooing.</li>
            <li>You can find myriad sexual benefits if you spend a minute searching.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much, much better.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re an expert at getting them--then you&#x27;ll probably love this</li>
            <li>how much more could it</li>
            <li>Also don&#x27;t wear a bra or top.</li>
            <li>Go with the strips, they do a much better job...</li>
            <li>Make sure you trim your hair to 1/4th of an inch.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I probably could have trimmed a bit more, but I wanted to make sure to get every hair.</li>
            <li>you should include more spatula and better quality spatulas.</li>
            <li>and I think that it works better for pits and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting the silk epil for my legs and pits and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>you wont be able to get it off.</li>
            <li>But if you follow the instructions well, it couldn&#x27;t be better and easier.</li>
            <li>I found this way better than shaving since 1 day after shaving I&#x27;d get stubble and itch.</li>
            <li>with my 1100 watt microwave, I had to microwave for more than 2 minutes before the wax was spreadable.</li>
            <li>I still find myself &amp;#34;over-microwaving&amp;#34; the jar for more than a minute to make the wax more spreadable.</li>
            <li>One thing, is I wish it came with more oil.</li>
            <li>Just make sure a fan is on in your room</li>
            <li>to get myself to a point where I felt confident doing this, no problem, so it&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t read the directions or</li>
            <li>If, however, you are going to be using it for your more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, do yourself a favor and use the oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sugaring is okay in a pinch for my legs</li>
            <li>Hope you have more luck</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>It gives interesting info on how brazilian waxing started &amp; also has a couple helpful illustrations.       </li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re used to the pain &amp; hair is more thinned out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but man I didn&#x27;t have anyluck.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;d feel more at ease if someone else does it &amp; knows more of what they&#x27;re doing.     </li>
            <li>more than I&#x27;d like to tweeze one by one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this wax online.</li>
            <li>and i love that amazon sells it as a subscription also :)</li>
            <li>and B)make sure to use the oil in the kit on your skin to be waxed and your hands to make sure you can get the wax off your hands.  </li>
            <li>I love this waxing kit.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the oil.  </li>
            <li>Takes about 5-8 mins per underarm-- leaves them smooth, creamy looking and lasts forever!     </li>
            <li>Some of us sit on the floor for the top parts of our bikini wax, some of us stand.     </li>
            <li>I was able to do a BETTER job than the results I get for paying between $60 and $80.</li>
            <li>I will say that the wax worked much better on my underarms than my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It is mostly soybean oil.</li>
            <li>I do not have to go over the area more than once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no faster than strip wax, but the results are better.</li>
            <li>I do not have to go over the area more than once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no faster than strip wax, but the results are better.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps! :)</li>
            <li>And I have 5 more to go....haha</li>
            <li>With the strips, you have to buy more</li>
            <li>And yes do use the oil a lot of it.:))</li>
            <li>but this one is more than I can handle.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years; they changed the formula and it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>Surgi Wax is definitely the best in brazilian wax, in terms of getting the job done, price, and pain level.  </li>
            <li>Start from your bum, and work your way toward the top.  </li>
            <li>luck :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>When used along with South Beach ultimate skin prep solution you will have the best, pain-free brazilian wax ever!!</li>
            <li>bits at a time - its more time consuming but works</li>
            <li>bottom to top -</li>
            <li>This is probably the #1 tip I can give because this caused me the most grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and hopefully I get better results then.</li>
            <li>Mostly.  </li>
            <li>But if you love your hoo-ha...</li>
            <li>am SO glad I found Surgi-Wax on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy i found this product thanks to all its glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more $$ in my pocket.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use this product and love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is grown out about 1/4 inch or so.  </li>
            <li>For the price that I was paying at Sally Beauty supplies for just 3 of the Brazzillian wax, I pay just $3 more, and get 6.  </li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using this wax for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best brazilian waxing kit.</li>
            <li>Its much better than the wax with fabric.</li>
            <li>I had to reheat it once or twice more to get it to a liquid consistency as recommended.</li>
            <li>All in all, i really love this product and will continue to order this via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also noticed more ingrowns with this stuff.</li>
            <li>wax is a much better value</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the quality is better too.</li>
            <li>This wax has a much better consistency.</li>
            <li>It was $5, I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do my bikini line otherwise.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>it seems to cook the wax and make it more brittle when you try to use it.</li>
            <li>I could use another type of oil but in all honesty, I don&#x27;t think this is for me as it requires more skill and experience-both of which I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>So I had to add more time and more time....</li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s been using this was for MANY MANY years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this wax.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>So shaving for me caused more problems than it solved.</li>
            <li>and I have still yet to find something better.  </li>
            <li>I love this wax.  </li>
            <li>I use many others &amp;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this wax for many years.</li>
            <li>This product works, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up! :-)</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for underarms.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love that I can do whenever I want</li>
            <li>Make sure you have nothing around that you love....</li>
            <li>Just love this wax.  </li>
            <li>For you ladies out there, your better off just going to an esthetician.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times</li>
            <li>so I hope this helps someone. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>There are better and easier to use products.</li>
            <li>I think you would be pleased</li>
            <li>you want to make sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve bought a couple more of them already.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as smooth as after salon!</li>
            <li>Gigi is much better both microwave and warmer</li>
            <li>And will be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>but i will get better at it.</li>
            <li>I love Surgi wax.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin, great to pull out all of the hair without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li>Now have to use the self heating sally Hansen, which is ok, but takes forever to heat up in its metal container, so no microwave option:(&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried ice, more oil...to no avail.</li>
            <li>account. :)</li>
            <li>Amazon is a way better deal.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>The wax got all over my counter top, all over my hands, and under my finger nails.  </li>
            <li>It hurt more than anything</li>
            <li>I have been doing my waxing for many years.</li>
            <li>She probably wonders why she hasn&#x27;t seen me for weeks and weeks, and unless Amazon stops selling this stuff, she probably won&#x27;t see me ever again.  :)</li>
            <li>and I love it just the way it is.  </li>
            <li>When you apply thicker amounts the better</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Although you don&#x27;t need strips, I use them because it makes it easier for me to apply more wax and pull it.</li>
            <li>also love the Pre-Epilation Oil as it prepares my skin for the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for selling great products like this Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li>But strip wax works best on relatively flat surfaces.</li>
            <li>I use to use it when it was available in stores, and now I order it from here because it&#x27;s easy to use, and better than the strips!</li>
            <li>It also will give you nice clean lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and clean-</li>
            <li>There were a fair amount of stray hairs but that was mostly my fault for not knowing exactly which direction the hair was growing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>directions say put on microwave safe plate - important to note, as you are using the wax, it can drip and scraping one side of the applicator against the side of the jar can create drips...not easy to remove from the plate you might pick, so plan to designate this plate just for waxing!  </li>
            <li>sure to scrub and clean the area before beginning!</li>
            <li>Moom Organic Hair Remover Refill, 6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]] does a pretty good job at getting about two-thirds of the hair off but can be wiped off if you&#x27;re in over your head for</li>
            <li>Pretty good wax for bikini area.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions exactly, you will have good results...</li>
            <li>works pretty good, although doesn&#x27;t get all the hair all the time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this 2 days ago and was so excited to get it today!</li>
            <li>Greatly reduced pain, in-grown hairs and re-growth (or ‘new growth’)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never done any intimate hair removal, the smooth skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>I was able to easily rip out the hairs.</li>
            <li>Also, because it hardens quickly, you want to keep the jar warm or reheat to keep the sides from getting gunky while you&#x27;re working.</li>
            <li>I find that a hotter, more runny wax works best for me, but that is also harder to apply by yourself.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow instructions, most important is to use the supplied oil.  </li>
            <li>It was actually very easy to use and not nearly as painful as when my friend did it.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in the wax not sticking to my skin when I used more oil.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>It worked amazing on the underarms (don&#x27;t forget the oil and make sure its hot when applying) and</li>
            <li>:) Smooth, no ingrown hairs at all, no irritation or even soreness.</li>
            <li>And then enjoy some nice, clean, smooth skin...</li>
            <li>I used up a full jar doing one Brazilian!</li>
            <li>I am blonde and fair!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trush the other reviews posted here saying that this is a great product, what a liers!</li>
            <li>, you can re-use each tub two or three times, making this SO much more economical than paying a pro!  </li>
            <li>I have gone to spas to get them many times, so I am familiar with the prep work and the aftercare.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so easy - and not painful!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that easy for it to come off.</li>
            <li>Though, it still doesn&#x27;t get rid of all your hair, but you can easily use tweezers to remove those.   </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve been a fan of this wax because of its easy use.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require any muslin strips.</li>
            <li>Doing it at home was easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and equipped with pre-expilation oil.</li>
            <li>Moom took off about 90% of the hair, and it was easy to re-do an area without any additional pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surgi Wax is easy to use and removes hair from the root.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and stayed</li>
            <li>and it did not come off easily at all.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>an the container is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It is salon quality and easy to use.</li>

            <li>BUT this product was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Have been giving myself Brazilians for years using it, so easy to use.</li>
            <li>really easy &amp; works for awhile.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I like the results after using this product, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>if this happened to me it could easily happen to a beginner</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, there is alittle pain</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with and takes all the hair off.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Virtually painless and so easy and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heats easily and quickly,&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just completely easy to use and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I like to use a strong kitchen roll(paper) with it.</li>
            <li>It was so strong it took off my eyelid skin</li>
            <li>The stuff smells sort of nice, but that&#x27;s the only good part.</li>
            <li>Really worth it if you want to save money and stay nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Then I will smile at the nice smooth results.</li>
            <li>It was perfect at keeping it at the right consistancy throughout the entire waxing.</li>
            <li>I am a first time waxer, and because of the (mainly) amazing reviews I decided that Surgi-wax would solve all my shaving problems.  </li>
            <li>so thrilled that I will be able to maintain my tidy look with such an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled that I will be able to maintain my tidy look with such an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever used a wax of any kind</li>
            <li>Works beautifully for underarms as well as facial hair.  </li>
            <li>The first is to put it in the microwave a bit longer: It is supposed to be kind of runny.</li>
            <li>So I read the instructions and followed exactly, except I had to warm the wax</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be successful, it will help if you&#x27;re using this product as maintenance between getting professional service.  </li>
            <li>I have only used for arm pits but can tell it&#x27;s very good quality wax and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Everything was going fine until I tried taking the wax off.</li>
            <li>However, the first wax will hurt since there&#x27;s a lot more hair with a lot more holding it in.    </li>
            <li>Even fine hairs.   </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>when you first start waxing, it hurts, no way to get around it, but will get better the more you do</li>
            <li>I am usually fine with pain and have been waxed before but when you have to continually grab another part of the wax because it will not rip off together, THAT HURTS.  </li>
            <li>Pull it off quickly!  </li>
            <li>and I did not have the courage to rip it off quickly and so many times..</li>
            <li>I have used almost every home wax product available and this is hands down the best bikini wax.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely rely on and love this wax!</li>
            <li>and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I will say is that I took some Motrin before I began, and I think that made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Also, never attempt to do a huge area all at once.  </li>
            <li>The suggested times are accurate, just remember to stir it.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find that accurate.</li>
            <li>Using the oil before waxing was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>It also qualifies for free shipping if you sign up for that automatic shipping thing, so just try it out.</li>
            <li>I have also had success with a cooler wax, a more gummy consistency.</li>
            <li>of course it&#x27;s not pain free</li>
            <li>I then moved out from that patch that I had just waxed, and it was smooth from there.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap (compared to a $80 session at a salon) and does the job</li>
            <li>If your brave enough I would recommend this money saving option.</li>
            <li>This wax worked fantastic on the fronts of my legs, where the hair all grew in one direction.  </li>
            <li>I think soft wax &amp; sugaring is more ideal for larger areas that don&#x27;t have too many nooks and curves (like your legs).</li>
            <li>This wax is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>--Wax in whatever position you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Before I can really review this wax, I&#x27;ll be completely honest with you: this hurts like a b</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>so I could be silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The prep oil makes it sticky wax free so you don&#x27;t get it stuck on your finger and nails.</li>
            <li>stuff works and will leave u just as smooth as the salon.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this honestly I didn&#x27;t believe all the complaints about it hurting so much.</li>
            <li>If I do I will get back on here and say how great it is</li>
            <li>Figuring out timing to remove wax is important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from perfect and far from painless, but it works and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it did not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I was brave enough to try this.  </li>
            <li>I received it in a very short time and it was in great condition.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really happy with this product</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.</li>
            <li>So my second shot was with Surgi after reading great reviews on here.</li>
            <li>B00008BK7H NeutrogenaBody Oil, Light Sesame Formula, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>candle, cup, or wax warmer to keep the right consistency is a huge help!</li>
            <li>and it took everything right off :)</li>
            <li>This is saving me so much money from going to the spa every month!!!</li>
            <li>YOU TEST IT FIRST!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li>--DO ENJOY your new brazilian wax!!!     :)</li>
            <li>I was excited to walk Ulta yesterday to see this product priced so cheaply.</li>
            <li>But for all you nay sayers, definitely try this because it&#x27;s a great wax that really gets EVERYTHING leaving it silky smooth, and is also probably the most pain free wax I&#x27;ve used (oxymoron for pain free and waxing, I know).</li>
            <li>Works like a charm every month for a clean smooth.....</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>(first wax ever, never got it done professionally) but I am really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely liked Parissa, but the price is so high.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at the drugstore, recently, so I was thrilled to see it is available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works, it smells great and lasts a long time.   </li>
            <li>i love love love this waxing kit personally.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed usually</li>
            <li>Make sure your body heat isn&#x27;t too hot, or it won&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>At the pack-of-three-price I find it&#x27;s better to just throw away the rest of the jar and start fresh each time which seems to be cost effective compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for a professional session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the pack-of-three-price I find it&#x27;s better to just throw away the rest of the jar and start fresh each time which seems to be cost effective compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for a professional session.  </li>
            <li>but it is so worth it!  </li>
            <li>So even if you are too scared to do a Brazilian, this wax is worth it for your underarms!</li>
            <li>My finger poked through a crust on top into hot liquid wax underneath.  </li>
            <li>but overall, it works nicely!</li>
            <li>I am more than willing to do this again.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try waxing</li>
            <li>Is there a better one to use if you are waxing for the first time ever?</li>
            <li>To save money, I then began buying Poetic Waxing from Bliss.</li>
            <li>Best small area wax I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate, apply oil, make sure the wax is not too hot (just as instructions recommend), then pull off without any strips.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, however I suffered a severe allergic reaction to it that lasted for about a week.  </li>
            <li>First time heating up the wax takes more than a minute for me.</li>
            <li>strongly suggest using a mug warmer with this as the wax does cool somewhat quickly (by design I think).  </li>
            <li>Doesn’t get real hot, so no burning, hardens quickly, and the prep cream makes it as pain free as the activity can ever be.</li>
            <li>It does manage to get a lot of the hair off, however, never on one clean strip.</li>
            <li>Then it is easiest to clean by chipping away at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I brought this because I figured if women use this for their more sensitive areas then it will surely be ok to use on my chest.</li>
            <li>More amazing because my local stores all seem to be switching to Nair products which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed before with waxing strips which I find the most effective and convenient because you can reuse the strip multiple times for those problem areas.</li>
            <li>Either I had to shave them or go to a salon to get them clean.</li>
            <li>the end result is perfectly clean underarms.</li>
            <li>The Nads product boasted having a pleasant mango or similar tropical fragrance-</li>
            <li>it is still very soft and tidy.</li>
            <li>(sometimes many many moons later), smooth as smooth can be and grinning.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Brazilian style and this is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t hurt if you know how to pull right.</li>
            <li>I love surgi wax and have used it for years - it is absolutely superior to the other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>The wax comes right off!</li>
            <li>so I can enjoy some intimate time with my husband!!</li>
            <li>This product does a very good job; although once used it leaves the container messy, it removes the hair painlessly.</li>
            <li>Best hard wax for bikini area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity as it once was a great product.</li>
            <li>I really stocked up :-)</li>
            <li>If you have never used it before make sure you apply the oil liberally before you wax, it really makes it easier for the wax to come off.</li>
            <li>You just apply the wax, wait about 30 seconds for it to cool, then peel it off.  </li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;The kit consists of a tub of microwaveable wax that you pop into the microwave for about 15-60 seconds, depending on how full the container is.</li>
            <li>You must use the oil provided reap the full benefits.  </li>
            <li>The oil works very good.(be sure to apply before waxing)  </li>
            <li>You also may need to reheat the wax before you&#x27;re finished if you are slow and methodical and intent on achieving perfect results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(my friend was becoming an esthetician and I was her first time).</li>
            <li>I have loved Surgi Wax for doing my upper lip</li>
            <li>No idea if that is true or not,</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I did what it said and the product didn&#x27;t remove as much hair as I wanted or it purported itself to be able to.</li>
            <li>I only use this product when I&#x27;m not in the mood to spend the money on a good wax.</li>
            <li>This wax seems to hit the sweet spot of cost, pliability, and grip.</li>
            <li>I love the oil that comes with it, it really makes the wax peel off easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gone through a full jar and a then some (which gave me about 2 brazilian waxes)</li>
            <li>Wait to cool.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really attribute it to the wax for sure.</li>
            <li>but i cant use it for a full brazilian waxing</li>
            <li>but its overall a good product.</li>
            <li>The wax is not bad at all</li>
            <li>I apply the muslin strip quickly to the spot I want to wax, wait for it to cool and rip it off.</li>
            <li>(other than some hair.. LOL).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this on other parts of my body with great results.  </li>
            <li>Why isn&#x27;t this brand more popular or widely used, I wonder?</li>
            <li>my hair seems to grow out fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Place the container on a paper plate in the microwave for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>For people who say it solidified too quickly, there are two things you can do.</li>
            <li>but I was lucky to have a wax warmer</li>
            <li>Then, when you try to pull it off quickly, it gets stuck to your skin</li>
            <li>and I would have to go over the same place more than once and sometimes more than twice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my results were WAY better than expected.</li>
            <li>Generously apply the provided oil (super important!).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I tried a quick test on the knee which didn&#x27;t even hurt and proceeded to start on a side just about level to the clit.  </li>
            <li>That aside, great solid no frills product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>but if you apply it to thin it will not work, you kind of have to find that happy medium.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different waxes, and this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>is BEFORE it&#x27;s fully hardened otherwise it will break and you end up turning one quick moment of pain into 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dries too quickly and cracks</li>
            <li>I love this particular Brazilian wax product because it doesn&#x27;t require wax strips.</li>
            <li>There are lots of other good (long) reviews that give great tips, read those.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, cheap, does not hurt like normal waxing.</li>
            <li>Have some Goo-Gone handy (general sticky-removal product) to remove wax from your fingers and furniture...</li>
            <li>I was able to finish the job, but what would normally be a 15 minute routine took me an hour from start to finish.  </li>
            <li>also doesn&#x27;t as quickly and cleanly as it says, but this was my first kit that I bought and not a bad choice I would say for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Before I tried any major areas I decided to do a really easy place, my knuckles, lol I have some blonde hair there that has always bugged me.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for any beginners or anyone who wants a easy and quick solution for hair removal.</li>
            <li>So I just use this for hard to reach hairs in certain creases that razors cant get to very easily and work great for me.</li>
            <li>Its super first time user friendly</li>
            <li>When I used my new wax purchase, I was extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This wax is awesome and, as long as you can tolerate the self-induced pain that comes along with an at-home wax, it definitely gets the job done with salon-quality results!</li>
            <li>Okay so let me start off by saying I was very scared when I first bought this.</li>
            <li>I had been using for years and really work for me, and with the pre-oil makes the hair easy to pull out off.</li>
            <li>The wax was fresh, hardened quickly when applied and removed without residue.</li>
            <li>But this is the easiest to use in that you can quickly microwave it, it does not require strips, and the pot has a great little handle to carry the mug.</li>
            <li>I lay the paper in a single strip over the wax once i apply it over my skin (when the wax is still warm)It helps give a good grip.      </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much easier to rip off quickly, which honestly does make it effective, and much less pain.</li>
            <li>it is an entirely different (and better!)</li>
            <li>I knew nothing of waxing and now after my first Brazilian wax, I felt like a pro!</li>
            <li>always remember to put the oil on first too!</li>
            <li>Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that works for me - love it!</li>
            <li>On the first try I felt like I was in a salon in my home town in Brazil!</li>
            <li>They are smooth (not stubbly) for the first time in my life, and if I do it right after I get out of the shower it does not hurt at all.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot less pain (be honest: you&#x27;re ripping hair out, it&#x27;s going to hurt a bit), but it&#x27;s more than bearable.  </li>
            <li>So, even if it did gave me great deal of pain the first time, and some mess to clean up, it does get the job done.</li>
            <li>Started way out at the edges of the hair and that worked fine -- it really stung, but it wasn&#x27;t outlandish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be able to do it myself, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, hairy girls, get it done by someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing your first time!</li>
            <li>My wallet is grateful and my calendar is a little more free being able to do this by myself</li>
            <li>, nothing beats the fast &amp; smooth effects of Surgi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, hell, I wear 4\\&quot; heels to work sometimes, the pain is worth the beauty aspect of it.</li>
            <li>If you spill hot wax just leave it and let it cool and harden.</li>
            <li>Ladies its cheaper using this kit at home rather than going to the salon and plus its with your own private eyes.</li>
            <li>Even though I knew what to expect pain wise, there is definitely a learning curve involved in mastering this skill which is probably why the salons charge so much to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, and it works.</li>
            <li>Your skin tends to be more sensitive where it&#x27;s closer to the belly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about trying to wax on yur own, definitely try this!  </li>
            <li>In a more sensitive area, let&#x27;s say.  </li>
            <li>It does take about a box a leg however if you&#x27;re not totally grossed out by your own leg hair</li>
            <li>I just did my second waxing on my own and it was</li>
            <li>My biggest gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t lift good in the harder to reach (oh so tender) areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be happy to pay extra to get it professionally done in a salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been either getting brazilians or doing my own for 12 years, and when I don&#x27;t want to pay someone to do it for me, this is the only viable alternative.  </li>
            <li>Do it every three or four weeks, and apply it in thin (1mm) layers for the best results.</li>
            <li>I would rather do a bikini wax on myself than let someone else do it again, I was bruised and going to a professional was MORE PAIN and not to mention COSTLY than doing it yourself.</li>
            <li>this wax works well but not on the most sensitive areas..</li>
            <li>a useful epilation oil included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, when I finally started moving inwards after getting the edges, it was some kind of hell.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the effort to curse at.</li>
            <li>Also, after reading reviews, I was paranoid that I would leave the wax on too long, but I found that I was often trying to pull it off too soon, so I know now not to be so quick to jump the gun.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a FANTASTIC product, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you MUST be sure of is to follow the directions and clean the area thoroughly, then use plenty of the oil they provide.   </li>
            <li>seriously, i save so much waxing myself with this awesome wax.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to not get your skin as much, and it&#x27;s significantly easier to pull out the hair....</li>
            <li>I admit that it might have been easier for me, because I have been going to the salon for this procedure for 2 or 3 years now, so the hair is much thinner by now, easier to pull off, and I am familiar with the procedure.</li>
            <li>The right temperature wax and the right amount of pre-epilation oil.</li>
            <li>just wanted to add that I started using tea tree oil right after I wax</li>
            <li>just wanted to add that I started using tea tree oil right after I wax</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect it to all just come right off like when you shave.    </li>
            <li>Apply pressure to the skin right after you pull the wax.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I should say right up front that I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian at a salon...</li>
            <li>I found that it defiantly needs to be in the microwave longer than the directions say, right out of the package or remelted.</li>
            <li>The hair just lifts right off after putting on the oil and wax.</li>
            <li>The wax came right off my nails!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I will spend the extra money to make sure I get it done right!</li>
            <li>Just had to try it on right away.</li>
            <li>I could kiss the inventor right now.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re reading this right now with your legs splayed...</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff that is gentle enough to use on your face and tends to pull out more hair than the other brands, plus its inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten a professional wax before, and i wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the first time being one with everything out there...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use when following the directions.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and relatively painless!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wax to get smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I am super happy that I bought this, as this will probably be my new &amp;#34;hair down there&amp;#34; maintenance routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of self-waxing kits and, by far, this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>But considering this was my first time doing it myself, I know I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Considering the price per waxing at home compared to having it done at a spa, I think it&#x27;s worth the self-inflicted pain for so much cheaper vs the professional inflicted pain for considerably more money.</li>
            <li>and then WAIT for it to cool by stirring and blowing on it gently.</li>
            <li>Romantic life effectively ruined; and I could have probably opened my own waxing place with the money I&#x27;ve spent dealing with ingrowns.    </li>
            <li>The microwave directions are a very general guideline, you will have to start on small settings and figure out what works best for your microwave.</li>
            <li>Its the only wax that removes everything and is soooo easy to use with no strips!</li>
            <li>Maybe a little messier, but I am sure I will get better with practice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you put a muslin strip right over the hot wax when you apply the was, you don&#x27;t have to do the \\&quot;peel up\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping as well.   </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and not messy at all.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered that waxing my armpits is far superior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>One negative is having to get up from my barricaded room to warm up the wax in the micro many times.  </li>
            <li>I usually wax between my eyebrows while the wax is still hot and it works great there too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>whole process took me about 45 minutes for my very first try.</li>
            <li>For comparison purposes, I think the Completely Bare wax is more effective in that it grabs hair better and removes more hair per application, but it is extremely messy to use due to</li>
            <li>I wanted to quit and throw it away, but I got on youtube and found that very very helpful video.</li>
            <li>I need it very fast</li>
            <li>More effective than soft wax and cloth strips  Removes the hair more effectively &#x3D; less overall pain (having to redo it)  </li>
            <li>The product leaves the same smooth, clean look as the salon without the cost.</li>
            <li>Its super easy to do my pits now, and relatively mess-free.</li>
            <li>so my brazilian waxing appointments were one of the first expenses I cut from my budget.</li>
            <li>I use this wax the most for the majority of my hair removal; not just for private parts.</li>
            <li>and, well, waxing isn&#x27;t supposed to be completely pain free.</li>
            <li>, it will be hot when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>I had to go back to the microwave 2 more times...</li>
            <li>You might try Orajel Max strength; even tho it feels funny when applied</li>
            <li>Plus, as you wax more, the hair grows back thinner and finer.      </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more than enough oil to cover everything you&#x27;re going to wax, so don&#x27;t skimp.  </li>
            <li>(this is my first time waxing...)</li>
            <li>This product really didn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li>The first strip hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>so make sure you start low)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a first time waxer, yes, it will hurt.  </li>
            <li>I received this product within the timeframe quoted and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This is to make sure you pull on only the hair and not your skin since without oil the wax will stick to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>You know exactly what you&#x27;re doing and how to do it, even if you&#x27;ve never tried this before now.</li>
            <li>I followed many tips people had left on here</li>
            <li>Is it really worth this much pain to be hair-free?</li>
            <li>exactly* what you are getting into here</li>
            <li>I have tried out many different waxes over the years...</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>which is how i came across it in the first place.</li>
            <li>It can be time consuming if it&#x27;s your first wax</li>
            <li>When I first started waxing I went to a salon/spa and paid up to $60 every 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Worked very well!</li>
            <li>It is either too hot or too stringy.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I used the oil first).  </li>
            <li>This guarantees a very even application!</li>
            <li>If the wax has a watery consistency, it is too hot.</li>
            <li>PS, I bought a MisterCoffee cup warming plate to keep the wax hot after microwaving it.  </li>
            <li>Not only will it prepare you for the pain, but it will also give you a much better idea of how to use this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first pot.  </li>
            <li>The first problem was that I heated the wax in a microwave for the prescribed time, but it wasn&#x27;t melting.  </li>
            <li>So when you do the brazilian yourself with SurgiWax, you won&#x27;t need to cover so much ground!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll thank me later :)&lt;</li>
            <li>You just heat this in the microwave and its ready!  </li>
            <li>works really well!</li>
            <li>first time I&#x27;ve waxed after avoiding at home waxing for a while....</li>
            <li>The thing that hurt the most was the hair ripping out when I was peeling back the first bit to grab on to.</li>
            <li>i have used so many different waxing products...</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T forget to apply the oil first.  </li>
            <li>First, the wax takes way longer to heat up then the instructions state.  </li>
            <li>I took Tylenol and even used a numbing cream the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>If you go any larger it becomes a bit more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the oil in the box before starting.</li>
            <li>Just heat and lay it on while it&#x27;s warm..not hot</li>
            <li>It was my first time waxing</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my first time waxing brazilian</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order some more packages together with Surgi wax for facial hair....</li>
            <li>I used it for the second time yesterday and it was wayyyyy better than the first time.</li>
            <li>The second time around, i felt more at ease</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Also note, this was my first time waxing myself</li>
            <li>Fast waxing!</li>
            <li>I was really upset til i found it here on amazon, and CHEAPER!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain about the price--3 jars for under $20 bucks--compared to how much brazilian wax costs!</li>
            <li>Go get one done professionally first</li>
            <li>so you get a first hand experience on how they do it...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>You MAY be able to get more than one application per jar, but I only had about 1/4 of the jar left and just threw the remainder away.</li>
            <li>I actually saw one drop of blood on that side, but it felt like it should be much more.  </li>
            <li>I admit this is the first time I tried waxing.</li>
            <li>First time I purchased I tried it for both my under arms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>First time users-</li>
            <li>The first time I tried (before I watched the youtube video)</li>
            <li>You then just have to heat up the wax for 30 sec or so in the microwave and when its warm (but NOT scorching hot)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even halfway through the first and my oil is just about gone.</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Also, prepare to use the tweezers because it most likely will not remove all hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only wax that has actually been able to remove most or all hair</li>
            <li>and you will end up using way more wax than you need and may have to redo the area.&lt;br /&gt;-I apply the wax against the hair growth (not in teh same direction like the container</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, this isn&#x27;t rocket science.  </li>
            <li>The first time you wax your snatch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time waxing or first self wax</li>
            <li>/&gt;Technique: I made some mistakes as it was my first time</li>
            <li>like I did the first time and it will take longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about as much time as it would if went to the salon, but just for a portion of the price!</li>
            <li>a glass of wine prior to waxing give you more courage to pull, and numbs it a bit  ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this</li>
            <li>First off the heating times on the instructions are way off.</li>
            <li>i think a candle warmer or something to keep the wax hot is a must...</li>
            <li>I have used this several years and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and it was the first time I&#x27;d waxed by myself.</li>
            <li>sure enough...</li>
            <li>When me and my husband decided to move to the US to persue our master&#x27;s degree one of the first practical worries that I started having was how on earth</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;d try this one since it had such lovely reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first at-home brazilian.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 2 hours since it was my first time, and then I decided to try it on my underarms, as suggested.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on my legs but they require too much wax to make it worth it.</li>
            <li>I received my latest shipment yesterday and tried to wax my underarms as I have done many times in the past.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used wax.</li>
            <li>First time will hurt, so buy some numbing cream to put on it 2 hrs before you use this wax.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this wax I was horrified.</li>
            <li>You must prep your skin first with an oil they provide, then apply the wax.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that the hair that grows back is softer, but its definitely more manageable (grows in one direction).</li>
            <li>First of all i had to heat the wax for WELL over</li>
            <li>I realize that some people say that this improved version of surgi wax isn&#x27;t as good as the old one, but I unfortunately never used the former wax, so I can&#x27;t really say anything about that.</li>
            <li>This wax is very easy to use (can be a little messy) and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Keeping in mind this IS waxing in a very sensitive area, I found the level of pain to be acceptable and much more tolerable than salon soft wax strips.</li>
            <li>If you will be waxing anything more than a tiny area I would suggest using cloth strips as this wax will tear if the area you are trying to remove is too large.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, take some kind of pain med before waxing and remember that pain threshold is lowest just before menstruation.</li>
            <li>but it was not worse than it was at the salon, actually the wax was way better.</li>
            <li>As long as it isn&#x27;t too hot on your skin, the hotter the better.</li>
            <li>I was only able to do the very front part.</li>
            <li>I actually use this on my legs, because the formula is superior to the regular Surgi-Wax.</li>
            <li>you must pull the wax as soon as it is not sticky, it feels soft , moldable but not dried, it will hurt but is better than shaving or wax strips.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 6 months and loved the results...until my last shipment.  </li>
            <li>i am a first time user of ANY kind of wax &#x27;down there&#x27; and took a chance on this product after reading the reviews...</li>
            <li>It is a little more involved than I originally thought so</li>
            <li>It took me a long time, because I needed more practice.</li>
            <li>do too much at once; I had to do my first home waxing over three sessions over a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this wax before but this time I used the strips with the wax and it worked a lot better with them and it didn&#x27;t take as long.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that it was just the first time that hurts so much...</li>
            <li>I bought a Mr.Coffee mug warmer with this product and it kept it at a consistent temperature during the whole process.</li>
            <li>First, the application is straight forward.  </li>
            <li>My tips: make sure you DON&#x27;T leave it on too long.  </li>
            <li>If it runs off the spoon too fast then it&#x27;s too hot and your burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Also, please note if you wax your whole face for the first time you will break out.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is really good for its price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very painful, better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Decent product, I&#x27;ve used better products around the same price range.</li>
            <li>I started using this product for my upper lips several years ago, as it is more cost effective than the smaller product marketed for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Honestly id rather pay someone to do this because at least then id know it was done right!</li>
            <li>I just want to start this review by saying that this product gets 4 stars because it was easy to use, worked great on the areas I was able to get done, and was overall not an unpleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews have said that the product takes longer to heat up than listed, but I found that the directions they provide are pretty accurate (and I only had to reheat</li>
            <li>Sounds easy enough...</li>
            <li>I eventually got through the entire area quite easily</li>
            <li>This wax never hardens enough to be pulled off easily.</li>
            <li>You know those remnants of wax that you always have left that easily wash off with soap and water?</li>
            <li>If you use it straight out of the microwave when it&#x27;s very creamy, of course it&#x27;s going to be hot.</li>
            <li>Ripping off soft wax hurts and is super</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do this close to the time of your period when skin can be more sensitive in general.</li>
            <li>It is SO simple and easy.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, but I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>, you must microwave it to heat it up, so you&#x27;ll be giving... certain parts radiation.</li>
            <li>I found myself having to shave over certain areas the wax didn&#x27;t fully get.</li>
            <li>I use a Brazilian hard body wax, because its easy to use, and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff!!    </li>
            <li>You might have to let it cool a little bit right out of the microwave, but once it&#x27;s a comfortable temperature</li>
            <li>It totally worked- fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The pre-puberty look has never been one I wanted to return to, but I do like the idea of being nearly hair free lower down for cleanliness and maybe to encourage my husband to spend more time there.  </li>
            <li>Hard to warm up to the right temperature without being too hot.  </li>
            <li>If you want to be thorough, you definitely need a mirror to get in all those nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;- When I first started waxing, I thought it would hurt more the further back into your precious lady.  </li>
            <li>Gets the fine hairs as well as the bigger ones for a hairless result</li>
            <li>After I finish waxing I can massage with a little oil (it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind) and any clinging bits of wax come</li>
            <li>I recommend getting one of those little pads that you plug in to keep your coffee warm and setting it on there.</li>
            <li>My wax always seems to take a little longer to heat than the instructions say but it stays warm plenty of time to wax um...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for people trying to wax the first time.</li>
            <li>For the die hard &amp;#34;do-it-yourselfer&amp;#34; this product is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Once I got the technique down, it was easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experimenting with a slightly wider and more flat tipped version and that seems to work much better.  </li>
            <li>I need more practice to perfect using this product, as it took me 2-1/2 hours to wax my entire bikini area and certain areas were a lot more painful and harder for the wax to pull up than others</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to get a professional one, at least look up tutorials or videos on how to do this if you want great results.    </li>
            <li>the oil before waxing DEFINITELY makes a huge difference, so does taking the time, and not trying to pull too soon.</li>
            <li>Yes, Brazilian bikini waxes are very convenient...</li>
            <li>I have tried others and they are very lacking.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>very liquidy/</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be tentative, if you go fast it won&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helps to see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to use and gets all the hair as opposed to strips.</li>
            <li>I really with someone</li>
            <li>fit into the former description</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and works very well.</li>
            <li>This made grabbing the tab much easier.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really bother me much.</li>
            <li>Just pop it in the microwave and its ready to go.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier than the stuff with the paper or cotton strips for removing</li>
            <li>I have very course hair and this wax kept it off for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you want to wax your eyebrows or anything else, this is a very cost-effective way too get all the wax you need.</li>
            <li>If using it on your face, you really don&#x27;t need to use the prep oil.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>But having my lady parts ripped/pulled at was just too much to bear.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
            <li>someone else do it would have gotten it done much quicker.  </li>
            <li>This is not flimsy stuff, but neither is it that super-hard consistency you get when you heat the Parissa too much on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it to wax my underarms, and it really is almost painless.  </li>
            <li>THUS, I HIGHLY recommend Surgi-wax!</li>
            <li>Then I sit on the very edge of the stool and use the magnified side of my hand mirror set on the floor, so that I can see where to apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product cools to fast once out of microwave and stirred.</li>
            <li>hair, the longer the hair, the harder for the wax to stick and more chances</li>
            <li>Maybe I used too much wax?</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I used the oil to remove piece by piece haha</li>
            <li>The box comes with two \\&quot;wooden spatulas\\&quot;, or small popsicle sticks, which worked great for first use.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know how much it would hurt..</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;honey\\&quot; consistantcy the whole time I needed it without a warmer.</li>
            <li>I also advise not to pour too much on because then the wax won&#x27;t stick to the hairs</li>
            <li>The pre-wax oil really helps.</li>
            <li>Unless you really, really have a lot of self control.</li>
            <li>It really hurts.</li>
            <li>So much.</li>
            <li>because I really almost didn&#x27;t make it..&gt;</li>
            <li>I invested in a cheap corning ware one that is a different pattern from those I eat off of.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the pain part much</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s supposed to hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one really sticks to the hair</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and underarms and it is quite gentle.</li>
            <li>If the wax has hardened too much, then it hurts removing the wax.  </li>
            <li>but it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying it!</li>
            <li>It did not remove hair very well in my experience.</li>
            <li>Saves me so much money to do it myself.</li>
            <li>The oil that comes with it to keep the wax from adhering to the skin is also really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t burn you and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It also cooled EXTREMELY fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product to wax my armpits myself.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works very well</li>
            <li>Doing it by yourself takes forever and it really hurts.</li>
            <li>the product works and its much much cheaper than going to the salon or even purchasing Bliss&#x27; at home kit (which i find the container to be bulky and it does not have a cover).  </li>
            <li>and yes, it does hurt but not as much as I</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really hurt to me...</li>
            <li>I ventured a bit lower and found that it did not hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li>It took out the thicker hairs really well</li>
            <li>If you think you put too much, get a piece of notebook/computer paper and dab a bit, then rub evenly with your fingers to redistribute the oil evenly again.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for the underarms and bikini areas.    </li>
            <li>I like this stuff as much as a person can like something that is basically used for torture.</li>
            <li>which means you don&#x27;t worry about having too much wax and no way to yank it off.</li>
            <li>The wax solidify fast.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HURTS</li>
            <li>I love this item, I use to but it at any pharmacy but now only amazon and a a few more websites sell them.</li>
            <li>Then again, I could be putting on too much wax.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, I really like it</li>
            <li>This wax surrounds the hair and makes the pulling/removal really easy.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I have so much experience and confidence waxing</li>
            <li>Order really was an order of 3 boxes.</li>
            <li>so I can pull fast.  </li>
            <li>cleanup is REALLY easy.&lt;br /&gt;- as recommended by someone else, the tea tree oil after, it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I tried it on my underarms and never had so much pain.  </li>
            <li>Once it thickened i tested it on my leg and it was still really sticky.</li>
            <li>The economy isn&#x27;t really working on my favor either.</li>
            <li>so i muddled through the whole process wishing i had cut the hair a tad shorter...</li>
            <li>and i would also buy some oil since i was using canola after the whole process to try and get some wax off me...  </li>
            <li>I might try again soon, but with much hesitation.</li>
            <li>is to much.</li>
            <li>Was an absolute catastrophic mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really bummed.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Surgi.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let it harden too much.</li>
            <li>When you peel it off, it comes off in pieces not the whole strip all at once.</li>
            <li>but is real wax I put it on the microwave for  1 minute then</li>
            <li>I have been using this wax for about 8 years now and highly suggest it!</li>
            <li>Also, I suspect they integratged some kind of agent that lets it only soften properly for one time.</li>
            <li>It applies unevenly, there&#x27;s no way to get nice even applications, and then there&#x27;s the added dripping of wax all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you follow all the steps carefully, it won&#x27;t hurt much any more.</li>
            <li>So this was a big leap of faith for me to use wax on this even more sensitive area.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t do it without or you will be going back and forth to keep the jar warm enough to work with.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just going to tidy up around the edges, as it were, this is doable and not too messy.  </li>
            <li>It is the only waxing kit that I found to be convenient, effective, and simple.</li>
            <li>Do not spread it on too thin or try to offset that by reapplying more on top.  </li>
            <li>I have tried scrubbing, rubbing with oil, attaching to a muslin strip, rubbing the area with a thick moisturizer, but this garbage is here for good.    </li>
            <li>You want to melt the whole bottle, which will help it from harding as quickly, but be aware it melts from the middle</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s mainly because this is such a great product for getting all the pesky little hairs.</li>
            <li>Used as directed, it comes off easily and leaves the skin bare and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of waxing, but I decided to give this a try due to good reviews....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for other areas of the body too, like the upper lip, tummy, bikini, and the rear!</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own pain tolerance, and this is a sensitive area, so don&#x27;t read other reviews saying it is &amp;#34;pain-free&amp;#34; and think it will be for you too.  </li>
            <li>I read more positive than negative and quickly became optimistic.</li>
            <li>, you can re-melt the used wax (stuff it back in the original jar) and reapply.</li>
            <li>This product is the only wax in the United States that in near as good as the south american waxes - mess free!</li>
            <li>Of course some areas hurt more than other, but just woman up and deal with it if you don&#x27;t want to see hair in that area for 2+ weeks.</li>
            <li>Works as well or better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>other than that, I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to use once I got the hang of it-a bit messy at first.</li>
            <li>Very few strays, clean application and strong hold.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it, really I did.</li>
            <li>After my first wax the hair took about 3 weeks to grow back and it came in much thinner (which I was pretty excited about because I have always shaved and everytime it feels like it comes back thicker and thicker).</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, about that sub-label \\&quot;use for private parts\\&quot;... I don&#x27;t see how that makes it special...</li>
            <li>I used up half a jar for both my underarms but probably used more than I should have because each application was really thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s quite tricky and you need to be somewhat of a contortionist to actually carry out this procedure on yourself, it really does a super job if you take your time and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty clear.    </li>
            <li>exactly that of my professional appointments</li>
            <li>One jar is enough for a full wax job if you recycle the beginning pieces which I tend to do.</li>
            <li>It has been 2months since my last full body waxing:</li>
            <li>Unlike Sally Hansen, it doesn&#x27;t become brittle as soon as it is cool enough to touch.</li>
            <li>I nearly packed up after that first one.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it barely hurts and it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>have zero experience with bikini waxing of any kind professional or home, and I thought that it would be a lot more complicated than it was.</li>
            <li>Not really messy, unless you are a first timer..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to tell when the wax is too hot to apply (burns down there &#x3D; ouch!), and it removes hair really well -- even when it&#x27;s on the shorter side --</li>
            <li>Secondly, I highly, highly, highly suggest getting a professional wax first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doable, but I HIGHLY recommend going somewhere and getting it done professionally the first time.</li>
            <li>Its easy to be discouraged when using it for the first time just because you need to get organized and find out how long is actually long enough to microwave it (since I usually had to microwave it for double what the directions said, maybe even more), and most importantly, get used to the fact that if you&#x27;re new to waxing, its going to hurt (but you get used to it if you stick with it-</li>
            <li>This hard wax is more time consuming but worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as other home wax kits, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to Brazilian waxing, I would bypass this and go straight to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I like it more runny because you can use less wax but still remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>Assuming that you get three uses out of a jar, you are paying less than two bucks per wax session :-)</li>
            <li>I was half done, or better say un-done...</li>
            <li>I do think the private areas are easier done in a salon, as it is quick</li>
            <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll have to go over the same area more than once</li>
            <li>After refining your skills and knowing what to expect, it only gets better and is actually addictive.  </li>
            <li>A quick tip from a male user.</li>
            <li>However, I will definitely be buying a pack of more for the next time.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will get lucky and it will be, but likely there will be some pain.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face.(It&#x27;s more economical,then buying the facial wax and works the same.)</li>
            <li>In my microwave, which isn&#x27;t older than 4-5 years, doesn&#x27;t quite melt the wax in order to use it on myself with the suggested time.</li>
            <li>main thing to know is that this product works</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s the main stuff you need to know.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have dedicated time to actually do the waxing, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner.  </li>
            <li>-Surgi doesn&#x27;t even know) and no other product removes hair as quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be investigating their other products for waxing those larger areas and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a smooth, bare bikini line or more!</li>
            <li>It gets most of the hair out (and I mean 99%), it&#x27;s very reasonably priced (1 jar lasts me 4 waxes), and it doesn&#x27;t hurt... that much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using a lot of oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as the title of this review suggests, this isn&#x27;t for the squeamish or newbies--unless you have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who has a fairly high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommened this product.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to waxing and have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will now have it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will now have it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone looking to save money on salon waxing services and can handle some pain.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gets less messy as you do it more and get used to it, but still; make sure you lay out some towels.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m not woman enough for this product, even though my favorite movie is Scarface</li>
            <li>Start carefully, then enjoy your new look!  </li>
            <li>I just put some baby powder on my legs, make sure the wax has cooled a little</li>
            <li>When you rip the wax off, the wax looks like a little porcupine :)</li>
            <li>The stuff is kind of oily and hard to get off it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I never used a pre-epilation oil with hard wax years ago, and I sometimes forget to apply it with this waxing kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my mom&#x27;s home made wax my entire life (my mom is Brazilian and makes amazing waxes), but now we live across the country from each other</li>
            <li>II later found out it was because since the whole area was hair covered, it was hard to flick a tab up with your nail to get a good grip.</li>
            <li>The only real problem I have is, it can be hard to get a good hold on the wax when removeing hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While not for the faint of heart, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Directions are clear &amp; straight to the point.</li>
            <li>I got about 2 waxes out of it, and it did a great job, but I thought it was bit expensive considering shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>This wax has made hair removal so much easier and nearly pain-free.</li>
            <li>The application is much easier (a bit gooey) than just complete liquid.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d go as far as to say that it works very well.</li>
            <li>but when I went to my normal CVS</li>
            <li>Only that it was my first time, and did not realize how much pain</li>
            <li>I love that this wax gets the job done, but it does take a few times to get used to.</li>
            <li>Make sure A) you have a bikini trimmer and trim the hair very short, about an eighth of an inch long</li>
            <li>If hair is too short then the wax can&#x27;t pick up all the hairs, and if it is too long then it will be more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I can get 2 uses out of each kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It grips the hairs better on uneven surfaces.</li>
            <li>It grips the hairs better on uneven surfaces.</li>
            <li>I did this a few more times.  </li>
            <li>After the first couple waxes, you will notice that your hair growth is slowly, thinner, and more sparse</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit messy, but i believe my technique will get better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I set it up at least a couple of hours ahead of time and let it warm and then shut it off after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Although I would suggest getting a few more sticks</li>
            <li>I pretty much just didn&#x27;t like the overall experience with it and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>ingrown hairs that you normally get form shaving</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I would be messing it up or that at the least it would hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>I let it sit a few more minutes and the samething.</li>
            <li>The mirror has the option to see magnified or normal, and I use both, dependent upon the situation or area of focus.  </li>
            <li>Wife says it&#x27;s a good product, not great.</li>
            <li>and I will NEVER try this kind of wax down that low again.</li>
            <li>The first time you wax will hurt the most, but every subsequent time will hurt much less.    </li>
            <li>the instructions and as many reviews as possible for extra tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming to the proper length first is crucial to a good result, as well as following ALL the instructions to the letter, with no short cuts especially with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes the most hair and doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a sticky residue as other waxes, especially those that use strips.  </li>
            <li>Hard wax is soo much easier than soft wax and this is the best hard wax.  </li>
            <li>It has to be just the right temperature for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>When the wax was not heated at the right temperature and liquid form, it would not wax properly and that hurt my skin.</li>
            <li>You can avoid some irritation by doing areas that aren&#x27;t right next to where you just waxed</li>
            <li>A helpful hint - leave a little thicker edge to be able to pull from, hold skin firm, take a big inhale, then yank as you exhale - honestly  </li>
            <li>When you first start to use it, you will most likely make a huge mess due to the fact that you don&#x27;t know the nature of the wax yet.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews, I was pretty excited to get started...and all of my boxes (3-pack) are missing the oil.</li>
            <li>At the salon the used strips, which pretty much took away the first layer of my skin, I was in pain for the next 2 days and my private parts were swollen, but not with this wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super duper clean and nowhere near as messy as soft wax/sugar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Surgi Wax is more messy than sugaring in that it makes strings the same way hot glue does, but sugaring is sticky on my skin even after I remove the hair, resulting in me sticking to things and to myself.</li>
            <li>My husband likened the experience of Surgiwax to getting the first car you could afford on your own: it was not a good car, but because you never had another one, you like it!</li>
            <li>but I would have liked for the waxing stick to be a little longer and bigger.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m no wimp, I have several tattoos and microdermal anchor piercings--so I like to think my pain tolerance is pretty darn high.</li>
            <li>Whereas I did not do the full Brazilian job, the areas I waxed just outside my bikini line and slightly along the inside felt smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I always buy one of the cheapest options when I do something new because if I make a mistake I don&#x27;t feel so bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in NYC</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m still new to home waxing</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant as a bunch of people said the \\&quot;new improved\\</li>
            <li>For people who gave up because of pain, I would say to take a Motrin, use plenty of the oil, and the instructions say you can rub down the area with an ice cube or use numbing spray (I didn&#x27;t do either), and lastly just bear through the whole process because it does get better.</li>
            <li>This works a lot better on uneven surfaces than soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works a lot better on uneven surfaces than soft wax.   </li>
            <li>you have to put enough on but not to much because if you put too much it wont take the hair off.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this wax for those of you who have really stubborn hairs like me because this wax gets even the tiniest hairs, which is the main reason why I keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction to it.</li>
            <li>Even when I used copious amounts of the oil provided, the wax still stuck to my skin in some very sensitive places...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; have no problems..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Microwave: This wax melts very fast and you will have to reheat it multiple times.</li>
            <li>Be ready to take off the strip pretty quickly (within about 20-30 sec of application because a minute is way too long).  </li>
            <li>(which is usually a no</li>
            <li>My first and last time waxing, I learned from my mistake.</li>
            <li>I had never waxed any part of my body before using this and took a big risk going with a Brazilian my first time out.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little nervous using this product because I have never waxed before and to start a first try on a Brazilian wax is risky!</li>
            <li>First, I trimmed the hair very short &amp; used the included oil beforehand.</li>
            <li>ALSO, I used this to do my underarms and WOW!  </li>
            <li>Run far away from this!</li>
            <li>And a hell of a lot cheaper than paying to have it done professionally!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the fact that this is messy as hell and required frequent re-heating, way better and cheaper than a professional.</li>
            <li>, just remember, it only hurts for a moment ;-)</li>
            <li>When I finally got to the waxing part it hurt way more than expected, and it didn&#x27;t even remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product ive used when i decided to do my waxing at home.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products for removing hair, including various wax kits from other brands, but this is the only one I love and the only one I unreservedly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time ordering this wax and my first amazon review.      </li>
            <li>The pain only exist when you are ripping the strip, which should only last at most 3 seconds.</li>
            <li>I finally got the nerve to try this product for my first Brazilian wax ever.  </li>
            <li>so you want to head these warnings, especially if it is your first time self waxing.</li>
            <li>The wax will occasionally form a tiny filament between the applicator and the jar, but it cools quickly and falls off -- usually right back into the jar.    </li>
            <li>Helps to stretch the skin a lot and press down lightly on an area after you rip the strip</li>
            <li>This product was very messy, took forever to heat up, and had to be applied many times.</li>
            <li>When you live in a Manhattan apartment, that becomes an issue quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any and all attempts by my wife to come near my hairy man legs with this wax have resulted in me locking myself in the bedroom and threatening to call the National Guard.</li>
            <li>If youare a first time waxer, I would highly recommend to take little chunks and don&#x27;t get too close the first time</li>
            <li>i did laugh at myself a few times considering i&#x27;m a 57 year old female who just gave herself her first brazilian!!....</li>
            <li>As long as you time your pulls right</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t pain free, I was ripping out hair from the root, but so much less so than Surgi-wax.  </li>
            <li>The top of the wax may seem like its still solid, but the bottom half is actually burning hot.</li>
            <li>careful with the hot wax, if it is really watery when it comes out of the microwave</li>
            <li>be SUPER careful that you don&#x27;t accidently drip wax on the hair.</li>
            <li>Really was easy and not at all hard to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews, I decided this was a job I could do myself rather than shelling out $80-$100 at a local salon.</li>
            <li>This works well and is so much mess free if used correctly.</li>
            <li>my hair is naturally corse and this wax removed it completely!</li>
            <li>I mean, more than normal wax ever should be.</li>
            <li>I am black and have coarse hair, I didn&#x27;t need to reapply and love the fact of no strip.</li>
            <li>the downside, could use more application sticks per pack (only two provided) and it smells... odd, and quite pungent.</li>
            <li>was a big bubble that never popped &amp; we had to pop it &amp; then the wax was so hot you had to let it cool down.</li>
            <li>One complaint I have is that the microwave directions weren&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
            <li>Had issues with the actual wax--it hardens very, very quickly &amp; would stick to the tiny wooden spatula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I was only waxing my underarms, as I can&#x27;t imagine the mess and pain</li>
            <li>The trickiest part is flipping up the end of the wax so that it&#x27;s big enough for you to grip and strong enough that it doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for years- only certain chains carry it which always makes it a hassle to find.  </li>
            <li>Before you wax, make sure that if you need to trim hair down a bit that you do or if it is your first time waxing shave the area that you are going to wax and let it grow out to about a half an inch.</li>
            <li>All in all, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other kind of waxing kit other than Surgi!</li>
            <li>The wax is easy to use and really grabs all the fine hairs that other waxes may leave behind.  </li>
            <li>the results are long lasting and effective - for those who are sensitive to chemical hair removal or break out from other wax formulas</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what some people say, (perhaps they are cyborgs?), ripping out hair down there hurts like mess but this stuff is efficient and gets most of the hair the first time.</li>
            <li>The pain is minimal and it requires minimal clean up, just don&#x27;t forget to apply the oil first.</li>
            <li>The oil seems like it should make the wax slip off the hair, but thankfully, it seems to help mostly with not sticking little extra bits to the skin.</li>
            <li>I spent 45 minutes trying to get the wax off until I realized that you can warm it with friction, add a little oil, and it comes off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get much more than that done without help from someone else.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used hard wax at home in many years.</li>
            <li>I hardly have any hair any more.</li>
            <li>so it might feel hard at the top</li>
            <li>The little cups are easy to use, but the wax does cool and become too thick to use pretty quickly (unless you follow the advice of one of the other commenters here and keep the jar on a mug warmer  - that did help!).</li>
            <li>If you do, it may feel hard on top but still be soft underneath.</li>
            <li>Anyway, she uses \\&quot;hard wax\\&quot; and after spending way to much every month for her to wax my underarms, I decided to look for the same (or similar) kind of stuff online and came across this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a great texture (like cold honey?</li>
            <li>The entire experience took me 2 days to complete (I needed a break haha).  </li>
            <li>And, I also used it for my eyebrows and although it&#x27;s difficult to shape them this way, it&#x27;s great for larger areas like the unibrow area and underneath them.  </li>
            <li>They have clear instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re saving a lot of money now that we can &#x27;clear the forest&#x27; in-house instead of at a salon.</li>
            <li>as far as having someone do all that business for you...</li>
            <li>No messy strips, either.</li>
            <li>no when waxing that sensitive area)</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>It really helps prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the hair grow back slower and thinner.  </li>
            <li>It really helps prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the hair grow back slower and thinner.  </li>
            <li>This makes the process a lot easier on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The jar contains enough for about 3-6 waxes depending how much work you need done.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and well... this worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I nearly considered ending it there.</li>
            <li>Complete craziness.</li>
            <li>Amazon, please keep it stocked, I&#x27;m too old to start my quest for wax again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when I had a professional wax me, I still had some residue.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t completely remove every piece of hair</li>
            <li>I heard this is when your skin is not so sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten around 6 waxes professionally, and then done at-home waxing.</li>
            <li>When I did some maintenance a week later (my hair grows fast</li>
            <li>I have never tried the soft wax with strips on the bikini</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just fork over the money and have a professional do it.  </li>
            <li>(In the meantime, I went to a salon and had a professional Brazilian wax done.  </li>
            <li>I have used it multiple times and it works very well.</li>
            <li>As far as the temperature of the wax- that it up to you.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores of late.</li>
            <li>Wow, this works so well</li>
            <li>Really works wonders especially when used as directed.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>It is not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>please, please don&#x27;t put this stuff directly on it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to re-microwave, but near the end, the applicator and sides of the pot were getting a bit gunky.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to go to a professional and have a brazilian done.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase this if you&#x27;ve ever had a professional wax</li>
            <li>and you prefer soft wax.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how clear the instruction was and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Sally Hansen kit, but when the price went up to $12 per bottle at the drugstore, I couldn&#x27;t really justify spending that much on a personal grooming product that I still had to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>jesus, unless youre into S&amp;M, dont buy this, just go to a salon and get it done professionally.</li>
            <li>No messy wax strips.  </li>
            <li>results are baby soft.</li>
            <li>What I did and recommend, is to use this product somewhere where you are near a microwave</li>
            <li>when compared to ‘professional’ waxing.</li>
            <li>(for sensitive, temperature-warmer areas than face/ legs, etc)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast which was a big plus!!</li>
            <li>I tend to heat it until it&#x27;s completely liquid</li>
            <li>But, the waxing lasts about 3.5 weeks and the next time you wax it is much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old,</li>
            <li>this product was better than what I expected.. it brings an pre-waxing oil, i would recommend to use it 10 mins before start waxing so your skin will be hydrate enough to support the next steps.</li>
            <li>The product seemed old.  </li>
            <li>This was a complete pain to use.</li>
            <li>instructions are thorough and complete.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt and feels like the professional stuff.</li>
            <li>This may be the same for all waxes, but it was a real pain in the arse.</li>
            <li>Be careful and use it on a small area first to make sure you don&#x27;t peal off your skin or have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s the same, just faster and soooo much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>The short duration of pain is worth the lasting results.</li>
            <li>The package comes with three kits (three jars, six spatulas, three oils), so there&#x27;s enough for several months&#x27; worth of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This waxing kit is probably the most obnoxiously messy waxing kit I have ever used in my entire life.</li>
            <li>It was difficult to get a good hold of the wax and hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too thick and sits on top of your hair, it&#x27;s going to hurt when you pull it off.  </li>
            <li>The wax is great consistency and it&#x27;s honestly the least painful product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Wait for it to cool down a bit.</li>
            <li>but when it did cool down enought to use it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, the areas that I did successfully wax were left with a few broken off hairs that quickly turned into ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Since I could not get it off right away, the wax started to get sticky and soft making it even harder to remove.</li>
            <li>That being said, this wax has been great - hardens enough to keep from making the usual mess and does the job.</li>
            <li>have used many different waxing products and this is head and shoulders above all other home waxing kits.</li>
            <li>is my second Surgi product (the other one is facial hair bleaching cream), and I love it.</li>
            <li>others have stated on here, same exact procedure as always, tried to remove, it was like super stiff, yet gummy tar.</li>
            <li>Tried this stuff, easy to use, no strips needed, and a jar will usually lasts me 3-4 applications.</li>
            <li>Instructions say it takes one minute to heat a full jar, 30 seconds for half a jar, etc., but it took longer in my microwave.</li>
            <li>The wax stuck to everything and was a HUGE mess!</li>
            <li>I found it very important to use the oil and spread it all over past the hair onto the skin above it.</li>
            <li>you still want to try hair removal without having ever had a professional waxing, I&#x27;d recommend starting with something you can&#x27;t get into too much trouble with in an area that is easily reached like the legs.</li>
            <li>The oil in the box works fine, but there&#x27;s a small amount provided,</li>
            <li>You need some type of warmer to keep it as a liquid, I made no less than 10-12 trips to the microwave   </li>
            <li>How much wax you need will depend on how much hair you are removing, but I think the average person will need 1/4 jar for a bikini line wax and 1/2 jar to remove all hair (Brazilian wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed the color was different, I heated it up and discovered it does not work as well as the older version.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn you and saves multiple trips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first box is now in the trash, the second and third boxes will be going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On a good note, regrowth is much slower (just coming in after about 10 days) than shaving (usually about 2 days for me) or using the hair removal cream (usually starts back within about 5-6 days having used surgi cream).</li>
            <li>I place a long piece of parchment/wax paper down on the floor and place the stool on one end of the paper; this ensures that I don&#x27;t get any wax dripping on the carpet/rug in my room and it is easy to ball up all my used wax and trash and then throw it away.</li>
            <li>The barely used jar and the 2 unopened jars went directly into the garbage.</li>
            <li>When I use my usual wax (strip free Parissa), I&#x27;m done in 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>As you may have guessed, the closer you get to more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, the more painful it is likely to be.  </li>
            <li>I was careful to use the oil first as instructed and had no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li>And last, but not least, this wax breaks.  </li>
            <li>and it will be really really hot on your skin, so be careful.</li>
            <li>i must say, a few made me laugh out loud!...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely takes a few tries to get the hang of doing your own waxing-</li>
            <li>Nads left more of a tacky residue behind and was a bit harder to clean up.</li>
            <li>It grabs all the hairs and the only real concern I have is that, in the really sensitive areas, it has been healing a little funny for me</li>
            <li>Using it on the bikini area is difficult and often requires going over the same area more than once, which can leave redness or even mild abrasion in such a sensitive area.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the packaging of it is kind of small and as a result of using it for various areas, I tend to go through this pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>sugar wax is better for many reasons: it was not as messy, not as painful, and so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that the oil that comes with the product, which usually removes residual wax from the skin very effectively, had a tough time removing this new formula.  </li>
            <li>I have only waxed my legs once, so this was going to be a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>It gets 99% of the hair and leaves skin soft and smooth for at least 3 weeks (for me anyway).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Surgi (formerly One Touch) roll-on strip (soft) wax for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>salon &amp; I got 6 months worth for less than that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any difference for the regular and this one, so I actually use this on my face too and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>This product not only showed up a week earlier than the estimated delivery time, but was so much easier to use than the reviews had lead me to believe it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing stops it from being messy or cooling off too quickly</li>
            <li>I had previously used a different kind of Surgi Wax, but had some problems with mess and sticking.  </li>
            <li>have to tweeze the occasional hair that the wax missed, but generally this hard wax kit works better than strip wax on my bikini area.</li>

            <li>In ten minutes I can be completely finished and after the first use you&#x27;ll immediately see how much finer and how much less hair grows back.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, at least I don&#x27;t itch like shaving! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done home waxing before with a salon-style crock pot and muslin strips, which was a major ordeal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will have to work up some major guts to try this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the major advantages Surgi Wax has over sugaring</li>
            <li>and I checked out other reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found any other at-home waxing kit that performs as well as this does and the price really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>No other wax works as well as this one</li>
            <li>They provide you a popsicle stick-ish applier and a small jar of pre-waxing oil (which is more than enough unless your looking to deep fry something) for every jar of wax.</li>
            <li>and I used the other kit (bikini, body and legs) first.</li>
            <li>When the hair grows in less full and coarse, you are set with this stuff!     </li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical that it would be pain free, but it really works as long as you put plenty of oil and the wax is warm/hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever had experience with the Sally Hansen wax strips available at drugstores, and this is by far much easier to do, with less mess.</li>
            <li>hair grows pretty fast, &#x27;down there&#x27; &amp; everywhere, so I got to wax once every 3 weeks, but nevertheless, because of Surgi, every session only takes me 20 mins (almost the same time as a waxing salon will take).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part ever is that it is not as painful as all other waxes.  </li>
            <li>However with the job situation being somewhat shaky, I decided I HAD to cut back, and my boyfriend REALLY enjoys the clean look of the Brazilian.</li>
            <li>FAR less messy, more efficient, and easier to use than Sally Hanson bikini wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy for a beginner and the quality of the hard wax far less messy and faster than working with strips (not to mention much cheaper than the salon).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazing product I love and I have used it on a few other people too.</li>
            <li>Hard wax is fantastic, and no muslin to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, the kit is very straight forward and, in itself, there wasn&#x27;t really anything negative</li>
            <li>lastly as this was my first time in a long time, I tried it on my legs first where I could experiment a little with applying...</li>
            <li>In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.      </li>
            <li>For waxing in general:  Why would you wax?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is cheaper than $60 each time I want to get it professionally done, but I have a 13 month old at home, and this process takes a long time to do my bikini area...</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will order it again when I find out how long the results last.   </li>
            <li>It really does hurt, but that&#x27;s what i expected it to do.  </li>
            <li>is that I don&#x27;t necessarily have to apply the wax directly to my skin for it to work.</li>
            <li>And maybe when I have the extra dough, I&#x27;ll get it professionally done.</li>
            <li>I had several professional bikini waxes done before attempting to do this myself at home and even then it was a challenge.</li>
            <li>Works very well, minimal pain.</li>
            <li>In the meantime I&#x27;ll shave if I want to go bare.</li>
            <li>I suggest washing the area very thoroughly after you are done waxing if you decide to use this oil because it clogged up my pores &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and several tiny pimples appeared the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably try a professional wax in the future...</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a helpful tip: for sensitive areas, applying two or three coats of Oragel (or a generic equivalent) 20% lidocaine gel as a numbing agent two minutes before the wax works wonders for lessening the pain.</li>
            <li>I must preface this by saying that I&#x27;ve had a Brazilian wax done by a professional for the last 2 years.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you have the patience, you can get professional result for a tenth of the price.</li>
            <li>beware if you aren&#x27;t intending to go all bare and accidentally get it into hair you want to keep</li>
            <li>I also have used Completely Bare, Sally Hansen, and Gigi.  </li>
            <li>1)Pay attention to the direction of hair growth and when you pull off you want to pull directly in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>it took all the hair and left my arm pits so soft without pulling my skin of....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, if you use the correct application technique (in the direction of hair growth)and removal technique (pulling in the opposite direction, as close to the skin as possible, NOT straight up!)this process will be worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a constant struggle to get everything on evenly (or as evenly as possible), and then make sure there&#x27;s a thick tab for you to hang on to as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a constant struggle to get everything on evenly (or as evenly as possible), and then make sure there&#x27;s a thick tab for you to hang on to as well.     </li>
            <li>Usually, it takes me 2.5 minutes to heat up the jar (when it&#x27;s full)...</li>
            <li>(it took a full 2 minutes to heat up in my small microwave).</li>
            <li>It hurt too much to get down into the really sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>After heating it for another minute trying to get it to all melt down, I took it out and it was so hot that dropped it</li>
            <li>However, once you get over the first time, it all became easier, with much less pain.</li>
            <li>This really helps to lower the pain level when removing the hard wax, as well as making any wax mess on your hands easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hardens quickly, so I work in small areas</li>
            <li>This is painful, does not peal off very nicely, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>So I was a little skeptical of this product, even after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, it took me a while because it hurt and i was making a mess.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable as you get 3 boxes for the price of one jar on other brands.</li>
            <li>I use tea tree oil after the procedure and for at least a week after the waxing, and it significantly reduces irritation and ingrown hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does however get a little messy but over all it takes most of the hair out with one try.</li>
            <li>It is kind of messy and really scary trying to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is hard to find at stores lately and this is a good deal online.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin so after I finished I did blot on a little bit of after shaving lotion just to make sure that my skin didn&#x27;t react negatively and the results were wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit of practice, but overall so much cheaper than a professional wax!  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t stress enough how important at least one salon trip can be.</li>
            <li>I have an epilady that I use on my legs which resembles a shaver, but it pulls the hair out so the results last a while and hair comes back soft.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, only slightly messy if you&#x27;re careful.  </li>
            <li>I personally LOVE waxing down under, no more ingrown hairs, no bumps.</li>
            <li>No more strips, hair comes out the first time and the wax doesn&#x27;t get all over the place!</li>
            <li>It helps to be a little flexible too ;)    </li>
            <li>At first I thought, okay I will just redo those spots tomorrow, but it was just far too painful for it to have to be a multiple day</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as strip wax on this sensitive area.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as strip wax on this sensitive area.</li>
            <li>put the oil on before, brush the wax on (the included tiny tongue-depressor stix barely last thru one session-- have a disposable wooden tool standing by as replacement), pat the wax down, find an edge and pull it right off.</li>
            <li>Find the right temperature that is comfortable for you, but is thin enough to apply down to the skin level.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, clean up is a breeze, and it&#x27;s one of the lesser painful waxes out there (not pain-free).  </li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen wax used to get dry and hard very quickly, which meant that you couldn&#x27;t pull a strip off in one motion and had to get it off crumble by crumble.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product 4 times so far and each time I am not completely hairless.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to complete the task</li>
            <li>The first is that it is messy.</li>
            <li>I still prefer doing this in the privacy of my own home than to pay some random woman at the spa to touch my private parts.at the spa to touch my private parts.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid amazon shopper and thought why not save a few $$ with the subscribe and save option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first few times.</li>
            <li>really close to the naughty bits</li>
            <li>I tried Surgi Wax and it was fairly easy to use (a little mess...</li>
            <li>I probably should have tried a smaller patch on my underarms first, since the hair is different there compared to \\&quot;down under\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>But in all fairness, I haven&#x27;t done any real maintenance \\&quot;down there\\&quot; in probably 18 months...</li>
            <li>the only thing is that it does not seem to stay as hot as long as other waxes</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I believe my natural body temperature in the bikini area made it much harder for the wax to cool down enough for easy removal</li>
            <li>Not messy as long as you heat it properly.</li>
            <li>I have gorilla-like amounts of leg hair, and can just barely do my legs in 2 boxes (I prefer to use 3), so if you are just waxing your \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; area, 1 box should last you several applications.  </li>
            <li>you are a newbie to brazilian waxing, definitely get it done professionally first a few times.  </li>
            <li>It would not dry and harden properly.</li>
            <li>put on the wax super thick.</li>
            <li>I used almost the whole jar and I only cleaned half up.</li>
            <li>I could only get half the job done before the wax cooled too much</li>
            <li>The hair was much shorter and of course less dense so that made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>First off, the grip is not strong enough to pull off all the hair once, or twice, or three times!</li>
            <li>It makes the whole process just a little bit easier, and does not decrease the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>I was ready to throw it away when my husband happened to find a little bottle.</li>
            <li>I typically have to do a little clean up with the tweezers</li>
            <li>If it has a very thick consistency, although it is still warm enough to work, it will waste a lot of wax.</li>
            <li>When I tried to remove the wax, only portions of it came off, leaving huge sticky areas behind.  </li>
            <li>I was too chicken to use the wax too close to the more sensitive areas, and just ended up shaving those bits.</li>

            <li> The best thing is that it comes with an oil so that it does not stick to your skin.  </li>

            <li> and it was awesome!</li>

            <li> I have tried a lot of the home hair removal products and have never been impressed.</li>
            <li> Best at home wax I have ever used</li>
            <li> Best to do it over a couple of days in that case.  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> You will have to figure out the consistency that is best for you.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is the best home wax I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> also think this was an excellent buy since there are 3 jars of wax included in the purchase.</li>
            <li> but the wax was not the greatest at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>

            <li> That was the best idea ever.  </li>
            <li> Then I found surgi bikini wax I used it on my underarms and its awesome.</li>
            <li> If you want to remove hair from this area, I&#x27;d say the best approach is laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li> &lt;3</li>
            <li> This I have found is the best one.</li>

            <li> An awesome product!  </li>
            <li> Ok.....this wax is wonderful......</li>
            <li> it works excellent for me....</li>
            <li> but nevertheless i&#x27;ve had the best luck with this.</li>
            <li> Best wax around!</li>
            <li> The best way I found to wax is this: I sit on a towel in my bathroom (because it&#x27;s so well-lit) with a mirror in front of me.  </li>
            <li> Is the best.</li>
            <li> practice makes perfect (almost with anything!)</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE YOU USE THE OIL!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good waxing product.  </li>
            <li> This product is very good at removing all of my pubic hair.</li>
            <li> After reading (mostly) very good reviews about this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell very good and didn&#x27;t grip the hair as well...</li>
            <li> and it is very good quality.</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Good luck waxing!</li>
            <li> Once you heat it up just throw it on the wax warmer and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> It does a good job!  </li>
            <li> Get a good rip, tighten the skin, and rip it fasssst!</li>
            <li> but I was blown away by how much I loved it!  </li>
            <li> but once I did, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> lol)...</li>
            <li> It works great for your bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I think it looks great (on me and on women).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a brazillian yet, but I thought I could try this wax out on my armpits and it works great.</li>
            <li> its great...</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The armpits were great, as well as the &#x27;stache....</li>

            <li> the experienced - you will rate this a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Waxing.</li>
            <li> Either way it turned out great.</li>
            <li> The best part about sugar wax is that if you make a mistake, the sugar rinses off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> The wax also heats up great in the microwave as intended-</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased 5 jars of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just started waxing- great for a beginner</li>
            <li> Great at home wax.  </li>

            <li> I am happy with this product and I will recommend it to people who are looking for microwaveale waxes WITHOUT STRIPS.</li>
            <li> Now, and this is a great tip ladies, I use a candle warmer to heat the wax.</li>
            <li> I liked the results, but knew that wasn&#x27;t the best method</li>
            <li> This is great priced wax.</li>
            <li> so this makes a great kit for all you at home users.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy about that.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The price is great, it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> Truly a great product.</li>
            <li> STILL wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>

            <li> this wax is great.</li>
            <li> Once they stopped selling it in stores I was so happy to find Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> This wax is great for bikini waxing or Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li> great product i felt no pain</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> SURE YOU USE THE OIL!!</li>
            <li> I love this wax!!</li>
            <li> Love this wax!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> it is very effective for removing hair by the root.  </li>
            <li> works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This wax was amazing!</li>
            <li> I am loving it!</li>
            <li> hear from my friends that Gigi is really the best, but for this price, and for what a great job it does, I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have to say this stuff is amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is excellent, way better than the Nad&#x27;s brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled to find that Amazon had it listed for a pack of 3!</li>
            <li> i am happy again!:)</li>
            <li> What works best for me is trim the area to about 1/4\\&quot;, the longer hair you have, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> Very happy and will be buying more of this once I use the leftover jar &amp; the two unopened boxes.</li>
            <li> :o)  </li>
            <li> nice product!</li>
            <li> This wax is very strong, and at the subscribe and save price, a very good deal.  </li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve found out there and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This wax is easy to use and does a great job!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and has great results!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this wax works very good and the price was even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very good with most beauty things ..</li>
            <li> Very easy and save you lots of money!  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I can no longer find anywhere in stores, so I was happy to find this 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> you have to have a good treshold for pain if you want to try brazilian wax yourself.  </li>
            <li> I started with a Sally Hansen product, and it was good, however, it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that it removed everything.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> This wax is good for all types of waxing, not just Brazillian.</li>
            <li> (good thing this</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it seemed like a good idea for hard-to-reach areas that are not flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This box costs about $6 and all you need is some time and a good mirror.</li>
            <li> So just say goodbye to your jankiest towel and put it to good use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I found baby oil to be a good substitute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You are on your way to looking good once you get over the intimidation factor of brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I know how great this product works, this requires microwave which I don&#x27;t own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works about as good as you&#x27;d expect it to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a good mirror.</li>
            <li> Really good buy for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always suspicious of good reviews but this one is legit.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> The brazilian went relatively smoothly, though there is a learning curve of how to do it best, depending on your preferences, skin type, and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Always a good price</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> If you want a perfect wax you will still have to fork over the $60 at a salon, but for a good, basic wax this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> That said, I am very pleased witht the result and use this for legs, and eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li> Sooooo happy to have it here, love amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product works great make</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a happy camper&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and the instructions were very detailed!</li>
            <li> lol  works much better..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Good luckay to get nice even applications,</li>
            <li> Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt a bit more on non-oiled parts, so beware!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> think if I&#x27;d ever been waxed before, this product would work a lot better, but after almost 2 hours (it took me 2 hours just to find this stuff - it was sold out in every store I went to!)</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the pretreatment oil that comes with it!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I Love this wax!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> After trying it - I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did though!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this for my first try at at-home waxing and it worked great!  </li>
            <li> Love this wax!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> so make sure you put the oil all over, including in any hair you want to keep!</li>
            <li> Will buy more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Will use Tend Skin product (see link below) to make sure ingrowns stay at bay!</li>
            <li> Will keep ordering more!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It works great as it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> and I just used it; it is easy to use and the results are GREAT.</li>
            <li> Gives great results and easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Gives great results and easy to do.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, easy to use</li>
            <li> Do not forget to apply the pretreatment oil first!!!!</li>
            <li> The three pack is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Now when I say amazing, keep in mind, you are still pulling hair out of your body...still hurts.    </li>
            <li> My results were amazing-</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and the packaging is great.  </li>
            <li> This 3pack for Brazilian is great because its cheap, and it comes with the oil to use beforehand.  </li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good idea to re-apply oil there to make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do not need fabric strips to use it which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better with practice, but after you get the hang of it, it works as good as being at the salon and paying 60 bucks.</li>
            <li> I also liked the smell of the wax</li>
            <li> There is so much \\&quot;junk\\&quot; on the market, so I am compelled to comment on great products!  </li>
            <li> but I bet it was my own fault.</li>
            <li> so believe me when I tell you, once you learn how to do your own waxing, the time and money you save is substantial.</li>
            <li> The wax smells good, like i&#x27;m burning some exotic candle.</li>
            <li> and honestly this is the cheapest place my wife has found to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Had to find my own way of waxing after moving to a town that didn&#x27;t offer Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> I end up throwing those out each time and using my own tongue depressor for application.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brazilian waxing kit.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was three separate jars.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll be honest with you-</li>
            <li> A warm shower beforehand helps.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even melt like it suppose to when you warm it up in the microwave for 60seconds as directed...</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the work I was able to accomplish in the lower areas.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a lost art for my generation</li>
            <li> It is so gentle, and best of all....easy!!</li>
            <li> Warm it if until it is runny and stringy</li>
            <li> Smells nice, too.  </li>
            <li> Its kind of cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have twizers handy because after you wax, if there are some hairs still there, you can easyly take them out because the heat from the wax has opened the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i sit when waxing with a mirror propped up nice and close.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own Brazilian for years...</li>
            <li> i use it to make a nice line</li>
            <li> I used to pay a lot of money at the salon for waxing, now I can do it on my own.</li>
            <li> you never used this before, a warm bath or shower helps.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used Surgi products before, I was fairly confident this would be good as well...</li>
            <li> Do your own waxing.</li>
            <li> It works great and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I ended up with great results, and most importantly my new husband LOVED it!</li>
            <li> Trial and error will kind of help you out because it will vary by how course or fine your hair is, but this is a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews in so many places.  </li>
            <li> Just received today and practiced with my armpits and it was easy and fairly painless.</li>
            <li> work great and a good price too thanks</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and</li>
            <li> and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy and virtually painless.</li>
            <li> and is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use...</li>
            <li> far as the temperature is concerned, you just have to experiment with what works best for you.</li>
            <li> This magical Surgi stuff is reeeeally weirdly effective--</li>
            <li> This is the best wax by far.</li>
            <li> One of the more effective and affordable waxes.</li>
            <li> So far, my boyfriend says this is the best waxing job I&#x27;ve done on myself.  </li>
            <li> it is by far the best product i have found.</li>
            <li> This wax is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> As far as the wax itself goes, it did an awesome job removing hair!</li>
            <li> this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li> I even brought the coffee pot warmer in my room to try to keep the wax warm, but I still needed to micro many times.  </li>
            <li> This lady teaches you a BRILLIANT trick on how to \\&quot;flick\\&quot; the wax to get it ready to pull up.  </li>
            <li> Surgi Wax is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love all surgi wax products which by far i think is the best brand for waxing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many a wax and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product, very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s great value for the quantity you get (still haven&#x27;t finished my first box)</li>
            <li> this is a great product &amp; with that being said make sure that when you warm up the wax there is a whole in it so it can come out.</li>
            <li> Very important.</li>
            <li> The oil is very important though because if you do not use it the wax will stick to your skin.</li>
            <li> I will never change the wax that I use because it is easy and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and it makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li> The good thing is this stuff is cheap, and relatively easy to use.  </li>
            <li> However, after I showered and exfoliated the area (exfoliating afterwards is very important to avoid ingrown hairs), I applied more of the oil to the area, and also rubbed some into my hands.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and people seemed to love it.</li>
            <li> I have to go over areas more than once</li>
            <li> Instead I have bumpy skin with a lot of sporadic hairs, not that sexy.</li>
            <li> If you can trust your partner to help you, it might work out better.</li>
            <li> I find with the cooler consistency, I use more wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (yeah you may laugh, I&#x27;m a good sport,</li>
            <li> It became more of a project that took about a week, than a before shower thing.   </li>
            <li> and then I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it in stores.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon.com has it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since tried the strips and like them so much more.</li>
            <li> , I know women are more tolerable to pain</li>
            <li> sure you follow the directions</li>
            <li> i think its a hundred times better than shaving).</li>
            <li> The more times you use it, the easier and faster it</li>
            <li> I started using it in August of &#x27;09 and have repurchased it many times.  </li>
            <li> ) Make sure you use the oil and re-apply if you need to.  </li>
            <li> it is perfectly safe as babies put it inside their mouths &amp; is used for tatooing.</li>
            <li> You can find myriad sexual benefits if you spend a minute searching.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much, much better.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re an expert at getting them--then you&#x27;ll probably love this</li>
            <li> how much more could it</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t wear a bra or top.</li>
            <li> Go with the strips, they do a much better job...</li>
            <li> Make sure you trim your hair to 1/4th of an inch.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I probably could have trimmed a bit more, but I wanted to make sure to get every hair.</li>
            <li> you should include more spatula and better quality spatulas.</li>
            <li> and I think that it works better for pits and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting the silk epil for my legs and pits and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this wax.</li>
            <li> you wont be able to get it off.</li>
            <li> But if you follow the instructions well, it couldn&#x27;t be better and easier.</li>
            <li> I found this way better than shaving since 1 day after shaving I&#x27;d get stubble and itch.</li>
            <li> with my 1100 watt microwave, I had to microwave for more than 2 minutes before the wax was spreadable.</li>
            <li> I still find myself &amp;#34;over-microwaving&amp;#34; the jar for more than a minute to make the wax more spreadable.</li>
            <li> One thing, is I wish it came with more oil.</li>
            <li> Just make sure a fan is on in your room</li>
            <li> to get myself to a point where I felt confident doing this, no problem, so it&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t read the directions or</li>
            <li> If, however, you are going to be using it for your more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, do yourself a favor and use the oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sugaring is okay in a pinch for my legs</li>
            <li> Hope you have more luck</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> It gives interesting info on how brazilian waxing started &amp; also has a couple helpful illustrations.       </li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re used to the pain &amp; hair is more thinned out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but man I didn&#x27;t have anyluck.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;d feel more at ease if someone else does it &amp; knows more of what they&#x27;re doing.     </li>
            <li> more than I&#x27;d like to tweeze one by one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this wax online.</li>
            <li> and i love that amazon sells it as a subscription also :)</li>
            <li> and B)make sure to use the oil in the kit on your skin to be waxed and your hands to make sure you can get the wax off your hands.  </li>
            <li> I love this waxing kit.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the oil.  </li>
            <li> Takes about 5-8 mins per underarm-- leaves them smooth, creamy looking and lasts forever!     </li>
            <li> Some of us sit on the floor for the top parts of our bikini wax, some of us stand.     </li>
            <li> I was able to do a BETTER job than the results I get for paying between $60 and $80.</li>
            <li> I will say that the wax worked much better on my underarms than my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It is mostly soybean oil.</li>
            <li> I do not have to go over the area more than once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no faster than strip wax, but the results are better.</li>
            <li> I do not have to go over the area more than once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no faster than strip wax, but the results are better.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps! :)</li>
            <li> And I have 5 more to go....haha</li>
            <li> With the strips, you have to buy more</li>
            <li> And yes do use the oil a lot of it.:))</li>
            <li> but this one is more than I can handle.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years; they changed the formula and it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> Surgi Wax is definitely the best in brazilian wax, in terms of getting the job done, price, and pain level.  </li>
            <li> Start from your bum, and work your way toward the top.  </li>
            <li> luck :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> When used along with South Beach ultimate skin prep solution you will have the best, pain-free brazilian wax ever!!</li>
            <li> bits at a time - its more time consuming but works</li>
            <li> bottom to top -</li>
            <li> This is probably the #1 tip I can give because this caused me the most grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and hopefully I get better results then.</li>
            <li> Mostly.  </li>
            <li> But if you love your hoo-ha...</li>
            <li> am SO glad I found Surgi-Wax on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i found this product thanks to all its glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more $$ in my pocket.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this product and love it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is grown out about 1/4 inch or so.  </li>
            <li> For the price that I was paying at Sally Beauty supplies for just 3 of the Brazzillian wax, I pay just $3 more, and get 6.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using this wax for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best brazilian waxing kit.</li>
            <li> Its much better than the wax with fabric.</li>
            <li> I had to reheat it once or twice more to get it to a liquid consistency as recommended.</li>
            <li> All in all, i really love this product and will continue to order this via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also noticed more ingrowns with this stuff.</li>
            <li> wax is a much better value</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found the quality is better too.</li>
            <li> This wax has a much better consistency.</li>
            <li> It was $5, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do my bikini line otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> it seems to cook the wax and make it more brittle when you try to use it.</li>
            <li> I could use another type of oil but in all honesty, I don&#x27;t think this is for me as it requires more skill and experience-both of which I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> So I had to add more time and more time....</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s been using this was for MANY MANY years.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this wax.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> So shaving for me caused more problems than it solved.</li>
            <li> and I have still yet to find something better.  </li>
            <li> I love this wax.  </li>
            <li> I use many others &amp;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wax for many years.</li>
            <li> This product works, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up! :-)</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for underarms.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love that I can do whenever I want</li>
            <li> Make sure you have nothing around that you love....</li>
            <li> Just love this wax.  </li>
            <li> For you ladies out there, your better off just going to an esthetician.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times</li>
            <li> so I hope this helps someone. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> There are better and easier to use products.</li>
            <li> I think you would be pleased</li>
            <li> you want to make sure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve bought a couple more of them already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as smooth as after salon!</li>
            <li> Gigi is much better both microwave and warmer</li>
            <li> And will be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> but i will get better at it.</li>
            <li> I love Surgi wax.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin, great to pull out all of the hair without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li> Now have to use the self heating sally Hansen, which is ok, but takes forever to heat up in its metal container, so no microwave option:(&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried ice, more oil...to no avail.</li>
            <li> account. :)</li>
            <li> Amazon is a way better deal.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> The wax got all over my counter top, all over my hands, and under my finger nails.  </li>
            <li> It hurt more than anything</li>
            <li> I have been doing my waxing for many years.</li>
            <li> She probably wonders why she hasn&#x27;t seen me for weeks and weeks, and unless Amazon stops selling this stuff, she probably won&#x27;t see me ever again.  :)</li>
            <li> and I love it just the way it is.  </li>
            <li> When you apply thicker amounts the better</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Although you don&#x27;t need strips, I use them because it makes it easier for me to apply more wax and pull it.</li>
            <li> also love the Pre-Epilation Oil as it prepares my skin for the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for selling great products like this Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> But strip wax works best on relatively flat surfaces.</li>
            <li> I use to use it when it was available in stores, and now I order it from here because it&#x27;s easy to use, and better than the strips!</li>
            <li> It also will give you nice clean lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and clean-</li>
            <li> There were a fair amount of stray hairs but that was mostly my fault for not knowing exactly which direction the hair was growing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> directions say put on microwave safe plate - important to note, as you are using the wax, it can drip and scraping one side of the applicator against the side of the jar can create drips...not easy to remove from the plate you might pick, so plan to designate this plate just for waxing!  </li>
            <li> sure to scrub and clean the area before beginning!</li>
            <li> Moom Organic Hair Remover Refill, 6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]] does a pretty good job at getting about two-thirds of the hair off but can be wiped off if you&#x27;re in over your head for</li>
            <li> Pretty good wax for bikini area.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions exactly, you will have good results...</li>
            <li> works pretty good, although doesn&#x27;t get all the hair all the time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this 2 days ago and was so excited to get it today!</li>
            <li> Greatly reduced pain, in-grown hairs and re-growth (or ‘new growth’)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never done any intimate hair removal, the smooth skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> I was able to easily rip out the hairs.</li>
            <li> Also, because it hardens quickly, you want to keep the jar warm or reheat to keep the sides from getting gunky while you&#x27;re working.</li>
            <li> I find that a hotter, more runny wax works best for me, but that is also harder to apply by yourself.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow instructions, most important is to use the supplied oil.  </li>
            <li> It was actually very easy to use and not nearly as painful as when my friend did it.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference in the wax not sticking to my skin when I used more oil.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It worked amazing on the underarms (don&#x27;t forget the oil and make sure its hot when applying) and</li>
            <li> :) Smooth, no ingrown hairs at all, no irritation or even soreness.</li>
            <li> And then enjoy some nice, clean, smooth skin...</li>
            <li> I used up a full jar doing one Brazilian!</li>
            <li> I am blonde and fair!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trush the other reviews posted here saying that this is a great product, what a liers!</li>
            <li> , you can re-use each tub two or three times, making this SO much more economical than paying a pro!  </li>
            <li> I have gone to spas to get them many times, so I am familiar with the prep work and the aftercare.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so easy - and not painful!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that easy for it to come off.</li>
            <li> Though, it still doesn&#x27;t get rid of all your hair, but you can easily use tweezers to remove those.   </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve been a fan of this wax because of its easy use.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require any muslin strips.</li>
            <li> Doing it at home was easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and equipped with pre-expilation oil.</li>
            <li> Moom took off about 90% of the hair, and it was easy to re-do an area without any additional pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surgi Wax is easy to use and removes hair from the root.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and stayed</li>
            <li> and it did not come off easily at all.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> an the container is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It is salon quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT this product was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Have been giving myself Brazilians for years using it, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> really easy &amp; works for awhile.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I like the results after using this product, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> if this happened to me it could easily happen to a beginner</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, there is alittle pain</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and takes all the hair off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Virtually painless and so easy and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heats easily and quickly,&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just completely easy to use and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I like to use a strong kitchen roll(paper) with it.</li>
            <li> It was so strong it took off my eyelid skin</li>
            <li> The stuff smells sort of nice, but that&#x27;s the only good part.</li>
            <li> Really worth it if you want to save money and stay nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Then I will smile at the nice smooth results.</li>
            <li> It was perfect at keeping it at the right consistancy throughout the entire waxing.</li>
            <li> I am a first time waxer, and because of the (mainly) amazing reviews I decided that Surgi-wax would solve all my shaving problems.  </li>
            <li> so thrilled that I will be able to maintain my tidy look with such an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled that I will be able to maintain my tidy look with such an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever used a wax of any kind</li>
            <li> Works beautifully for underarms as well as facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The first is to put it in the microwave a bit longer: It is supposed to be kind of runny.</li>
            <li> So I read the instructions and followed exactly, except I had to warm the wax</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be successful, it will help if you&#x27;re using this product as maintenance between getting professional service.  </li>
            <li> I have only used for arm pits but can tell it&#x27;s very good quality wax and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Everything was going fine until I tried taking the wax off.</li>
            <li> However, the first wax will hurt since there&#x27;s a lot more hair with a lot more holding it in.    </li>
            <li> Even fine hairs.   </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> when you first start waxing, it hurts, no way to get around it, but will get better the more you do</li>
            <li> I am usually fine with pain and have been waxed before but when you have to continually grab another part of the wax because it will not rip off together, THAT HURTS.  </li>
            <li> Pull it off quickly!  </li>
            <li> and I did not have the courage to rip it off quickly and so many times..</li>
            <li> I have used almost every home wax product available and this is hands down the best bikini wax.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely rely on and love this wax!</li>
            <li> and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is that I took some Motrin before I began, and I think that made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Also, never attempt to do a huge area all at once.  </li>
            <li> The suggested times are accurate, just remember to stir it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find that accurate.</li>
            <li> Using the oil before waxing was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> It also qualifies for free shipping if you sign up for that automatic shipping thing, so just try it out.</li>
            <li> I have also had success with a cooler wax, a more gummy consistency.</li>
            <li> of course it&#x27;s not pain free</li>
            <li> I then moved out from that patch that I had just waxed, and it was smooth from there.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap (compared to a $80 session at a salon) and does the job</li>
            <li> If your brave enough I would recommend this money saving option.</li>
            <li> This wax worked fantastic on the fronts of my legs, where the hair all grew in one direction.  </li>
            <li> I think soft wax &amp; sugaring is more ideal for larger areas that don&#x27;t have too many nooks and curves (like your legs).</li>
            <li> This wax is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> --Wax in whatever position you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Before I can really review this wax, I&#x27;ll be completely honest with you: this hurts like a b</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> so I could be silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> The prep oil makes it sticky wax free so you don&#x27;t get it stuck on your finger and nails.</li>
            <li> stuff works and will leave u just as smooth as the salon.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this honestly I didn&#x27;t believe all the complaints about it hurting so much.</li>
            <li> If I do I will get back on here and say how great it is</li>
            <li> Figuring out timing to remove wax is important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from perfect and far from painless, but it works and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it did not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was brave enough to try this.  </li>
            <li> I received it in a very short time and it was in great condition.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am really happy with this product</li>
            <li> Easy clean up.</li>
            <li> So my second shot was with Surgi after reading great reviews on here.</li>
            <li> B00008BK7H NeutrogenaBody Oil, Light Sesame Formula, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> candle, cup, or wax warmer to keep the right consistency is a huge help!</li>
            <li> and it took everything right off :)</li>
            <li> This is saving me so much money from going to the spa every month!!!</li>
            <li> YOU TEST IT FIRST!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li> --DO ENJOY your new brazilian wax!!!     :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to walk Ulta yesterday to see this product priced so cheaply.</li>
            <li> But for all you nay sayers, definitely try this because it&#x27;s a great wax that really gets EVERYTHING leaving it silky smooth, and is also probably the most pain free wax I&#x27;ve used (oxymoron for pain free and waxing, I know).</li>
            <li> Works like a charm every month for a clean smooth.....</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> (first wax ever, never got it done professionally) but I am really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely liked Parissa, but the price is so high.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at the drugstore, recently, so I was thrilled to see it is available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works, it smells great and lasts a long time.   </li>
            <li> i love love love this waxing kit personally.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed usually</li>
            <li> Make sure your body heat isn&#x27;t too hot, or it won&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> At the pack-of-three-price I find it&#x27;s better to just throw away the rest of the jar and start fresh each time which seems to be cost effective compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for a professional session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the pack-of-three-price I find it&#x27;s better to just throw away the rest of the jar and start fresh each time which seems to be cost effective compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for a professional session.  </li>
            <li> but it is so worth it!  </li>
            <li> So even if you are too scared to do a Brazilian, this wax is worth it for your underarms!</li>
            <li> My finger poked through a crust on top into hot liquid wax underneath.  </li>
            <li> but overall, it works nicely!</li>
            <li> I am more than willing to do this again.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try waxing</li>
            <li> Is there a better one to use if you are waxing for the first time ever?</li>
            <li> To save money, I then began buying Poetic Waxing from Bliss.</li>
            <li> Best small area wax I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate, apply oil, make sure the wax is not too hot (just as instructions recommend), then pull off without any strips.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, however I suffered a severe allergic reaction to it that lasted for about a week.  </li>
            <li> First time heating up the wax takes more than a minute for me.</li>
            <li> strongly suggest using a mug warmer with this as the wax does cool somewhat quickly (by design I think).  </li>
            <li> Doesn’t get real hot, so no burning, hardens quickly, and the prep cream makes it as pain free as the activity can ever be.</li>
            <li> It does manage to get a lot of the hair off, however, never on one clean strip.</li>
            <li> Then it is easiest to clean by chipping away at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I brought this because I figured if women use this for their more sensitive areas then it will surely be ok to use on my chest.</li>
            <li> More amazing because my local stores all seem to be switching to Nair products which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed before with waxing strips which I find the most effective and convenient because you can reuse the strip multiple times for those problem areas.</li>
            <li> Either I had to shave them or go to a salon to get them clean.</li>
            <li> the end result is perfectly clean underarms.</li>
            <li> The Nads product boasted having a pleasant mango or similar tropical fragrance-</li>
            <li> it is still very soft and tidy.</li>
            <li> (sometimes many many moons later), smooth as smooth can be and grinning.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Brazilian style and this is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t hurt if you know how to pull right.</li>
            <li> I love surgi wax and have used it for years - it is absolutely superior to the other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> The wax comes right off!</li>
            <li> so I can enjoy some intimate time with my husband!!</li>
            <li> This product does a very good job; although once used it leaves the container messy, it removes the hair painlessly.</li>
            <li> Best hard wax for bikini area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity as it once was a great product.</li>
            <li> I really stocked up :-)</li>
            <li> If you have never used it before make sure you apply the oil liberally before you wax, it really makes it easier for the wax to come off.</li>
            <li> You just apply the wax, wait about 30 seconds for it to cool, then peel it off.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;The kit consists of a tub of microwaveable wax that you pop into the microwave for about 15-60 seconds, depending on how full the container is.</li>
            <li> You must use the oil provided reap the full benefits.  </li>
            <li> The oil works very good.(be sure to apply before waxing)  </li>
            <li> You also may need to reheat the wax before you&#x27;re finished if you are slow and methodical and intent on achieving perfect results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my friend was becoming an esthetician and I was her first time).</li>
            <li> I have loved Surgi Wax for doing my upper lip</li>
            <li> No idea if that is true or not,</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I did what it said and the product didn&#x27;t remove as much hair as I wanted or it purported itself to be able to.</li>
            <li> I only use this product when I&#x27;m not in the mood to spend the money on a good wax.</li>
            <li> This wax seems to hit the sweet spot of cost, pliability, and grip.</li>
            <li> I love the oil that comes with it, it really makes the wax peel off easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gone through a full jar and a then some (which gave me about 2 brazilian waxes)</li>
            <li> Wait to cool.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really attribute it to the wax for sure.</li>
            <li> but i cant use it for a full brazilian waxing</li>
            <li> but its overall a good product.</li>
            <li> The wax is not bad at all</li>
            <li> I apply the muslin strip quickly to the spot I want to wax, wait for it to cool and rip it off.</li>
            <li> (other than some hair.. LOL).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this on other parts of my body with great results.  </li>
            <li> Why isn&#x27;t this brand more popular or widely used, I wonder?</li>
            <li> my hair seems to grow out fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Place the container on a paper plate in the microwave for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> For people who say it solidified too quickly, there are two things you can do.</li>
            <li> but I was lucky to have a wax warmer</li>
            <li> Then, when you try to pull it off quickly, it gets stuck to your skin</li>
            <li> and I would have to go over the same place more than once and sometimes more than twice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my results were WAY better than expected.</li>
            <li> Generously apply the provided oil (super important!).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I tried a quick test on the knee which didn&#x27;t even hurt and proceeded to start on a side just about level to the clit.  </li>
            <li> That aside, great solid no frills product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> but if you apply it to thin it will not work, you kind of have to find that happy medium.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different waxes, and this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> is BEFORE it&#x27;s fully hardened otherwise it will break and you end up turning one quick moment of pain into 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dries too quickly and cracks</li>
            <li> I love this particular Brazilian wax product because it doesn&#x27;t require wax strips.</li>
            <li> There are lots of other good (long) reviews that give great tips, read those.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, cheap, does not hurt like normal waxing.</li>
            <li> Have some Goo-Gone handy (general sticky-removal product) to remove wax from your fingers and furniture...</li>
            <li> I was able to finish the job, but what would normally be a 15 minute routine took me an hour from start to finish.  </li>
            <li> also doesn&#x27;t as quickly and cleanly as it says, but this was my first kit that I bought and not a bad choice I would say for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Before I tried any major areas I decided to do a really easy place, my knuckles, lol I have some blonde hair there that has always bugged me.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for any beginners or anyone who wants a easy and quick solution for hair removal.</li>
            <li> So I just use this for hard to reach hairs in certain creases that razors cant get to very easily and work great for me.</li>
            <li> Its super first time user friendly</li>
            <li> When I used my new wax purchase, I was extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome and, as long as you can tolerate the self-induced pain that comes along with an at-home wax, it definitely gets the job done with salon-quality results!</li>
            <li> Okay so let me start off by saying I was very scared when I first bought this.</li>
            <li> I had been using for years and really work for me, and with the pre-oil makes the hair easy to pull out off.</li>
            <li> The wax was fresh, hardened quickly when applied and removed without residue.</li>
            <li> But this is the easiest to use in that you can quickly microwave it, it does not require strips, and the pot has a great little handle to carry the mug.</li>
            <li> I lay the paper in a single strip over the wax once i apply it over my skin (when the wax is still warm)It helps give a good grip.      </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much easier to rip off quickly, which honestly does make it effective, and much less pain.</li>
            <li> it is an entirely different (and better!)</li>
            <li> I knew nothing of waxing and now after my first Brazilian wax, I felt like a pro!</li>
            <li> always remember to put the oil on first too!</li>
            <li> Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that works for me - love it!</li>
            <li> On the first try I felt like I was in a salon in my home town in Brazil!</li>
            <li> They are smooth (not stubbly) for the first time in my life, and if I do it right after I get out of the shower it does not hurt at all.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot less pain (be honest: you&#x27;re ripping hair out, it&#x27;s going to hurt a bit), but it&#x27;s more than bearable.  </li>
            <li> So, even if it did gave me great deal of pain the first time, and some mess to clean up, it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> Started way out at the edges of the hair and that worked fine -- it really stung, but it wasn&#x27;t outlandish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be able to do it myself, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, hairy girls, get it done by someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing your first time!</li>
            <li> My wallet is grateful and my calendar is a little more free being able to do this by myself</li>
            <li> , nothing beats the fast &amp; smooth effects of Surgi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , hell, I wear 4\\&quot; heels to work sometimes, the pain is worth the beauty aspect of it.</li>
            <li> If you spill hot wax just leave it and let it cool and harden.</li>
            <li> Ladies its cheaper using this kit at home rather than going to the salon and plus its with your own private eyes.</li>
            <li> Even though I knew what to expect pain wise, there is definitely a learning curve involved in mastering this skill which is probably why the salons charge so much to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, and it works.</li>
            <li> Your skin tends to be more sensitive where it&#x27;s closer to the belly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about trying to wax on yur own, definitely try this!  </li>
            <li> In a more sensitive area, let&#x27;s say.  </li>
            <li> It does take about a box a leg however if you&#x27;re not totally grossed out by your own leg hair</li>
            <li> I just did my second waxing on my own and it was</li>
            <li> My biggest gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t lift good in the harder to reach (oh so tender) areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be happy to pay extra to get it professionally done in a salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been either getting brazilians or doing my own for 12 years, and when I don&#x27;t want to pay someone to do it for me, this is the only viable alternative.  </li>
            <li> Do it every three or four weeks, and apply it in thin (1mm) layers for the best results.</li>
            <li> I would rather do a bikini wax on myself than let someone else do it again, I was bruised and going to a professional was MORE PAIN and not to mention COSTLY than doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> this wax works well but not on the most sensitive areas..</li>
            <li> a useful epilation oil included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, when I finally started moving inwards after getting the edges, it was some kind of hell.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the effort to curse at.</li>
            <li> Also, after reading reviews, I was paranoid that I would leave the wax on too long, but I found that I was often trying to pull it off too soon, so I know now not to be so quick to jump the gun.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a FANTASTIC product, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you MUST be sure of is to follow the directions and clean the area thoroughly, then use plenty of the oil they provide.   </li>
            <li> seriously, i save so much waxing myself with this awesome wax.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to not get your skin as much, and it&#x27;s significantly easier to pull out the hair....</li>
            <li> I admit that it might have been easier for me, because I have been going to the salon for this procedure for 2 or 3 years now, so the hair is much thinner by now, easier to pull off, and I am familiar with the procedure.</li>
            <li> The right temperature wax and the right amount of pre-epilation oil.</li>
            <li> just wanted to add that I started using tea tree oil right after I wax</li>
            <li> just wanted to add that I started using tea tree oil right after I wax</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect it to all just come right off like when you shave.    </li>
            <li> Apply pressure to the skin right after you pull the wax.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I should say right up front that I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian at a salon...</li>
            <li> I found that it defiantly needs to be in the microwave longer than the directions say, right out of the package or remelted.</li>
            <li> The hair just lifts right off after putting on the oil and wax.</li>
            <li> The wax came right off my nails!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I will spend the extra money to make sure I get it done right!</li>
            <li> Just had to try it on right away.</li>
            <li> I could kiss the inventor right now.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re reading this right now with your legs splayed...</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff that is gentle enough to use on your face and tends to pull out more hair than the other brands, plus its inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten a professional wax before, and i wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the first time being one with everything out there...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use when following the directions.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and relatively painless!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wax to get smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I am super happy that I bought this, as this will probably be my new &amp;#34;hair down there&amp;#34; maintenance routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of self-waxing kits and, by far, this one is the best!  </li>
            <li> But considering this was my first time doing it myself, I know I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Considering the price per waxing at home compared to having it done at a spa, I think it&#x27;s worth the self-inflicted pain for so much cheaper vs the professional inflicted pain for considerably more money.</li>
            <li> and then WAIT for it to cool by stirring and blowing on it gently.</li>
            <li> Romantic life effectively ruined; and I could have probably opened my own waxing place with the money I&#x27;ve spent dealing with ingrowns.    </li>
            <li> The microwave directions are a very general guideline, you will have to start on small settings and figure out what works best for your microwave.</li>
            <li> Its the only wax that removes everything and is soooo easy to use with no strips!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little messier, but I am sure I will get better with practice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you put a muslin strip right over the hot wax when you apply the was, you don&#x27;t have to do the \\&quot;peel up\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping as well.   </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and not messy at all.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered that waxing my armpits is far superior to shaving.  </li>
            <li> One negative is having to get up from my barricaded room to warm up the wax in the micro many times.  </li>
            <li> I usually wax between my eyebrows while the wax is still hot and it works great there too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li> whole process took me about 45 minutes for my very first try.</li>
            <li> For comparison purposes, I think the Completely Bare wax is more effective in that it grabs hair better and removes more hair per application, but it is extremely messy to use due to</li>
            <li> I wanted to quit and throw it away, but I got on youtube and found that very very helpful video.</li>
            <li> I need it very fast</li>
            <li> More effective than soft wax and cloth strips  Removes the hair more effectively &#x3D; less overall pain (having to redo it)  </li>
            <li> The product leaves the same smooth, clean look as the salon without the cost.</li>
            <li> Its super easy to do my pits now, and relatively mess-free.</li>
            <li> so my brazilian waxing appointments were one of the first expenses I cut from my budget.</li>
            <li> I use this wax the most for the majority of my hair removal; not just for private parts.</li>
            <li> and, well, waxing isn&#x27;t supposed to be completely pain free.</li>
            <li> , it will be hot when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I had to go back to the microwave 2 more times...</li>
            <li> You might try Orajel Max strength; even tho it feels funny when applied</li>
            <li> Plus, as you wax more, the hair grows back thinner and finer.      </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more than enough oil to cover everything you&#x27;re going to wax, so don&#x27;t skimp.  </li>
            <li> (this is my first time waxing...)</li>
            <li> This product really didn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li> The first strip hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> so make sure you start low)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time waxer, yes, it will hurt.  </li>
            <li> I received this product within the timeframe quoted and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is to make sure you pull on only the hair and not your skin since without oil the wax will stick to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> You know exactly what you&#x27;re doing and how to do it, even if you&#x27;ve never tried this before now.</li>
            <li> I followed many tips people had left on here</li>
            <li> Is it really worth this much pain to be hair-free?</li>
            <li> exactly* what you are getting into here</li>
            <li> I have tried out many different waxes over the years...</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> which is how i came across it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It can be time consuming if it&#x27;s your first wax</li>
            <li> When I first started waxing I went to a salon/spa and paid up to $60 every 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Worked very well!</li>
            <li> It is either too hot or too stringy.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I used the oil first).  </li>
            <li> This guarantees a very even application!</li>
            <li> If the wax has a watery consistency, it is too hot.</li>
            <li> PS, I bought a MisterCoffee cup warming plate to keep the wax hot after microwaving it.  </li>
            <li> Not only will it prepare you for the pain, but it will also give you a much better idea of how to use this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first pot.  </li>
            <li> The first problem was that I heated the wax in a microwave for the prescribed time, but it wasn&#x27;t melting.  </li>
            <li> So when you do the brazilian yourself with SurgiWax, you won&#x27;t need to cover so much ground!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll thank me later :)&lt;</li>
            <li> You just heat this in the microwave and its ready!  </li>
            <li> works really well!</li>
            <li> first time I&#x27;ve waxed after avoiding at home waxing for a while....</li>
            <li> The thing that hurt the most was the hair ripping out when I was peeling back the first bit to grab on to.</li>
            <li> i have used so many different waxing products...</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T forget to apply the oil first.  </li>
            <li> First, the wax takes way longer to heat up then the instructions state.  </li>
            <li> I took Tylenol and even used a numbing cream the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> If you go any larger it becomes a bit more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the oil in the box before starting.</li>
            <li> Just heat and lay it on while it&#x27;s warm..not hot</li>
            <li> It was my first time waxing</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was my first time waxing brazilian</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order some more packages together with Surgi wax for facial hair....</li>
            <li> I used it for the second time yesterday and it was wayyyyy better than the first time.</li>
            <li> The second time around, i felt more at ease</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Also note, this was my first time waxing myself</li>
            <li> Fast waxing!</li>
            <li> I was really upset til i found it here on amazon, and CHEAPER!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the price--3 jars for under $20 bucks--compared to how much brazilian wax costs!</li>
            <li> Go get one done professionally first</li>
            <li> so you get a first hand experience on how they do it...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> You MAY be able to get more than one application per jar, but I only had about 1/4 of the jar left and just threw the remainder away.</li>
            <li> I actually saw one drop of blood on that side, but it felt like it should be much more.  </li>
            <li> I admit this is the first time I tried waxing.</li>
            <li> First time I purchased I tried it for both my under arms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> First time users-</li>
            <li> The first time I tried (before I watched the youtube video)</li>
            <li> You then just have to heat up the wax for 30 sec or so in the microwave and when its warm (but NOT scorching hot)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even halfway through the first and my oil is just about gone.</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Also, prepare to use the tweezers because it most likely will not remove all hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax that has actually been able to remove most or all hair</li>
            <li> and you will end up using way more wax than you need and may have to redo the area.&lt;br /&gt;-I apply the wax against the hair growth (not in teh same direction like the container</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, this isn&#x27;t rocket science.  </li>
            <li> The first time you wax your snatch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first time waxing or first self wax</li>
            <li> /&gt;Technique: I made some mistakes as it was my first time</li>
            <li> like I did the first time and it will take longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about as much time as it would if went to the salon, but just for a portion of the price!</li>
            <li> a glass of wine prior to waxing give you more courage to pull, and numbs it a bit  ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this</li>
            <li> First off the heating times on the instructions are way off.</li>
            <li> i think a candle warmer or something to keep the wax hot is a must...</li>
            <li> I have used this several years and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and it was the first time I&#x27;d waxed by myself.</li>
            <li> sure enough...</li>
            <li> When me and my husband decided to move to the US to persue our master&#x27;s degree one of the first practical worries that I started having was how on earth</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;d try this one since it had such lovely reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first at-home brazilian.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 2 hours since it was my first time, and then I decided to try it on my underarms, as suggested.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on my legs but they require too much wax to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> I received my latest shipment yesterday and tried to wax my underarms as I have done many times in the past.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used wax.</li>
            <li> First time will hurt, so buy some numbing cream to put on it 2 hrs before you use this wax.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this wax I was horrified.</li>
            <li> You must prep your skin first with an oil they provide, then apply the wax.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the hair that grows back is softer, but its definitely more manageable (grows in one direction).</li>
            <li> First of all i had to heat the wax for WELL over</li>
            <li> I realize that some people say that this improved version of surgi wax isn&#x27;t as good as the old one, but I unfortunately never used the former wax, so I can&#x27;t really say anything about that.</li>
            <li> This wax is very easy to use (can be a little messy) and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind this IS waxing in a very sensitive area, I found the level of pain to be acceptable and much more tolerable than salon soft wax strips.</li>
            <li> If you will be waxing anything more than a tiny area I would suggest using cloth strips as this wax will tear if the area you are trying to remove is too large.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, take some kind of pain med before waxing and remember that pain threshold is lowest just before menstruation.</li>
            <li> but it was not worse than it was at the salon, actually the wax was way better.</li>
            <li> As long as it isn&#x27;t too hot on your skin, the hotter the better.</li>
            <li> I was only able to do the very front part.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my legs, because the formula is superior to the regular Surgi-Wax.</li>
            <li> you must pull the wax as soon as it is not sticky, it feels soft , moldable but not dried, it will hurt but is better than shaving or wax strips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 6 months and loved the results...until my last shipment.  </li>
            <li> i am a first time user of ANY kind of wax &#x27;down there&#x27; and took a chance on this product after reading the reviews...</li>
            <li> It is a little more involved than I originally thought so</li>
            <li> It took me a long time, because I needed more practice.</li>
            <li> do too much at once; I had to do my first home waxing over three sessions over a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this wax before but this time I used the strips with the wax and it worked a lot better with them and it didn&#x27;t take as long.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that it was just the first time that hurts so much...</li>
            <li> I bought a Mr.Coffee mug warmer with this product and it kept it at a consistent temperature during the whole process.</li>
            <li> First, the application is straight forward.  </li>
            <li> My tips: make sure you DON&#x27;T leave it on too long.  </li>
            <li> If it runs off the spoon too fast then it&#x27;s too hot and your burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Also, please note if you wax your whole face for the first time you will break out.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is really good for its price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very painful, better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Decent product, I&#x27;ve used better products around the same price range.</li>
            <li> I started using this product for my upper lips several years ago, as it is more cost effective than the smaller product marketed for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Honestly id rather pay someone to do this because at least then id know it was done right!</li>
            <li> I just want to start this review by saying that this product gets 4 stars because it was easy to use, worked great on the areas I was able to get done, and was overall not an unpleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews have said that the product takes longer to heat up than listed, but I found that the directions they provide are pretty accurate (and I only had to reheat</li>
            <li> Sounds easy enough...</li>
            <li> I eventually got through the entire area quite easily</li>
            <li> This wax never hardens enough to be pulled off easily.</li>
            <li> You know those remnants of wax that you always have left that easily wash off with soap and water?</li>
            <li> If you use it straight out of the microwave when it&#x27;s very creamy, of course it&#x27;s going to be hot.</li>
            <li> Ripping off soft wax hurts and is super</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do this close to the time of your period when skin can be more sensitive in general.</li>
            <li> It is SO simple and easy.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, but I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> , you must microwave it to heat it up, so you&#x27;ll be giving... certain parts radiation.</li>
            <li> I found myself having to shave over certain areas the wax didn&#x27;t fully get.</li>
            <li> I use a Brazilian hard body wax, because its easy to use, and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff!!    </li>
            <li> You might have to let it cool a little bit right out of the microwave, but once it&#x27;s a comfortable temperature</li>
            <li> It totally worked- fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The pre-puberty look has never been one I wanted to return to, but I do like the idea of being nearly hair free lower down for cleanliness and maybe to encourage my husband to spend more time there.  </li>
            <li> Hard to warm up to the right temperature without being too hot.  </li>
            <li> If you want to be thorough, you definitely need a mirror to get in all those nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;- When I first started waxing, I thought it would hurt more the further back into your precious lady.  </li>
            <li> Gets the fine hairs as well as the bigger ones for a hairless result</li>
            <li> After I finish waxing I can massage with a little oil (it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind) and any clinging bits of wax come</li>
            <li> I recommend getting one of those little pads that you plug in to keep your coffee warm and setting it on there.</li>
            <li> My wax always seems to take a little longer to heat than the instructions say but it stays warm plenty of time to wax um...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people trying to wax the first time.</li>
            <li> For the die hard &amp;#34;do-it-yourselfer&amp;#34; this product is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Once I got the technique down, it was easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with a slightly wider and more flat tipped version and that seems to work much better.  </li>
            <li> I need more practice to perfect using this product, as it took me 2-1/2 hours to wax my entire bikini area and certain areas were a lot more painful and harder for the wax to pull up than others</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to get a professional one, at least look up tutorials or videos on how to do this if you want great results.    </li>
            <li> the oil before waxing DEFINITELY makes a huge difference, so does taking the time, and not trying to pull too soon.</li>
            <li> Yes, Brazilian bikini waxes are very convenient...</li>
            <li> I have tried others and they are very lacking.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> very liquidy/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be tentative, if you go fast it won&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really helps to see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to use and gets all the hair as opposed to strips.</li>
            <li> I really with someone</li>
            <li> fit into the former description</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and works very well.</li>
            <li> This made grabbing the tab much easier.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really bother me much.</li>
            <li> Just pop it in the microwave and its ready to go.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier than the stuff with the paper or cotton strips for removing</li>
            <li> I have very course hair and this wax kept it off for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you want to wax your eyebrows or anything else, this is a very cost-effective way too get all the wax you need.</li>
            <li> If using it on your face, you really don&#x27;t need to use the prep oil.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> But having my lady parts ripped/pulled at was just too much to bear.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
            <li> someone else do it would have gotten it done much quicker.  </li>
            <li> This is not flimsy stuff, but neither is it that super-hard consistency you get when you heat the Parissa too much on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it to wax my underarms, and it really is almost painless.  </li>
            <li> THUS, I HIGHLY recommend Surgi-wax!</li>
            <li> Then I sit on the very edge of the stool and use the magnified side of my hand mirror set on the floor, so that I can see where to apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product cools to fast once out of microwave and stirred.</li>
            <li> hair, the longer the hair, the harder for the wax to stick and more chances</li>
            <li> Maybe I used too much wax?</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I used the oil to remove piece by piece haha</li>
            <li> The box comes with two \\&quot;wooden spatulas\\&quot;, or small popsicle sticks, which worked great for first use.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know how much it would hurt..</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;honey\\&quot; consistantcy the whole time I needed it without a warmer.</li>
            <li> I also advise not to pour too much on because then the wax won&#x27;t stick to the hairs</li>
            <li> The pre-wax oil really helps.</li>
            <li> Unless you really, really have a lot of self control.</li>
            <li> It really hurts.</li>
            <li> So much.</li>
            <li> because I really almost didn&#x27;t make it..&gt;</li>
            <li> I invested in a cheap corning ware one that is a different pattern from those I eat off of.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the pain part much</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s supposed to hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one really sticks to the hair</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and underarms and it is quite gentle.</li>
            <li> If the wax has hardened too much, then it hurts removing the wax.  </li>
            <li> but it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest buying it!</li>
            <li> It did not remove hair very well in my experience.</li>
            <li> Saves me so much money to do it myself.</li>
            <li> The oil that comes with it to keep the wax from adhering to the skin is also really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t burn you and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It also cooled EXTREMELY fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product to wax my armpits myself.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works very well</li>
            <li> Doing it by yourself takes forever and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> the product works and its much much cheaper than going to the salon or even purchasing Bliss&#x27; at home kit (which i find the container to be bulky and it does not have a cover).  </li>
            <li> and yes, it does hurt but not as much as I</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really hurt to me...</li>
            <li> I ventured a bit lower and found that it did not hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li> It took out the thicker hairs really well</li>
            <li> If you think you put too much, get a piece of notebook/computer paper and dab a bit, then rub evenly with your fingers to redistribute the oil evenly again.  </li>
            <li> It works really well for the underarms and bikini areas.    </li>
            <li> I like this stuff as much as a person can like something that is basically used for torture.</li>
            <li> which means you don&#x27;t worry about having too much wax and no way to yank it off.</li>
            <li> The wax solidify fast.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HURTS</li>
            <li> I love this item, I use to but it at any pharmacy but now only amazon and a a few more websites sell them.</li>
            <li> Then again, I could be putting on too much wax.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, I really like it</li>
            <li> This wax surrounds the hair and makes the pulling/removal really easy.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I have so much experience and confidence waxing</li>
            <li> Order really was an order of 3 boxes.</li>
            <li> so I can pull fast.  </li>
            <li> cleanup is REALLY easy.&lt;br /&gt;- as recommended by someone else, the tea tree oil after, it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I tried it on my underarms and never had so much pain.  </li>
            <li> Once it thickened i tested it on my leg and it was still really sticky.</li>
            <li> The economy isn&#x27;t really working on my favor either.</li>
            <li> so i muddled through the whole process wishing i had cut the hair a tad shorter...</li>
            <li> and i would also buy some oil since i was using canola after the whole process to try and get some wax off me...  </li>
            <li> I might try again soon, but with much hesitation.</li>
            <li> is to much.</li>
            <li> Was an absolute catastrophic mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really bummed.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Surgi.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it harden too much.</li>
            <li> When you peel it off, it comes off in pieces not the whole strip all at once.</li>
            <li> but is real wax I put it on the microwave for  1 minute then</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for about 8 years now and highly suggest it!</li>
            <li> Also, I suspect they integratged some kind of agent that lets it only soften properly for one time.</li>
            <li> It applies unevenly, there&#x27;s no way to get nice even applications, and then there&#x27;s the added dripping of wax all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you follow all the steps carefully, it won&#x27;t hurt much any more.</li>
            <li> So this was a big leap of faith for me to use wax on this even more sensitive area.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do it without or you will be going back and forth to keep the jar warm enough to work with.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just going to tidy up around the edges, as it were, this is doable and not too messy.  </li>
            <li> It is the only waxing kit that I found to be convenient, effective, and simple.</li>
            <li> Do not spread it on too thin or try to offset that by reapplying more on top.  </li>
            <li> I have tried scrubbing, rubbing with oil, attaching to a muslin strip, rubbing the area with a thick moisturizer, but this garbage is here for good.    </li>
            <li> You want to melt the whole bottle, which will help it from harding as quickly, but be aware it melts from the middle</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s mainly because this is such a great product for getting all the pesky little hairs.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, it comes off easily and leaves the skin bare and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of waxing, but I decided to give this a try due to good reviews....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for other areas of the body too, like the upper lip, tummy, bikini, and the rear!</li>
            <li> Everyone has their own pain tolerance, and this is a sensitive area, so don&#x27;t read other reviews saying it is &amp;#34;pain-free&amp;#34; and think it will be for you too.  </li>
            <li> I read more positive than negative and quickly became optimistic.</li>
            <li> , you can re-melt the used wax (stuff it back in the original jar) and reapply.</li>
            <li> This product is the only wax in the United States that in near as good as the south american waxes - mess free!</li>
            <li> Of course some areas hurt more than other, but just woman up and deal with it if you don&#x27;t want to see hair in that area for 2+ weeks.</li>
            <li> Works as well or better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> other than that, I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to use once I got the hang of it-a bit messy at first.</li>
            <li> Very few strays, clean application and strong hold.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it, really I did.</li>
            <li> After my first wax the hair took about 3 weeks to grow back and it came in much thinner (which I was pretty excited about because I have always shaved and everytime it feels like it comes back thicker and thicker).</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, about that sub-label \\&quot;use for private parts\\&quot;... I don&#x27;t see how that makes it special...</li>
            <li> I used up half a jar for both my underarms but probably used more than I should have because each application was really thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s quite tricky and you need to be somewhat of a contortionist to actually carry out this procedure on yourself, it really does a super job if you take your time and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty clear.    </li>
            <li> exactly that of my professional appointments</li>
            <li> One jar is enough for a full wax job if you recycle the beginning pieces which I tend to do.</li>
            <li> It has been 2months since my last full body waxing:</li>
            <li> Unlike Sally Hansen, it doesn&#x27;t become brittle as soon as it is cool enough to touch.</li>
            <li> I nearly packed up after that first one.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it barely hurts and it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> have zero experience with bikini waxing of any kind professional or home, and I thought that it would be a lot more complicated than it was.</li>
            <li> Not really messy, unless you are a first timer..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to tell when the wax is too hot to apply (burns down there &#x3D; ouch!), and it removes hair really well -- even when it&#x27;s on the shorter side --</li>
            <li> Secondly, I highly, highly, highly suggest getting a professional wax first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doable, but I HIGHLY recommend going somewhere and getting it done professionally the first time.</li>
            <li> Its easy to be discouraged when using it for the first time just because you need to get organized and find out how long is actually long enough to microwave it (since I usually had to microwave it for double what the directions said, maybe even more), and most importantly, get used to the fact that if you&#x27;re new to waxing, its going to hurt (but you get used to it if you stick with it-</li>
            <li> This hard wax is more time consuming but worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as other home wax kits, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to Brazilian waxing, I would bypass this and go straight to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I like it more runny because you can use less wax but still remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> Assuming that you get three uses out of a jar, you are paying less than two bucks per wax session :-)</li>
            <li> I was half done, or better say un-done...</li>
            <li> I do think the private areas are easier done in a salon, as it is quick</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll have to go over the same area more than once</li>
            <li> After refining your skills and knowing what to expect, it only gets better and is actually addictive.  </li>
            <li> A quick tip from a male user.</li>
            <li> However, I will definitely be buying a pack of more for the next time.</li>
            <li> Maybe you will get lucky and it will be, but likely there will be some pain.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face.(It&#x27;s more economical,then buying the facial wax and works the same.)</li>
            <li> In my microwave, which isn&#x27;t older than 4-5 years, doesn&#x27;t quite melt the wax in order to use it on myself with the suggested time.</li>
            <li> main thing to know is that this product works</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s the main stuff you need to know.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have dedicated time to actually do the waxing, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner.  </li>
            <li> -Surgi doesn&#x27;t even know) and no other product removes hair as quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be investigating their other products for waxing those larger areas and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a smooth, bare bikini line or more!</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hair out (and I mean 99%), it&#x27;s very reasonably priced (1 jar lasts me 4 waxes), and it doesn&#x27;t hurt... that much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using a lot of oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as the title of this review suggests, this isn&#x27;t for the squeamish or newbies--unless you have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who has a fairly high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommened this product.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to waxing and have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will now have it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will now have it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone looking to save money on salon waxing services and can handle some pain.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It gets less messy as you do it more and get used to it, but still; make sure you lay out some towels.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m not woman enough for this product, even though my favorite movie is Scarface</li>
            <li> Start carefully, then enjoy your new look!  </li>
            <li> I just put some baby powder on my legs, make sure the wax has cooled a little</li>
            <li> When you rip the wax off, the wax looks like a little porcupine :)</li>
            <li> The stuff is kind of oily and hard to get off it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I never used a pre-epilation oil with hard wax years ago, and I sometimes forget to apply it with this waxing kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my mom&#x27;s home made wax my entire life (my mom is Brazilian and makes amazing waxes), but now we live across the country from each other</li>
            <li> II later found out it was because since the whole area was hair covered, it was hard to flick a tab up with your nail to get a good grip.</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have is, it can be hard to get a good hold on the wax when removeing hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While not for the faint of heart, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Directions are clear &amp; straight to the point.</li>
            <li> I got about 2 waxes out of it, and it did a great job, but I thought it was bit expensive considering shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> This wax has made hair removal so much easier and nearly pain-free.</li>
            <li> The application is much easier (a bit gooey) than just complete liquid.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d go as far as to say that it works very well.</li>
            <li> but when I went to my normal CVS</li>
            <li> Only that it was my first time, and did not realize how much pain</li>
            <li> I love that this wax gets the job done, but it does take a few times to get used to.</li>
            <li> Make sure A) you have a bikini trimmer and trim the hair very short, about an eighth of an inch long</li>
            <li> If hair is too short then the wax can&#x27;t pick up all the hairs, and if it is too long then it will be more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I can get 2 uses out of each kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It grips the hairs better on uneven surfaces.</li>
            <li> It grips the hairs better on uneven surfaces.</li>
            <li> I did this a few more times.  </li>
            <li> After the first couple waxes, you will notice that your hair growth is slowly, thinner, and more sparse</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit messy, but i believe my technique will get better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I set it up at least a couple of hours ahead of time and let it warm and then shut it off after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Although I would suggest getting a few more sticks</li>
            <li> I pretty much just didn&#x27;t like the overall experience with it and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> ingrown hairs that you normally get form shaving</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I would be messing it up or that at the least it would hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> I let it sit a few more minutes and the samething.</li>
            <li> The mirror has the option to see magnified or normal, and I use both, dependent upon the situation or area of focus.  </li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s a good product, not great.</li>
            <li> and I will NEVER try this kind of wax down that low again.</li>
            <li> The first time you wax will hurt the most, but every subsequent time will hurt much less.    </li>
            <li> the instructions and as many reviews as possible for extra tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming to the proper length first is crucial to a good result, as well as following ALL the instructions to the letter, with no short cuts especially with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes the most hair and doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a sticky residue as other waxes, especially those that use strips.  </li>
            <li> Hard wax is soo much easier than soft wax and this is the best hard wax.  </li>
            <li> It has to be just the right temperature for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> When the wax was not heated at the right temperature and liquid form, it would not wax properly and that hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> You can avoid some irritation by doing areas that aren&#x27;t right next to where you just waxed</li>
            <li> A helpful hint - leave a little thicker edge to be able to pull from, hold skin firm, take a big inhale, then yank as you exhale - honestly  </li>
            <li> When you first start to use it, you will most likely make a huge mess due to the fact that you don&#x27;t know the nature of the wax yet.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I was pretty excited to get started...and all of my boxes (3-pack) are missing the oil.</li>
            <li> At the salon the used strips, which pretty much took away the first layer of my skin, I was in pain for the next 2 days and my private parts were swollen, but not with this wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super duper clean and nowhere near as messy as soft wax/sugar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Surgi Wax is more messy than sugaring in that it makes strings the same way hot glue does, but sugaring is sticky on my skin even after I remove the hair, resulting in me sticking to things and to myself.</li>
            <li> My husband likened the experience of Surgiwax to getting the first car you could afford on your own: it was not a good car, but because you never had another one, you like it!</li>
            <li> but I would have liked for the waxing stick to be a little longer and bigger.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m no wimp, I have several tattoos and microdermal anchor piercings--so I like to think my pain tolerance is pretty darn high.</li>
            <li> Whereas I did not do the full Brazilian job, the areas I waxed just outside my bikini line and slightly along the inside felt smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I always buy one of the cheapest options when I do something new because if I make a mistake I don&#x27;t feel so bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in NYC</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m still new to home waxing</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant as a bunch of people said the \\&quot;new improved\\</li>
            <li> For people who gave up because of pain, I would say to take a Motrin, use plenty of the oil, and the instructions say you can rub down the area with an ice cube or use numbing spray (I didn&#x27;t do either), and lastly just bear through the whole process because it does get better.</li>
            <li> This works a lot better on uneven surfaces than soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This works a lot better on uneven surfaces than soft wax.   </li>
            <li> you have to put enough on but not to much because if you put too much it wont take the hair off.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this wax for those of you who have really stubborn hairs like me because this wax gets even the tiniest hairs, which is the main reason why I keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Even when I used copious amounts of the oil provided, the wax still stuck to my skin in some very sensitive places...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; have no problems..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Microwave: This wax melts very fast and you will have to reheat it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Be ready to take off the strip pretty quickly (within about 20-30 sec of application because a minute is way too long).  </li>
            <li> (which is usually a no</li>
            <li> My first and last time waxing, I learned from my mistake.</li>
            <li> I had never waxed any part of my body before using this and took a big risk going with a Brazilian my first time out.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little nervous using this product because I have never waxed before and to start a first try on a Brazilian wax is risky!</li>
            <li> First, I trimmed the hair very short &amp; used the included oil beforehand.</li>
            <li> ALSO, I used this to do my underarms and WOW!  </li>
            <li> Run far away from this!</li>
            <li> And a hell of a lot cheaper than paying to have it done professionally!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the fact that this is messy as hell and required frequent re-heating, way better and cheaper than a professional.</li>
            <li> , just remember, it only hurts for a moment ;-)</li>
            <li> When I finally got to the waxing part it hurt way more than expected, and it didn&#x27;t even remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product ive used when i decided to do my waxing at home.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products for removing hair, including various wax kits from other brands, but this is the only one I love and the only one I unreservedly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this wax and my first amazon review.      </li>
            <li> The pain only exist when you are ripping the strip, which should only last at most 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> I finally got the nerve to try this product for my first Brazilian wax ever.  </li>
            <li> so you want to head these warnings, especially if it is your first time self waxing.</li>
            <li> The wax will occasionally form a tiny filament between the applicator and the jar, but it cools quickly and falls off -- usually right back into the jar.    </li>
            <li> Helps to stretch the skin a lot and press down lightly on an area after you rip the strip</li>
            <li> This product was very messy, took forever to heat up, and had to be applied many times.</li>
            <li> When you live in a Manhattan apartment, that becomes an issue quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any and all attempts by my wife to come near my hairy man legs with this wax have resulted in me locking myself in the bedroom and threatening to call the National Guard.</li>
            <li> If youare a first time waxer, I would highly recommend to take little chunks and don&#x27;t get too close the first time</li>
            <li> i did laugh at myself a few times considering i&#x27;m a 57 year old female who just gave herself her first brazilian!!....</li>
            <li> As long as you time your pulls right</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pain free, I was ripping out hair from the root, but so much less so than Surgi-wax.  </li>
            <li> The top of the wax may seem like its still solid, but the bottom half is actually burning hot.</li>
            <li> careful with the hot wax, if it is really watery when it comes out of the microwave</li>
            <li> be SUPER careful that you don&#x27;t accidently drip wax on the hair.</li>
            <li> Really was easy and not at all hard to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decided this was a job I could do myself rather than shelling out $80-$100 at a local salon.</li>
            <li> This works well and is so much mess free if used correctly.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally corse and this wax removed it completely!</li>
            <li> I mean, more than normal wax ever should be.</li>
            <li> I am black and have coarse hair, I didn&#x27;t need to reapply and love the fact of no strip.</li>
            <li> the downside, could use more application sticks per pack (only two provided) and it smells... odd, and quite pungent.</li>
            <li> was a big bubble that never popped &amp; we had to pop it &amp; then the wax was so hot you had to let it cool down.</li>
            <li> One complaint I have is that the microwave directions weren&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
            <li> Had issues with the actual wax--it hardens very, very quickly &amp; would stick to the tiny wooden spatula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I was only waxing my underarms, as I can&#x27;t imagine the mess and pain</li>
            <li> The trickiest part is flipping up the end of the wax so that it&#x27;s big enough for you to grip and strong enough that it doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for years- only certain chains carry it which always makes it a hassle to find.  </li>
            <li> Before you wax, make sure that if you need to trim hair down a bit that you do or if it is your first time waxing shave the area that you are going to wax and let it grow out to about a half an inch.</li>
            <li> All in all, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other kind of waxing kit other than Surgi!</li>
            <li> The wax is easy to use and really grabs all the fine hairs that other waxes may leave behind.  </li>
            <li> the results are long lasting and effective - for those who are sensitive to chemical hair removal or break out from other wax formulas</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what some people say, (perhaps they are cyborgs?), ripping out hair down there hurts like mess but this stuff is efficient and gets most of the hair the first time.</li>
            <li> The pain is minimal and it requires minimal clean up, just don&#x27;t forget to apply the oil first.</li>
            <li> The oil seems like it should make the wax slip off the hair, but thankfully, it seems to help mostly with not sticking little extra bits to the skin.</li>
            <li> I spent 45 minutes trying to get the wax off until I realized that you can warm it with friction, add a little oil, and it comes off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get much more than that done without help from someone else.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used hard wax at home in many years.</li>
            <li> I hardly have any hair any more.</li>
            <li> so it might feel hard at the top</li>
            <li> The little cups are easy to use, but the wax does cool and become too thick to use pretty quickly (unless you follow the advice of one of the other commenters here and keep the jar on a mug warmer  - that did help!).</li>
            <li> If you do, it may feel hard on top but still be soft underneath.</li>
            <li> Anyway, she uses \\&quot;hard wax\\&quot; and after spending way to much every month for her to wax my underarms, I decided to look for the same (or similar) kind of stuff online and came across this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a great texture (like cold honey?</li>
            <li> The entire experience took me 2 days to complete (I needed a break haha).  </li>
            <li> And, I also used it for my eyebrows and although it&#x27;s difficult to shape them this way, it&#x27;s great for larger areas like the unibrow area and underneath them.  </li>
            <li> They have clear instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re saving a lot of money now that we can &#x27;clear the forest&#x27; in-house instead of at a salon.</li>
            <li> as far as having someone do all that business for you...</li>
            <li> No messy strips, either.</li>
            <li> no when waxing that sensitive area)</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> It really helps prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the hair grow back slower and thinner.  </li>
            <li> It really helps prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the hair grow back slower and thinner.  </li>
            <li> This makes the process a lot easier on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The jar contains enough for about 3-6 waxes depending how much work you need done.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and well... this worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I nearly considered ending it there.</li>
            <li> Complete craziness.</li>
            <li> Amazon, please keep it stocked, I&#x27;m too old to start my quest for wax again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I had a professional wax me, I still had some residue.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t completely remove every piece of hair</li>
            <li> I heard this is when your skin is not so sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten around 6 waxes professionally, and then done at-home waxing.</li>
            <li> When I did some maintenance a week later (my hair grows fast</li>
            <li> I have never tried the soft wax with strips on the bikini</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just fork over the money and have a professional do it.  </li>
            <li> (In the meantime, I went to a salon and had a professional Brazilian wax done.  </li>
            <li> I have used it multiple times and it works very well.</li>
            <li> As far as the temperature of the wax- that it up to you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores of late.</li>
            <li> Wow, this works so well</li>
            <li> Really works wonders especially when used as directed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> It is not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> please, please don&#x27;t put this stuff directly on it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to re-microwave, but near the end, the applicator and sides of the pot were getting a bit gunky.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to go to a professional and have a brazilian done.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this if you&#x27;ve ever had a professional wax</li>
            <li> and you prefer soft wax.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how clear the instruction was and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Sally Hansen kit, but when the price went up to $12 per bottle at the drugstore, I couldn&#x27;t really justify spending that much on a personal grooming product that I still had to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> jesus, unless youre into S&amp;M, dont buy this, just go to a salon and get it done professionally.</li>
            <li> No messy wax strips.  </li>
            <li> results are baby soft.</li>
            <li> What I did and recommend, is to use this product somewhere where you are near a microwave</li>
            <li> when compared to ‘professional’ waxing.</li>
            <li> (for sensitive, temperature-warmer areas than face/ legs, etc)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast which was a big plus!!</li>
            <li> I tend to heat it until it&#x27;s completely liquid</li>
            <li> But, the waxing lasts about 3.5 weeks and the next time you wax it is much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old,</li>
            <li> this product was better than what I expected.. it brings an pre-waxing oil, i would recommend to use it 10 mins before start waxing so your skin will be hydrate enough to support the next steps.</li>
            <li> The product seemed old.  </li>
            <li> This was a complete pain to use.</li>
            <li> instructions are thorough and complete.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt and feels like the professional stuff.</li>
            <li> This may be the same for all waxes, but it was a real pain in the arse.</li>
            <li> Be careful and use it on a small area first to make sure you don&#x27;t peal off your skin or have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s the same, just faster and soooo much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> The short duration of pain is worth the lasting results.</li>
            <li> The package comes with three kits (three jars, six spatulas, three oils), so there&#x27;s enough for several months&#x27; worth of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This waxing kit is probably the most obnoxiously messy waxing kit I have ever used in my entire life.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get a good hold of the wax and hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too thick and sits on top of your hair, it&#x27;s going to hurt when you pull it off.  </li>
            <li> The wax is great consistency and it&#x27;s honestly the least painful product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Wait for it to cool down a bit.</li>
            <li> but when it did cool down enought to use it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the areas that I did successfully wax were left with a few broken off hairs that quickly turned into ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Since I could not get it off right away, the wax started to get sticky and soft making it even harder to remove.</li>
            <li> That being said, this wax has been great - hardens enough to keep from making the usual mess and does the job.</li>
            <li> have used many different waxing products and this is head and shoulders above all other home waxing kits.</li>
            <li> is my second Surgi product (the other one is facial hair bleaching cream), and I love it.</li>
            <li> others have stated on here, same exact procedure as always, tried to remove, it was like super stiff, yet gummy tar.</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff, easy to use, no strips needed, and a jar will usually lasts me 3-4 applications.</li>
            <li> Instructions say it takes one minute to heat a full jar, 30 seconds for half a jar, etc., but it took longer in my microwave.</li>
            <li> The wax stuck to everything and was a HUGE mess!</li>
            <li> I found it very important to use the oil and spread it all over past the hair onto the skin above it.</li>
            <li> you still want to try hair removal without having ever had a professional waxing, I&#x27;d recommend starting with something you can&#x27;t get into too much trouble with in an area that is easily reached like the legs.</li>
            <li> The oil in the box works fine, but there&#x27;s a small amount provided,</li>
            <li> You need some type of warmer to keep it as a liquid, I made no less than 10-12 trips to the microwave   </li>
            <li> How much wax you need will depend on how much hair you are removing, but I think the average person will need 1/4 jar for a bikini line wax and 1/2 jar to remove all hair (Brazilian wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed the color was different, I heated it up and discovered it does not work as well as the older version.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn you and saves multiple trips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first box is now in the trash, the second and third boxes will be going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a good note, regrowth is much slower (just coming in after about 10 days) than shaving (usually about 2 days for me) or using the hair removal cream (usually starts back within about 5-6 days having used surgi cream).</li>
            <li> I place a long piece of parchment/wax paper down on the floor and place the stool on one end of the paper; this ensures that I don&#x27;t get any wax dripping on the carpet/rug in my room and it is easy to ball up all my used wax and trash and then throw it away.</li>
            <li> The barely used jar and the 2 unopened jars went directly into the garbage.</li>
            <li> When I use my usual wax (strip free Parissa), I&#x27;m done in 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li> As you may have guessed, the closer you get to more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, the more painful it is likely to be.  </li>
            <li> I was careful to use the oil first as instructed and had no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li> And last, but not least, this wax breaks.  </li>
            <li> and it will be really really hot on your skin, so be careful.</li>
            <li> i must say, a few made me laugh out loud!...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely takes a few tries to get the hang of doing your own waxing-</li>
            <li> Nads left more of a tacky residue behind and was a bit harder to clean up.</li>
            <li> It grabs all the hairs and the only real concern I have is that, in the really sensitive areas, it has been healing a little funny for me</li>
            <li> Using it on the bikini area is difficult and often requires going over the same area more than once, which can leave redness or even mild abrasion in such a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the packaging of it is kind of small and as a result of using it for various areas, I tend to go through this pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> sugar wax is better for many reasons: it was not as messy, not as painful, and so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the oil that comes with the product, which usually removes residual wax from the skin very effectively, had a tough time removing this new formula.  </li>
            <li> I have only waxed my legs once, so this was going to be a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> It gets 99% of the hair and leaves skin soft and smooth for at least 3 weeks (for me anyway).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Surgi (formerly One Touch) roll-on strip (soft) wax for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li> salon &amp; I got 6 months worth for less than that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any difference for the regular and this one, so I actually use this on my face too and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This product not only showed up a week earlier than the estimated delivery time, but was so much easier to use than the reviews had lead me to believe it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing stops it from being messy or cooling off too quickly</li>
            <li> I had previously used a different kind of Surgi Wax, but had some problems with mess and sticking.  </li>
            <li> have to tweeze the occasional hair that the wax missed, but generally this hard wax kit works better than strip wax on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have to tweeze the occasional hair that the wax missed, but generally this hard wax kit works better than strip wax on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> In ten minutes I can be completely finished and after the first use you&#x27;ll immediately see how much finer and how much less hair grows back.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, at least I don&#x27;t itch like shaving! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done home waxing before with a salon-style crock pot and muslin strips, which was a major ordeal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will have to work up some major guts to try this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the major advantages Surgi Wax has over sugaring</li>
            <li> and I checked out other reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found any other at-home waxing kit that performs as well as this does and the price really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> No other wax works as well as this one</li>
            <li> They provide you a popsicle stick-ish applier and a small jar of pre-waxing oil (which is more than enough unless your looking to deep fry something) for every jar of wax.</li>
            <li> and I used the other kit (bikini, body and legs) first.</li>
            <li> When the hair grows in less full and coarse, you are set with this stuff!     </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that it would be pain free, but it really works as long as you put plenty of oil and the wax is warm/hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever had experience with the Sally Hansen wax strips available at drugstores, and this is by far much easier to do, with less mess.</li>
            <li> hair grows pretty fast, &#x27;down there&#x27; &amp; everywhere, so I got to wax once every 3 weeks, but nevertheless, because of Surgi, every session only takes me 20 mins (almost the same time as a waxing salon will take).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part ever is that it is not as painful as all other waxes.  </li>
            <li> However with the job situation being somewhat shaky, I decided I HAD to cut back, and my boyfriend REALLY enjoys the clean look of the Brazilian.</li>
            <li> FAR less messy, more efficient, and easier to use than Sally Hanson bikini wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy for a beginner and the quality of the hard wax far less messy and faster than working with strips (not to mention much cheaper than the salon).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazing product I love and I have used it on a few other people too.</li>
            <li> Hard wax is fantastic, and no muslin to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, the kit is very straight forward and, in itself, there wasn&#x27;t really anything negative</li>
            <li> lastly as this was my first time in a long time, I tried it on my legs first where I could experiment a little with applying...</li>
            <li> In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.      </li>
            <li> For waxing in general:  Why would you wax?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is cheaper than $60 each time I want to get it professionally done, but I have a 13 month old at home, and this process takes a long time to do my bikini area...</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will order it again when I find out how long the results last.   </li>
            <li> It really does hurt, but that&#x27;s what i expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> is that I don&#x27;t necessarily have to apply the wax directly to my skin for it to work.</li>
            <li> And maybe when I have the extra dough, I&#x27;ll get it professionally done.</li>
            <li> I had several professional bikini waxes done before attempting to do this myself at home and even then it was a challenge.</li>
            <li> Works very well, minimal pain.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I&#x27;ll shave if I want to go bare.</li>
            <li> I suggest washing the area very thoroughly after you are done waxing if you decide to use this oil because it clogged up my pores &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and several tiny pimples appeared the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably try a professional wax in the future...</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a helpful tip: for sensitive areas, applying two or three coats of Oragel (or a generic equivalent) 20% lidocaine gel as a numbing agent two minutes before the wax works wonders for lessening the pain.</li>
            <li> I must preface this by saying that I&#x27;ve had a Brazilian wax done by a professional for the last 2 years.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you have the patience, you can get professional result for a tenth of the price.</li>
            <li> beware if you aren&#x27;t intending to go all bare and accidentally get it into hair you want to keep</li>
            <li> I also have used Completely Bare, Sally Hansen, and Gigi.  </li>
            <li> 1)Pay attention to the direction of hair growth and when you pull off you want to pull directly in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> it took all the hair and left my arm pits so soft without pulling my skin of....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, if you use the correct application technique (in the direction of hair growth)and removal technique (pulling in the opposite direction, as close to the skin as possible, NOT straight up!)this process will be worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a constant struggle to get everything on evenly (or as evenly as possible), and then make sure there&#x27;s a thick tab for you to hang on to as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a constant struggle to get everything on evenly (or as evenly as possible), and then make sure there&#x27;s a thick tab for you to hang on to as well.     </li>
            <li> Usually, it takes me 2.5 minutes to heat up the jar (when it&#x27;s full)...</li>
            <li> (it took a full 2 minutes to heat up in my small microwave).</li>
            <li> It hurt too much to get down into the really sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> After heating it for another minute trying to get it to all melt down, I took it out and it was so hot that dropped it</li>
            <li> However, once you get over the first time, it all became easier, with much less pain.</li>
            <li> This really helps to lower the pain level when removing the hard wax, as well as making any wax mess on your hands easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hardens quickly, so I work in small areas</li>
            <li> This is painful, does not peal off very nicely, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> So I was a little skeptical of this product, even after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, it took me a while because it hurt and i was making a mess.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very affordable as you get 3 boxes for the price of one jar on other brands.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil after the procedure and for at least a week after the waxing, and it significantly reduces irritation and ingrown hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does however get a little messy but over all it takes most of the hair out with one try.</li>
            <li> It is kind of messy and really scary trying to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find at stores lately and this is a good deal online.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin so after I finished I did blot on a little bit of after shaving lotion just to make sure that my skin didn&#x27;t react negatively and the results were wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of practice, but overall so much cheaper than a professional wax!  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t stress enough how important at least one salon trip can be.</li>
            <li> I have an epilady that I use on my legs which resembles a shaver, but it pulls the hair out so the results last a while and hair comes back soft.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, only slightly messy if you&#x27;re careful.  </li>
            <li> I personally LOVE waxing down under, no more ingrown hairs, no bumps.</li>
            <li> No more strips, hair comes out the first time and the wax doesn&#x27;t get all over the place!</li>
            <li> It helps to be a little flexible too ;)    </li>
            <li> At first I thought, okay I will just redo those spots tomorrow, but it was just far too painful for it to have to be a multiple day</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as strip wax on this sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as strip wax on this sensitive area.</li>
            <li> put the oil on before, brush the wax on (the included tiny tongue-depressor stix barely last thru one session-- have a disposable wooden tool standing by as replacement), pat the wax down, find an edge and pull it right off.</li>
            <li> Find the right temperature that is comfortable for you, but is thin enough to apply down to the skin level.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, clean up is a breeze, and it&#x27;s one of the lesser painful waxes out there (not pain-free).  </li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen wax used to get dry and hard very quickly, which meant that you couldn&#x27;t pull a strip off in one motion and had to get it off crumble by crumble.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product 4 times so far and each time I am not completely hairless.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to complete the task</li>
            <li> The first is that it is messy.</li>
            <li> I still prefer doing this in the privacy of my own home than to pay some random woman at the spa to touch my private parts.at the spa to touch my private parts.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid amazon shopper and thought why not save a few $$ with the subscribe and save option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first few times.</li>
            <li> really close to the naughty bits</li>
            <li> I tried Surgi Wax and it was fairly easy to use (a little mess...</li>
            <li> I probably should have tried a smaller patch on my underarms first, since the hair is different there compared to \\&quot;down under\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> But in all fairness, I haven&#x27;t done any real maintenance \\&quot;down there\\&quot; in probably 18 months...</li>
            <li> the only thing is that it does not seem to stay as hot as long as other waxes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I believe my natural body temperature in the bikini area made it much harder for the wax to cool down enough for easy removal</li>
            <li> Not messy as long as you heat it properly.</li>
            <li> I have gorilla-like amounts of leg hair, and can just barely do my legs in 2 boxes (I prefer to use 3), so if you are just waxing your \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; area, 1 box should last you several applications.  </li>
            <li> you are a newbie to brazilian waxing, definitely get it done professionally first a few times.  </li>
            <li> It would not dry and harden properly.</li>
            <li> put on the wax super thick.</li>
            <li> I used almost the whole jar and I only cleaned half up.</li>
            <li> I could only get half the job done before the wax cooled too much</li>
            <li> The hair was much shorter and of course less dense so that made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> First off, the grip is not strong enough to pull off all the hair once, or twice, or three times!</li>
            <li> It makes the whole process just a little bit easier, and does not decrease the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I was ready to throw it away when my husband happened to find a little bottle.</li>
            <li> I typically have to do a little clean up with the tweezers</li>
            <li> If it has a very thick consistency, although it is still warm enough to work, it will waste a lot of wax.</li>
            <li> When I tried to remove the wax, only portions of it came off, leaving huge sticky areas behind.  </li>
            <li> I was too chicken to use the wax too close to the more sensitive areas, and just ended up shaving those bits.</li>
            <li> The results depend on how well you apply it, but it works very well, just make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t get too cold because it will be harder to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy, but definitley worth it!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for the at home waxer that doesn&#x27;t want to mess with a waxing pot.</li>
            <li> Now not only can I not try this product, but I have to go through the hassle of returning it because a fairly vital (according to the other reviewers...)</li>
            <li> I use it not only &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, you know what I mean, right....?</li>
            <li> The struggle for me was, that because I was so nervous, my body heat made it hard for the wax to get hear, but after I calmed down, it was fine.</li>
            <li> The container is convenient in that it&#x27;s small, has a cover and a comfortable little handle.  </li>
            <li> it up once more is not a good idea: the 2nd round of heating makes it so liquid you can&#x27;t keep it on the spatula.</li>
            <li> It only took a half-jar for my first waxing, so I can count on getting at least 6 waxings total, which would cost me around $600 in a salon.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the wax doesn&#x27;t have a natural smell.</li>
            <li> You have been warned though and I decreased my original 5 stars to 4.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I&#x27;ve noticed that, depending on the model of your microwave, the time to heat up the wax might varies, and it can be pretty annoying having to check the wax every 30 seconds just to make sure that I didn&#x27;t overheat the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and you will probably get first or second degree burns; the temperature of hard wax melted to that point is going to burn you</li>
            <li> Make sure the wax is heated until it&#x27;s thin enough to get all the way down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, the Surgiwax works WAY better than any Sally Hansen product that I&#x27;ve used, BUT this is only true beneath the navel and close to the thighs, When you reach the labia, it is excruciatingly painful.</li>
            <li> loved the old version of this product, but this new formula is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Last but not the least, no matter how much prep oil you put on your skin, the wax is going to leave traces on you because of the hair that is supposed to be gone now is still there, with wax on it!</li>
            <li> The only time stickiness or stringiness was an issue is when I didn&#x27;t wait quite long enough to pull the wax off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the product stays in a melted state long enough for me to work for several minutes before requiring reheating.</li>
            <li> ( I tried a small amount, medium amount, and large amount and the wax was still did not want to stick to the hair.</li>
            <li> I threw out my old warmer bc of the mess and have tried several different microwave ones-</li>
            <li> It was my first time using hard wax on myself and the results were quite favorable.  </li>
            <li> but I have tried many hard waxes and this hard wax is definitely the stickiest and tackiest I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Great for do it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with oil to use before you start waxing to make it less painful.</li>
            <li> The second wax was much less painful, probably partially to do with improved technique and, unlike shaving where it starts growing back about as soon as you finish, everything is wonderfully smooth and stays smooth.</li>
            <li> this product much improved from others in the past.  </li>
            <li> (My husband&#x27;s technique still needs some work, but at least he&#x27;s willing to continue practicing.)  </li>
            <li> and the results are long lasting!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too long, same situation.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s my method.&lt;br /&gt;-sit on a towel, cloth or something flat (magazine) to protect the flooring you are sitting on&lt;br /&gt;-use</li>
            <li> will definitely be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t exactly peel it off if you don&#x27;t have a thick layer on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nine-pound baby epidural-free, and have had two broken bones misdiagnosed as sprains because the doctor said \\&quot;I really thought if it was broken, you would&#x27;ve been in more pain.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I like my wax thin, when I spread it on, I like to spread a little bit more on where I am going to rip it off from.  </li>
            <li> , one last thing is that if I try to reheat/reuse the same Surgi-Wax jar after it has been consistently warmed using my candle warmer, sometimes the results are not the same - the wax gets either gummy or for whatever reason I just get just poor results.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the little wooden stick and trying to scoop the wax out of the container, pour a little bit of the wax onto wax paper while its hot.</li>
            <li> and I mean really taut!  </li>
            <li> I have had previous experience waxing my bikini line using soft wax.</li>
            <li> My skin was significantly less irritated than when I had professional waxes.  </li>
            <li> After that, you have to overheat it to get it to soften, and then it will be totally soupy - and obviously too hot to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, unless you want to only do your under-arm, or any other very small area, you will need all three pots.</li>
            <li> I remembered it to be messy and to require a lot more wax than strip wax, which rolls on in a thin layer.</li>
            <li> , I had barely gotten the bottom half of one leg done, and I was so cranky I decided to stop trying and just book a waxing at a local spa.  </li>
            <li> I personally had a salon Brazilian 5 weeks ago and left the two inch strip down the middle.  </li>
            <li> It actually did not last me as well as it did some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only waxed one other time and it was on my legs with a different product</li>
            <li> one half of one side, then the lower half, then the other side&#x27;s top half and then the other bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy and it doesn&#x27;t require those little strips</li>
            <li> If you put too much it will be hard to remove the wax, increasing your pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hard wax is so much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> It is hard to supply on skin uniformly, because it is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Too much oil will make it hard for the wax to do</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian wax, so I thought I&#x27;d just use a little of the wax to remove my leg hairs to get me started, which, while ridiculously thick, still are obviously not as bad as the bikini region.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and had no issues, except for the pain, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> then I chicken out, and I end up tugging on the hair which makes it more</li>
            <li> Then it starts to melt (get warm) when you handle it too much on the skin, and then must be slowly (and painfully) pulled off while each hair is pulled off, one at a time.  </li>
            <li> &quot; once and that was the worst, but it looked so great afterwards and it still hasn&#x27;t grown back all the way yet (like 3 weeks later) and</li>
            <li> 2)Work in small areas, especially in the sensitive areas with thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered Surgi in a six pack on Amazon and that is now my long term plan.  </li>
            <li> not in a long strips.</li>
            <li> should be about 1/4-inch long for waxing, so you may want to use a trimmer set to that length.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people who just go in and start ripping it all off it to get it over with, this won&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> not sure that is normal or not...</li>
            <li> My eyes teared up, my fingers started sweating and I couldn&#x27;t grip the wax well to try again, and then the wax where my fingers were started melting away and pulling off in long gooey</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for so long</li>
            <li> I should have tried this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using Surgi Wax for so long that I cannot remember not using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it sit too long because it will become britle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only wax ever to work as I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> As long as you coat yourself in the oil</li>
            <li> how long it says just to get it somewhat melted.</li>
            <li> Smoothness lasts as long as anything has for me (8-10 days).</li>
            <li> Luck!ame Surgi-Wax jar after it has been consistently warmed using my candle warmer, sometimes the results are not the same - the wax gets either gummy or for whatever reason I just get just poor results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been about a week and a half now, and while some of the hair is starting to come back</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used hard wax you&#x27;ll never go back to soft waxing with cloth strips!</li>
            <li> Even when devoting much time to following the instructions carefully, it does not stick to and pull out even half the hair targeted, even when tried on an area wit thin, short hair such as the back of one&#x27;s hand or arm.</li>
            <li> Also beware, that it is messy (lay something underneath you but NO CLOTH/TOWEL because the wax will stick like no other!)</li>
            <li> The only trouble with the oil is that, once you&#x27;ve gone over a spot and gotten most of the hair, it won&#x27;t stick to the few little hairs left behind (maybe they were just too short...</li>
            <li> The only other thing that bothered me is how the wax piles up on the rim of the jar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if they were going out of business or if supplies were low due to warmer weather.</li>
            <li> as noted in other reviews, may not get all the hairs...plan to go after remaining ones with a tweezer or even the following week with another wax application?&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I tried all other wax brands and its not the same</li>
            <li> I tried to save a little money the next time around and buy the Sally Henson kit from my local CVS, and I will NEVER do that again!</li>
            <li> Not hot enough</li>
            <li> the box&#x27;s size is little but the wax last n is enough for everything.</li>
            <li> I use this only for my face as I am allergic to every other face wax.</li>
            <li> A few times, I let the wax dry a little too much and then trying to get your fingers under the</li>
            <li> Soft wax is cheaper than hard wax, but when it comes to your private area, there has to be a compromise.</li>
            <li> This is not the same, and from my experience, those who prefer soft wax will not like hard wax and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it stays liquid for a very long time</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hard wax.  </li>
            <li> , you wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more painful than the actual waxing process!)</li>
            <li> Just a pinch really and so much less mess than other waxes.</li>
            <li> and it was still quite sticky/stringy (like gum) after a minute or two which made the processes not only longer, but more painful.  </li>
            <li> Wash the area with soap and water and dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> melt very well, very sticky, but need to get cold to be off the skin</li>
            <li> Even after leaving it on for ages and turning on a fan in an attempt to make it dry, it was still a sticky goo.  </li>
            <li> Surgi-wax does take off a good 85% of the hair, but it was way too painful and messy for me.  </li>
            <li> I may narrow my triangle a bit on a future try after trimming real short.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse hair in really sensitive areas built up from years of shaving so if it works for me it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> you apply a decent but not too thick layer to the needed area.  </li>
            <li> It does grab almost every single hair in a single pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Gigi hard wax for brazillians is very similar to this product in effectiveness and texture, but more expensive.  </li>
            <li> - Oil makes skin slippery (duh!); hence, I cannot pull my skin tight - and tightly pulled skin is a key to a painless and clean waxing  - Took forever.</li>
            <li> I will, however, purchase a sugar wax and muslin strips for that area and still use Surgiwax for the less sensitive areas down below as well as my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> It did do its job, it took the hair out, but was not worth a second try.  </li>
            <li> You just need to be careful and not leave it on for long else</li>
            <li> I had nothing to loose compare to what I spend in spas</li>
            <li> But no, the only down fall..</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately blessed with a little more hair in areas than other women and have to keep up with my waxing sometimes on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be painful, but I thought I was pretty smart to try and counteract that with 2 ibuprofen AND numbing cream (lidocaine).  </li>
            <li> It was less painful than using the Surgi-wax, for sure!)  </li>
            <li> It only removed like half of the hair.</li>
            <li> There were also some small chunks of wax left stuck on the skin, which was a big pain to remove.     </li>
            <li> Also, with hair growing in several cycles, if you approach the Surgi Wax as *maintenance* plan then you will have much less to work with and</li>
            <li> the only slight issue I had was that I had to reheat the jar halfway through.     </li>
            <li> and I only got about half way done before just throwing the rest of the wax and shaving the rest.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a difference between this formula and the other ones for other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> There are numbing creams (lidocaine/prilocaine) that can be used beforehand (usually a half hour to an hour prior) to ease the pain a bit.</li>
            <li> I would just be really careful in the sensitive areas, work in small areas and stuff.</li>
            <li> I found the wax to be much different than the previous formula.  </li>
            <li> After heating it , it was very thin so iset it aside to cool and thicken.</li>
            <li> I find it helpful to get a big trash bag and lay it out to sit on and wax, so if it drips, you won&#x27;t be making a mess in your house.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply the wax too hot, you can get serious burns!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had waxes done professionally before, and they were always super painful, so I was apprehensive to try to wax myself.  </li>
            <li> tried a few more times until I spent 20 mins in the bath tub in hot water slowly and painfully puling pieces of the wax off my skin.</li>
            <li> However, my most recent 3 pack was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Those little wooden applicators, if they were any shorter, one would end up using one&#x27;s fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does come with a pre-epilation oil, though, which you should definitely use to make removing hairs a little easier.</li>
            <li> After only a few minutes, the spatula (and jar) was a big, sticky mess.    </li>
            <li> The only thing I would recommend is getting a little glass jar and a wax warmer</li>
            <li> ..wait a little, then pull per the instructions..not pulling up but pulling back</li>
            <li> should such a little accident occur.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get everything, I have to pluck a little, but my esthetician always had to do the same for me.  </li>
            <li> Whereas Surgi Wax is in inoffensive waxy specks even if some does cling to my skin and the removed strips of wax are hard and not messy.</li>
            <li> had tried several different brands of hard wax...</li>
            <li> and it was gushy in the middle, but rock hard on the outside.</li>
            <li> The spots that I didn&#x27;t rub the oil on, it was soooo painful that I wanted to cry, but if you put plenty of oil on the spots you&#x27;re waxing and the wax is not too cold, then it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> For years, I spent a fortune at a waxing salon, which had great results but let&#x27;s face it - is rather awkward and intrusive, not to mention expensive.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be more painful for Brazilian waxing virgins.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is that you have to grow your hair out to 1/4 of an inch (gross!).  </li>
            <li> ladies, you can decrease your pain by doing this at the end of your period or a few days later.</li>
            <li> Its yield is truly minimal.</li>
            <li> Regrowth is as expected-- a couple weeks.   </li>
            <li> I also carefully read instructions which helped a lot.    </li>
            <li> Total waste of money and who can you give even unused ones to?</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m not very hairy.</li>
            <li> I expected to have some discomfort &amp; pain...</li>
            <li> and it was harder for me to do it.  </li>
            <li> I recently went back to school, so I am now too poor to afford my regular waxes at the salon.</li>
            <li> directions also say you can re-apply over a potentially too thin layer, but then the hardening time differs from the rest and can make it more difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Still, cost a lot although not nearly as much as having a salon do it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Read the directions carefully or it will not work.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> But after carefully rereading instructions and watching tutorials online</li>
            <li> and ive spent anywhere from $40-$75 on a brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only messy if you let it be.</li>
            <li> Read directions carefully and the product will work somewhat.</li>
            <li> Minimal pain.</li>
            <li> Minimal pain</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long, long while since I have waxed my underarms as I have been using the epilator since my last wax which was at least a year ago.</li>
            <li> It got EVERYWHERE no matter how careful I was, and this stuff gets stuck on skin, under fingernails, clothes, floor,</li>
            <li> be careful when heating.</li>
            <li> It does leave a few hairs, but only the thinner ones that are harder to grip with wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving what&#x27;s left of the wax for when my hair grows back, in hopes that it won&#x27;t be so thick</li>
            <li> what has grown back is soft and thin.  </li>
            <li> At first, its very difficult to get it to completely melt.</li>
            <li> First off, the wax works well and removes hair with very few left behind.  </li>
            <li> However it is quite painful, particularly when waxing the scrotum and the certain area around the butt.</li>
            <li> However, it was difficult to maintain the right temperature as I waxed over a period of time.</li>
            <li> I am SO IRRITATED to have wasted my time and money on this product, and my skin is raw, red and sticky to boot, plus, the job it did actually removing the hair is pitiful.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else - if you&#x27;ve never waxed before, a little scary at first, but definitely prefer this over the wax and fabric technique.</li>
            <li> and you can also push down the sides as you use it up so they don&#x27;t harden and mess with the overall consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li> other than that, i plan on using this wax for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s less than 1/4 inch long!  </li>
            <li> , I still get it professionally done once or twice a year, because it&#x27;s just so ridiculously</li>
            <li> I ended up spending 45 minutes trying to get a small piece wax off -- bit by bit -- from some sensitive areas and crying all the while from the pain.</li>
            <li> I hate waiting for it to grow out to wax again, too, but I think the more I wax it the less overall hair there will be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy the first go-around, but then again, I&#x27;m a novice at the waxing game.  </li>
            <li> Well, I think hard wax hurts less than soft wax (applied with a muslin strip), and it&#x27;s a lot</li>
            <li> I will only use hard wax for my future \\&quot;down south\\&quot; upkeep!     </li>
            <li> I found Surgi Wax to do a much better job of removing hair than sugaring, and when used with the oil it was less painful.</li>
            <li> The wax was hard to get off and more painful than regular waxing.</li>
            <li> And it is a lot cheaper than some of the other waxes,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> use a small amount of oil, just enough to moisten the area.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other home waxing product ever again.</li>
            <li> It also contains two spatulas and some oil that is supposed to be rubbed on before applying the wax, to prevent it from sticking to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply the wax with the spatula in small patches, wait for the wax to harden (about 20-30 seconds), and use your fingernail to \\&quot;flick\\&quot; one end up to provide a tab to pull with, and the rip the wax off in the opposite direction of growth.</li>
            <li> I have some small scars left on my mons pubis from the bleeding caused by this product.</li>
            <li> And the roots are so deep that if you pluck a hair a few mm long, when it&#x27;s plucked it&#x27;s usually 1/4in long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the wax kit the other supplies I use</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other wax.</li>
            <li> here are a few tips from a LONG time waxer...</li>
            <li> Other than those 2 things-</li>
            <li> (112g) pot of wax, 2 wooden spatulas, a small vial (3.6 ml) of pre-epilation oil, and an instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> so figured I&#x27;d try this for the other end.  </li>
            <li> That way it didn&#x27;t get boring :p</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other wax</li>
            <li> After trying other products, I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> But believe me, if you are not willing to torture yourself, just don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of forgetting and spent an hour trying to get all the wax off, it wouldn&#x27;t pull!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets the majority of the hairs, but it does miss a few here and there (which depends on how long you let the hair grow out).</li>
            <li> I tried other things for 2 months and caved in to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I get it sent to me every other month.</li>
            <li> Other types of wax just sit on the hair when you apply, and when you want to remove the hair, the wax gets streachy, pulls the hair withour removing or does nothing.</li>
            <li> i get the feeling that the products attributes are due to its formula.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will try a small small patch and see if the results are equally torturous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that</li>
            <li> no more $60 salon fees and having someone else get all up in my private area.</li>
            <li> they way a lot of other waxes do.</li>
            <li> i used it so i dont have to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> I mean, this wax is by far the less \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It certainly was no where near as painful and a lot</li>
            <li> I used the oil given and followed the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> The wax stays pliable for about 10 minutes, and you do have to make repeat trips, but that is better than dealing with the insane stickiness of soft wax.</li>
            <li> I like my wax very thin and hot, so a lot of times they drip before it even reach where I want it to.  </li>
            <li> I usually trim the intended area down fairly low then apply the oil and wax.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t mind, my SOs in the past 5 years haven&#x27;t minded/noticed, and I have never gotten an infection, just some slight discomfort from the in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> the key is to get the wax thin enough to get down to the skin, hold the skin taut and tear strips off swiftly AGAINST the grain of growth.</li>
            <li> and I am so mad that Surgiwax apparently changed their formula, or something has happened to the product, because I have used wax for years and this formulation several times before and never had the issue that I have with this last batch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and much less painful than getting waxed at the salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wax around back without help.  </li>
            <li> This is the same as the hard wax used in salons.</li>
            <li> are for two reasons; the salon/spa I went to only used hard wax</li>
            <li> Finally I took it out and pushed my finger into the hard surface to see what was up.  </li>
            <li> It was still hard after only 1 minute.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find it in local retail stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of hard (stripless) wax for brazilians and underarm use.  </li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;d be hard to continually pull up the wax, but, all in all, I would definitely buy and use this product again.</li>
            <li> The hard wax is the only way to go when you when you are waxing the nether regions.</li>
            <li> Use it for my underarms, and also I use it on my male friends neck to get rid of horrible neck hair that grows back way to quickly!</li>
            <li> , just apply  a little on a cotton fabric stripe , let it dry a little bit....pull it away....</li>
            <li> However I found it hard to get the layer to be thick enough throughout entire surface</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about it is that it does not come with a \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; oil.  </li>
            <li> For the past few days, I&#x27;ve read reviews for all different kinds of waxing, watched videos, read articles, etc.</li>
            <li> possible, have this done professionally at least once</li>
            <li> after the painful experience, I still wasn&#x27;t willing to go back to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I could only handle a few small strips before I had to stop.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but this really works.</li>
            <li> Bliss&#x27;s product is so dark that I wasn&#x27;t always sure.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have medium course dark hair</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only supplier I&#x27;ve found over the past few year.</li>
            <li> cause when the wax gets pulled off it hurts like crazy &amp; the pain only last for a short time.</li>
            <li> It is not worth a product.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t seem to get my hands on my order (much to my husband&#x27;s dismay).  </li>
            <li> Therefore, do this every month to prevent your hair from grown back thick.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax that works on thick brunette hair that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Took a few tries and ~15 minutes to figure out the ropes of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy to get exhausted and lose motivation and then get wax stuck in random parts of your body.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve already decided to / already do some cleaning up down there, it&#x27;s a lot simpler than shaving.  </li>
            <li> stray hairs, use tweezers or an epilator after skin has calmed down rather than trying to go wax an area twice</li>
            <li> , I can get the SurgiWax melted down to a workable consistency in about 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> However, since... it is for down there...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend they read the microwave directions I have down below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> down side is that its price keeps increasing.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this wax for over 10 years, I have it down to a science</li>
            <li> I wont use any other brand!  </li>
            <li> In other words, I spent the majority of the time picking out pieces of wax from my crotch because every pull left some wax behind.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again, after I get through my 2 other jars!</li>
            <li> Apply the wax in small patches, and allow to dry for 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find myself picking at the product that is left behind on my skin, making red marks that take days to go away, not to mention the hair that is left behind from this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would rather use strips in that area because like a previous reviewer stated, once you get down there, it&#x27;s like pulling off a piece of bubble gum.</li>
            <li> I have used other wax systems, they are all messy at home</li>
            <li> only negative thing about this product is that the heating directions are a little off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even just wax it off by adding a little fresh wax and smoothing it over to just remove it because without the pre-wax oil this stuff sticks like crazy glue to the hair AND the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky mess down there.</li>
            <li> It may lead to a few ingrown hairs (a bunch that get stuck but free themselves, and one or two that need to be helped out), but none that are painful.  </li>
            <li> You could reuse the spatulas, but after awhile the wax builds up on the handle and makes the already difficult to control wax, even more difficult to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could reuse the spatulas, but after awhile the wax builds up on the handle and makes the already difficult to control wax, even more difficult to control.     </li>
            <li> After an hour and a half of fussing with Surgi</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s less</li>
            <li> much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a pro wax before, but I can guarantee I would have had less pain and been done in less than half the time.  </li>
            <li> I quit half way thru and just shaved.</li>
            <li> It takes out the hair in one yank, which means less pain.</li>
            <li> in addition to using the oil, pop a couple Advil about a half hour before.</li>
            <li> Much less pain and time involved.</li>
            <li> a bit less so than my bikini</li>
            <li> So there is less redness.</li>
            <li> So there is less redness.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my fault for trying to strip hair from an area that nature put there for some odd reason.  </li>
            <li> Although there is no denying that it hurts, I think it hurts much less when I do the waxing myself because 1.</li>
            <li> and half the hair was still there</li>
            <li> If your worried about 5 bucks, go to a discount beauty store and buy a 3 pack for around 5 bucks less (not even taking into consideration the s&amp;h.)    </li>
            <li> Leaving a sticky, sore spot that still hurts a half hour</li>
            <li> I had never waxed before, so I was slightly terrified.</li>
            <li> After that, it becomes less of an ordeal.</li>
            <li> I am first time wax user, the first time was terrible.</li>
            <li> Comes with 2 small, short popsicle sticks, and a really small bottle of pre-epilation oil.</li>
            <li> I have been on the planet a half century +</li>
            <li> It took half an hour or so to do everything</li>
            <li> Less mess    </li>
            <li> I have resorted to home waxing after moving to a different country where such services may be hard or near impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> I got my first brazilian using hard wax last month and it was less painful than the other method where you had to use strips.</li>
            <li> Although the wax is a bit thicker than honey, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> That is NOT true.  </li>
            <li> The wax was a mess</li>
            <li> Those made it an even gooier mess, so do not try those things to remove it.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a mess.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to it though you don&#x27;t make a mess anymore.</li>
            <li> The product is sticky, will not harden, creates a mess on my fingers because it will not harden and now pulls out almost no hairs.</li>
            <li> My arm even ended up stuck to my side at one point from the sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Surgi&#x27;s brazilian waxing kit for 2 years now, and though I have tried a few other name brands every now and then (a girl got to test the market!)</li>
            <li> *The only time it was bad (really, unreasonable bad) was in places where the hair was too long (I had trimmed prior but not close enough!)   </li>
            <li> I also always managed to bruise myself sugaring my bikini area, no matter how diligent I was about trying to hold the skin tight, and with the Surgi Wax I had no bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is microwavable so no special appliances to buy.</li>
            <li> I use it for facial hair and hated paying the higher prices for small jars when it is all the same stuff.</li>
            <li> I am sick of paying for the full service to get my wax done, so I figured I would try this.</li>
            <li> The key for me was to RELAX, because if you get anxious, you will pull the wax off slowly.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting on a thick coat of wax and letting it dry about 10-15 seconds before pulling it off so that it&#x27;s malleable but not sticky.</li>
            <li> At first it was annoying that I had to walk back and forth to the microwave...</li>
            <li> The packaging was neatly done, each jar has a nifty little handle attached.</li>
            <li> A lot easier than using strips but tales a little time to get used to.  </li>
            <li> If that happens, just give it a little longer and try again.</li>
            <li> Each box has a little bottle of oil to help the wax not stick to your skin.</li>
            <li> If you put a little wax over an area that is hairless or has already been waxed, then you can peel the bit off without slowing ripping anything else.</li>
            <li> and I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, Goo Gone removed a little and it didn&#x27;t hurt my skin as I thought it would</li>
            <li> You want the wax to start to harden just a little, so it is still plyable.</li>
            <li> I had a little flub up with the spatula and got a blob in my little landing strip</li>
            <li> I find that I have to heat it up a little longer than the directions state to get it to that honey consistancy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there still is a bit of pain when waxing those sensitive bikini areas, but you recover quickly, no bleeding, bruising or tearing.  </li>
            <li> The oil will stay on your skin for a few hours afterwards, but it&#x27;s so little</li>
            <li> I did find the product a bit messy, but I suspect I will be a little neater once I get the hang of how to deal with the wax.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of other products that I have used in the past but this one is a clear winner.</li>
            <li> The wax is a little messy.</li>
            <li> A little messy</li>
            <li> It takes a while for it to actually get hard, which can be hard when you&#x27;re in a rush.  </li>
            <li> (I am a man, and I used it on \\&quot;everything\\&quot; down below!)  </li>
            <li> love this product but be careful to put on a thin layer and not clump up...can be hard to remove and painful.</li>
            <li> A tip: Do not be afraid to apply too much of the oil, add quite a bit.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the time it takes to pick at all of the left behind product that doesn&#x27;t come off, and</li>
            <li> then the unslightly hair that is still left behind.</li>
            <li> so I had to nuke it a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a messy wax to use, and it does not yield well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I gave this item two stars because it does rip the hair out although unevenly</li>
            <li> It can be messy, but once you get the  hang of it, you&#x27;ll be a pro in no</li>
            <li> Because you have to apply this directly to your skin (there are no strips), it&#x27;s difficult to control.</li>
            <li> The wax can be a bit messy and could ruin your clothes.</li>
            <li> There are a few cons I will list.</li>
            <li> I had lots and lots of hair left behind.    </li>
            <li> Not to mention extremely messy because it does not use waxing strips</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely apply the oil before you wax.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaaay too messy.  </li>
            <li> a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos on the internet and read the instructions.</li>
            <li> It was messy, and didn&#x27;t remove the hair efficiently, which meant redoing a lot of areas.</li>
            <li> It is messy and doesn&#x27;t go on evenly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I sang a few lines from the song (20-30 seconds) before pulling the wax off.</li>
            <li> I still have to microwave it every few minutes.  </li>
            <li> e.g. Would it be weird looking at 80 years old with no hair there?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit,  it hurt (obviously), but some places we&#x27;re worse than others.</li>
            <li> I did have a few spots of blood where I did NOT pull against the hair growth...</li>
            <li> I feel as if I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here with wax still stuck to me because it doesn&#x27;t remove like it says and its messy and with all the time pain crying and still stuck with wax on my lady</li>
            <li> It was extremely messy.</li>
            <li> A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take a few sessions of doing this until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> You can ball up the just-used wax and use it to help remove any stubborn wax that has been left behind (like you do with tape or a sticker to get sticky residue off).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> part is missing.</li>
            <li> It was horribly messy, and didn&#x27;t even get all the hair, so I ended up re-waxing a few areas.</li>
            <li> Having the opportunity to buy a three-box pack also saves you money and trouble having to order it too often.</li>
            <li> Here are a few of my bullets:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Non greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> It only makes the experience worse.  </li>
            <li> and I started off with the cheap Sally crap.</li>
            <li> (this was heavily emphasised)&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, this wax is messy.</li>
            <li> it did get messy but doing it yourself</li>
            <li> but it was messy as putty</li>
            <li> The local drug stores stopped selling this wax and I was broken hearted.</li>
            <li> Messy messy messy.  </li>
            <li> Second, that oil crap that&#x27;s included does absolutely nothing to make the wax adhere to the hair at all</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the change to this product, not to mention that the price has increased significantly for such an inferior formula.  </li>
            <li> A little bit longer and its still just a sticky mess!</li>
            <li> The pre-wax application oil has a slight numbing sensation, so when you follow the directions there&#x27;s basically very little pain at all,</li>
            <li> Put on the oil that is included first, and this helps to make it less painful when you pull the wax</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot less maintenance (once a month compared with a few times a week!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less time-consuimg and no pain!</li>
            <li> A Brazilian is $60 in my area, but this is less than $5 an application!</li>
            <li> A Brazilian is $60 in my area, but this is less than $5 an application!</li>
            <li> Hurts, messy, not easy to use barley usable except for throwing out</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a pale lemon color because I can see all the hair that came out.</li>
            <li> So I applied the wax on one of my fingers waited a few seconds, pulled the skin tight and pulled the wax off going against the hair!</li>
            <li> A little wax can go a LONG WAY if you spread it out to about ~1.5mm thin.</li>
            <li> an unbelievable sticky blobbed up mess.</li>
            <li> The product is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And it is never easy to wax an area that you can&#x27;t see well.</li>
            <li> And it is never easy to wax an area that you can&#x27;t see well.</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it has to do with this specific product, but trying to DIY a wax session at home ranks as one of the worst decisions I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> It is less painful, as it does not stick to the skin as much.</li>
            <li> It is less painful, as it does not stick to the skin as much.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier and in my opinion less painful.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> The first 3 pulls stung a bit, teary eyed but after those pulls, it wasn&#x27;t as painful.</li>
            <li> The caps were VERY difficult to remove on my batch, so I resorted to heating them gently in the microwave for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Surgiwax has undergone reformulation, and knowing that, the product has noticeably changed: in that&lt;br /&gt;it remains a bit stickier than &#x27;hard wax&#x27; typically is:</li>
            <li> and i hardly made a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming they have changed the formula, as it now will not get hard on your skin, making for a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving the bikini area and have been professionally waxed numerous times.  </li>
            <li> With a little body contorting, this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry properly and remains excessively sticky making it very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> This little adventure took me at least 2.5 hours.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t tear and bled very little.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t really that bad.</li>
            <li> For me, it is just too painful and too much work.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at CVS for $9</li>
            <li> They used to include a small vial of oil in the box</li>
            <li> I found this product to me messy and worthless after the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> Whatever is in the oil or the wax has a crazy moisturizing/silky after-effect and my skin was SO soft for days.</li>
            <li> I spread the wax in small strips at a time</li>
            <li> The jar is small but with this purchase you get 3 jars</li>
            <li> The wax dries and ends up flaking off in small chunks.</li>
            <li> They say to microwave the wax for no more than a minute but</li>
            <li> After trying a couple small areas, I gave up.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recommend working in small patches no more than 1 inch by 1 inch sections.</li>
            <li> I finally tried this product for the first time yesterday and holy crap!!!</li>
            <li> Do small strips.  </li>
            <li> It prevents the wax from sticking to skin, making it easier to remove small, stray pieces.</li>
            <li> After recovering from that, I applied a small strip of wax and removed it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just nervous that there might be some reason why I wouldn&#x27;t want to remove hair permanently from that area, although I&#x27;m not sure what that reason is.  </li>
            <li> I suggest working in small sections and being patient with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a small patch on my...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> Start with a small area...</li>
            <li> Tried product multiple times thinking maybe i was doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> and I would use small patches or strips</li>
            <li> Each box contained two wood spatula sticks, an instruction guide and small vial of oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this one bcs was not able to find one i was usually using.</li>
            <li> I have NO MORE bikini hair at all PLUS</li>
            <li> So I ordered this again, not without a small amount of trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get around 3-4 uses out of it which gets me through all of swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I do small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> This one is the least messy and easiest to use that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> this is TERRIBLE- I had to go over each area many times and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used at-home waxes before for my bikini area, usually crappy ones like Sally Hansen or Parissa strips, so</li>
            <li> I can only find it at sallys, Its expensive there for one box.</li>
            <li> It was messy and ineffeftive!</li>
            <li> I am definitely not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> When I saw that it was on Amazon, I was skeptical and wondered if the product would have the same quality.</li>
            <li> was make a huge mess that I had a terrible time cleaning off.  </li>
            <li> that decreased the learning curve for other areas!&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li> It did a fairly decent job at removing the hair but it was way too painful for me.</li>
            <li> I was doing it correctly, but it was not a very good product.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to apply the wax to too large of an area where there is a lot of hair, or it will be difficult (and painful) to remove.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my calves have hair in 3 different directions within a very small area, and I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get almost any hair off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done plenty of painful things to my body (including various types of hair removal in other areas)</li>
            <li> When I ventured back up on the other side it was another painful experience.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I have really thick and dark hair that grows down there and also on my arms, so I use this product for both areas to avoid shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely sticky when you&#x27;re done, unlike those nasty soft waxes with muslin strips.  </li>
            <li> and you have to mess with those irritating strips and honey wax (which I never got to work on me).</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still waiting for the hair in the bikini area to grow back to try Moom there as well, but I have no doubts that it will be less painful than the Surgi-</li>
            <li> It was actually much less painful that going to a pro because I did smaller patches at a time.</li>
            <li> In the end, it does the dreadful deed just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a hard wax, so you don&#x27;t need any cloth strips.  </li>
            <li> I had a really hard time pulling the thickest areas...</li>
            <li> So, when I saw that Surgi now makes a hard wax kit for the bikini area, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using the Surgi Brazilian Waxing Kit on my bikini area from now on.sed a pre-epilation oil with hard wax years ago, and I sometimes forget to apply it with this waxing kit.</li>
            <li> So I thought of ordering a hard wax home kit to save money and do it myself.</li>
            <li> This was hard for me to use.</li>
            <li> It is the hard type of wax and you don&#x27;t need strips to pull it off (you just use your fingers).  </li>
            <li> Spend the money and buy the GIGI Brazilian Hard Wax kit instead.</li>
            <li> The wax got really hard and couldn&#x27;t peel off my skin...</li>
            <li> The wax gets brittle and hard to remove if you leave it on longer than one</li>
            <li> I advise you to go to youtube.com and type in Brazilian tuturial: how to use hard wax.  </li>
            <li> Getting in the hard to reach places you have to be a contortionist.</li>
            <li> This is my go to hard wax.</li>
            <li> hard to say).  </li>
            <li> Well I learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I never thought to look for hard wax online before.  </li>
            <li> its gonna happen, but it is ridiculously hard getting a grip on it and keeping your skin taught all while</li>
            <li> it sticks every where and hard to get off ur skin.</li>
            <li> #1 thing I HATE about this product: you need to use a large amount of wax for any area.  </li>
            <li> -- DO take advil or tylenol (NOT ASPIRIN; will cause you to bleed if you accidently pull to hard on your hair) before you wax- wait at least 30 mins.       </li>
            <li> Like any waxing, the microwavable wax has it plus sides and negative sides.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t even chip off when it hardens, at least in mine...</li>
            <li> your a newbie.     --- Do use the pre wax oil and wait at least 5 minutes before waxing.       </li>
            <li> It doesnt hurt or feel painful at all, even sensitive skin doesnt react allergically to it.</li>
            <li> but I would like it to work at least.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my nether parts and it is scary because skin can become caught if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> and I wanna file a complaint.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is thinner but not effective.  </li>
            <li> At least the strips don&#x27;t break apart.</li>
            <li> It does take longer to melt in the microwave (at least my microwave) than the packaging says.</li>
            <li> It sucks don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Definitely try to follow some of the tips on here though because if you spread too thin, I feel sorry for your lady bits.  </li>
            <li> &quot; formula was terrible, but fortunately, I don&#x27;t know the difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is thick, not what one wishes for at all.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you are slowly pulling out hair in tender areas.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to apply a thick layer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick taffy texture.</li>
            <li> Some areas are difficult to reach neatly with the spatula, and for those spots I heat the wax slightly hotter than usual and spread it on a strip of muslin.</li>
            <li> No more shaving!</li>
            <li> Not sexy!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for her endless and arcane bathroom waxing ritual which I, as a mere mortal, am not privy to.</li>
            <li> It was painful, very painful, but not painful enough to make me cry or discourage me from discontinuing.</li>
            <li> I recommend doing SMALL spots at a time - yes this will take a while, but larger strips of wax make pulling hair the \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; way painful and may cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other waxes, and I&#x27;ve found that I prefer hard wax, or wax that does not require the use of disposable strips because they tend to be less painful for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> The only thing unpleasant was trying to get the wax where I wanted it but</li>
            <li> and I found it very difficult to grab the wax in order to peel it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be the fastest, easiest, least messy, and least expensive way of removing hair.</li>
            <li> oil on you skin prior or you&#x27;ll be so very sorry.</li>
            <li> Definitely a bit painful and sometimes it gets too hard to take it out and breaks off, leaves bits and pieces :</li>
            <li> It was less painful than my other wax.</li>
            <li> I have been so uncomfortable shaving,  as I get so itchy and uncomfortable the next day, not to mention the unsightly bumps!!</li>
            <li> And getting the last bit out of the pot is impossible, because it hardens up before you can use it all.&lt;br /&gt;Heating</li>
            <li> As for the pain; the pain is worst the 1st time because that&#x27;s the only time you&#x27;ll be pulling out all the hairs from an area, after that it&#x27;s only a fraction of pain since you&#x27;re just keeping up.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> So seriously, don&#x27;t do this.  </li>
            <li> I have found it much less expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, but I followed the directions and the wax got stuck to the skin in a really oddly gummy texture.</li>
            <li> YES the first few times are painful, but as your hair thins out from waxing, it shouldn&#x27;t be as painful after.</li>
            <li> All the other types leave a terrible sticky mess behind and this is the only type that leaves no residue</li>
            <li> and it was getting a little expensive</li>
            <li> Secondly, it is difficult to get off the little scraps of wax, even with oil.</li>
            <li> I told him I was waxing myself and with the bad reception it took him a while to understand I was probably waxing some private parts.</li>
            <li> sadly, my skin is not smooth when I am done.</li>
            <li> Messy, complicated, needed three hands to hold the skin to rip the strip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 15 minutes&#x27; painful prying and trimming at the edges with a pair of nail scissors, I FINALLY got the hardened wax off.  </li>
            <li> It will be likely painful; just accept that.  </li>
            <li> Without the oil it does not work properly and sticks painfully.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that yes it is painful because you are waxing yourself.</li>
            <li> If you are not good with pain i would not recommend you getting just the wax i would go for the strips instead.</li>
            <li> My bikini area hair was 1/4\\&quot; like the instructions said to do, but I found it would grab halfway onto hairs around the edges, so it basically just yanked on them painfully but didn&#x27;t actually remove them when I pulled it</li>
            <li> Have I made it clear that I hate Surgi-wax?</li>
            <li> Too thick or too thin</li>
            <li> (so it is not dripping from the stick) spread the wax on.. not too thin.. not too thick.</li>
            <li> Much less messy and painful, and the oil works well.  </li>
            <li> the only thing i DONT like about this is that it doesnt come with a warmer, so i had to keep going to the microwave to heat it up when it got hard which was annoying.</li>
            <li> I spent 30 minutes slowly and painfully peeling/</li>
            <li> This makes it hurt much worse than just ripping it off (the oil does really help though), and worst of all, pulling slowly won&#x27;t pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> However, I would also like to say that it was very stupid of me to try to do it myself for the first time I&#x27;ve ever been waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my local CVS no longer sells this wax :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful, but tolerable (unless you let it harden too long).  </li>
            <li> Very hard to apply unless you&#x27;re already an expert.</li>
            <li> what a time consuming, sloppy mess for nothing!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft wax...and was a painful nightmare!</li>
            <li> And my hair is very thick, both in surface area and follicle circumference.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It never hardens so very hard to remove and worse it leaves bits of wax behind and won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different waxing products over the years, and NOTHING comes close to how terrible this one is.  </li>
            <li> Painful, absolutely no way around that.</li>
            <li> nuke the product to get a thin consistency, then you spread it on your skin</li>
            <li> and I just got to tired of paying $60+ and decided to try to do it myself.</li>
            <li> One jar will last through about 2 1/2 waxings for your pubes, balls (use the wax a bit cooler there), and base of your penis.  </li>
            <li> But I am tired of shaving</li>
            <li> thin layers will stick to your skin and will be a pain to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I also use a thin towel or paper towel to help pull the wax off...</li>
            <li> It was frustrating.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t worse</li>
            <li> Again, I like my wax thin.  </li>
            <li> easier to just remove the thin level and then reapply completely.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> so I continued trying it on the rest of my knuckles and it just got worse with everything finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had waxes before and never experienced that level of pain.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not great but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> So leave this product behind.</li>
            <li> It leaves thin strands of hair even if you go over it a hundred times.</li>
            <li> My poor esthetician never saw it coming.  </li>
            <li> It left behind about 15% of the hair which was annoying.  </li>
            <li> Pulling up is very painful and can cause bleeding in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think waxing other parts of the body is painful, but the bikini area is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think waxing other parts of the body is painful, but the bikini area is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, i&#x27;m really mad</li>
            <li> Hello serious pain!</li>
            <li> I had to scrap it off desperately with my fingernails, leaving my underarms so bloody painful for the next 2 days, with some open pores.</li>
            <li> it just is less painful that way.  </li>
            <li> For me personally, it is less painful compare to sugar wax that I used before.</li>
            <li> Strips from drug store were easier, cleaner, and less painful.</li>
            <li> Also, it took almost an half hour in the shower of painfully pulling and rolling it off my hair with shampoo to get it out.</li>
            <li> so when I remove wax it sticks if it was too thin (usually on the sides of the waxed area) and it is impossible to remove it.</li>
            <li> This wax is seriously messy, like prepare for an ugly, ugly mess.</li>
            <li> cutting the stuck wax off some delicate places...</li>
            <li> II hated to shave my underarms because it made them dark(I am an Asian).</li>
            <li> and if your slow like me you will have to reheat the jar once or twice (which is inconvenient esp when you have roomates....awwkward).  </li>
            <li> I will skeptical on ordering, not knowing if it was going to be outdated.</li>
            <li> Probably because I didn&#x27;t use it properly, I feel very painful when pull the wax off</li>
            <li> The product did not do as it says, it&#x27;s very messy and painful</li>
            <li> At the end when was like &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; that crap just made a mess.</li>
            <li> and NO MORE HAIR...!!!  </li>
            <li> was is really hard and painful.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see how it could have been any worse!</li>
            <li> They give you 3 boxes of the stuff so needless to say I will be giving the rest of mine away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> it hurt, it was difficult to remove from my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Cons:  Small jar :(</li>
            <li> And it grows in all sorts of weird directions.  </li>
            <li> But, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong if you want a DIY Brazillian wax.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 because it was difficult in heating and wax was difficult to grab and</li>
            <li> maybe, I&#x27;m doing this wrong</li>
            <li> the hair will \\&quot;curl\\&quot; or get \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; in the wax and be pulled in the wrong direction (this causes pain).       </li>
            <li> However,  I find it a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> You will be sad.</li>
            <li> The product is now terribly difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you need to have a piece of the wax not on a spot with hair</li>
            <li> As salon visits get expensive.</li>
            <li> but I thought I would try it since GOING to get waxed was getting a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Difficult to heat in microwave and instructions are incorrect.  </li>
            <li> He has never voiced a preference, but he had a silly grin on his face when he came home.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my time to return the iteme expired yesterday (how convenient for the seller).</li>
            <li> I decided to start waxing my bikini area because after shaving I would get these horrible red bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> No need for expensive salon visits ever again.</li>
            <li> Got it wrong on all counts.</li>
            <li> It is also quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> Ill stick to strips.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m stuck with this useless product.</li>
            <li> Ordered it recently and it was absolutely horrible!</li>
            <li> I had heard of the absurd prices of waxing here and had no experience in trying it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> microwave heated is weird.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Save money on expensive salons and do it yourself at home.</li>
            <li> It was very painful (as expected), but I also had an allergic reaction to the wax.</li>
            <li> it yourself waxing with the separates strips, however, this product was extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you read some of the reviews talking about how painful it is, I&#x27;ve got to say I think they didn&#x27;t read the instructions and did it wrong.  </li>
            <li> It stays adhered to your skin like chewing gum or crazy glue - I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m a bit of a chicken, so it takes me about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to try the Brazillian wax, but was too chicken to go to the shop.</li>
            <li> I pulled again, and again -- each time, it hurt like crazy but wouldn&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li> This was the worst product i&#x27;ve ever tried,itwas messy and my hair grew in three days after i used this don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to hurt like crazy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require cutting up cloth strips.</li>
            <li> Waxing at home is difficult and painful, period.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, extremely painful, terrible instructions, shoddy job</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> Sad :(</li>
            <li> Mad that I bought 2</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was so discouraged I wanted to cry!</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.  </li>
            <li> but I am very shy and have never had the nerve to go get it done.</li>
            <li> very  difficult, to used</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;SurgiWax\\&quot; towel now (because the wax is impossible to get off the towel.  </li>
            <li> But not as bad as you think.</li>
            <li> If someone says this isn&#x27;t so bad, they must be on something or trying to impress people (or have been waxing for years).</li>
            <li> it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad, so I would recommend this for use AFTER getting started with a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok-I have been waxed once before and it was so bad</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re going to buy this and then give it a bad review because it hurts or because of user error, don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how badly it hurt</li>
            <li> The stray hairs can just be plucked out with tweezers, which doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as it</li>
            <li> Too bad they discontinued it at Ulta</li>
            <li> Ive bad no problem with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff was so bad, I googled it after the fact, to see if this was just an anomaly or others</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> It also leaves a bad residue.</li>
            <li> And the bad part is it comes with 6 boxes.</li>
            <li> and although it was painful, it was nothing that was too bad.</li>
            <li> I am actually shocked how well this works.</li>
            <li> There were some points where it was a bit painful</li>
            <li> The wax, even with Tylenol and lidocaine, was extremely painful.  </li>
            <li> Still extremely painful, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as painful as sticking needles into my eyeballs, or so I imagine.  </li>
            <li> It got so painful</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so painful.</li>
            <li> and they were painful</li>
            <li> , I guess it may work for someone, but for me it was just too painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it is unusually painful.</li>
            <li> and it was still ridiculously painful?</li>
            <li> And yes it was quite painful.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even finish that area because it was so painful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to hear my CVS didn&#x27;t carry it anymore..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>
            <li> I am afraid I will run out, or they&#x27;ll stop making it!     </li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Used with: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate stubble, so</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t screaming bloody murder in your bathroom when pulling the wax off.</li>
            <li> I hate strips.</li>
            <li> i hate</li>
            <li> hate</li>
            <li> hate hate it if i could afford a lawyer i would sue for being traumatized.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how anyone can say this crap works.</li>
            <li> but worst of all is that the gunk is absolutely impossible to get off.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so bad if you forget on your legs, but in the bikini area this is a NECESSITY!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painful without the strips.</li>
            <li> This product however is a very painful product to use.</li>
            <li> and it was very painful for him</li>
            <li> Very painful to use.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be terrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever done to my pubic area.    </li>
            <li> The worst part: I have ingrowns galore.</li>
            <li> It looks horrible and hurts like the dickens.</li>
            <li> The pain is insane.  </li>

            <li> This is the worst thing to wax your bikini ever!</li>
            <li> I would say this stuff for bikini area is at worst on a pain scale of 3.5 out of 10, 10 being mauled by a bear while screaming for life.</li>
            <li> I thought the pain would be horrible.</li>
            <li> Let me say why I thought the pain would be horrible, it wasn&#x27;t because of any reviews on this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painful without the strips. It&#x27;s not that easy for it to come off.</li>
            <li> It takes practice. It&#x27;s not very painful, better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Yes, Brazilian bikini waxes are very convenient...as far as having someone do all that business for you...but they can also get pricey!  This wax is awesome and, as long as you can tolerate the self-induced pain that comes along with an at-home wax, it definitely gets the job done with salon-quality results! No messy strips, either.</li>
            <li> I decided to start giving myself Brazilian waxes about 6mths ago when I was done paying 60 dollars for others to do it! I usually buy this at CVS for $9 but when I went to my normal CVS and they didn&#x27;t have it and then to another CVS and Walgreens neither had it which is why I went to Amazon. I will now always by it from here. You get 3 boxes for about $4 bucks each! Great value! I really stocked up :-) If you have never used it before make sure you apply the oil liberally before you wax, it really makes it easier for the wax to come off.</li>
            <li> Everyone is looking to save some money these days so my brazilian waxing appointments were one of the first expenses I cut from my budget. I have been so uncomfortable shaving,  as I get so itchy and uncomfortable the next day, not to mention the unsightly bumps!! I read the reviews for this product and people seemed to love it. I have never waxed myself before, so I can not compare it to the do it yourself waxing with the separates strips, however, this product was extremely disappointing. It does manage to get a lot of the hair off, however, never on one clean strip. I find myself picking at the product that is left behind on my skin, making red marks that take days to go away, not to mention the hair that is left behind from this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You nuke the product to get a thin consistency, then you spread it on your skin, you wait for it to dry then you peel up a corner and rip it off (going against the hair). Sounds easy enough...well, it isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t mind the pain, hell, I wear 4\\&quot; heels to work sometimes, the pain is worth the beauty aspect of it. What I don&#x27;t like is the time it takes to pick at all of the left behind product that doesn&#x27;t come off, and then the unslightly hair that is still left behind. I have to go over areas more than once (which is usually a no no when waxing that sensitive area) and even after that there is still hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper than $60 each time I want to get it professionally done, but I have a 13 month old at home, and this process takes a long time to do my bikini area...I want to get it done so I can enjoy some intimate time with my husband!! And then enjoy some nice, clean, smooth skin...sadly, my skin is not smooth when I am done. I have used this product 4 times so far and each time I am not completely hairless. Instead I have bumpy skin with a lot of sporadic hairs, not that sexy. Oh well, at least I don&#x27;t itch like shaving! :)</li>
            <li> While not for the faint of heart, this is a great product. I have used other wax systems, they are all messy at home that is a given. But this is the easiest to use in that you can quickly microwave it, it does not require strips, and the pot has a great little handle to carry the mug. the only thing is that it does not seem to stay as hot as long as other waxes so I had to nuke it a few times. That said, I am very pleased witht the result and use this for legs, and eyebrows as well. And it is a lot cheaper than some of the other waxes, that only come with 1 pot, and you have to boil! I do think the private areas are easier done in a salon, as it is quick and they are pros, but for the cost and ease of use this is great stuff. It also will give you nice clean lines.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my friend recommended it.  I have been getting waxed at a salon for over a year now and it was getting a little expensive (I&#x27;m a student), so I decided to do it myself.  This product works wonders!</li>
            <li> I realize that some people say that this improved version of surgi wax isn&#x27;t as good as the old one, but I unfortunately never used the former wax, so I can&#x27;t really say anything about that. I use this wax the most for the majority of my hair removal; not just for private parts. Sadly I have really thick and dark hair that grows down there and also on my arms, so I use this product for both areas to avoid shaving. I&#x27;ve tried other waxes, and I&#x27;ve found that I prefer hard wax, or wax that does not require the use of disposable strips because they tend to be less painful for whatever reason. I would highly recommend this wax for those of you who have really stubborn hairs like me because this wax gets even the tiniest hairs, which is the main reason why I keep coming back to this product. Sadly, the packaging of it is kind of small and as a result of using it for various areas, I tend to go through this pretty quickly. The stuff is kind of oily and hard to get off it there&#x27;s remnants left over, but that&#x27;s mainly because this is such a great product for getting all the pesky little hairs. But for all you nay sayers, definitely try this because it&#x27;s a great wax that really gets EVERYTHING leaving it silky smooth, and is also probably the most pain free wax I&#x27;ve used (oxymoron for pain free and waxing, I know). The price of buying this as a pack, especially if you&#x27;re on the automatic shipping thing where you save 10% or something like that makes this definitely cheaper to by online than in store. It also qualifies for free shipping if you sign up for that automatic shipping thing, so just try it out. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for about 2 years now and it works great! The key is practice. The right temperature wax and the right amount of pre-epilation oil. They used to include a small vial of oil in the box but my last shipment did not include any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount of oil, just enough to moisten the area. If you put too much it will be hard to remove the wax, increasing your pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the temperature is concerned, you just have to experiment with what works best for you. I find that a hotter, more runny wax works best for me, but that is also harder to apply by yourself. If you can trust your partner to help you, it might work out better. I have also had success with a cooler wax, a more gummy consistency. I guess I like it more runny because you can use less wax but still remove all the hair. I find with the cooler consistency, I use more wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, if you use the correct application technique (in the direction of hair growth)and removal technique (pulling in the opposite direction, as close to the skin as possible, NOT straight up!)this process will be worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also ladies, you can decrease your pain by doing this at the end of your period or a few days later. It has to do with the hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No strips required. If you spill hot wax just leave it and let it cool and harden. Then it is easiest to clean by chipping away at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my armpits too. Works great!</li>
            <li> My husband likened the experience of Surgiwax to getting the first car you could afford on your own: it was not a good car, but because you never had another one, you like it! Then you discover what else there is to be had, and your perspective changes....&lt;br /&gt;It is a messy wax to use, and it does not yield well. Those little wooden applicators, if they were any shorter, one would end up using one&#x27;s fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Application is thick, not what one wishes for at all. And getting the last bit out of the pot is impossible, because it hardens up before you can use it all.&lt;br /&gt;Heating it up once more is not a good idea: the 2nd round of heating makes it so liquid you can&#x27;t keep it on the spatula. Also, I suspect they integratged some kind of agent that lets it only soften properly for one time. After that, you have to overheat it to get it to soften, and then it will be totally soupy - and obviously too hot to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, unless you want to only do your under-arm, or any other very small area, you will need all three pots. Its yield is truly minimal. You need one pot per leg. Oh yeah, about that sub-label \\&quot;use for private parts\\&quot;... I don&#x27;t see how that makes it special... I did my pubic area with it, and it was a &#x27;bi..h&#x27; of a job to get it to rip off. Can&#x27;t see how it could have been any worse! (yeah you may laugh, I&#x27;m a good sport, lol)...&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Gigi Brasilien Bikini wax shortly after this one, and I encourage waxers to go for that one: it is an entirely different (and better!) story alltogether.&lt;br /&gt;Spare yourself the hassle of trying this, use the stuff the pros use!</li>
            <li> If you follow the instruction correctly, then it can be done. Only that it was my first time, and did not realize how much pain I was going to be in. It became more of a project that took about a week, than a before shower thing.   However, once you get over the first time, it all became easier, with much less pain. Though, it still doesn&#x27;t get rid of all your hair, but you can easily use tweezers to remove those.   So, even if it did gave me great deal of pain the first time, and some mess to clean up, it does get the job done. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for years.  It works great as it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I found this product to me messy and worthless after the first time i used it. It got everywhere + stuck to everything. Under my nails and it was truly a disaster!!! They give you 3 boxes of the stuff so needless to say I will be giving the rest of mine away. There are no strips included with this product and I found it very difficult to grab the wax in order to peel it back.</li>
            <li> I bought the three pack of the Surgi Wax.   I&#x27;ve done home waxing before with a salon-style crock pot and muslin strips, which was a major ordeal. Messy, complicated, needed three hands to hold the skin to rip the strip. OW!   This magical Surgi stuff is reeeeally weirdly effective-- put the oil on before, brush the wax on (the included tiny tongue-depressor stix barely last thru one session-- have a disposable wooden tool standing by as replacement), pat the wax down, find an edge and pull it right off. The pain was quite bearable.   **The only time it was bad (really, unreasonable bad) was in places where the hair was too long (I had trimmed prior but not close enough!)   Whatever is in the oil or the wax has a crazy moisturizing/silky after-effect and my skin was SO soft for days. Makes me wonder what bio-engineering they have going on. I didn&#x27;t get the red bumpy rash, either. That was a wonderful surprise! Regrowth is as expected-- a couple weeks.   Why isn&#x27;t this brand more popular or widely used, I wonder? I&#x27;m really really impressed with the ease of process and the results.   As other reviewers have noted, take some kind of pain med before waxing and remember that pain threshold is lowest just before menstruation.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every home wax product available and this is hands down the best bikini wax.  It removes the most hair and doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a sticky residue as other waxes, especially those that use strips.  I also use it for facial hair.  Much less messy and painful, and the oil works well.  Just be careful not to apply the wax to too large of an area where there is a lot of hair, or it will be difficult (and painful) to remove.  I will not use any other home waxing product ever again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good waxing product.  I have used it for years and then I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it in stores.  I am so glad Amazon.com has it.  It works great for your bikini area.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to have to look for another product to do the same thing.  I have tried others and they are very lacking.</li>
            <li> With a little body contorting, this stuff works wonders! The pre-wax application oil has a slight numbing sensation, so when you follow the directions there&#x27;s basically very little pain at all, if any. It does hurt a bit more on non-oiled parts, so beware! I&#x27;ve only ever had experience with the Sally Hansen wax strips available at drugstores, and this is by far much easier to do, with less mess. This is going to be my go-to wax for bikini season; at the subscribe &amp; save price it&#x27;s definitely a bargain.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this wax anywhere,I&#x27;ve been using it for years, won&#x27;t use anything else.  Sooooo happy to have it here, love amazon. thanks</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever used a wax of any kind and I have to say I am not a fan of this one. It hurts. It&#x27;s messy. It hurts. Strings of cooling wax get everywhere and it hurts a lot when you try to remove it. It&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly. And did I mention it hurts? I&#x27;ve since tried the strips and like them so much more. I gave this item two stars because it does rip the hair out although unevenly and, well, waxing isn&#x27;t supposed to be completely pain free.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I wanted to try an alternative to shaving. I&#x27;m a man but I brought this because I figured if women use this for their more sensitive areas then it will surely be ok to use on my chest. I don&#x27;t know how you women do this, I know women are more tolerable to pain but wow. Everything was going fine until I tried taking the wax off. It was difficult to get a good hold of the wax and hurt like hell. Since I could not get it off right away, the wax started to get sticky and soft making it even harder to remove. It did a fairly decent job at removing the hair but it was way too painful for me. The barely used jar and the 2 unopened jars went directly into the garbage. My first and last time waxing, I learned from my mistake. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly if you grow your hair out. Does not work so well on short hair. I highly recommend using a lot of oil. It makes the whole process just a little bit easier, and does not decrease the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product works great make sure you follow the directions and you should have no problems i have recomended this product to all my friends..</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of self-waxing kits and, by far, this one is the best!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at the drugstore, recently, so I was thrilled to see it is available on Amazon.com.  (The subscription option is great!)  The wax is easy to use and really grabs all the fine hairs that other waxes may leave behind.  The only negative thing about it is that it does not come with a \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; oil.  It does come with a pre-epilation oil, though, which you should definitely use to make removing hairs a little easier.</li>
            <li> I love that this wax gets the job done, but it does take a few times to get used to. Its easy to be discouraged when using it for the first time just because you need to get organized and find out how long is actually long enough to microwave it (since I usually had to microwave it for double what the directions said, maybe even more), and most importantly, get used to the fact that if you&#x27;re new to waxing, its going to hurt (but you get used to it if you stick with it- i think its a hundred times better than shaving). The key for me was to RELAX, because if you get anxious, you will pull the wax off slowly. This makes it hurt much worse than just ripping it off (the oil does really help though), and worst of all, pulling slowly won&#x27;t pull the hair out. I spread the wax in small strips at a time so it&#x27;s much easier to rip off quickly, which honestly does make it effective, and much less pain. The more times you use it, the easier and faster it gets.[[ASIN:B001A43ELC Surgi-wax Brazilian Waxing Kit For Private Parts, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I started using it in August of &#x27;09 and have repurchased it many times.  I had never waxed any part of my body before using this and took a big risk going with a Brazilian my first time out.  It can be messy, but once you get the  hang of it, you&#x27;ll be a pro in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some key tips based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure the wax is heated until it&#x27;s thin enough to get all the way down to the skin.  If it&#x27;s too thick and sits on top of your hair, it&#x27;s going to hurt when you pull it off.  Warning though, it will be hot when you apply it.  Find the right temperature that is comfortable for you, but is thin enough to apply down to the skin level.  For me personally, I like it very liquidy/thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Pull it off quickly!  Don&#x27;t be tentative, if you go fast it won&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Buy a mug warmer to keep it heated.  I bought mine from Fry&#x27;s Electronics for about $10.  This is a must in my opinion.  Before I bought the warmer, I had to keep going back to my microwave to reheat the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Make sure you use the oil and re-apply if you need to.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll have to go over the same area more than once and it&#x27;s a good idea to re-apply oil there to make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method:&lt;br /&gt;I sit on a towel and use a lighted mirror with magnification. This really helps to see what I&#x27;m doing.  I also use a tweezer to get any stray hairs that may not have been picked up by the wax.  I follow up with tea tree oil which I believe helps prevent ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve heard that lotion/moisturizer with salicylic acid also prevents ingrown hairs, but I personally haven&#x27;t tried this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not a hairy person (I&#x27;m Asian) my hair seems to grow out fairly quickly.  I hate stubble, so I end up waxing once every week.  One container/tub lasts me about 5-6 waxes.  I buy the 3-pack and I&#x27;m on the Amazon subscription plan so it&#x27;s even cheaper.  This is the cheapest price around.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 8/11/12*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to add that I started using tea tree oil right after I wax and it has made a huge difference.  It really helps prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the hair grow back slower and thinner.  Now I can go for 2-3 weeks without waxing.  I use Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil.rice around.

            <li> I bought this product, after I waxed at a salon for about 4 years now and I just got to tired of paying $60+ and decided to try to do it myself. I didn&#x27;t think that one jar would be enough for 1 setting but it was...of course it&#x27;s not pain free but it was not worse than it was at the salon, actually the wax was way better. At the salon the used strips, which pretty much took away the first layer of my skin, I was in pain for the next 2 days and my private parts were swollen, but not with this wax. The struggle for me was, that because I was so nervous, my body heat made it hard for the wax to get hear, but after I calmed down, it was fine. I had to go back to the microwave 2 more times...I can so recommend this product, I will definitely order it again...</li>
            <li> I not only use this wax for my bakini line but also my armpits. It is great for sensitive areas. It is much easier to use and gets all the hair as opposed to strips.</li>
            <li> Works on all different areas of the body or face. This is the best wax by far. All the other types leave a terrible sticky mess behind and this is the only type that leaves no residue what so ever. It&#x27;s very easy to use when following the directions. As for the pain; the pain is worst the 1st time because that&#x27;s the only time you&#x27;ll be pulling out all the hairs from an area, after that it&#x27;s only a fraction of pain since you&#x27;re just keeping up. You might try Orajel Max strength; even tho it feels funny when applied it is perfectly safe as babies put it inside their mouths &amp; is used for tatooing. It may take you several attempts before you accomplish your goal the 1st time and then it&#x27;s a breeze. ...The short duration of pain is worth the lasting results.</li>
            <li> I like this wax. You do not need fabric strips to use it which is nice. It also gets all the hairs at once. However I found it hard to get the layer to be thick enough throughout entire surface so when I remove wax it sticks if it was too thin (usually on the sides of the waxed area) and it is impossible to remove it. That is why I am giving it 4 stars.   I really with someone came up with water solvable wax.</li>
            <li> A review from a guy&#x27;s perspective:    For waxing in general:  Why would you wax?  If you&#x27;ve never done any intimate hair removal, the smooth skin feels great.  I think it looks great (on me and on women).  You can find myriad sexual benefits if you spend a minute searching.  If you&#x27;ve already decided to / already do some cleaning up down there, it&#x27;s a lot simpler than shaving.  It&#x27;s a lot easier.  Doing it at home is a lot cheaper ($14 for 7-8 months of wax vs 15 razor blades).  There&#x27;s a lot less maintenance (once a month compared with a few times a week!).  Plus, as you wax more, the hair grows back thinner and finer.      Some of the downsides:   It&#x27;s hard to wax around back without help.  It&#x27;s time consuming (about 30-45 minutes, but that&#x27;s only once a month).  You need to wait for your hair to grow back to 1/4\\&quot; before you can wax again.  It may lead to a few ingrown hairs (a bunch that get stuck but free themselves, and one or two that need to be helped out), but none that are painful.  The ingrown hair problem can be helped with something like Tend Skin, which is meant to stop ingrown hairs.  The first time you wax will hurt the most, but every subsequent time will hurt much less.    For this product:    I tried this out as an alternative to wax strips (Sally Hansen for Men).  It&#x27;s much, much better.  There is a lot less pain (be honest: you&#x27;re ripping hair out, it&#x27;s going to hurt a bit), but it&#x27;s more than bearable.  It&#x27;s close to pulling an adhesive bandage off your arm.  If you read some of the reviews talking about how painful it is, I&#x27;ve got to say I think they didn&#x27;t read the instructions and did it wrong.  The instructions are pretty clear.    The wax comes with an oil to put on your skin to prevent the wax from sticking to your skin so the wax only sticks to the hairs.  This makes the process a lot easier on sensitive skin.  The oil will stay on your skin for a few hours afterwards, but it&#x27;s so little it doesn&#x27;t stain anything.  Definitely use the oil.I missed a spot once and it was pretty painful.  There&#x27;s more than enough oil to cover everything you&#x27;re going to wax, so don&#x27;t skimp.  However, the first wax will hurt since there&#x27;s a lot more hair with a lot more holding it in.    This is a hard wax, so you don&#x27;t need any cloth strips.  You just apply the wax, wait about 30 seconds for it to cool, then peel it off.  The trickiest part is flipping up the end of the wax so that it&#x27;s big enough for you to grip and strong enough that it doesn&#x27;t break.  Although the wax is a bit thicker than honey, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  The wax will occasionally form a tiny filament between the applicator and the jar, but it cools quickly and falls off -- usually right back into the jar.    One jar will last through about 2 1/2 waxings for your pubes, balls (use the wax a bit cooler there), and base of your penis.  It&#x27;s hard to get much more than that done without help from someone else.</li>
            <li> Do you like pain?&lt;br /&gt;Do you like messiness?&lt;br /&gt;Do you like to look at your ceiling and scream to God \\&quot;WHY!?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then get this.</li>
            <li> Exelent product.  This is the best wax I have ever used.  The best thing is that it comes with an oil so that it does not stick to your skin.  Also there is no need to use paper to remove the wax.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to Brazilian waxing, I would bypass this and go straight to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re an expert at getting them--then you&#x27;ll probably love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fit into the former description, so I&#x27;m not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;The kit consists of a tub of microwaveable wax that you pop into the microwave for about 15-60 seconds, depending on how full the container is. The jar contains enough for about 3-6 waxes depending how much work you need done. It also contains two spatulas and some oil that is supposed to be rubbed on before applying the wax, to prevent it from sticking to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply the wax with the spatula in small patches, wait for the wax to harden (about 20-30 seconds), and use your fingernail to \\&quot;flick\\&quot; one end up to provide a tab to pull with, and the rip the wax off in the opposite direction of growth. The package comes with three kits (three jars, six spatulas, three oils), so there&#x27;s enough for several months&#x27; worth of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, the kit is very straight forward and, in itself, there wasn&#x27;t really anything negative I have to say about it. It does grab almost every single hair in a single pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as the title of this review suggests, this isn&#x27;t for the squeamish or newbies--unless you have a high pain tolerance. Now I&#x27;m no wimp, I have several tattoos and microdermal anchor piercings--so I like to think my pain tolerance is pretty darn high. But I couldn&#x27;t tolerate this after about three waxes on myself. By the fourth wax, I chickened out and ended up using a pair of scissors to pull it off myself because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian in my life and don&#x27;t know what prompted me to start with an at-home kit (I figured, I do eyebrow waxing on myself, how much more could it hurt?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to work up some major guts to try this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Because you have to apply this directly to your skin (there are no strips), it&#x27;s difficult to control. It applies unevenly, there&#x27;s no way to get nice even applications, and then there&#x27;s the added dripping of wax all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s only two spatulas per jar. As stated, you can get several applications per jar, but there&#x27;s only enough spatula&#x27;s for two applications. You could reuse the spatulas, but after awhile the wax builds up on the handle and makes the already difficult to control wax, even more difficult to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The earlier part mentioned about using your fingernail to \\&quot;flick\\&quot; the edge up to use as a grabbing tab to yank with, if you don&#x27;t apply the wax heavily enough for your nail--you&#x27;ll have nothing to grab on to. So it&#x27;s a constant struggle to get everything on evenly (or as evenly as possible), and then make sure there&#x27;s a thick tab for you to hang on to as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re a waxing expert, the above probably won&#x27;t phase you. Good luckay to get nice even applications, and then there&#x27;s the added dripping of wax all over the place.    - There&#x27;s only two spatulas per jar.

            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a brazillian yet, but I thought I could try this wax out on my armpits and it works great. (this is my first time waxing...) It took me a long time, because I needed more practice. It took the entire container to wax both armpits. I found it very important to use the oil and spread it all over past the hair onto the skin above it. When applying the wax, spread it about an inch above the hair. I had to re-microwave several times, but not a big deal. Place the container on a paper plate in the microwave for quick cleaning. Also don&#x27;t wear a bra or top. The wax can be a bit messy and could ruin your clothes. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and works very well.</li>
            <li> It only removed like half of the hair. I was doing it correctly, but it was not a very good product. Go with the strips, they do a much better job...</li>
            <li> been using this for years... its great... you have to have a good treshold for pain if you want to try brazilian wax yourself.  Make sure you trim your hair to 1/4th of an inch.  Although it works without any waxing strips..I like to use a strong kitchen roll(paper) with it. I lay the paper in a single strip over the wax once i apply it over my skin (when the wax is still warm)It helps give a good grip.      Works beautifully for underarms as well as facial hair.  Must buy...</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product. I use it for facial hair and hated paying the higher prices for small jars when it is all the same stuff. The three pack is an amazing deal. More amazing because my local stores all seem to be switching to Nair products which I don&#x27;t like.  This stuff works, it smells great and lasts a long time.   Super fast shipping as well.   No negatives here!</li>
            <li> Open oil and wax even though package is selled</li>
            <li> i love love love this waxing kit personally. I love all surgi wax products which by far i think is the best brand for waxing. This product no only works for bikini areas but also places like underarms. It does however get a little messy but over all it takes most of the hair out with one try. Ladies its cheaper using this kit at home rather than going to the salon and plus its with your own private eyes. i would definitely recommend this product!! its a MUST TRY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using since i started using it years ago, for some reason, i couldn&#x27;t find this anymore in stores but it&#x27;s ok AMAZON is the best place to buy this from and it&#x27;s in packs, so it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be terrible. I was expecting tears. But no, the only down fall.. it hurts. But not as bad as you think. I have sensitive skin, and well... this worked wonders. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that it would be pain free, but it really works as long as you put plenty of oil and the wax is warm/hot. The spots that I didn&#x27;t rub the oil on, it was soooo painful that I wanted to cry, but if you put plenty of oil on the spots you&#x27;re waxing and the wax is not too cold, then it&#x27;s perfect. This is saving me so much money from going to the spa every month!!!</li>
            <li> One of the more effective and affordable waxes. I am unfortunately blessed with a little more hair in areas than other women and have to keep up with my waxing sometimes on a weekly basis. This is good stuff that is gentle enough to use on your face and tends to pull out more hair than the other brands, plus its inexpensive and easy to use. One minute in the microwave.</li>
            <li> Okay so let me start off by saying I was very scared when I first bought this. I had my legs waxed once and NEVER had a brazilian. I started with my legs. This product really didn&#x27;t hurt at all! I was able to easily rip out the hairs. For people who say it solidified too quickly, there are two things you can do. The first is to put it in the microwave a bit longer: It is supposed to be kind of runny. As long as it isn&#x27;t too hot on your skin, the hotter the better. The second thing you can do is to keep it on a candle warmer. This is not necessary, but saves you trips to the microwave. The only thing you MUST be sure of is to follow the directions and clean the area thoroughly, then use plenty of the oil they provide.   Next, I moved onto my brazilian. I probably could have trimmed a bit more, but I wanted to make sure to get every hair. The first strip hurt a lot. I won&#x27;t lie, I nearly considered ending it there. II later found out it was because since the whole area was hair covered, it was hard to flick a tab up with your nail to get a good grip. It was painful, very painful, but not painful enough to make me cry or discourage me from discontinuing. I then moved out from that patch that I had just waxed, and it was smooth from there. I put a bit of wax on a non hairy area and then continued it onto the hair I wanted to remove. This made grabbing the tab much easier. I eventually got through the entire area quite easily and although it was painful, it was nothing that was too bad. The one thing I will say is that I took some Motrin before I began, and I think that made a huge difference. I also carefully read instructions which helped a lot.    There are a few cons I will list. The first is that it is messy. It gets less messy as you do it more and get used to it, but still; make sure you lay out some towels. Secondly, it is difficult to get off the little scraps of wax, even with oil. It is, however, possible. It does leave a few hairs, but only the thinner ones that are harder to grip with wax. This didn&#x27;t really bother me much. That is about all I can think of. For people who gave up because of pain, I would say to take a Motrin, use plenty of the oil, and the instructions say you can rub down the area with an ice cube or use numbing spray (I didn&#x27;t do either), and lastly just bear through the whole process because it does get better. I really like this product and will order it again when I find out how long the results last.   Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of waxing, but I decided to give this a try due to good reviews....it hurt, it was difficult to remove from my skin.  Complete craziness.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to hear my CVS didn&#x27;t carry it anymore..but i&#x27;ve been a fan of this wax because of its easy use.  Just pop it in the microwave and its ready to go. (all microwaves are diff so make sure you start low) Using the oil before and after makes a big difference when waxing. The jar lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little nervous using this product because I have never waxed before and to start a first try on a Brazilian wax is risky! But I am tired of shaving so I gave it a try and it was awesome! I knew nothing of waxing and now after my first Brazilian wax, I felt like a pro! The first 3 pulls stung a bit, teary eyed but after those pulls, it wasn&#x27;t as painful. The only thing was I had to heat it about 2 - 2 1/2 minutes to melt the wax but I was lucky to have a wax warmer (it&#x27;s a plus!) I am loving it! I recommend this product to all my friends and family! It&#x27;s smooth and it makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing/epilating my bikini area for years; and decided to try this product after a rave review from my friend. This is the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever done to my pubic area.    - This wax never hardens enough to be pulled off easily. Imagine trying to get rid of a piece of chewing gum...attached to your labia.  - Oil makes skin slippery (duh!); hence, I cannot pull my skin tight - and tightly pulled skin is a key to a painless and clean waxing  - Took forever. When I use my usual wax (strip free Parissa), I&#x27;m done in 20-25 minutes. After an hour and a half of fussing with Surgi I had lots and lots of hair left behind.    The worst part: I have ingrowns galore. Never, ever had it happened before (and as I said, I&#x27;ve been waxing, shaving and epilating for years). It looks horrible and hurts like the dickens. I&#x27;ve tried TendSkin, AHA, BHA, azulene oil and whatnot. Despite all my efforts, the entire area still looks like a train wreck. Romantic life effectively ruined; and I could have probably opened my own waxing place with the money I&#x27;ve spent dealing with ingrowns.    Bottom line: it does not work for me. I am getting back to Parissa.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for over 10 years.  I started with a Sally Hansen product, and it was good, however, it was discontinued.  I then bounced around to different wax brands and types.  All of this ended when I found Surgi brazilian wax.  I tried it out of desperation and have never looked back.  Recently, the drug store by my house stopped selling it.  I looked around and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  So, once again I began my search.  I went back and tried earlier tested products and was not even close to being satisfyied. Ordered Surgi in a six pack on Amazon and that is now my long term plan.  Amazon, please keep it stocked, I&#x27;m too old to start my quest for wax again.&lt;br /&gt;If you have wax stuck to you afterwards, try the Surgi Care Erase After Wax Lotion, it removes wax residue.  It smells like coconut suntan lotion and gets the job done. Even when I had a professional wax me, I still had some residue.&lt;br /&gt;Also, to the reviewers that said it hurts.  You&#x27;re ripping hairs out of your body.  It&#x27;s not going to feel like puppy licking your face.  Follow the instructions and it will, however, get easier with time and practice.</li>
            <li> I had been using for years and really work for me, and with the pre-oil makes the hair easy to pull out off.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review:  This is the best ever wax I have ever used.  Didn&#x27;t think anything like this existed.  Like any waxing, the microwavable wax has it plus sides and negative sides.  Nothing stops it from being messy or cooling off too quickly so you have to reheat often, but it&#x27;s quicker than honey wax with strips.  The best part ever is that it is not as painful as all other waxes.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there still is a bit of pain when waxing those sensitive bikini areas, but you recover quickly, no bleeding, bruising or tearing.  You must use the oil provided reap the full benefits.  Overlap with the oil the intended target so when you put the wax on, it&#x27;s easier to peel off.  The jar is small but with this purchase you get 3 jars so I find it priced well.  I will definitely be investigating their other products for waxing those larger areas and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a smooth, bare bikini line or more!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, but I figured it was worth a try. I was wrong. Never, never buy this product. I only used it to test on my legs and used the oil, etc. to prep the skin. After following all the instructions, I put it on and then waited for it to try before pulling off. It took all the hair off but they forgot to mention that it also takes all your skin off. Total waste of money and who can you give even unused ones to? I had to throw them all in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my mom&#x27;s home made wax my entire life (my mom is Brazilian and makes amazing waxes), but now we live across the country from each other so I decided to give this a try.     #1 thing I HATE about this product: you need to use a large amount of wax for any area.  you can&#x27;t exactly peel it off if you don&#x27;t have a thick layer on.  with that being said, you will NEED a lot of wax.   thin layers will stick to your skin and will be a pain to get it off.  I used an entire jar for one time. I waxed everything, but it was still an entire jar.    The good thing is that it removed everything. Even fine hairs.   I will probably continue to use this product until I get to see my mom, and have her make me a lifetime supply of wax.</li>
            <li> good product. you should include more spatula and better quality spatulas.</li>
            <li> Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely order this again and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.      If you&#x27;re a first time waxer, yes, it will hurt.  After refining your skills and knowing what to expect, it only gets better and is actually addictive.  MAKE SURE YOU USE THE OIL!!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Does get all the hair.  The oil works very good.(be sure to apply before waxing)  It can be used to remove facial hair.  Cons:  Small jar :( hehe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed before with waxing strips which I find the most effective and convenient because you can reuse the strip multiple times for those problem areas. This product however is a very painful product to use. Not to mention extremely messy because it does not use waxing strips but rather the wax itself is supposedly the waxing strip. I will not purchase again. The wax was hard to get off and more painful than regular waxing.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It is much easier than the stuff with the paper or cotton strips for removing and I think that it works better for pits and bikini area.  I ended up getting the silk epil for my legs and pits and I love it.  But this is the best for the bikini.</li>
            <li> I have very course hair and this wax kept it off for almost 3 weeks. I was impressed usually i have to wax every 8-10 days.</li>
            <li> I received this product within the timeframe quoted and it was exactly what I ordered. I had no issues with my order and will continue to do business with this vendor.</li>
            <li> This product is very good at removing all of my pubic hair. However it is quite painful, particularly when waxing the scrotum and the certain area around the butt. results last for approx 4 weeks and the hair seems to come back softer and finer. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The wax dries and ends up flaking off in small chunks. not in a long strips. I wish this had come with strips, I would not have purchased if I had known they weren&#x27;t part of this process.</li>
            <li> It really does hurt, but that&#x27;s what i expected it to do.  So I just use this for hard to reach hairs in certain creases that razors cant get to very easily and work great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this wax. Its so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require any muslin strips. You just need to be careful and not leave it on for long else you wont be able to get it off. But if you follow the instructions well, it couldn&#x27;t be better and easier.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t completely remove every piece of hair but it&#x27;s cheap (compared to a $80 session at a salon) and does the job well. I highly recommend it! I found this way better than shaving since 1 day after shaving I&#x27;d get stubble and itch. YES the first few times are painful, but as your hair thins out from waxing, it shouldn&#x27;t be as painful after. Therefore, do this every month to prevent your hair from grown back thick. One complaint I have is that the microwave directions weren&#x27;t very accurate. They say to microwave the wax for no more than a minute but with my 1100 watt microwave, I had to microwave for more than 2 minutes before the wax was spreadable. I get 2 waxes out of one jar. This works well on armpits, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely apply the oil before you wax. This is to make sure you pull on only the hair and not your skin since without oil the wax will stick to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Look away when you pull. This helped me to gather strength because if I look at it then I chicken out, and I end up tugging on the hair which makes it more painful.&lt;br /&gt;For females, wax 2 weeks before your period. I heard this is when your skin is not so sensitive so it&#x27;s less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this product for over 5 years to give myself a Brazilian wax and even though the manufacturer has claimed to update the formula, the product has stayed about the same for me. I still find myself &amp;#34;over-microwaving&amp;#34; the jar for more than a minute to make the wax more spreadable. I do want to warn buyers that this product will sometimes cause bleeding/in-grown hairs. I have some small scars left on my mons pubis from the bleeding caused by this product. I personally don&#x27;t mind, my SOs in the past 5 years haven&#x27;t minded/noticed, and I have never gotten an infection, just some slight discomfort from the in grown hairs. You have been warned though and I decreased my original 5 stars to 4. I still prefer doing this in the privacy of my own home than to pay some random woman at the spa to touch my private parts.at the spa to touch my private parts.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the hard wax used in salons. If your brave enough I would recommend this money saving option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this around 3 times. It&#x27;s awesome! Definetly wouldn&#x27;t use if I never got waxed before. I&#x27;ve gotten around 6 waxes professionally, and then done at-home waxing. It&#x27;s definitely better with practice, but after you get the hang of it, it works as good as being at the salon and paying 60 bucks. One thing, is I wish it came with more oil. I&#x27;ve have to start using baby oil, which still works alright. Make sure your body heat isn&#x27;t too hot, or it won&#x27;t pull. Just make sure a fan is on in your room and you&#x27;ll be fine. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I just want to start this review by saying that this product gets 4 stars because it was easy to use, worked great on the areas I was able to get done, and was overall not an unpleasant experience.  However, I would also like to say that it was very stupid of me to try to do it myself for the first time I&#x27;ve ever been waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hairy person, like a gorilla.  And my hair is very thick, both in surface area and follicle circumference.  And it grows in all sorts of weird directions.  And the roots are so deep that if you pluck a hair a few mm long, when it&#x27;s plucked it&#x27;s usually 1/4in long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian wax, so I thought I&#x27;d just use a little of the wax to remove my leg hairs to get me started, which, while ridiculously thick, still are obviously not as bad as the bikini region.  This wax worked fantastic on the fronts of my legs, where the hair all grew in one direction.  I was getting it all off in one fell swoop.  Unfortunately my calves have hair in 3 different directions within a very small area, and I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get almost any hair off.  For the past few days, I&#x27;ve read reviews for all different kinds of waxing, watched videos, read articles, etc. to get myself to a point where I felt confident doing this, no problem, so it&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t read the directions or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I&#x27;d ever been waxed before, this product would work a lot better, but after almost 2 hours (it took me 2 hours just to find this stuff - it was sold out in every store I went to!), I had barely gotten the bottom half of one leg done, and I was so cranky I decided to stop trying and just book a waxing at a local spa.  I&#x27;m saving what&#x27;s left of the wax for when my hair grows back, in hopes that it won&#x27;t be so thick and I&#x27;ll be able to do it myself, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, hairy girls, get it done by someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing your first time!</li>
            <li> I have been using wax for almost 10 years and this is the best.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in any local stores so I had to get it online.  The sticky wax and strips never work for me.  This hard wax is more time consuming but worth the effort.  Once you get the hang of it you won&#x27;t go back to strips.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different waxing products over the years, and NOTHING comes close to how terrible this one is.  Difficult to use, extremely painful, terrible instructions, shoddy job but worst of all is that the gunk is absolutely impossible to get off.  You know those remnants of wax that you always have left that easily wash off with soap and water? NOT THIS JUNK! It stays adhered to your skin like chewing gum or crazy glue - I have tried everything. I have tried scrubbing, rubbing with oil, attaching to a muslin strip, rubbing the area with a thick moisturizer, but this garbage is here for good.    I am SO IRRITATED to have wasted my time and money on this product, and my skin is raw, red and sticky to boot, plus, the job it did actually removing the hair is pitiful. I swear, this product must be concocted by a mischievous salon owner looking to make women run back to a salon to get professionals to do the job.    Have I made it clear that I hate Surgi-wax? Please don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. Find another product.</li>
            <li> This wax is good for all types of waxing, not just Brazillian. If you want to wax your eyebrows or anything else, this is a very cost-effective way too get all the wax you need. It also is one of the best microwavable waxes I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction to it. If using it on your face, you really don&#x27;t need to use the prep oil. If, however, you are going to be using it for your more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, do yourself a favor and use the oil so you aren&#x27;t screaming bloody murder in your bathroom when pulling the wax off. It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sugaring to remove underarm, leg and bikini hair for 3 or 4 years, so my review will be with that comparison in mind. I found Surgi Wax to do a much better job of removing hair than sugaring, and when used with the oil it was less painful. I also always managed to bruise myself sugaring my bikini area, no matter how diligent I was about trying to hold the skin tight, and with the Surgi Wax I had no bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surgi Wax is more messy than sugaring in that it makes strings the same way hot glue does, but sugaring is sticky on my skin even after I remove the hair, resulting in me sticking to things and to myself. Whereas Surgi Wax is in inoffensive waxy specks even if some does cling to my skin and the removed strips of wax are hard and not messy. After I finish waxing I can massage with a little oil (it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind) and any clinging bits of wax come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major advantages Surgi Wax has over sugaring is that I don&#x27;t necessarily have to apply the wax directly to my skin for it to work. Some areas are difficult to reach neatly with the spatula, and for those spots I heat the wax slightly hotter than usual and spread it on a strip of muslin. I apply the muslin strip quickly to the spot I want to wax, wait for it to cool and rip it off. I got the idea from a review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sugaring is okay in a pinch for my legs but now that I&#x27;ve tried Surgi Wax I won&#x27;t ever go back for my underarms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this.  I read so many good reviews in so many places.  Waaaaaaaay too messy.  Hard to warm up to the right temperature without being too hot.  Doesn&#x27;t get every hair. Very hard to apply unless you&#x27;re already an expert. Messy messy messy.  Hope you have more luck then I did.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I had never tried waxing before. After reading (mostly) very good reviews about this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. What was there to lose? (other than some hair.. LOL). First, I trimmed the hair very short &amp; used the included oil beforehand. My hair is not course &amp; I&#x27;m not very hairy. I expected to have some discomfort &amp; pain... But WOWZERS! Hello serious pain! I&#x27;m one of those people who has a fairly high pain tolerance. But having my lady parts ripped/pulled at was just too much to bear. After trying a couple small areas, I gave up. In a nutshell...    The negatives:    1. Had issues with the actual wax--it hardens very, very quickly &amp; would stick to the tiny wooden spatula. And then it would stick to my hands from trying to wipe wax from the spatula! After only a few minutes, the spatula (and jar) was a big, sticky mess.    2. Painful, absolutely no way around that. If someone says this isn&#x27;t so bad, they must be on something or trying to impress people (or have been waxing for years). The bit of skin I did wax was was simply left red, irritated and sore. There were also some small chunks of wax left stuck on the skin, which was a big pain to remove.     The positives:    1. The packaging was neatly done, each jar has a nifty little handle attached. I love that. I also liked the smell of the wax lol. The positives almost stop there..    2. Directions are clear &amp; straight to the point. You know exactly what you&#x27;re doing and how to do it, even if you&#x27;ve never tried this before now. It gives interesting info on how brazilian waxing started &amp; also has a couple helpful illustrations.       In conclusion, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I really wanted this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t go well. What a mess! I followed many tips people had left on here &amp; it did no use. Those that left rave reviews have probably been waxing for 20 yrs so they&#x27;re used to the pain &amp; hair is more thinned out. I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but man I didn&#x27;t have anyluck. I think I&#x27;ll stick to shaving for now. It&#x27;s less time-consuimg and no pain! And maybe when I have the extra dough, I&#x27;ll get it professionally done. Maybe I&#x27;d feel more at ease if someone else does it &amp; knows more of what they&#x27;re doing.     Is it really worth this much pain to be hair-free? I decided NO... I&#x27;d almost rather give childbirth than use this wax!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use to use it when it was available in stores, and now I order it from here because it&#x27;s easy to use, and better than the strips! I use it for every part of my body, not just my bikini area. It can be a little messy, but definitley worth it!</li>
            <li> I had several professional bikini waxes done before attempting to do this myself at home and even then it was a challenge. Not to be crass but waxing your eyebrows and waxing downtown are two VERY different things and you probably want to know *exactly* what you are getting into here so I can&#x27;t stress enough how important at least one salon trip can be. Even though I knew what to expect pain wise, there is definitely a learning curve involved in mastering this skill which is probably why the salons charge so much to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If possible, have this done professionally at least once so pain-wise you know what you can handle. Also, with hair growing in several cycles, if you approach the Surgi Wax as *maintenance* plan then you will have much less to work with and much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and as many reviews as possible for extra tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming to the proper length first is crucial to a good result, as well as following ALL the instructions to the letter, with no short cuts especially with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do too much at once; I had to do my first home waxing over three sessions over a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The candle, cup, or wax warmer to keep the right consistency is a huge help! Too thick or too thin and you wind up with a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For stray hairs, use tweezers or an epilator after skin has calmed down rather than trying to go wax an area twice - you&#x27;ll risk swelling, irritation and possibly even removing skin if you try \\&quot;double dipping\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to try hair removal without having ever had a professional waxing, I&#x27;d recommend starting with something you can&#x27;t get into too much trouble with in an area that is easily reached like the legs. This product [[ASIN:B001ET73FQ Moom Organic Hair Remover Refill, 6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]] does a pretty good job at getting about two-thirds of the hair off but can be wiped off if you&#x27;re in over your head for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one last thing is that if I try to reheat/reuse the same Surgi-Wax jar after it has been consistently warmed using my candle warmer, sometimes the results are not the same - the wax gets either gummy or for whatever reason I just get just poor results. At the pack-of-three-price I find it&#x27;s better to just throw away the rest of the jar and start fresh each time which seems to be cost effective compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for a professional session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!ame Surgi-Wax jar after it has been consistently warmed using my candle warmer, sometimes the results are not the same - the wax gets either gummy or for whatever reason I just get just poor results.

Good Luck!</li>
            <li> 3.5 stars.  The good thing is this stuff is cheap, and relatively easy to use.  I&#x27;ve never had a pro wax before, but I can guarantee I would have had less pain and been done in less than half the time.  I had a really hard time pulling the thickest areas... it hurt so bad and I kept chickening out and dragging out the pain - having someone else do it would have gotten it done much quicker.  When I did some maintenance a week later (my hair grows fast I guess) it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad, so I would recommend this for use AFTER getting started with a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cons: it left a lot of hair... more than I&#x27;d like to tweeze one by one.  And the wax does not dissolve, so don&#x27;t get it in the tub!  It won&#x27;t even chip off when it hardens, at least in mine...</li>
            <li> This wax is very strong, and at the subscribe and save price, a very good deal.  I have tried out many different waxes over the years... I definitely liked Parissa, but the price is so high.  Sally Hansen seemed to be my go-to, esp. because they always include a $1 off coupon.  But oftentimes, the Sally Hansen would not catch all my underarm hair, and I would have to go over it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Surgiwax for a brazillian, armpit, lip and eyebrow wax.  The Brazillian came out beautifully!  Very few strays, clean application and strong hold.  This is not flimsy stuff, but neither is it that super-hard consistency you get when you heat the Parissa too much on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The armpits were great, as well as the &#x27;stache.... the only think I don&#x27;t want to recommend this for is eyebrows.  It was so strong it took off my eyelid skin (good thing this this happened at Halloween).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear from my friends that Gigi is really the best, but for this price, and for what a great job it does, I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> A lot easier than using strips but tales a little time to get used to.  Easier with another person helping.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on reviews. This is a 5 star product. I have very thick, curly hair.  Shaving is not an option for me.  This stuff works so well I have it on auto deliver subscription from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t like it for my legs (as some reviewers have mentioned), but bikini and underarm are wonders!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 3 years. It works. It removes all the hair with minimum pain.</li>
            <li> I have had previous experience waxing my bikini line using soft wax. Soft wax is cheaper than hard wax, but when it comes to your private area, there has to be a compromise. I bought this item from Shopper&#x27;s Drug Mart (one jar) for 12.99+HST but you can find it at Sally&#x27;s for 10.50+ HST. Compare that with the low end cost of a salon visit at 35-45 dollars. I also want to add, I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian in my life.. ever! All I did was watch a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos on the internet and read the instructions. I recommend working in small patches no more than 1 inch by 1 inch sections. I didn&#x27;t tear and bled very little. The hardest area to get (for me) was the labia. I didn&#x27;t bruise either. Just take your time. Inhale and rip! The entire experience took me 2 days to complete (I needed a break haha).  I think soft wax &amp; sugaring is more ideal for larger areas that don&#x27;t have too many nooks and curves (like your legs). I will only use hard wax for my future \\&quot;down south\\&quot; upkeep!     PROS:  More effective than soft wax and cloth strips  Removes the hair more effectively &#x3D; less overall pain (having to redo it)  The provided Oil is great for conditioning the skin and helping to protect it  Less mess    CONS:  You need some type of warmer to keep it as a liquid, I made no less than 10-12 trips to the microwave   I used up a full jar doing one Brazilian! But in all fairness, I haven&#x27;t done any real maintenance \\&quot;down there\\&quot; in probably 18 months...</li>
            <li> works amazingly well! was very impressed! my hair is naturally corse and this wax removed it completely! The oil that comes in the package definitely helps the wax adhere to the hair and not the skin making it virtually painless. I will def be using it again next month!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Best on the market!!!!</li>
            <li> I am actually shocked how well this works. I use it to wax my underarms, and it really is almost painless.  Almost painless waxing? Never would have imagined that. Price is great too. Big fan!</li>
            <li> I am blonde and fair!  this is the best wax I have ever used!   Follow instructions and you will have a flawless bikini line!</li>
            <li> I started out using Surgi-wax to do a Brazillian style wax. I got about 2 waxes out of it, and it did a great job, but I thought it was bit expensive considering shipping and handling. So, I bought Sally Hansen&#x27;s bikini wax kit at my local store. It&#x27;s soft wax...and was a painful nightmare! It was messy, and didn&#x27;t remove the hair efficiently, which meant redoing a lot of areas. The wax stuck to everything and was a HUGE mess! I quit half way thru and just shaved. Plus, I was left with swollen, red welts for a week. THUS, I HIGHLY recommend Surgi-wax! It&#x27;s worth the money, and it works. The hard wax is so much easier to deal with. It takes out the hair in one yank, which means less pain. It gets 99% of the hair and leaves skin soft and smooth for at least 3 weeks (for me anyway). The wax stays pliable for about 10 minutes, and you do have to make repeat trips, but that is better than dealing with the insane stickiness of soft wax. The oil that comes with the kit is great to use before and after waxing. Once you&#x27;ve used hard wax you&#x27;ll never go back to soft waxing with cloth strips! Surgi-wax is a great product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have to say this stuff is amazing!!!!  I love the pretreatment oil that comes with it!  Now when I say amazing, keep in mind, you are still pulling hair out of your body...still hurts.    Recommendation!  Go to salon and get a Brazilian!  Have her remove it all as it is a lot of work to get the stubborn hairs yourself.  Now you are set to keep your Brazilian perfect with the surgiwax!  When the hair grows in less full and coarse, you are set with this stuff!     I personally had a salon Brazilian 5 weeks ago and left the two inch strip down the middle.  I had difficulty keeping that with the surgiwax so decided to take it all off.  The wax had some difficulty with the thicker parts and it was harder for me to do it.  Eventually, I finished and have to say, am very impressed with it!  Definitely will purchase this again in the future!</li>
            <li> So I was a little skeptical of this product, even after reading all the great reviews. I have tried a lot of the home hair removal products and have never been impressed. I recently went back to school, so I am now too poor to afford my regular waxes at the salon. I finally tried this product for the first time yesterday and holy crap!!! It really works! Keeping in mind this IS waxing in a very sensitive area, I found the level of pain to be acceptable and much more tolerable than salon soft wax strips. I did find the product a bit messy, but I suspect I will be a little neater once I get the hang of how to deal with the wax. If you want a perfect wax you will still have to fork over the $60 at a salon, but for a good, basic wax this product is awesome. I am definitely a convert and plan on using this product a lot in the future. Tip: in addition to using the oil, pop a couple Advil about a half hour before.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I will use. I hate strips. Works like a charm every month for a clean smooth..... yea know...</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years- only certain chains carry it which always makes it a hassle to find.  The wax is great consistency and it&#x27;s honestly the least painful product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this wax online. Works great anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> Best at home wax I have ever used</li>
            <li> my local CVS no longer sells this wax :( which is how i came across it in the first place. I&#x27;ve tried a sally hansen kit but it DIDNT WORK AT ALL. this is the only wax i&#x27;ll use and i love that amazon sells it as a subscription also :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to do a brazillian at home this is the way to go.  Make sure A) you have a bikini trimmer and trim the hair very short, about an eighth of an inch long and B)make sure to use the oil in the kit on your skin to be waxed and your hands to make sure you can get the wax off your hands.  I also use a thin towel or paper towel to help pull the wax off...it just is less painful that way.  Also, never attempt to do a huge area all at once.  Do small strips.  Do all these things and this is a relatively painless home wax.  It can be time consuming if it&#x27;s your first wax or you&#x27;ve let your hair grow in.  Best to do it over a couple of days in that case.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this waxing kit. When I first started waxing I went to a salon/spa and paid up to $60 every 5-6 weeks. I have never tried the soft wax with strips on the bikini are for two reasons; the salon/spa I went to only used hard wax and I have used strips before when waxing my dad&#x27;s back and it was very painful for him and it didn&#x27;t catch even 60% of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried several different brands of hard wax...whatever I could find in my local drugstores. I found the Surgi Wax kit at a local beauty supply store but it is $6.99 for one (not including tax). I have been an avid amazon shopper and thought why not save a few $$ with the subscribe and save option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have a very specific method when I wax. Before you wax, make sure that if you need to trim hair down a bit that you do or if it is your first time waxing shave the area that you are going to wax and let it grow out to about a half an inch. If hair is too short then the wax can&#x27;t pick up all the hairs, and if it is too long then it will be more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the wax kit the other supplies I use are: low step/stool, hand mirror with magnification, and parchment/wax paper. I place a long piece of parchment/wax paper down on the floor and place the stool on one end of the paper; this ensures that I don&#x27;t get any wax dripping on the carpet/rug in my room and it is easy to ball up all my used wax and trash and then throw it away. Then I sit on the very edge of the stool and use the magnified side of my hand mirror set on the floor, so that I can see where to apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to waxing use the oil that is given in the kit and liberally spread in all over area to be waxed as well as all over your hands. This really helps to lower the pain level when removing the hard wax, as well as making any wax mess on your hands easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with the hot wax, if it is really watery when it comes out of the microwave then it will burn your skin (at leastfor me...it&#x27;s more painful than the actual waxing process!) and it tends to be very drippy and messy. You will have to figure out the consistency that is best for you. If it has a very thick consistency, although it is still warm enough to work, it will waste a lot of wax. Normally I can get 2 uses out of each kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I all done I typically have to do a little clean up with the tweezers but I&#x27;d say that for me it gets 98% of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Works very well, minimal pain. Just a pinch really and so much less mess than other waxes. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Worked very well! Not messy as long as you heat it properly. Have baby oil on hand to remove any left over wax.</li>
            <li> I have used this wax before but this time I used the strips with the wax and it worked a lot better with them and it didn&#x27;t take as long.  I think this is a great product.  I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> This is the best home wax I have tried. FAR less messy, more efficient, and easier to use than Sally Hanson bikini wax. I won&#x27;t buy any other wax. One tub gets me about 2 bikini waxes. You don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as other home wax kits, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> This wax is fantastic.  It was my first time using hard wax on myself and the results were quite favorable.  It&#x27;s super duper clean and nowhere near as messy as soft wax/sugar.  Make sure you use the oil.  I forgot to put it on one side and it hurt quite a bit.  The only thing that sucks is that you have to grow your hair out to 1/4 of an inch (gross!).  I had some hairs that were closer to 1/8 of an inch and they didn&#x27;t get pulled out from the root (just the surface).  So far, my boyfriend says this is the best waxing job I&#x27;ve done on myself.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for years. it is by far the best product i have found. It is easy to use and not messy at all. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> This product took a 30 seconds longer to heat up than instructions said it would. Perhaps it&#x27;s microwave wattage issue. This product cools to fast once out of microwave and stirred. The oil works well. When applying wax to skin I recommend doing SMALL spots at a time - yes this will take a while, but larger strips of wax make pulling hair the \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; way painful and may cause bleeding. Very important. For me, it is just too painful and too much work. But, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong if you want a DIY Brazillian wax. I give it a 3 because it was difficult in heating and wax was difficult to grab and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the experienced - you will rate this a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Waxing.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! After reading the positive reviews, I decided this was a job I could do myself rather than shelling out $80-$100 at a local salon. Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s quite tricky and you need to be somewhat of a contortionist to actually carry out this procedure on yourself, it really does a super job if you take your time and follow the instructions. You also may need to reheat the wax before you&#x27;re finished if you are slow and methodical and intent on achieving perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think this was an excellent buy since there are 3 jars of wax included in the purchase. It only took a half-jar for my first waxing, so I can count on getting at least 6 waxings total, which would cost me around $600 in a salon. I would definitely repurchase this item rather than another when I run out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know...maybe, I&#x27;m doing this wrong but the wax was not the greatest at removing the hair. I followed the instructions. It seemed to work at removing some hair (quite painfully-which I was expecting) but not even the majority of what I wanted removed. I have tried this 4-5 times now and I have finally given up. I have now started looking into laser removal.</li>
            <li> The product is not easy to use.  It is either too hot or too stringy.  It is messy and doesn&#x27;t go on evenly.  Then, when you try to pull it off quickly, it gets stuck to your skin (yes, I used the oil first).  Then it starts to melt (get warm) when you handle it too much on the skin, and then must be slowly (and painfully) pulled off while each hair is pulled off, one at a time.  I&#x27;d just fork over the money and have a professional do it.  Much less pain and time involved.</li>
            <li> There is so much \\&quot;junk\\&quot; on the market, so I am compelled to comment on great products!  This is a GREAT PRODUCT!  Be sure to follow instructions, most important is to use the supplied oil.  Rub it on your hands as well.  This product actually works!  Be careful not to apply the wax too hot, you can get serious burns!  Start carefully, then enjoy your new look!  Wonderful product!  (I am a man, and I used it on \\&quot;everything\\&quot; down below!)  Don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>
            <li> A quick tip from a male user. 2 words WAX PAPER. Instead of using the little wooden stick and trying to scoop the wax out of the container, pour a little bit of the wax onto wax paper while its hot. Then apply to the desired area and start to press it out. This guarantees a very even application! A little wax can go a LONG WAY if you spread it out to about ~1.5mm thin. Good luck waxing!</li>
            <li> Yes, Brazilian Bikini Waxing hurts, there is no doubt about it. It is an acquired habit. I personally LOVE waxing down under, no more ingrown hairs, no bumps. It&#x27;s wonderful! This wax is comparable to salon wax. Doing it at home was easy. The wax picks up all the hair. But I have discovered another amazing use for this wax--- my underarms!!! Takes about 5-8 mins per underarm-- leaves them smooth, creamy looking and lasts forever!     This wax IS the BEST at home wax for bikini, underarm and even legs! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the \\&quot;For Private Parts\\&quot; slogan on the box- it is amazing! I have about 6 jars at home becuase I am afraid I will run out, or they&#x27;ll stop making it!     If you have never done a biki wax- here are a few tips from a LONG time waxer...at home and salon:        -- DO take advil or tylenol (NOT ASPIRIN; will cause you to bleed if you accidently pull to hard on your hair) before you wax- wait at least 30 mins.       ---Trim hair, the longer the hair, the harder for the wax to stick and more chances the hair will \\&quot;curl\\&quot; or get \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; in the wax and be pulled in the wrong direction (this causes pain).       ---Don&#x27;t try to wax a 5 inch section. Go 2 X 1 inches, especially f your a newbie.     --- Do use the pre wax oil and wait at least 5 minutes before waxing.       --Wax in whatever position you feel comfortable. Some of us sit on the floor for the top parts of our bikini wax, some of us stand.     -- DO place newspaper under your feet / or when sitting on the floor-this will catch any \\&quot;drops\\&quot; that may fall.     --DO ENJOY your new brazilian wax!!!     :)</li>
            <li> If you follow all the steps carefully, it won&#x27;t hurt much any more. On the other hand, the wax doesn&#x27;t have a natural smell.</li>
            <li> This wax is the best I have used so far. It is very easy to use. The oil makes it unpainful. The only problem is that you&#x27;ll have reheat it quite often.</li>
            <li> It is excellent, way better than the Nad&#x27;s brazilian wax. It doesnt hurt or feel painful at all, even sensitive skin doesnt react allergically to it. It is easy to use and equipped with pre-expilation oil.</li>
            <li> I am sick of paying for the full service to get my wax done, so I figured I would try this. I was able to do a BETTER job than the results I get for paying between $60 and $80. My wallet is grateful and my calendar is a little more free being able to do this by myself</li>
            <li> Ok-I have been waxed once before and it was so bad I swore to never do it again (my friend was becoming an esthetician and I was her first time). I saw all of the reviews and I thought- what the heck maybe I can do this too. It was actually very easy to use and not nearly as painful as when my friend did it. There were some points where it was a bit painful but I bet it was my own fault. It actually did not last me as well as it did some other reviewers. I used almost the whole jar and I only cleaned half up. Maybe I used too much wax? Either way it turned out great. It&#x27;s nice and clean- which is what I wanted. The only other thing that bothered me is how the wax piles up on the rim of the jar. It was frustrating. I also had to reheat it about 3 times. I might get the mug warmer. Other than those 2 things- I&#x27;m a happy camper&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have been purchasing it through amazon because I thought it was the only place that sold it.  Wrong!  I was just walking through ULTA and found this on the shelf for the amazing price of-get this- $4.49!!!!!  I haven&#x27;t figured out yet why there&#x27;s approximately a ten dollar price gap between amazon and ULTA&#x27;s but consumers out there, if you have access to an ULTA nearby, I would purchase it there.  Assuming that you get three uses out of a jar, you are paying less than two bucks per wax session :-)</li>
            <li> I am a first time waxer, and because of the (mainly) amazing reviews I decided that Surgi-wax would solve all my shaving problems.  I was very wrong.  The wax, even with Tylenol and lidocaine, was extremely painful.  Even when I used copious amounts of the oil provided, the wax still stuck to my skin in some very sensitive places... Ouch!  I spent 30 minutes slowly and painfully peeling/cutting the stuck wax off some delicate places...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Surgi-wax does take off a good 85% of the hair, but it was way too painful and messy for me.  I will say that the wax worked much better on my underarms than my bikini area.  Still extremely painful, but a bit less so than my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the painful experience, I still wasn&#x27;t willing to go back to shaving.  Some of the reviews mentioned Moom sugar wax, so I decided to try it.  (In the meantime, I went to a salon and had a professional Brazilian wax done.  It was less painful than using the Surgi-wax, for sure!)  When Moom came, I couldn&#x27;t stop waxing!  I waxed my legs and underarms, and wanted to keep going!  (I&#x27;m still waiting for the hair in the bikini area to grow back to try Moom there as well, but I have no doubts that it will be less painful than the Surgi-wax.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sugar wax is better for many reasons: it was not as messy, not as painful, and so much easier!  The best part about sugar wax is that if you make a mistake, the sugar rinses off with warm water.  It wasn&#x27;t pain free, I was ripping out hair from the root, but so much less so than Surgi-wax.  Once I got the technique down, it was easy and quick.  Moom took off about 90% of the hair, and it was easy to re-do an area without any additional pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to buy Moom sugar wax instead.</li>
            <li> I have resorted to home waxing after moving to a different country where such services may be hard or near impossible to find.  Surgi Wax is easy to use and removes hair from the root.  It took me a long time to complete the task but I am pleased with the results. I was skeptical because of other products that I have used in the past but this one is a clear winner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Surgi (formerly One Touch) roll-on strip (soft) wax for nearly 30 years. I&#x27;ve found it to be the fastest, easiest, least messy, and least expensive way of removing hair. But strip wax works best on relatively flat surfaces. Using it on the bikini area is difficult and often requires going over the same area more than once, which can leave redness or even mild abrasion in such a sensitive area. So, when I saw that Surgi now makes a hard wax kit for the bikini area, I decided to give it a try. I hadn&#x27;t used hard wax at home in many years. I remembered it to be messy and to require a lot more wax than strip wax, which rolls on in a thin layer. Nevertheless, it seemed like a good idea for hard-to-reach areas that are not flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surgi&#x27;s Brazilian Waxing Kit for Private Parts includes a 4 oz. (112g) pot of wax, 2 wooden spatulas, a small vial (3.6 ml) of pre-epilation oil, and an instruction booklet. Conveniently, the wax can be heated in the microwave. Instructions say it takes one minute to heat a full jar, 30 seconds for half a jar, etc., but it took longer in my microwave. If the wax has a watery consistency, it is too hot. Wait for it to cool down a bit. It should have a honey-like consistency. You can test it for temperature on your hand, if you like. I could only get half the job done before the wax cooled too much and I had to re-heat, but you could place the jar on a cup warmer if you prefer. How much wax you need will depend on how much hair you are removing, but I think the average person will need 1/4 jar for a bikini line wax and 1/2 jar to remove all hair (Brazilian wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair should be about 1/4-inch long for waxing, so you may want to use a trimmer set to that length. Apply the pre-epilation oil before waxing. It is mostly soybean oil. The pre-epilation oil is not entirely necessary, so don&#x27;t worry if you run out or don&#x27;t have it. It prevents the wax from sticking to skin, making it easier to remove small, stray pieces. It&#x27;s nice, but I never used a pre-epilation oil with hard wax years ago, and I sometimes forget to apply it with this waxing kit. It&#x27;s not a big deal. Use a spatula to spread the wax in the direction of the hair growth. Let it set for about 30 seconds or until no longer tacky to touch. Then rip off in the opposite direction of hair growth. This works a lot better on uneven surfaces than soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tweeze the occasional hair that the wax missed, but generally this hard wax kit works better than strip wax on my bikini area. It grips the hairs better on uneven surfaces. I do not have to go over the area more than once. So there is less redness. It is less painful, as it does not stick to the skin as much. I don&#x27;t think waxing other parts of the body is painful, but the bikini area is. I was pleasantly surprised to find that hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as strip wax on this sensitive area. It&#x27;s a bit messy. I recommend putting newspaper underneath you. And it is never easy to wax an area that you can&#x27;t see well. You have to use a mirror. It&#x27;s no faster than strip wax, but the results are better. I&#x27;ll be using the Surgi Brazilian Waxing Kit on my bikini area from now on.sed a pre-epilation oil with hard wax years ago, and I sometimes forget to apply it with this waxing kit.

            <li> I have loved Surgi Wax for doing my upper lip so figured I&#x27;d try this for the other end.  Whereas I did not do the full Brazilian job, the areas I waxed just outside my bikini line and slightly along the inside felt smooth and soft.  I was careful to use the oil first as instructed and had no skin irritation at all. I&#x27;ve only waxed one other time and it was on my legs with a different product and I actually had skin peel off here and there. So this was a big leap of faith for me to use wax on this even more sensitive area. But I have never been dissapointed with SurgiWax and I checked out other reviews first.  I highly recommend this wax to get smooth and silky. The only thing unpleasant was trying to get the wax where I wanted it but that isn&#x27;t the fault of SurgiWax.  That&#x27;s my fault for trying to strip hair from an area that nature put there for some odd reason.  PS, I bought a MisterCoffee cup warming plate to keep the wax hot after microwaving it.  It was perfect at keeping it at the right consistancy throughout the entire waxing. Never had to re-nuke it. I&#x27;ll bet any cup warmer would work too.</li>
            <li> I have used it multiple times and it works very well. Excellent results after use. However,  I find it a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> I got my first brazilian using hard wax last month and it was less painful than the other method where you had to use strips. So I thought of ordering a hard wax home kit to save money and do it myself. Surgi Wax is so easy to use! Just follow the instructions and you&#x27;re all set! I did it while listening to music haha I sang a few lines from the song (20-30 seconds) before pulling the wax off. That way it didn&#x27;t get boring :p always remember to put the oil on first too! If you don&#x27;t, the wax would still come off but it will be in pieces though. I used the oil to remove piece by piece haha</li>
            <li> Before I can really review this wax, I&#x27;ll be completely honest with you: this hurts like a b****. But what do you expect? An eyebrow wax can sting- THIS IS YOUR PUBIC AREA. OF COURSE IT WILL HURT!!! So if you&#x27;re going to buy this and then give it a bad review because it hurts or because of user error, don&#x27;t bother buying it. Secondly, I highly, highly, highly suggest getting a professional wax first. Not only will it prepare you for the pain, but it will also give you a much better idea of how to use this product. If you don&#x27;t want to get a professional one, at least look up tutorials or videos on how to do this if you want great results.    As far as the wax itself goes, it did an awesome job removing hair! Although there is no denying that it hurts, I think it hurts much less when I do the waxing myself because 1. it&#x27;s my body, and 2. I can re-postition myself and take a break if needed. The box comes with two \\&quot;wooden spatulas\\&quot;, or small popsicle sticks, which worked great for first use. However, I will definitely be buying a pack of more for the next time. The wax also heats up great in the microwave as intended- the only slight issue I had was that I had to reheat the jar halfway through.     The only time stickiness or stringiness was an issue is when I didn&#x27;t wait quite long enough to pull the wax off. If that happens, just give it a little longer and try again. As far as the temperature of the wax- that it up to you. MAKE SURE YOU TEST IT FIRST!! If you use it straight out of the microwave when it&#x27;s very creamy, of course it&#x27;s going to be hot. Also, this is not something that should be done in a hurry. Obviously, the time it takes to finish depends on your personal tolerance to pain. If you&#x27;re one of those people who just go in and start ripping it all off it to get it over with, this won&#x27;t take long at all. However, I&#x27;m a bit of a chicken, so it takes me about 40 minutes. My point is- don&#x27;t expect it to all just come right off like when you shave.    Overall, this is a great product. My results were amazing- exactly that of my professional appointments, only about $35 cheaper. I hope this review helps! :)</li>
            <li> OMG! This is the best wax ever. Very easy to use and even without applying the Pre-Epilation Oil, it doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin. For me personally, it is less painful compare to sugar wax that I used before. I am so happy that I purchased 5 jars of this stuff. I will def continue using it.</li>
            <li> So, I have never waxed anything before so I didn&#x27;t know how much it would hurt.. but it is so worth it!  I used this on my \\&quot;private parts\\&quot; once and that was the worst, but it looked so great afterwards and it still hasn&#x27;t grown back all the way yet (like 3 weeks later) and what has grown back is soft and thin.  I hate waiting for it to grow out to wax again, too, but I think the more I wax it the less overall hair there will be.  ALSO, I used this to do my underarms and WOW!  That was the best idea ever.  They are smooth (not stubbly) for the first time in my life, and if I do it right after I get out of the shower it does not hurt at all.  So even if you are too scared to do a Brazilian, this wax is worth it for your underarms! No more shaving! And, I also used it for my eyebrows and although it&#x27;s difficult to shape them this way, it&#x27;s great for larger areas like the unibrow area and underneath them.  So, that&#x27;s my two cents!  Also, I bought a wax warmer but it doesn&#x27;t really help.  I still have to microwave it every few minutes.  BUT I&#x27;ve used it lots of times and I&#x27;m still on the first pot.  And I have 5 more to go....haha</li>
            <li> No more strips, hair comes out the first time and the wax doesn&#x27;t get all over the place! With the strips, you have to buy more and I would have to go over the same place more than once and sometimes more than twice.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t microwave the container as described - it caused my microwave to pop and spark. Otherwise the product once melted works well.</li>
            <li> II hated to shave my underarms because it made them dark(I am an Asian). So I started to wax the, using sugar wax. It was sticky and it used to take 30-40 mins to wax my underarms. The end result was always untidy underarms with a lot of leftovers. Either I had to shave them or go to a salon to get them clean. Then I found surgi bikini wax I used it on my underarms and its awesome. It just takes 10 minutes to get the work done. Its not sticky and the end result is perfectly clean underarms. Watch a youtube video to how to wax your underarms. It will help. And yes do use the oil a lot of it.:))</li>
            <li> I will never use this product again!  I can&#x27;t believe how badly it hurt and I followed the directions.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> After shaving this area for a while, I decided to try waxing so I could be silky smooth.  I knew it would be painful, but I thought I was pretty smart to try and counteract that with 2 ibuprofen AND numbing cream (lidocaine).  I gave the ibuprofen and lidocaine plenty of time to work.  The first problem was that I heated the wax in a microwave for the prescribed time, but it wasn&#x27;t melting.  I kept heating it and heating it with no result.  Finally I took it out and pushed my finger into the hard surface to see what was up.  My finger poked through a crust on top into hot liquid wax underneath.  I burnt my finger and spilled wax all over the place.  After recovering from that, I applied a small strip of wax and removed it.  OH MY GOD THE PAIN.  I did this a few more times.  It left behind about 15% of the hair which was annoying.  I could only handle a few small strips before I had to stop.  The pain is insane.  It&#x27;s about as painful as sticking needles into my eyeballs, or so I imagine.  I&#x27;ve done plenty of painful things to my body (including various types of hair removal in other areas) but this one is more than I can handle.    If you want to remove hair from this area, I&#x27;d say the best approach is laser hair removal.  I&#x27;ve done this on other parts of my body with great results.  I&#x27;m just nervous that there might be some reason why I wouldn&#x27;t want to remove hair permanently from that area, although I&#x27;m not sure what that reason is.  e.g. Would it be weird looking at 80 years old with no hair there?  I don&#x27;t know.  In the meantime I&#x27;ll shave if I want to go bare.</li>
            <li> I got this wax since my husband was returning from deployment. Of course it hurt, its ripping the hair out of my body! Haha. But it wasn&#x27;t worse then I&#x27;d expect. My hair returned in about 3 weeks. It was easy to apply and stayed \\&quot;honey\\&quot; consistantcy the whole time I needed it without a warmer. I&#x27;ve never used any other wax so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything but shaving but I like it and the instructions were very detailed!</li>
            <li> Each box has a little bottle of oil to help the wax not stick to your skin. I suggest washing the area very thoroughly after you are done waxing if you decide to use this oil because it clogged up my pores &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and several tiny pimples appeared the next day. I also advise not to pour too much on because then the wax won&#x27;t stick to the hairs either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also use the time suggested on the container when you&#x27;re microwaving it. The top of the wax may seem like its still solid, but the bottom half is actually burning hot. The suggested times are accurate, just remember to stir it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, when it arrived I noticed the color was different, I heated it up and discovered it does not work as well as the older version. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff!!    I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores of late. I began to panic because I have been using this wax for years and refuse to use anything else.     I use to work in the spa industry so believe me when I tell you, once you learn how to do your own waxing, the time and money you save is substantial. A regular brazillian at a spa can cost you $60-$80. This box costs about $6 and all you need is some time and a good mirror. It helps to be a little flexible too ;)    I didn&#x27;t know if they were going out of business or if supplies were low due to warmer weather. I searches all over the surrounding areas. I was absolutely thrilled to find that Amazon had it listed for a pack of 3! I am going to order a bunch so that I never run out again!</li>
            <li> After trying other products, I decided to try this one. Wow, this works so well and the results are long lasting! I use this every time I wax. It&#x27;s good for other areas of the body too, like the upper lip, tummy, bikini, and the rear! The only thing I would recommend is getting a little glass jar and a wax warmer so you don&#x27;t have to keep running back and forth to the microwave. Once you heat it up just throw it on the wax warmer and you&#x27;re good to go! Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> Works so well!! I just started waxing- great for a beginner</li>
            <li> This I have found is the best one. The prep oil makes it sticky wax free so you don&#x27;t get it stuck on your finger and nails. It pulls out the hair from the roots and doesn&#x27;t leave irritation. I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years; they changed the formula and it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> Decent product, I&#x27;ve used better products around the same price range. Strips from drug store were easier, cleaner, and less painful.</li>
            <li> Surgi Wax is definitely the best in brazilian wax, in terms of getting the job done, price, and pain level.  It gets most of the hair out (and I mean 99%), it&#x27;s very reasonably priced (1 jar lasts me 4 waxes), and it doesn&#x27;t hurt... that much.  Well, I think hard wax hurts less than soft wax (applied with a muslin strip), and it&#x27;s a lot cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;If you are a newbie to brazilian waxing, definitely get it done professionally first a few times.  After the first couple waxes, you will notice that your hair growth is slowly, thinner, and more sparse (remember hair grows in cycles!)  So when you do the brazilian yourself with SurgiWax, you won&#x27;t need to cover so much ground!  Even though I consider myself a pro with brazilian waxing now, I still get it professionally done once or twice a year, because it&#x27;s just so ridiculously thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Invest in a coffee mug warmer.  I know a lot of reviewers have said this.  Listen to us!  If you don&#x27;t get a mug warmer, you will be making a lot of trips to the microwave!&lt;br /&gt;- Lay out a towel to sit on.  Seriously.  I like my wax very thin and hot, so a lot of times they drip before it even reach where I want it to.  I have a \\&quot;SurgiWax\\&quot; towel now (because the wax is impossible to get off the towel.  So just say goodbye to your jankiest towel and put it to good use.&lt;br /&gt;- The microwave times on the jar is incorrect.  But usually, I microwave the jar for a minute first, and then in 30 second increments.  Usually, it takes me 2.5 minutes to heat up the jar (when it&#x27;s full)... Again, I like my wax thin.  But that&#x27;s just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;- If your bedroom closet has a sliding door mirror, then you are in luck.  If not, invest in a standup mirror.  If you want to be thorough, you definitely need a mirror to get in all those nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;- When I first started waxing, I thought it would hurt more the further back into your precious lady.  That is NOT true.  Start from your bum, and work your way toward the top.  It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt as much back there.  Your skin tends to be more sensitive where it&#x27;s closer to the belly.&lt;br /&gt;- Even though I like my wax thin, when I spread it on, I like to spread a little bit more on where I am going to rip it off from.  You&#x27;ll thank me later :)&lt;br /&gt;- When you are about to pull the wax, hold your skin taut!  and I mean really taut!  The tighter your skin, the easier it&#x27;ll be to pull it.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply pressure to the skin right after you pull the wax.&lt;br /&gt;- If you are like me and run out of the pre-epilation oil before the wax, DO NOT FEAR!  I found baby oil to be a good substitute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are on your way to looking good once you get over the intimidation factor of brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck :)</li>
            <li> Run far away from this! No amount of wine can take care of the pain I put myself through... Got halfway through and said screw it! Stick to a razor</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Really works wonders especially when used as directed.  I&#x27;ve never found any other at-home waxing kit that performs as well as this does and the price really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Even when devoting much time to following the instructions carefully, it does not stick to and pull out even half the hair targeted, even when tried on an area wit thin, short hair such as the back of one&#x27;s hand or arm. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this cheap knockoff. Totally ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you must microwave it to heat it up, so you&#x27;ll be giving... certain parts radiation.</li>
            <li> This waxing kit is probably the most obnoxiously messy waxing kit I have ever used in my entire life. The stuff smells sort of nice, but that&#x27;s the only good part. This wax is seriously messy, like prepare for an ugly, ugly mess. I would definitely NOT recommend this product to ANYONE. Nope.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but this really works. The pre-wax oil really helps. I suggest working in small sections and being patient with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works and will leave u just as smooth as the salon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 years now and I love it. I highly recommened this product. I subscribe to the monthly deal and wouldnt switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this honestly I didn&#x27;t believe all the complaints about it hurting so much. But believe me, if you are not willing to torture yourself, just don&#x27;t bother. Unless you really, really have a lot of self control. It really hurts. So much. I can&#x27;t say this enough. I thiiiink it is worth it. I am hoping that it was just the first time that hurts so much...because I really almost didn&#x27;t make it..&gt;&lt;</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter and still wound up with wax all over the bathroom and severe pain and bruising on my ladybits. Apparently I&#x27;m not woman enough for this product, even though my favorite movie is Scarface and I listen to Slayer. Do yourself a favor and pay someone to do this for you. It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax that works on thick brunette hair that I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried a ton. If you need to wax eyebrows, lip, armpits, bikini lines weekly or biweekly... This is the wax for you. Gets the fine hairs as well as the bigger ones for a hairless result</li>
            <li> love this product but be careful to put on a thin layer and not clump up...can be hard to remove and painful.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome product for doing a brazilian wax @ home. I spend $65 monthly @ salon &amp; I got 6 months worth for less than that. I miss the monthly visit to the salon, but the $ saved is awesome. The product leaves the same smooth, clean look as the salon without the cost. Best I&#x27;ve found out there and easy to use.When used along with South Beach ultimate skin prep solution you will have the best, pain-free brazilian wax ever!!</li>
            <li> Great at home wax.  I&#x27;ve tried Gigi&#x27;s with the wax heating plate and it doesn&#x27;t compare to this one.  I was amazed at how well it works.  You just heat this in the microwave and its ready!  You can wax hair that&#x27;s less than 1/4 inch long!  If you&#x27;re thinking about trying to wax on yur own, definitely try this!  Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to try the Brazillian wax, but was too chicken to go to the shop. I&#x27;ve never gotten a professional wax before, and i wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the first time being one with everything out there...&lt;br /&gt;This works really well! I&#x27;ll admit,  it hurt (obviously), but some places we&#x27;re worse than others. USE THE OIL!!! Oh my lord! I was too chicken to use the wax too close to the more sensitive areas, and just ended up shaving those bits. I&#x27;d probably try a professional wax in the future... but overall, it works nicely! I bought the 3 pack, and will probably use the rest on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is a great DIY wax! Just received today and practiced with my armpits and it was easy and fairly painless. And a hell of a lot cheaper than paying to have it done professionally! The wax is a little messy. It has to be just the right temperature for it to work properly. But considering this was my first time doing it myself, I know I got my moneys worth. Really worth it if you want to save money and stay nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> first time I&#x27;ve waxed after avoiding at home waxing for a while....this product much improved from others in the past.  as noted in other reviews, may not get all the hairs...plan to go after remaining ones with a tweezer or even the following week with another wax application?&lt;br /&gt;1) directions say put on microwave safe plate - important to note, as you are using the wax, it can drip and scraping one side of the applicator against the side of the jar can create drips...not easy to remove from the plate you might pick, so plan to designate this plate just for waxing!  I invested in a cheap corning ware one that is a different pattern from those I eat off of.&lt;br /&gt;2) directions also say you can re-apply over a potentially too thin layer, but then the hardening time differs from the rest and can make it more difficult to remove.  easier to just remove the thin level and then reapply completely.&lt;br /&gt;3) I also struggle with the applicator provided....I&#x27;m experimenting with a slightly wider and more flat tipped version and that seems to work much better.  Might have to improvise depending on what you like.&lt;br /&gt;4) the warming mug/candle unit was an excellent tip...don&#x27;t do it without or you will be going back and forth to keep the jar warm enough to work with.  I just left my jar on the plate and set the plate on the warming unit directly.&lt;br /&gt;5) lastly as this was my first time in a long time, I tried it on my legs first where I could experiment a little with applying...that decreased the learning curve for other areas!&lt;br /&gt;6) and although it \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, don&#x27;t be scared off....it was so momentary I am more than willing to do this again.  I did have a few spots of blood where I did NOT pull against the hair growth...not sure that is normal or not...no lasting issues however.  Use the oil though!</li>
            <li> I got this about a week ago, but I have been putting off using it until last night.&lt;br /&gt;I have never gotten a professional Brazilian before, as I just can&#x27;t see myself dropping $80 to have some one rip hair out of my nethers, but I was curious to do it myself. Honestly, my results were WAY better than expected. I am super happy that I bought this, as this will probably be my new &amp;#34;hair down there&amp;#34; maintenance routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be some trial and error, here were some of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tips*&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget the oil! It hurts like mother if you don&#x27;t put this on first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny bits at a time - its more time consuming but works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a towel you don&#x27;t mind ruining and keep a wastebasket close by or you will have wax pieces everywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put on the wax super thick. If you do, it may feel hard on top but still be soft underneath. Ripping off soft wax hurts and is super messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to keep any sort of hair patches, be SUPER careful that you don&#x27;t accidently drip wax on the hair. If you do, consider it gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go bottom to top - The thing that hurt the most was the hair ripping out when I was peeling back the first bit to grab on to. If you put a little wax over an area that is hairless or has already been waxed, then you can peel the bit off without slowing ripping anything else. This is probably the #1 tip I can give because this caused me the most grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact that this is messy as hell and required frequent re-heating, way better and cheaper than a professional. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i have used so many different waxing products... this by far is the best.  I have very sensitive skin &amp; have no problems.. It is not messy at all.  I use it on my face, underarms &amp; bikini</li>
            <li> Well I decided to finally try waxing! I was so excited to try waxing but I am very shy and have never had the nerve to go get it done. I ordered this 2 days ago and was so excited to get it today! Before I tried any major areas I decided to do a really easy place, my knuckles, lol I have some blonde hair there that has always bugged me. So I read the instructions and followed exactly, except I had to warm the wax 30 seconds longer then the recommended time. It was still hard after only 1 minute. So I applied the wax on one of my fingers waited a few seconds, pulled the skin tight and pulled the wax off going against the hair! and half the hair was still there so I continued trying it on the rest of my knuckles and it just got worse with everything finger. Until the last one which has all the hair left on it!!!  I asked a friend to come over later to help me and hopefully I get better results then. If I do I will get back on here and say how great it is but for now I don&#x27;t care for it. I feel as if I wasted my money. :-( Is there a better one to use if you are waxing for the first time ever? I don&#x27;t care about the pain part much but I would like it to work at least. I wanted to do this before my vacation in a couple weeks. ??????? HELP?</li>
            <li> Hard wax is fantastic, and no muslin to use.  I wont use any other brand!  Great for legs and brows too!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If your worried about 5 bucks, go to a discount beauty store and buy a 3 pack for around 5 bucks less (not even taking into consideration the s&amp;h.)    Great product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I should say right up front that I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian at a salon...so I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s supposed to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that...I have a high tolerance for pain.  I&#x27;ve had a nine-pound baby epidural-free, and have had two broken bones misdiagnosed as sprains because the doctor said \\&quot;I really thought if it was broken, you would&#x27;ve been in more pain.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Surgi-Wax thinking I could try waxing while staying in my budget.  Started way out at the edges of the hair and that worked fine -- it really stung, but it wasn&#x27;t outlandish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried a small patch on my...well, on one of my, uh...Okay, this is a family website.  In a more sensitive area, let&#x27;s say.  Let it harden, pulled, and YEEEOOOWW!  Blinding pain...but only a tiny portion of the strip would pull up.  I pulled again, and again -- each time, it hurt like crazy but wouldn&#x27;t budge.  My eyes teared up, my fingers started sweating and I couldn&#x27;t grip the wax well to try again, and then the wax where my fingers were started melting away and pulling off in long gooey strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes&#x27; painful prying and trimming at the edges with a pair of nail scissors, I FINALLY got the hardened wax off.  Mostly.  Leaving a sticky, sore spot that still hurts a half hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, IMHO:  If you&#x27;re just going to tidy up around the edges, as it were, this is doable and not too messy.  But if you love your hoo-ha...please, please don&#x27;t put this stuff directly on it.  You will be sad.</li>
            <li> The wax was a mess and it did not come off easily at all. It was very painful (as expected), but I also had an allergic reaction to the wax. I immediately threw everything in the trash! Never again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands, even salon brands, of wax but I always come back to this brand. Hard wax is soo much easier than soft wax and this is the best hard wax.  I use this on my face, legs, bikini and even for nose hairs. I&#x27;ve used it on my husband&#x27;s back of neck area and his back. This is the only brand I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li> I tried all other wax brands and its not the same but this one really sticks to the hair so once you put some on there&#x27;s no way to take it off but with your hair</li>
            <li> This product had a lot of great reviews so i thought id give it a try.  I used the oil given and followed the instructions very carefully.  The wax was a honey consistency and I applied it and waited 30 seconds (as instructed). I grabbed the edge of the wax and began to pull my skin OFF. tried a few more times until I spent 20 mins in the bath tub in hot water slowly and painfully puling pieces of the wax off my skin. This product was awful. I&#x27;ll stick with strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here with wax still stuck to me because it doesn&#x27;t remove like it says and its messy and with all the time pain crying and still stuck with wax on my lady parts the freaking hair dint even come off the parts that the wax did come off my skin at. its a pain both meanings. i hate hate hate hate it if i could afford a lawyer i would sue for being traumatized.</li>
            <li> For years, I spent a fortune at a waxing salon, which had great results but let&#x27;s face it - is rather awkward and intrusive, not to mention expensive. To save money, I then began buying Poetic Waxing from Bliss. The price is close to $50 per jar, and I would re-use all the wax (they recommend doing so) from my face and underarms - not the bikini area. Still, cost a lot although not nearly as much as having a salon do it.&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I found Surgi-Wax on Amazon. It arrived today and I just used it; it is easy to use and the results are GREAT. I like that it&#x27;s a pale lemon color because I can see all the hair that came out. Bliss&#x27;s product is so dark that I wasn&#x27;t always sure.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent value for the money. I used it on my face and underarms and it is quite gentle. Worked great on bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have only waxed my legs once, so this was going to be a new experience for me. I did use this wax on my legs and it worked great! The wax smells good, like i&#x27;m burning some exotic candle. It does take about a box a leg however if you&#x27;re not totally grossed out by your own leg hair, you can re-melt the used wax (stuff it back in the original jar) and reapply. I found that it defiantly needs to be in the microwave longer than the directions say, right out of the package or remelted. MAKE SURE YOU USE THE OIL!!! I can&#x27;t stress this enough! It isn&#x27;t so bad if you forget on your legs, but in the bikini area this is a NECESSITY! I made the mistake of forgetting and spent an hour trying to get all the wax off, it wouldn&#x27;t pull! Unfortunately I believe my natural body temperature in the bikini area made it much harder for the wax to cool down enough for easy removal, I ended up standing in front of a fan and it was still quite sticky/stringy (like gum) after a minute or two which made the processes not only longer, but more painful.  Have some Goo-Gone handy (general sticky-removal product) to remove wax from your fingers and furniture... it works wonders! I bought a Mr.Coffee mug warmer with this product and it kept it at a consistent temperature during the whole process. It got a bit of wax on it so I applied the Goo-gone with a cotton ball and it took everything right off :)</li>
            <li> Though I know how great this product works, this requires microwave which I don&#x27;t own.</li>
            <li> How do you review wax??  Lets see it seems to work well on hair removal and honestly this is the cheapest place my wife has found to buy it.  The key to it all is &amp;#34;don&#x27;t be in the room when she uses it !&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Loooove this stuff! Had to find my own way of waxing after moving to a town that didn&#x27;t offer Brazilian wax. Tried this stuff, easy to use, no strips needed, and a jar will usually lasts me 3-4 applications. Spacing each application out every 4 weeks, makes a jar last about 4 months. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i found this product thanks to all its glowing reviews.  I was paying $65 to get Brazilian waxing done and now with Surgi-wax, it&#x27;s more $$ in my pocket.  I&#x27;ll likely get 2.5 waxes out of one pot, which will work out to be &lt; $3.00 a wax!!!!!  Subscribe and save adds to this deal!&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit messy, but i believe my technique will get better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be successful, it will help if you&#x27;re using this product as maintenance between getting professional service.  I imagine it would be more painful for Brazilian waxing virgins.  Figuring out timing to remove wax is important. If the wax has hardened too much, then it hurts removing the wax.  Seems like 30-45 seconds after application works for me.  Will consider getting a beverage warmer.  I didn&#x27;t have to re-microwave, but near the end, the applicator and sides of the pot were getting a bit gunky.</li>
            <li> I can no longer justify going to a salon to get bikini waxes and so I looked for the cheapest home option. I always buy one of the cheapest options when I do something new because if I make a mistake I don&#x27;t feel so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works about as good as you&#x27;d expect it to work. It&#x27;s far from perfect and far from painless, but it works and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well but it is very time consuming. Read the directions carefully or it will not work.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is easy to use. My only criticism is that the application sticks it comes with are way too short. I end up throwing those out each time and using my own tongue depressor for application. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I Love this wax!  Have used it for years and will continue to do so.  I highly suggest buying it!</li>
            <li> All this stuff managed to do for me was make a huge mess that I had a terrible time cleaning off.  It did not remove hair very well in my experience.</li>
            <li> This was hard for me to use. I give credit for those who an use SURGI wax. I am going to have to go to a professional and have a brazilian done.</li>
            <li> This is the best bikini wax I&#x27;ve ever found. I prefer the Brazilian style and this is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t hurt if you know how to pull right. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Saves me so much money to do it myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely rely on and love this wax! It is the hard type of wax and you don&#x27;t need strips to pull it off (you just use your fingers).  I use it for all my waxing purposes not just the bikini line.  It is wonderful for my armpits and I also use it on my face.  The oil that comes with it to keep the wax from adhering to the skin is also really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different waxing products and this is head and shoulders above all other home waxing kits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years and I thought it was the best product for waxing. However, it seems they recently changed their formula. The product is now terribly difficult to work with. It doesn&#x27;t dry properly and remains excessively sticky making it very difficult to remove. It sticks to everything including your hands while trying to remove it. As a consequence it has caused skin DAMAGE. I do not recommend this product. It&#x27;s a pity as it once was a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s super easy for a beginner and the quality of the hard wax far less messy and faster than working with strips (not to mention much cheaper than the salon). The only downside is that you will find yourself reheating the container often if you have a lot of work to do because it&#x27;s sitting out at room temperature and hardens. I recommend getting one of those little pads that you plug in to keep your coffee warm and setting it on there. Other than that I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brazilian waxing kit.  Gives great results and easy to do.  DON&#x27;T forget to apply the oil first.  And be prepared for the pain, just remember, it only hurts for a moment ;-)</li>
            <li> Best wax I have ever found. it won&#x27;t burn you and it works very well. I only use on my legs tho.</li>
            <li> this wax works very good and the price was even better. I liked the fact that it was three separate jars. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this product and love it.  I do recommend you put the oil on  before putting the wax on.. lol  works much better..</li>
            <li> It was extremely messy. The heating guide didn&#x27;t work for me. I put it in the microwave for 60 seconds and it was gushy in the middle, but rock hard on the outside. After heating it for another minute trying to get it to all melt down, I took it out and it was so hot that dropped it and it spilled all over my feet and oven. When I finally got to the waxing part it hurt way more than expected, and it didn&#x27;t even remove the hair completely.I found myself having to shave over certain areas the wax didn&#x27;t fully get. It got so painful I eventually stopped and just shaved the rest. It also cooled EXTREMELY fast. I had to reheat the wax four times and I only got about half way done before just throwing the rest of the wax and shaving the rest.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 0 stars if I could.  First, the wax takes way longer to heat up then the instructions state.  Second, that oil crap that&#x27;s included does absolutely nothing to make the wax adhere to the hair at all ( I tried a small amount, medium amount, and large amount and the wax was still did not want to stick to the hair. And last, but not least, this wax breaks.  In other words, I spent the majority of the time picking out pieces of wax from my crotch because every pull left some wax behind.  This was a total waste of time and money.  I definitely do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I purchase and I have been using it for years without any problems. One jar is enough for a full wax job if you recycle the beginning pieces which I tend to do. Then when I am all done, it all goes in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product I love and I have used it on a few other people too. The best out there.</li>
            <li> First off, the wax works well and removes hair with very few left behind.  Unfortunately you need to have a piece of the wax not on a spot with hair so you have something to grab onto before pulling.  Otherwise you are slowly pulling out hair in tender areas. No good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest using a mug warmer with this as the wax does cool somewhat quickly (by design I think).  If you will be waxing anything more than a tiny area I would suggest using cloth strips as this wax will tear if the area you are trying to remove is too large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it has to do with this specific product, but trying to DIY a wax session at home ranks as one of the worst decisions I&#x27;ve made in a long time. The little cups are easy to use, but the wax does cool and become too thick to use pretty quickly (unless you follow the advice of one of the other commenters here and keep the jar on a mug warmer  - that did help!). All I can say about the rest of the experience is OW. I&#x27;ve had waxes before and never experienced that level of pain. Maybe I&#x27;m just a wimp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wax since 2000 and will continue to use this wax.  It&#x27;s the only one that works for me - love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product to wax my armpits myself.  I took Tylenol and even used a numbing cream the first time I used it.  It still hurt a bit.  The process took me an hour to do.  I waxed yesterday without the meds (forgot) and used plenty of the oil that comes in the box.  I left the wax on for a shorter time and it still worked well.  You have to be flexible to do it yourself, but you&#x27;ll figure out how to do it.  No pain this time, and it only took me 30 minutes.  I may try my bikini now that I have it figured out!</li>
            <li> There is definitely a difference between this formula and the other ones for other parts of your body. This one seems to not get your skin as much, and it&#x27;s significantly easier to pull out the hair....from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I can only get over the part where I wax myself.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I use it on my face and it works great.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hard wax.  It&#x27;s easy to use, clean up is a breeze, and it&#x27;s one of the lesser painful waxes out there (not pain-free).  The oil included in the kit definitely helps with the pain and the clean-up.  A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It will be likely painful; just accept that.  Everyone has their own pain tolerance, and this is a sensitive area, so don&#x27;t read other reviews saying it is &amp;#34;pain-free&amp;#34; and think it will be for you too.  Maybe you will get lucky and it will be, but likely there will be some pain.  Put on the oil that is included first, and this helps to make it less painful when you pull the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Do not over-melt the wax.  If it&#x27;s to the consistency of broth, you&#x27;ve overheated it.  If this happens, just let it set in room temp and solidify a bit.  The consistency for best results will be like honey.  Any thinner and you will probably get first or second degree burns; the temperature of hard wax melted to that point is going to burn you and once you put it on, it has to sit and solidify before you can pull it off...thus you will damage your skin.  So seriously, don&#x27;t do this.  Any thicker and the wax isn&#x27;t going to stick as well to the hairs and won&#x27;t pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Start with a small area...1x1 inch or 2x1 inch.  If you go any larger it becomes a bit more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t purchase this if you&#x27;ve ever had a professional wax and you prefer soft wax.  This is not the same, and from my experience, those who prefer soft wax will not like hard wax and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Make sure your hair is grown out about 1/4 inch or so.  If it&#x27;s too short, the wax isn&#x27;t going to pull it out.  If it&#x27;s too long, same situation.  Trial and error will kind of help you out because it will vary by how course or fine your hair is, but this is a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. As you may have guessed, the closer you get to more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, the more painful it is likely to be.  If youare a first time waxer, I would highly recommend to take little chunks and don&#x27;t get too close the first time just so you can gauge how it will be for you.  I&#x27;ve found my personal line that I won&#x27;t cross with a waxing kit.</li>
            <li> For the price that I was paying at Sally Beauty supplies for just 3 of the Brazzillian wax, I pay just $3 more, and get 6.  It is the same wax, and you can not beat that with a stick.</li>
            <li> Tried product multiple times thinking maybe i was doing it wrong. But after carefully rereading instructions and watching tutorials online I still could not get the product to work</li>
            <li> Been buying this for years! Saves me time and money... As salon visits get expensive. This wax is easy to use and does a great job!</li>
            <li> My favorite.  I have medium course dark hair and I have been using this wax for many years.  I was sad that they don&#x27;t carry it in my local stores but glad to find it on Amazon.  It is the only over the counter wax that works for me.  You apply it and it should harden a bit (like soften toostie roll) then remove.  It should come with an oil to help from sticking to your skin. Without the oil it does not work properly and sticks painfully.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the oil in the box before starting. It&#x27;s works very well and I would use small patches or strips so it&#x27;s not so painful. You do get used to it just like plucking your eyebrows. Just heat and lay it on while it&#x27;s warm..not hot..wait a little, then pull per the instructions..not pulling up but pulling back</li>
            <li> I like this wax. I am in healthcare and heard from someone that this is used in the Operating Rppm?  No idea if that is true or not, but I thought I would try it since GOING to get waxed was getting a bit expensive. It does a good job!  ALTHOUGH, I found that I still like to use muslin (?? spelling??) strips with wax.  I dont/didnt like to just peel this stuff off - I found it didnt like to all come off. WITH the strips - no problem!</li>
            <li> Between the SurgiWax brand and Nads, this is my preferred product. Nads left more of a tacky residue behind and was a bit harder to clean up. The Nads product boasted having a pleasant mango or similar tropical fragrance- but I didn&#x27;t find that accurate. It didn&#x27;t smell very good and didn&#x27;t grip the hair as well...requiring several repeats to the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SurgiWax heats and mixes well. This time, and to save time on re-ordering, I purchased the 3 box set. The caps were VERY difficult to remove on my batch, so I resorted to heating them gently in the microwave for about 30 seconds. They loosened up after this, but still required a bit of prying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my microwave, I can get the SurgiWax melted down to a workable consistency in about 60 seconds. Each box contained two wood spatula sticks, an instruction guide and small vial of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely takes a few tries to get the hang of doing your own waxing- the key is to get the wax thin enough to get down to the skin, hold the skin taut and tear strips off swiftly AGAINST the grain of growth. There are numbing creams (lidocaine/prilocaine) that can be used beforehand (usually a half hour to an hour prior) to ease the pain a bit. But I&#x27;ll be honest with you- this hurt like a #%#$@! the first few times. It will take a few sessions of doing this until you get the hang of it. You may experience moments of questioning your sanity when pulling the wax strips off, cursing them when you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a good mirror. A warm shower beforehand helps. Don&#x27;t do this close to the time of your period when skin can be more sensitive in general. I&#x27;ve found the product stays in a melted state long enough for me to work for several minutes before requiring reheating. In the end, it does the dreadful deed just fine.</li>
            <li> It was my first time waxing and I was a little worried. I was surprised at how clear the instruction was and it helped a lot. However, it was difficult to maintain the right temperature as I waxed over a period of time. I do not like that I have to reheat again and again. When the wax was not heated at the right temperature and liquid form, it would not wax properly and that hurt my skin. Overall, I think it is a good product. I just wish I know how to maintain the temperature and liquid form to make the waxing process easier.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best brazilian waxing kit. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and would recommend it. Gives great results and easy to do. Its much better than the wax with fabric. The pain is minimal and it requires minimal clean up, just don&#x27;t forget to apply the oil first.</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible, horrible.. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a lot of research. Really good buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time waxing brazilian and I did it myself. It&#x27;s doable, but I HIGHLY recommend going somewhere and getting it done professionally the first time. Doing it by yourself takes forever and it really hurts. I was only able to do the very front part. It hurt too much to get down into the really sensitive areas. I just did my second waxing on my own and it was LOADS easier. It certainly was no where near as painful and a lot quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the majority of the hairs, but it does miss a few here and there (which depends on how long you let the hair grow out). The stray hairs can just be plucked out with tweezers, which doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as it sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to scrub and clean the area before beginning! It also helps to take ibuprofen or some sort of pain medication an hour or so before you start waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to those who give this a go!</li>
            <li> This product does a very good job; although once used it leaves the container messy, it removes the hair painlessly.</li>
            <li> This is great for any part of your body. I mainly use it on my face.(It&#x27;s more economical,then buying the facial wax and works the same.) The hair just lifts right off after putting on the oil and wax. If your like me and have to wax often and dread doing it, this is the wax for you. Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I got this one bcs was not able to find one i was usually using. After trying it - I&#x27;m in love with it! I have NO MORE bikini hair at all PLUS it didn&#x27;t hurt. I think the oil that comes with wax makes it pull only hair but no skin. I&#x27;m about to order some more packages together with Surgi wax for facial hair....</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product ive used when i decided to do my waxing at home. I live in NYC and ive spent anywhere from $40-$75 on a brazilian wax. I used it for the second time yesterday and it was wayyyyy better than the first time. It was easier and since i know what to expect, the process was faster. The first time i used it, it took me a while because it hurt and i was making a mess. The second time around, i felt more at ease and i hardly made a mess. the only thing i DONT like about this is that it doesnt come with a warmer, so i had to keep going to the microwave to heat it up when it got hard which was annoying. other than that, i plan on using this wax for a very long time!! ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product, for a lot cheaper than the price on here at Sally&#x27;s. I had high hopes for it, really I did. I read the instructions and tried it out. At first, its very difficult to get it to completely melt. I had to reheat it once or twice more to get it to a liquid consistency as recommended. I did what it said and the product didn&#x27;t remove as much hair as I wanted or it purported itself to be able to. Plus, it seemed to remove a layer of skin along with it! It got stuck and wouldn&#x27;t peel off and I thought baby oil or washing it off would work.. Big mistake. Those made it an even gooier mess, so do not try those things to remove it. Believe it or not, Goo Gone removed a little and it didn&#x27;t hurt my skin as I thought it would (but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that to others). I will not try this again and am back to shaving. Schick, you&#x27;ve kept a customer.</li>
            <li> This product is a definite keeper. No one sells this anymore in Georgia (trust me, I checked-Surgi doesn&#x27;t even know) and no other product removes hair as quickly and completely. I tried other things for 2 months and caved in to Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did though! Only people who wax could truly understand the frustration.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product i&#x27;ve ever tried,itwas messy and my hair grew in three days after i used this don&#x27;t buy this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, i&#x27;m really mad cuz i bought 3 boxes.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.  It works well, it&#x27;s cheap and the packaging is great.  The container is convenient in that it&#x27;s small, has a cover and a comfortable little handle.  Just pop it in the microwave.  the product works and its much much cheaper than going to the salon or even purchasing Bliss&#x27; at home kit (which i find the container to be bulky and it does not have a cover).  One jar of this stuff was enough to give myself a brazilian with some left over to spare for underarms.  Also note, this was my first time waxing myself so i dropped alot of wax.  All in all, i really love this product and will continue to order this via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Difficult to heat in microwave and instructions are incorrect.  Very painful to use. Spend the money and buy the GIGI Brazilian Hard Wax kit instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s so convenient and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s very easy to use. It&#x27;s not messy and it doesn&#x27;t require those little strips I can&#x27;t find anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about this product is that the heating directions are a little off.</li>
            <li> I only use this product when I&#x27;m not in the mood to spend the money on a good wax. The consistency is not great but it gets the job done. My biggest gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t lift good in the harder to reach (oh so tender) areas. I also noticed more ingrowns with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. Buy Moom instead.</li>
            <li> This wax has made hair removal so much easier and nearly pain-free. I used to use the Sally Hansen kit, but when the price went up to $12 per bottle at the drugstore, I couldn&#x27;t really justify spending that much on a personal grooming product that I still had to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is a much better value and I&#x27;ve found the quality is better too. You might have to let it cool a little bit right out of the microwave, but once it&#x27;s a comfortable temperature it stays liquid for a very long time so you don&#x27;t need to reheat. The Sally Hansen wax used to get dry and hard very quickly, which meant that you couldn&#x27;t pull a strip off in one motion and had to get it off crumble by crumble.  This wax has a much better consistency. I recommend putting on a thick coat of wax and letting it dry about 10-15 seconds before pulling it off so that it&#x27;s malleable but not sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this wax!!  It beats paying $80 to get a Brazilian wax at the salon.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to walk Ulta yesterday to see this product priced so cheaply. It was $5, I should have known better. Although I read the reviews before using this wax. I read more positive than negative and quickly became optimistic. That was my mistake again... This product doesn&#x27;t even melt like it suppose to when you warm it up in the microwave for 60seconds as directed... Once you apply the wax, the wax is very sticky and messy. Lastly, the wax doesn&#x27;t come off as simple and neatly at the salon. Using the oil before waxing was a huge mistake. The wax got really hard and couldn&#x27;t peel off my skin... Even when I used powder before waxing, it was a nightmare to remove... I returned this awful product to Ulta. The only reason why I resorted to self waxing cause I can&#x27;t afford to keep going to salon. It has been 2months since my last full body waxing:( So ladies save your money and let the professionals do it...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for so long and I like it because I do not react to any skin issues using it - the results are long lasting and effective - for those who are sensitive to chemical hair removal or break out from other wax formulas should try this brand - I like the convenience of using the microwave for melting the wax an the container is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the five star reviews.  I would add, though, that if you use muslin strips, it makes it a lot easier.  You can totally do it without the strips, but you do experience pain as you try to peel up enough of the wax edge in order to pull of the wax.  If you put a muslin strip right over the hot wax when you apply the was, you don&#x27;t have to do the \\&quot;peel up\\&quot; process- you just rip it off.  A few times, I let the wax dry a little too much and then trying to get your fingers under the was is really hard and painful.  With the muslin, again, just rip and off it goes.  I also used this wax (with muslin strips) for under my arms.  It totally worked- fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I only like waxing kits that they DO NOT come with strips and it could be warmed in microwave.  This surgi wax product does that.  I am happy with this product and I will recommend it to people who are looking for microwaveale waxes WITHOUT STRIPS.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my legs, because the formula is superior to the regular Surgi-Wax. This wax seems to hit the sweet spot of cost, pliability, and grip. Unlike Sally Hansen, it doesn&#x27;t become brittle as soon as it is cool enough to touch. Unlike Gigi, it doesn&#x27;t break the bank. The oil seems like it should make the wax slip off the hair, but thankfully, it seems to help mostly with not sticking little extra bits to the skin. I have gorilla-like amounts of leg hair, and can just barely do my legs in 2 boxes (I prefer to use 3), so if you are just waxing your \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; area, 1 box should last you several applications.  Here&#x27;s a helpful tip: for sensitive areas, applying two or three coats of Oragel (or a generic equivalent) 20% lidocaine gel as a numbing agent two minutes before the wax works wonders for lessening the pain. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do my bikini line otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is my go to wax. I have found it much less expensive elsewhere. Very easy to use and relatively painless! Use with Gigi pre-explication oil and wax off.</li>
            <li> This product is the only wax in the United States that in near as good as the south american waxes - mess free! the oil that comes with it helps a lot too... Fast waxing! gone in 20 minutes! (after mastering the technique)</li>
            <li> I was please by the short amount of time that it took to get to my house.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving the bikini area and have been professionally waxed numerous times.  I tried Surgi Wax and it was fairly easy to use (a little mess...but it is wax) and yes, it does hurt but not as much as I though it would.  The 2nd time I waxed I got wax stuck to my skin (even though I used the oil) and it didn&#x27;t come off for about 2 days.  Fortunately it did not irritate my skin at all.  Considering the price per waxing at home compared to having it done at a spa, I think it&#x27;s worth the self-inflicted pain for so much cheaper vs the professional inflicted pain for considerably more money. I will continue to use the product and grimace once a month while I pull my hair out by the roots.  Then I will smile at the nice smooth results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 6 years now and I absolutely love it. At first it was annoying that I had to walk back and forth to the microwave... then I pulled the microwave out of the kitchen and put it in my room... Now, and this is a great tip ladies, I use a candle warmer to heat the wax. I set it up at least a couple of hours ahead of time and let it warm and then shut it off after I&#x27;m done. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn you and saves multiple trips. Don&#x27;t let it sit overnight though... it seems to cook the wax and make it more brittle when you try to use it. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Started buying this wax when they sold it in wal-mart. Its the only wax that removes everything and is soooo easy to use with no strips! When wal-mart stopped having it in stock I was really upset til i found it here on amazon, and CHEAPER! i am happy again!:)</li>
            <li> This wax is great and does its job! Can&#x27;t complain about the price--3 jars for under $20 bucks--compared to how much brazilian wax costs! They have clear instructions on how to use it. However, since... it is for down there... I wouldn&#x27;t advise to DIY brazilian wax if you have never gotten one done before. Go get one done professionally first so you get a first hand experience on how they do it... THEN do it yourself. I highly recommend this!! I use this for my underarms and legs too! Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered that waxing my armpits is far superior to shaving.  I had previously used a different kind of Surgi Wax, but had some problems with mess and sticking.  This 3pack for Brazilian is great because its cheap, and it comes with the oil to use beforehand.  Its super easy to do my pits now, and relatively mess-free. Yay!</li>
            <li> I must preface this by saying that I&#x27;ve had a Brazilian wax done by a professional for the last 2 years. I toyed with doing this at home, and even ordered this product once and returned it without opening because I psyched myself out of it. However with the job situation being somewhat shaky, I decided I HAD to cut back, and my boyfriend REALLY enjoys the clean look of the Brazilian. So I ordered this again, not without a small amount of trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally blown away by how simple this is! I sat on the bed (on a towel) to do this, and kept the jar on a candle warmer after warming it in the microwave (it took a full 2 minutes to heat up in my small microwave). I followed the instructions exactly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cut hair to 1/4 inch length&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash the area with soap and water and dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;3. Generously apply the provided oil (super important!).&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply the wax in small patches, and allow to dry for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;5. Flip up one end of the wax and pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole process took me about 45 minutes for my very first try. Some things to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is probably not for someone who has never waxed before. I&#x27;m used to waxing and have a high tolerance for pain. This doesn&#x27;t really hurt to me...just like ripping a band-aid off. However that will not be the case for a first-timer, I am quite sure.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wax gets brittle and hard to remove if you leave it on longer than one minute.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can ball up the just-used wax and use it to help remove any stubborn wax that has been left behind (like you do with tape or a sticker to get sticky residue off).&lt;br /&gt;4. This stuff will definitely stick to your nails! I may try using gloves next time. However, after I showered and exfoliated the area (exfoliating afterwards is very important to avoid ingrown hairs), I applied more of the oil to the area, and also rubbed some into my hands. Voila! The wax came right off my nails!&lt;br /&gt;5. You MAY be able to get more than one application per jar, but I only had about 1/4 of the jar left and just threw the remainder away. Next time I will plan to do my legs and underarms at the same time, but I had recently shaved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thrilled that I will be able to maintain my tidy look with such an inexpensive option. A Brazilian is $60 in my area, but this is less than $5 an application! I highly recommend this product and will now have it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m going to see if I can get my boyfriend to let me use it on him! &amp;lt;evil grin&gt;ion per jar, but I only had about 1/4 of the jar left and just threw the remainder away.

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was brave enough to try this.  I have never waxed my personal parts-at home or at a salon.  I&#x27;ve just been using a trimmer for a number of years.  I have an epilady that I use on my legs which resembles a shaver, but it pulls the hair out so the results last a while and hair comes back soft.  I tried it on my nether parts and it is scary because skin can become caught if you aren&#x27;t careful.  When I was done I liked the results, but knew that wasn&#x27;t the best method so I came to buy this surgi wax after reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;FYI- I am not going to remove everything.  The pre-puberty look has never been one I wanted to return to, but I do like the idea of being nearly hair free lower down for cleanliness and maybe to encourage my husband to spend more time there.  I tried a quick test on the knee which didn&#x27;t even hurt and proceeded to start on a side just about level to the clit.  Oh my.  I nearly packed up after that first one.  I ventured a bit lower and found that it did not hurt much at all.  The hair was much shorter and of course less dense so that made a big difference.  When I ventured back up on the other side it was another painful experience.  I actually saw one drop of blood on that side, but it felt like it should be much more.  I also used a bit of topical lidocaine 30 min. before that either didn&#x27;t help in the upper regions or I didn&#x27;t apply enough there.  I am delighted with the work I was able to accomplish in the lower areas.  I may narrow my triangle a bit on a future try after trimming real short.  One negative is having to get up from my barricaded room to warm up the wax in the micro many times.  I even brought the coffee pot warmer in my room to try to keep the wax warm, but I still needed to micro many times.  I will look to see if there is a warmer that will work with this. This little adventure took me at least 2.5 hours.  My husband called me and asked me what I was doing.  I told him I was waxing myself and with the bad reception it took him a while to understand I was probably waxing some private parts. He has never voiced a preference, but he had a silly grin on his face when he came home.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax ever. Too bad they discontinued it at Ulta and now I can only get it on amazon. No other wax works as well as this one</li>
            <li> The epilation oil containers all spilled during transit. So I used it without the oil and that was a big mistake. It&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m still trying to get off wax. I could use another type of oil but in all honesty, I don&#x27;t think this is for me as it requires more skill and experience-both of which I don&#x27;t have. I need the wax with the application strips.</li>
            <li> Awful, what a scam! Never gets the appropiate consistence after following the instructions to heat it. So I had to add more time and more time.... At the end when was like &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; that crap just made a mess. I don&#x27;t trush the other reviews posted here saying that this is a great product, what a liers! This is the worst thing to wax your bikini ever! I hate it and I wanna file a complaint. Unfortunately my time to return the iteme expired yesterday (how convenient for the seller). I feel 100% scamed!</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s been using this was for MANY MANY years.  Kind of a lost art for my generation (end of the baby boomers) but Mom swears by it.</li>
            <li> Can not find it in the stores where I am. LOVE this wax. It is salon quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this wax!! It is hard to find it in local retail stores anymore. I will skeptical on ordering, not knowing if it was going to be outdated. I received it in a very short time and it was in great condition.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my first try at at-home waxing and it worked great!  It was pretty easy to use once I got the hang of it-a bit messy at first. It took out the thicker hairs really well but didn&#x27;t work so well on the finer hair on my thigh. It was actually much less painful that going to a pro because I did smaller patches at a time.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products for removing hair, including various wax kits from other brands, but this is the only one I love and the only one I unreservedly recommend!! It is so gentle, and best of all....easy!! Microwave, spread it on, rip it off, done. I use it for upper lip waxing, as well.</li>
            <li> okay I admit this is the first time I tried waxing. After 4 attempts I finally gave up on this product. First off, the grip is not strong enough to pull off all the hair once, or twice, or three times! Second it hurts as hell and ice pack didn&#x27;t even help. Last but not the least, no matter how much prep oil you put on your skin, the wax is going to leave traces on you because of the hair that is supposed to be gone now is still there, with wax on it! I&#x27;ll be happy to pay extra to get it professionally done in a salon.</li>
            <li> I use this product to wax my friends and family.  It is a great product, easy to use and we actually use it for facial and underarm waxing although it is indicated otherwise....it works great!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I can no longer find anywhere in stores, so I was happy to find this 3-pack.  I&#x27;ve been either getting brazilians or doing my own for 12 years, and when I don&#x27;t want to pay someone to do it for me, this is the only viable alternative.  It&#x27;s easy to tell when the wax is too hot to apply (burns down there &#x3D; ouch!), and it removes hair really well -- even when it&#x27;s on the shorter side -- whether or not I prep with the azulene oil (included).  If you don&#x27;t mind the ick factor (and I don&#x27;t), you can re-use each tub two or three times, making this SO much more economical than paying a pro!  It&#x27;s barely sticky when you&#x27;re done, unlike those nasty soft waxes with muslin strips.  Definitely a bathromm cabinet staple!  I use PFB Vanish along with the surgi-wax to prevent ingrowns with excellent results.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this wax and my first amazon review.      It&#x27;s only messy if you let it be. I find it helpful to get a big trash bag and lay it out to sit on and wax, so if it drips, you won&#x27;t be making a mess in your house.  Warm it if until it is runny and stringy so you don&#x27;t have to apply a thick layer. Don&#x27;t put a lot of oil because the wax won&#x27;t adhere well to the hair.  If you think you put too much, get a piece of notebook/computer paper and dab a bit, then rub evenly with your fingers to redistribute the oil evenly again.  It works really well for the underarms and bikini areas.    Get this if you can tolerate mild-moderate pain.  Of course some areas hurt more than other, but just woman up and deal with it if you don&#x27;t want to see hair in that area for 2+ weeks. What works best for me is trim the area to about 1/4\\&quot;, the longer hair you have, the more it hurts. I would say this stuff for bikini area is at worst on a pain scale of 3.5 out of 10, 10 being mauled by a bear while screaming for life. The pain only exist when you are ripping the strip, which should only last at most 3 seconds. Get a good rip, tighten the skin, and rip it fasssst!</li>
            <li> I decided to start waxing my bikini area because after shaving I would get these horrible red bumps and ingrown hairs. So shaving for me caused more problems than it solved. I decided to try this wax after reading the reviews and I gotta say, I thought the pain would be horrible. But it wasn&#x27;t really that bad. Let me say why I thought the pain would be horrible, it wasn&#x27;t because of any reviews on this product. Nope it is all about what others have told me, what I&#x27;ve seen on tv and I tried Nads when it came out, OUCH! I should have tried this a long time ago. I love the oil that comes with it, it really makes the wax peel off easier. I highly recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I was pretty excited to get started...and all of my boxes (3-pack) are missing the oil. Now not only can I not try this product, but I have to go through the hassle of returning it because a fairly vital (according to the other reviewers...) part is missing. Sad :(</li>
            <li> I have been using Surgi Wax for so long that I cannot remember not using it. I just put some baby powder on my legs, make sure the wax has cooled a little (so it is not dripping from the stick) spread the wax on.. not too thin.. not too thick. You want the wax to start to harden just a little, so it is still plyable. And pull. TADA.. no hair. It&#x27;s the greatest! I even do under my arms! Don&#x27;t worry, it barely hurts and it is so worth it. I hardly have any hair any more. I get it sent to me every other month.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else - if you&#x27;ve never waxed before, a little scary at first, but definitely prefer this over the wax and fabric technique.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff as much as a person can like something that is basically used for torture. This is great priced wax. I refuse to go to a salon or spa to have someone else wax my bikini area so this makes a great kit for all you at home users. I don&#x27;t care what some people say, (perhaps they are cyborgs?), ripping out hair down there hurts like mess but this stuff is efficient and gets most of the hair the first time. I usually trim the intended area down fairly low then apply the oil and wax. No cloth strips needed  which means you don&#x27;t worry about having too much wax and no way to yank it off. I usually wax between my eyebrows while the wax is still hot and it works great there too. My wax always seems to take a little longer to heat than the instructions say but it stays warm plenty of time to wax um... where ever. I usually get around 3-4 uses out of it which gets me through all of swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> I have been using Surgi Wax for over 8 years now and I have still yet to find something better.  I even use this to wax my eyebrows. This product is NOT for people with low pain tolerance. Highly recommend for anyone looking to save money on salon waxing services and can handle some pain.  Excelent for bikini wax, brazilian, eyebrows, lip &amp; chin.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  We&#x27;re saving a lot of money now that we can &#x27;clear the forest&#x27; in-house instead of at a salon. (My husband&#x27;s technique still needs some work, but at least he&#x27;s willing to continue practicing.)  Smells nice, too.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> it works. I use it with wax strips though.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.  I use many others &amp;  the strips just don&#x27;t work for me but this does.  I been buying this product for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now and am really impressed with it.  First time I purchased I tried it for both my under arms and bikini area.  It worked amazing on the underarms (don&#x27;t forget the oil and make sure its hot when applying) and now its all I ever use with my under arms.  The bikini area hurt like a B (not to a fault of the product) so never attempted again.  Overall definitely recommend the product.  It is SO simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. Been buying it for years. Does the job and does it well.</li>
            <li> Best hard wax for bikini area. Used as directed, it comes off easily and leaves the skin bare and soft. I&#x27;ve used this wax for many years. Amazon is the only supplier I&#x27;ve found over the past few year. Great value!</li>
            <li> I finally got the nerve to try this product for my first Brazilian wax ever.  First time users- I advise you to go to youtube.com and type in Brazilian tuturial: how to use hard wax.  This lady teaches you a BRILLIANT trick on how to \\&quot;flick\\&quot; the wax to get it ready to pull up.  The first time I tried (before I watched the youtube video) I had no idea how to get ahold of it and I ended up with a mess.  I wanted to quit and throw it away, but I got on youtube and found that very very helpful video. (the video only shows a woman&#x27;s leg, btw).  This product works, that&#x27;s for sure.  But it can take some time getting used to.  Don&#x27;t give up! :-)</li>
            <li> The wax solidify fast. It is hard to supply on skin uniformly, because it is very sticky. Probably because I didn&#x27;t use it properly, I feel very painful when pull the wax off (I made my skin taut..)</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for underarms.  It works great.  In ten minutes I can be completely finished and after the first use you&#x27;ll immediately see how much finer and how much less hair grows back.  All the local stores no longer carry this brand for some reason but it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon anyway.  Forget those strips!  This is so much easier and in my opinion less painful.</li>
            <li> AHHhHHHH&lt;br /&gt;AHHHHHHHHHH&lt;br /&gt;OWWWWW&lt;br /&gt;OOOOOOWWWWWWW IT HURTS IT REALLY HURTS&lt;br /&gt;OW!!! ! !&lt;br /&gt;NO HAIR REMOVED&lt;br /&gt;oWWWWW!! Ow! ahh! AHHH! ah</li>
            <li> I have been using the Brazilian Waxing Kit by Surgi Wax since 2005. It is the only waxing kit that I found to be convenient, effective, and simple. There are no strips so you only have 3 pieces to work with. The spatula, oil and wax. It is microwavable so no special appliances to buy. The only thing is that yes it is painful because you are waxing yourself. Yet it has gotten easier for me over the years and now I can wax in about an hour. The results are amazing. The oil is very important though because if you do not use it the wax will stick to your skin. I will never change the wax that I use because it is easy and effective. When you first start to use it, you will most likely make a huge mess due to the fact that you don&#x27;t know the nature of the wax yet. Once you get used to it though you don&#x27;t make a mess anymore. It is an art after all. I would recommend that you buy it.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I like because it takes out the hair from the root.&lt;br /&gt;- Its kind of cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It gets too messy!!!&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely a bit painful and sometimes it gets too hard to take it out and breaks off, leaves bits and pieces :(&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this item, I use to but it at any pharmacy but now only amazon and a a few more websites sell them. I need it very fast and I got like the next day, so I was happy about that. And I think is cheaper on amazon.com!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gone through a full jar and a then some (which gave me about 2 brazilian waxes) and I have to say, as a newcomer in self waxing, the product exceeded my expectations.  First, the application is straight forward.  They provide you a popsicle stick-ish applier and a small jar of pre-waxing oil (which is more than enough unless your looking to deep fry something) for every jar of wax. You then just have to heat up the wax for 30 sec or so in the microwave and when its warm (but NOT scorching hot) you apply a decent but not too thick layer to the needed area.  Wait to cool.  Then rip.  Easy, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the pain, I&#x27;ve found that creating tension or scretching the area out when you pull helps with the pain (as does applied pressure afterwards).  Also beware, that it is messy (lay something underneath you but NO CLOTH/TOWEL because the wax will stick like no other!) and if your slow like me you will have to reheat the jar once or twice (which is inconvenient esp when you have roomates....awwkward).  That aside, great solid no frills product, reasonably priced.  Would buy again, after I get through my 2 other jars!</li>
            <li> not it all what it  claims it does . very  difficult, to used</li>
            <li> This is the best bikini wax I have ever found.  I love that I can do whenever I want - it&#x27;s so easy - and not painful!  A helpful hint - leave a little thicker edge to be able to pull from, hold skin firm, take a big inhale, then yank as you exhale - honestly  it helps!</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t go and get a brazilian wax, this is my go to wax. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> please never discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a surprise for my soon to be husband for our wedding night. I had never waxed before, so I was slightly terrified. BUT this product was so easy to use. I followed the directions and had no issues, except for the pain, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be. I ended up with great results, and most importantly my new husband LOVED it! I tried to save a little money the next time around and buy the Sally Henson kit from my local CVS, and I will NEVER do that again! It was horribly messy, and didn&#x27;t even get all the hair, so I ended up re-waxing a few areas. I gave up about a third of the way through and just decided to shave until I could get back to the store that sells Surgi. I will spend the extra money to make sure I get it done right! All in all, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other kind of waxing kit other than Surgi! Although I would suggest getting a few more sticks bc the two didn&#x27;t seem enough for me. Then again, I could be putting on too much wax.</li>
            <li> Read directions carefully and the product will work somewhat. I pretty much just didn&#x27;t like the overall experience with it and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hurts like a brat and still misses hair. Since I&#x27;m still new to home waxing it&#x27;s probably just me. In my microwave, which isn&#x27;t older than 4-5 years, doesn&#x27;t quite melt the wax in order to use it on myself with the suggested time. Also, not enough oil! I&#x27;m not even halfway through the first and my oil is just about gone. I would buy again though, if I ever wanted to.</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well.  It is kind of messy and really scary trying to use it for the first time. Make sure you have nothing around that you love....carpet, rugs, clothes, towels etc.  Also, prepare to use the tweezers because it most likely will not remove all hair.</li>
            <li> The results depend on how well you apply it, but it works very well, just make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t get too cold because it will be harder to apply and remove. Overall, if you have the patience, you can get professional result for a tenth of the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, I really like it and it is very good quality. I will keep purshising in the future for me and my daugther</li>
            <li> jesus, unless youre into S&amp;M, dont buy this, just go to a salon and get it done professionally.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax EVER!! No strips just the wax that hardens and you pull off.</li>
            <li> Very easy and save you lots of money!  I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this wax! I have only used for arm pits but can tell it&#x27;s very good quality wax and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just love this wax.  Have been giving myself Brazilians for years using it, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries and ~15 minutes to figure out the ropes of it but once I did, it works beautifully. Minimal pain. Let it sit for about 5 minutes after taking it out of the microwave. The application is much easier (a bit gooey) than just complete liquid.</li>
            <li> I have tried many a wax and this is by far the best. This is the only wax that has actually been able to remove most or all hair I apply it to in one pull. Other types of wax just sit on the hair when you apply, and when you want to remove the hair, the wax gets streachy, pulls the hair withour removing or does nothing. This wax surrounds the hair and makes the pulling/removal really easy.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my method.&lt;br /&gt;-sit on a towel, cloth or something flat (magazine) to protect the flooring you are sitting on&lt;br /&gt;-use the oil to pretare the skin. Too much oil will make it hard for the wax to do it&#x27;s job so just enough to cover the area.&lt;br /&gt;- heat the wax until you see it a bit runny. Too liquidy and it will be really really hot on your skin, so be careful. Not hot enough and you will end up using way more wax than you need and may have to redo the area.&lt;br /&gt;-I apply the wax against the hair growth (not in teh same direction like the container advices)&lt;br /&gt;-let it sit there until you can touch the wax and it doesn&#x27;t stick to your fingers. Don&#x27;t let it sit too long because it will become britle.&lt;br /&gt;-I do small areas at a time. one half of one side, then the lower half, then the other side&#x27;s top half and then the other bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;I have twizers handy because after you wax, if there are some hairs still there, you can easyly take them out because the heat from the wax has opened the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and there you have it... perfect Brazilian wax at home...&lt;br /&gt;seriously the only wax ever to work as I expected it to work. I only use this now and I recommend it to anyone that will listen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how anyone can say this crap works. I followed the directions exactly, this isn&#x27;t rocket science.  The wax did not remove any hair.  maybe a couple I don&#x27;t know, but what a time consuming, sloppy mess for nothing!!!</li>
            <li> This wax definitely does the job but I have tried many hard waxes and this hard wax is definitely the stickiest and tackiest I&#x27;ve tried.  It takes a while for it to actually get hard, which can be hard when you&#x27;re in a rush.  That being said, it&#x27;s great value for the quantity you get (still haven&#x27;t finished my first box) and I&#x27;ll be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> For the die hard &amp;#34;do-it-yourselfer&amp;#34; this product is as good as it gets. The first time you wax your snatch it&#x27;s going to hurt like crazy no matter who does it! After that, it becomes less of an ordeal. Do it every three or four weeks, and apply it in thin (1mm) layers for the best results.</li>
            <li> this is a great product &amp; with that being said make sure that when you warm up the wax there is a whole in it so it can come out. we didn&#x27;t know this &amp; all there was in ours was a big bubble that never popped &amp; we had to pop it &amp; then the wax was so hot you had to let it cool down. but when it did cool down enought to use it works. altho beprepared to bite something or try to keep your mouth shut. cause when the wax gets pulled off it hurts like crazy &amp; the pain only last for a short time. If you can&#x27;t do it yourself or don&#x27;t want to get someone to help you. I had my husband help me cause i didn&#x27;t want to pull the wax myself. really easy &amp; works for awhile. you get enough product to last awhile.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t come with a Brazilian hottie to do the hair removal. For you ladies out there, your better off just going to an esthetician. Getting in the hard to reach places you have to be a contortionist.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Easy to use.  No messy wax strips.  Hair is removed with ease.  No need for expensive salon visits ever again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times but I had always purchased it at Wal-Mart. However, they no longer carry this product so I ordered it from here. My 3 box kit arrived but there is no oil in any of the three boxes so now I have to return it and try to find it from somewhere else. Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I like the results after using this product, it is easy to use. I would recommend the use of this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years (the regular and brazillian). I don&#x27;t really notice any difference for the regular and this one, so I actually use this on my face too and it works like a charm. Minimal pain and it gets virtually every hair at the root. When you rip the wax off, the wax looks like a little porcupine :)</li>
            <li> Prose&lt;br /&gt;. is simple to use&lt;br /&gt;. Removes the hair in one ripe.&lt;br /&gt;.stops ingrown hairs that you normally get form shaving&lt;br /&gt;. you can use any part of body leg under arms, and of course bikini</li>
            <li> I am 46 and have been waxing since I was twelve so I&#x27;d say I have a bit of experience. This wax is very easy to use (can be a little messy) and does a great job. It is almost dummy-proof. However. . . beware if you aren&#x27;t intending to go all bare and accidentally get it into hair you want to keep and you didn&#x27;t have the pre-wax oil there. Nowhere in the directions does it suggest how to get this wax out of hair you want should such a little accident occur. I had a little flub up with the spatula and got a blob in my little landing strip and omg I tried EVERYTHING imaginable to get it out. The oil it comes with, Jojoba oil, soap, shampoo, argan oil, and it just stayed put - an unbelievable sticky blobbed up mess. I couldn&#x27;t even just wax it off by adding a little fresh wax and smoothing it over to just remove it because without the pre-wax oil this stuff sticks like crazy glue to the hair AND the skin underneath. As long as you coat yourself in the oil it comes with this will never happen so make sure you put the oil all over, including in any hair you want to keep! Also, it took almost an half hour in the shower of painfully pulling and rolling it off my hair with shampoo to get it out. It turns to a melty sticky glob when combined with water. Otherwise it&#x27;s great. We are all human and make mistakes so learn from mine! I have so much experience and confidence waxing if this happened to me it could easily happen to a beginner so I hope this helps someone. :)</li>
            <li> I would rather do a bikini wax on myself than let someone else do it again, I was bruised and going to a professional was MORE PAIN and not to mention COSTLY than doing it yourself. I started using this product and can&#x27;t find it in my local Wal Mart anymore. I love this product. It is easy to use, there is alittle pain BUT it gets the job done results are baby soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Easy to use, cheap, does not hurt like normal waxing. I am first time wax user, the first time was terrible. It hurts, red bumps, but for the second and third time it did not hurt at all. I highly recommend this for people trying to wax the first time. Once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll be done in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The best wax you can use at home</li>
            <li> This product was very messy, took forever to heat up, and had to be applied many times. I would not recommend for any beginners or anyone who wants a easy and quick solution for hair removal. There are better and easier to use products.</li>
            <li> Just got these yesterday. Just had to try it on right away. Comes with 2 small, short popsicle sticks, and a really small bottle of pre-epilation oil. Order really was an order of 3 boxes. The jar does have a handle for when you&#x27;re heating it up in the microwave. Heated it in 15 second intervals as instructed in the box. Really was easy and not at all hard to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially got these for my underarms and it was one of the easiest waxing I have ever done. And it didn&#x27;t even hurt. It&#x27;s been a long, long while since I have waxed my underarms as I have been using the epilator since my last wax which was at least a year ago. I honestly thought I would be messing it up or that at the least it would hurt a lot. Naaaaaaaaaah. Got it wrong on all counts. Very easy and virtually painless. I used up half a jar for both my underarms but probably used more than I should have because each application was really thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, enough ramblings. Get this. I think you would be pleased and it&#x27;s very affordable as you get 3 boxes for the price of one jar on other brands. Very happy and will be buying more of this once I use the leftover jar &amp; the two unopened boxes.</li>
            <li> Best small area wax I&#x27;ve used yet. I&#x27;m going to keep buying these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of hard (stripless) wax for brazilians and underarm use.  This one is the least messy and easiest to use that I&#x27;ve found. I also have used Completely Bare, Sally Hansen, and Gigi.  For comparison purposes, I think the Completely Bare wax is more effective in that it grabs hair better and removes more hair per application, but it is extremely messy to use due to it&#x27;s thick taffy texture. It is also quite expensive.  Sally Hansen is thinner but not effective.  The Gigi hard wax for brazillians is very similar to this product in effectiveness and texture, but more expensive.  I will keep using Surgiwax for the time being!  It has a great texture (like cold honey? maybe?) and is very easy to work with.  It hardens quickly, so I work in small areas so I can pull fast.  As long as you time your pulls right (you want it to be just set) it is very effective for removing hair by the root.  Also, because it hardens quickly, you want to keep the jar warm or reheat to keep the sides from getting gunky while you&#x27;re working. I have never had any irritation from using this wax or the accompanying pre-oil (which I sometimes forget to use, but do like).</li>
            <li> work great and a good price too thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always suspicious of good reviews but this one is legit. It&#x27;s the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used (first wax ever, never got it done professionally) but I am really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing to know is that this product works and I&#x27;d go as far as to say that it works very well. If it&#x27;s your first time waxing or first self wax I would keep reading the rest of this, someone who knows about waxing could skip to the end but I&#x27;d recommend they read the microwave directions I have down below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you should know about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microwave: This wax melts very fast and you will have to reheat it multiple times. What I did and recommend, is to use this product somewhere where you are near a microwave so you don&#x27;t have to run back and forth between rooms to heat it back up. The microwave directions are a very general guideline, you will have to start on small settings and figure out what works best for your microwave. It melts from the middle so it might feel hard at the top but you have to keep poking at it and eventually it will cave in an melt into the rest of it. You want to melt the whole bottle, which will help it from harding as quickly, but be aware it melts from the middle and you can also push down the sides as you use it up so they don&#x27;t harden and mess with the overall consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique: I made some mistakes as it was my first time and they were painful so you want to head these warnings, especially if it is your first time self waxing. 1)Pay attention to the direction of hair growth and when you pull off you want to pull directly in the opposite direction of hair growth. Pulling up is very painful and can cause bleeding in sensitive areas. 2)Work in small areas, especially in the sensitive areas with thick/coarse hair. 3)Map out what hair is getting removed and break it up into smaller workable sections and then do those sections one by one. You can avoid some irritation by doing areas that aren&#x27;t right next to where you just waxed and if you go in there with no plan you will just get lost in the maze of hair like I did the first time and it will take longer. Helps to stretch the skin a lot and press down lightly on an area after you rip the strip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepration: Research all the preperation and aftercare you&#x27;ll need to do. It is a little more involved than I originally thought so you want to make sure you know what you&#x27;re getting into and how to do it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the main stuff you need to know. Overall, I am really happy with this product and I&#x27;ve bought a couple more of them already. After my first wax the hair took about 3 weeks to grow back and it came in much thinner (which I was pretty excited about because I have always shaved and everytime it feels like it comes back thicker and thicker). The second wax was much less painful, probably partially to do with improved technique and, unlike shaving where it starts growing back about as soon as you finish, everything is wonderfully smooth and stays smooth. I was looking for an alternative to shaving and found it. The price is great, it is a quality product. It grabs all the hairs and the only real concern I have is that, in the really sensitive areas, it has been healing a little funny for me but I can&#x27;t really attribute it to the wax for sure. I would just be really careful in the sensitive areas, work in small areas and stuff. I have really thick coarse hair in really sensitive areas built up from years of shaving so if it works for me it will work for anyone. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I admit that it might have been easier for me, because I have been going to the salon for this procedure for 2 or 3 years now, so the hair is much thinner by now, easier to pull off, and I am familiar with the procedure. But oh my God! I had no idea you can actually do it at home, and this will work! It&#x27;s as smooth as after salon! And you don&#x27;t have to schedule weeks in advance and pay a fortune!&lt;br /&gt;Applying the oil before waxing DEFINITELY makes a huge difference, so does taking the time, and not trying to pull too soon. I use tea tree oil after the procedure and for at least a week after the waxing, and it significantly reduces irritation and ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about as much time as it would if went to the salon, but just for a portion of the price! Maybe a little messier, but I am sure I will get better with practice.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Surgi product (the other one is facial hair bleaching cream), and I love it. Having the opportunity to buy a three-box pack also saves you money and trouble having to order it too often.</li>
            <li> The wax is not bad at all but if you apply it to thin it will not work, you kind of have to find that happy medium. If you are not good with pain i would not recommend you getting just the wax i would go for the strips instead.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good wax. I would recommend a mug warmer as  I kept having to run to the microwave. Also, if you&#x27;re not used to waxing or if you haven&#x27;t waxed in a while, I would recommend purchasing numbing cream. I used this was about 3 weeks ago, and the hair is just now starting to grow back in. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different waxes, and this one works the best for me.  There are lots of other good (long) reviews that give great tips, read those.  Here are a few of my bullets:&lt;br /&gt;- when you first start waxing, it hurts, no way to get around it, but will get better the more you do it.&lt;br /&gt;- i sit when waxing with a mirror propped up nice and close. I sit on a piece of newspaper, so cleanup is REALLY easy.&lt;br /&gt;- as recommended by someone else, the tea tree oil after, it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;- a glass of wine prior to waxing give you more courage to pull, and numbs it a bit  ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. Truly a great product. Very easy to use and you have to mess with those irritating strips and honey wax (which I never got to work on me). This is great for armpits too!</li>
            <li> Hurts, messy, not easy to use barley usable except for throwing out</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! The kit came with everything I needed and as someone who had never done a wax before I was very impressed. Thumbs up to this great product!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own Brazilian for years... I threw out my old warmer bc of the mess and have tried several different microwave ones- this is TERRIBLE- I had to go over each area many times and STILL wasn&#x27;t happy with the results. Gigi is much better both microwave and warmer</li>
            <li> So easy to use and has great results!</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with another Surgi kit and I used the other kit (bikini, body and legs) first. I tried it on my underarms and never had so much pain.  I am usually fine with pain and have been waxed before but when you have to continually grab another part of the wax because it will not rip off together, THAT HURTS.  It did do its job, it took the hair out, but was not worth a second try.  I sent it all back.  Ill stick to strips.  At least the strips don&#x27;t break apart.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use. Non greasy or messy. Easy clean up. It&#x27;s my first time using this and I&#x27;m still getting used to it. But overall I like it And will be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have is, it can be hard to get a good hold on the wax when removeing hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I have use piers.</li>
            <li> Ive bad no problem with this product. Its super first time user friendly and I definitly will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Pretty good wax for bikini area. Easy to work with and takes all the hair off.</li>
            <li> Love these. I tried all. This is the best for bikini wax!</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. It sticks to your private hair and does not come off properly! Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best wax! Easy to use!</li>
            <li> First off the heating times on the instructions are way off. I had to double the time to get the wax fully melted. After heating it , it was very thin so iset it aside to cool and thicken. Once it thickened i tested it on my leg and it was still really sticky. I let it sit a few more minutes and the samething. A little bit longer and its still just a sticky mess! I will never ever purchase this wax again. I rather pay the 50 bucks then deal with this stuff again!</li>
            <li> I just bought 2 of these and I am so mad that Surgiwax apparently changed their formula, or something has happened to the product, because I have used wax for years and this formulation several times before and never had the issue that I have with this last batch.  The product is sticky, will not harden, creates a mess on my fingers because it will not harden and now pulls out almost no hairs. Had to go over the same area several times and ended up denuding areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a company is going to change its formula, it should advertise this fact. Mad that I bought 2 and I&#x27;m stuck with this useless product.</li>
            <li> I had nothing to loose compare to what I spend in spas so I decided to purchase this. The economy isn&#x27;t really working on my favor either. Guest what? It work! A little messy but i will get better at it. I am black and have coarse hair, I didn&#x27;t need to reapply and love the fact of no strip. I could kiss the inventor right now. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;PS: Do not forget to apply the pretreatment oil first!!!! OUCH!!!</li>
            <li> well, i found out i must be a masochist!...i am a first time user of ANY kind of wax &#x27;down there&#x27; and took a chance on this product after reading the reviews...i must say, a few made me laugh out loud!...i like the product even though i thought i&#x27;d have a heart attack, but figured that would NOT be a good way for the EMT&#x27;s etc to find me!!...so i muddled through the whole process wishing i had cut the hair a tad shorter...overall, i like the result, and i can see that next time it will be easier...i think a candle warmer or something to keep the wax hot is a must...and i would also buy some oil since i was using canola after the whole process to try and get some wax off me...  :o)  i swear if i died now i think the undertaker would find some wax in my southern hemisphere!....i did laugh at myself a few times considering i&#x27;m a 57 year old female who just gave herself her first brazilian!!....i think i&#x27;ll try my underarms next time and i&#x27;ll probably prepare with a shot or three of tequila as well!</li>
            <li> melt very well, very sticky, but need to get cold to be off the skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read well- it came with 3 boxes!</li>
            <li> I have used this several years and it is my favorite. If you follow the instructions exactly, you will have good results...Exfoliate, apply oil, make sure the wax is not too hot (just as instructions recommend), then pull off without any strips. It works great and the price is right! Will buy more!</li>
            <li> Priceless for the ability of you and your partner to wax without going and spending over a $100 a month at a salon.  Wax is excellent quality.</li>
            <li> We all know how it works. &amp;#34;Oh, I could do this!&amp;#34; No, you can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m very good with most beauty things .. but I&#x27;m just gonna leave waxing to the professionals. It&#x27;s too easy to get exhausted and lose motivation and then get wax stuck in random parts of your body. I DO like the product however. And you can reuse it a bit. I might try again soon, but with much hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have been on the planet a half century + and this is the best bikini area wax I have ever used. Doesn’t get real hot, so no burning, hardens quickly, and the prep cream makes it as pain free as the activity can ever be. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work well on me at all, i only get maybe 1 out of 4 hairs. really close to the naughty bits flippin forget about the pain is to much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s easy to use and much less painful than getting waxed at the salon. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky mess down there.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is really good for its price. I was shipped 3 boxes for 14 bucks and saved money on it. Reheating in between is time consuming but i would by a wax warmer to save time. Excellent product for waxing privates and saves you lot of money at the salon! This product comes with only two sticks but i am buying extra ones to use it on the body.</li>
            <li> the direction is so complicated， I bought it but never use it..... and I bought another one to replace it.....</li>
            <li> This is the best Brazilian wax I&#x27;ve used.  Great for do it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with oil to use before you start waxing to make it less painful.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great product and it was the first time I&#x27;d waxed by myself. It does take longer to melt in the microwave (at least my microwave) than the packaging says. After that, I then used a candle warmer to keep the wax melted while I was in the bathroom waxing. A tip: Do not be afraid to apply too much of the oil, add quite a bit. It made a huge difference in the wax not sticking to my skin when I used more oil. I need more practice to perfect using this product, as it took me 2-1/2 hours to wax my entire bikini area and certain areas were a lot more painful and harder for the wax to pull up than others and I&#x27;d get wax under my fingernails and then it&#x27;d be hard to continually pull up the wax, but, all in all, I would definitely buy and use this product again.</li>
            <li> It sucks don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, however I suffered a severe allergic reaction to it that lasted for about a week.  I&#x27;m not allergic to anything else, and didn&#x27;t expect that to happen.</li>
            <li> Each strip I used only removed about 1/3 of the hair in the area. At first I thought, okay I will just redo those spots tomorrow, but it was just far too painful for it to have to be a multiple day project!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It removes hair well.</li>
            <li> I love Surgi wax. I have been using it since 2008 and never have a problem. It is the best. Gentle on my skin, great to pull out all of the hair without hurting my skin. I use the Brazilian kit for my armpits and my bikini. You only need your kit and a microwave, so convenient.</li>
            <li> The best one in the market. I have used for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy the first go-around, but then again, I&#x27;m a novice at the waxing game.  It&#x27;s painful, but tolerable (unless you let it harden too long).  I like the result though.  Definitely try to follow some of the tips on here though because if you spread too thin, I feel sorry for your lady bits.  My tips: make sure you DON&#x27;T leave it on too long.  Be ready to take off the strip pretty quickly (within about 20-30 sec of application because a minute is way too long).  Do not spread it on too thin or try to offset that by reapplying more on top.  It only makes the experience worse.  Make sure you have dedicated time to actually do the waxing, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner.  On a good note, regrowth is much slower (just coming in after about 10 days) than shaving (usually about 2 days for me) or using the hair removal cream (usually starts back within about 5-6 days having used surgi cream).</li>
            <li> this wax works well but not on the most sensitive areas.. i use it to make a nice line but i cant use it for a full brazilian waxing</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, with excellent results. Have tried others and always came back to surgiwax.  Ordered it recently and it was absolutely horrible! Was an absolute catastrophic mess.&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review, though I buy almost everything from amazon...from cosmetics to T.V.s and everything in between. This stuff was so bad, I googled it after the fact, to see if this was just an anomaly or others have had this experience...sure enough...it has been an issue for others. Really bummed. Now have to use the self heating sally Hansen, which is ok, but takes forever to heat up in its metal container, so no microwave option:(&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated on here, same exact procedure as always, tried to remove, it was like super stiff, yet gummy tar. Tried ice, more oil...to no avail. Stuck under fingernails, on floor of shower, etc. Ended up with some bruising.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this right now with your legs splayed...try some &#x27;Desolve It&#x27; on a bath scrubbie. If not...do not attempt. Not sexy!</li>
            <li> I started using this product for my upper lips several years ago, as it is more cost effective than the smaller product marketed for that purpose.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I used to get brazilian waxing in a salon, but I wanted to save money and try this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess it may work for someone, but for me it was just too painful and I did not have the courage to rip it off quickly and so many times.. It just hurt as hell!!!! After 2 hours of agonizing pain I gave up... I was half done, or better say un-done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work for you, try some smaller packaging. I wish I could use it, but I just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I guess I have a lot of leverage when it comes to reviewing brazilian wax because I am brazilian and have waxed in salons in Brazil for the last 15 years of my life. In Brazil we can get a bikini wax for $10,00 and get out of there with the skin of a child. When me and my husband decided to move to the US to persue our master&#x27;s degree one of the first practical worries that I started having was how on earth was I supose to wax. I had heard of the absurd prices of waxing here and had no experience in trying it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got here the search began and I started off with the cheap Sally crap. Needless to say I was so discouraged I wanted to cry! Hurted like hell and when I looked at the strip there were 3 or 4 hairs!! So my second shot was with Surgi after reading great reviews on here. On the first try I felt like I was in a salon in my home town in Brazil! Virtually painless and so easy and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys figured it out and I am never going to change brands again!!</li>
            <li> I got one box of 4oz only instead of 3 boxes.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for her endless and arcane bathroom waxing ritual which I, as a mere mortal, am not privy to. All my doubts are cast aside when she emerges (sometimes many many moons later), smooth as smooth can be and grinning. A happy wife is a happy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tells me that the Surgi Wax:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats easily and quickly,&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t require strips (this was heavily emphasised)&lt;br /&gt;Has a useful epilation oil included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, could use more application sticks per pack (only two provided) and it smells... odd, and quite pungent. When you live in a Manhattan apartment, that becomes an issue quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any and all attempts by my wife to come near my hairy man legs with this wax have resulted in me locking myself in the bedroom and threatening to call the National Guard.</li>
            <li> This product rocks! Greatly reduced pain, in-grown hairs and re-growth (or ‘new growth’) when compared to ‘professional’ waxing. i get the feeling that the products attributes are due to its formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used at-home waxes before for my bikini area, usually crappy ones like Sally Hansen or Parissa strips, so I though I&#x27;d try this one since it had such lovely reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is unusually painful. My bikini area hair was 1/4\\&quot; like the instructions said to do, but I found it would grab halfway onto hairs around the edges, so it basically just yanked on them painfully but didn&#x27;t actually remove them when I pulled it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I finally started moving inwards after getting the edges, it was some kind of hell. I ended up spending 45 minutes trying to get a small piece wax off -- bit by bit -- from some sensitive areas and crying all the while from the pain. Did I mention I even took two ibuprofen beforehand and it was still ridiculously painful? Yeah. I just gave up after that and shaved the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the areas that I did successfully wax were left with a few broken off hairs that quickly turned into ingrown hairs. Charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, this wax is messy. I mean, more than normal wax ever should be. It got EVERYWHERE no matter how careful I was, and this stuff gets stuck on skin, under fingernails, clothes, floor, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my lady parts look like a half-waxed, ingrown battlefield. Thanks, Surgi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have LOVED it.  Used it for bikini line, arms, armpits, upper lip, etc.  However, my most recent 3 pack was very disappointing.  I&#x27;m assuming they have changed the formula, as it now will not get hard on your skin, making for a sticky mess.  It won&#x27;t come off of your skin and sticks all over your fingers and skin that you&#x27;re attempting to wax.  I&#x27;m so bummed.  I thought maybe it was just a defective jar, but opened another from my 3 pack and it is the same.  Unfortunately I will not be purchasing again :-)</li>
            <li> i have never written a product review.  EVER.  I have used Surgi products for years.  This one states that it is &#x27;improved&#x27;.  Only if their definition of &#x27;improved&#x27; includes not hardening, not sticking to hair, and not removing from the skin - even when pre-treated as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first box is now in the trash, the second and third boxes will be going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can find some of the pre-improved product, I will get it in an instant.  This stuff?  It isn&#x27;t worth the effort to curse at.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!!!  I used to pay a lot of money at the salon for waxing, now I can do it on my own. It&#x27;s very easy to use. Good price.</li>
            <li> Surgiwax has undergone reformulation, and knowing that, the product has noticeably changed: in that&lt;br /&gt;it remains a bit stickier than &#x27;hard wax&#x27; typically is: (for sensitive, temperature-warmer areas than face/ legs, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Surgiwax still out-performs anything in its same category.&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that its price keeps increasing.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast which was a big plus!! It wasn&#x27;t bad but I would have liked for the waxing stick to be a little longer and bigger. I like the strips so this will take a litte time to get used to but its overall a good product.</li>
            <li> microwave heated is weird.</li>
            <li> Used with: [[ASIN:B000CO89T8 Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer]] to maintain the temperature of the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first at-home brazilian. I have gone to spas to get them many times, so I am familiar with the prep work and the aftercare. After reading the reviews, I also purchased the mug warmer (see link above) so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep running back to the microwave, and I don&#x27;t know how I would have survived without the combination! The brazilian went relatively smoothly, though there is a learning curve of how to do it best, depending on your preferences, skin type, and sensitivity. Definitely follow the directions if you&#x27;re a firstie! Their suggestions helped me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 2 hours since it was my first time, and then I decided to try it on my underarms, as suggested. What an awful experience! I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, but I followed the directions and the wax got stuck to the skin in a really oddly gummy texture. I had to scrap it off desperately with my fingernails, leaving my underarms so bloody painful for the next 2 days, with some open pores. (If this happens to you, don&#x27;t put ANYTHING on: no deoderant, anti-perspirant, or lotions; just baby oil or body oil.) I probably should have tried a smaller patch on my underarms first, since the hair is different there compared to \\&quot;down under\\&quot;. Next time, I will try a small small patch and see if the results are equally torturous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I am very happy with my at-home Brazilian! :) Smooth, no ingrown hairs at all, no irritation or even soreness. Will use Tend Skin product (see link below) to make sure ingrowns stay at bay! Remember: only use Tend Skin a day or two after waxing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hint: to remove wax product from skin, nails, or anything else it may drip on, including desks, use body oil or baby oil (see link below to what I used). The wax comes right off! (I had wax on a handheld mirror.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00008BK7H NeutrogenaBody Oil, Light Sesame Formula, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ECQ7G4 Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution For Unsightly Razor Burns, Ingrown Hair And Razor Burns, 8-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Recommend for Brazilian, will re-try a patch of underarm hair again. Recommend with mug warmer, body/baby oil, and tend skin.</li>
            <li> This is horrible. It never hardens so very hard to remove and worse it leaves bits of wax behind and won&#x27;t come off. It also leaves a bad residue. So leave this product behind. Just threw the three bottles away!</li>
            <li> Best wax I have ever used...</li>
            <li> used for years - best out there</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to. Doesn&#x27;t require cutting up cloth strips. be careful when heating. If it runs off the spoon too fast then it&#x27;s too hot and your burn yourself. I tend to heat it until it&#x27;s completely liquid and then WAIT for it to cool by stirring and blowing on it gently. Wax can be reused if you want to stretch it. It&#x27;ll have hairs but doesn&#x27;t affect performance. (I tried this and it works, but I no longer bother)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you never used this before, a warm bath or shower helps. Use the oil. It won&#x27;t prevent the hairs from sticking but will help it not stick to the skin. Don&#x27;t let it harden too much. I&#x27;ve found the best time to pull it off is BEFORE it&#x27;s fully hardened otherwise it will break and you end up turning one quick moment of pain into 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just realized I&#x27;m reviewing this under my husbands account. :)</li>
            <li> I have never waxed at home before so this was a learning experience.  You definitely want to use the oil a lot.  that helps.  Also as another reviewer mentioned heat it up longer to make it easier to spread and get a coffee warmer to avoid reheating.  I find standing up is the easiest.  Once I got the hang of it, all was good...except for the pain.  But, the waxing lasts about 3.5 weeks and the next time you wax it is much easier.</li>
            <li> Waxing at home is difficult and painful, period. That being said, this wax has been great - hardens enough to keep from making the usual mess and does the job. Will keep ordering more!</li>
            <li> It is not worth a product. When you peel it off, it comes off in pieces not the whole strip all at once. Not worth buying. And the bad part is it comes with 6 boxes. I cant use even one, how would I use all 6. Really horrible product.</li>
            <li> An awesome product!  Takes a little bit of practice, but overall so much cheaper than a professional wax!  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great on your pits too. This product is a no-brainer ... heat ... rip ... repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use oil on you skin prior or you&#x27;ll be so very sorry. The oil in the box works fine, but there&#x27;s a small amount provided, if you run out any corn or olive oil will do just as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I use and ever will, wally world stopped selling it. I can only find it at sallys, Its expensive there for one box. Amazon is a way better deal. I can get about four or five uses out of one jar.</li>
            <li> seriously, i save so much waxing myself with this awesome wax. no more $60 salon fees and having someone else get all up in my private area. that always made me cringe. this wax is great. no muslin needed.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive when I got it I thought it was wax strips but is real wax I put it on the microwave for  1 minute then stir it and wax my arm pits  it took all the hair and left my arm pits so soft without pulling my skin of.... of course you have to follow direction. you must pull the wax as soon as it is not sticky, it feels soft , moldable but not dried, it will hurt but is better than shaving or wax strips.</li>
            <li> Ok.....this wax is wonderful......it works excellent for me....I use it not only &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, you know what I mean, right....? but I use it to get rid of a bit of moustache.  Easy to use, just apply  a little on a cotton fabric stripe , let it dry a little bit....pull it away....and NO MORE HAIR...!!!  YEPPEEEE...!!!&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m 65 years old, so....if it works for me, it works for everybody...!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go to hard wax. Always a good price and it works well. Once they stopped selling it in stores I was so happy to find Amazon sells it. It does hurt to wax but if you take an aspirin before hand and use the pre-oil it comes with, it lessens the pain.</li>
            <li> My favorite. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands but this works the best for me. Easy to use. First time heating up the wax takes more than a minute for me. Also once it gets towards the bottom of the carton the wax doesn&#x27;t work as well but nevertheless i&#x27;ve had the best luck with this.</li>
            <li> Best wax around! I have been using this wax for about 8 years now and highly suggest it! I use it on everything from my eye brows to my bikini line. I have tried it on my legs but they require too much wax to make it worth it. Love this wax!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had waxes done professionally before, and they were always super painful, so I was apprehensive to try to wax myself.  Since I&#x27;ve used Surgi products before, I was fairly confident this would be good as well... but I was blown away by how much I loved it!  The best way I found to wax is this: I sit on a towel in my bathroom (because it&#x27;s so well-lit) with a mirror in front of me.  The mirror has the option to see magnified or normal, and I use both, dependent upon the situation or area of focus.  Some reviews have said that the product takes longer to heat up than listed, but I found that the directions they provide are pretty accurate (and I only had to reheat once).&lt;br /&gt;DO use the oil, it helps a LOT.  The only trouble with the oil is that, once you&#x27;ve gone over a spot and gotten most of the hair, it won&#x27;t stick to the few little hairs left behind (maybe they were just too short... hard to say).  Also, after reading reviews, I was paranoid that I would leave the wax on too long, but I found that I was often trying to pull it off too soon, so I know now not to be so quick to jump the gun.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a FANTASTIC product, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought the 3 pack.  My skin was significantly less irritated than when I had professional waxes.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a salon after this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 6 months and loved the results...until my last shipment.  I received my latest shipment yesterday and tried to wax my underarms as I have done many times in the past.  I found the wax to be much different than the previous formula.  It would not dry and harden properly. Even after leaving it on for ages and turning on a fan in an attempt to make it dry, it was still a sticky goo.  When I tried to remove the wax, only portions of it came off, leaving huge sticky areas behind.  The wax got all over my counter top, all over my hands, and under my finger nails.  My arm even ended up stuck to my side at one point from the sticky mess.  I was able to finish the job, but what would normally be a 15 minute routine took me an hour from start to finish.  I also noticed that the oil that comes with the product, which usually removes residual wax from the skin very effectively, had a tough time removing this new formula.  I&#x27;m just glad I was only waxing my underarms, as I can&#x27;t imagine the mess and pain this formula would cause if waxing the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the old version of this product, but this new formula is terrible.  I was very disappointed with the change to this product, not to mention that the price has increased significantly for such an inferior formula.  Needless to say, I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> This product not only showed up a week earlier than the estimated delivery time, but was so much easier to use than the reviews had lead me to believe it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I have zero experience with bikini waxing of any kind professional or home, and I thought that it would be a lot more complicated than it was. There were a fair amount of stray hairs but that was mostly my fault for not knowing exactly which direction the hair was growing.&lt;br /&gt;It has been about a week and a half now, and while some of the hair is starting to come back it is still very soft and tidy. I bought this thinking that it would be easier to maintain than shaving after having my son and I was right. It took half an hour or so to do everything and there was no pain or irritation afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin so after I finished I did blot on a little bit of after shaving lotion just to make sure that my skin didn&#x27;t react negatively and the results were wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works as well or better than other products I have tried. Still need to QA spots with tweezers after using.</li>
            <li> dries too quickly and cracks</li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s a good product, not great.</li>
            <li> this product was better than what I expected.. it brings an pre-waxing oil, i would recommend to use it 10 mins before start waxing so your skin will be hydrate enough to support the next steps. also the wax took off all the hairs from brazilian area, underarms, legs. the box&#x27;s size is little but the wax last n is enough for everything. nice product!</li>
            <li> This is painful, does not peal off very nicely, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I love surgi wax and have used it for years - it is absolutely superior to the other products on the market.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t seem to get my hands on my order (much to my husband&#x27;s dismay).  I placed the order on January 16th and am still waiting for the product on January 30th.  Unacceptable in this day and age.</li>
            <li> The product seemed old.  Would not even heat in microwave when I tried for 3 minutes.  Would return it but already used it and now I have 3 boxes of it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my bikini line and underarms.  NO PAIN whatsoever.  Easy to use, only slightly messy if you&#x27;re careful.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It hurt more than anything but it also worked.</li>
            <li> Ladies. Do your own waxing. Start with this product. You can use this formula anywhere on your body.  It&#x27;s gonna save you a fortune!</li>
            <li> This was a complete pain to use. It was messy and ineffeftive! I am definitely not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this only for my face as I am allergic to every other face wax. This works well and is so much mess free if used correctly. This is hard to find at stores lately and this is a good deal online.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use...instructions are thorough and complete.  It comes with everything you need.  Save money on expensive salons and do it yourself at home.</li>
            <li> This wax is great for bikini waxing or Brazilian waxing. The hard wax is the only way to go when you when you are waxing the nether regions. I find that I have to heat it up a little longer than the directions state to get it to that honey consistancy but that might just be my microwave. I would highly recommend for the at home waxer that doesn&#x27;t want to mess with a waxing pot.</li>
            <li> Love this product, very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin they way a lot of other waxes do.</li>
            <li> great product i felt no pain</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used wax. And yes it was quite painful. i did find that the wax did not melt within one miniut as it said it would on the jar. And it actually took 2 jars for one sitting.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve just exited the bathroom after not finishing my bikini area. Now, the Surgiwax works WAY better than any Sally Hansen product that I&#x27;ve used, BUT this is only true beneath the navel and close to the thighs, When you reach the labia, it is excruciatingly painful. I would rather use strips in that area because like a previous reviewer stated, once you get down there, it&#x27;s like pulling off a piece of bubble gum. I couldn&#x27;t even finish that area because it was so painful. I spent 45 minutes trying to get the wax off until I realized that you can warm it with friction, add a little oil, and it comes off. But, man! Trying to rip hair off of the labia was HORRID and I will NEVER try this kind of wax down that low again. I will, however, purchase a sugar wax and muslin strips for that area and still use Surgiwax for the less sensitive areas down below as well as my underarms and legs. I gave the wax 4 stars because it does state on the box that the labia area is the hardest. And it is. My God, it is.</li>
            <li> I use this product for years. Is the best.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and feels like the professional stuff.</li>
            <li> It leaves thin strands of hair even if you go over it a hundred times. It also is not for beginners! First time will hurt, so buy some numbing cream to put on it 2 hrs before you use this wax. You&#x27;ll thank me later!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, and it just takes forever to use, because I keep having to reheat it. This may be the same for all waxes, but it was a real pain in the arse.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my waxing for many years. I use a Brazilian hard body wax, because its easy to use, and you get more for your money. The first time I used this wax I was horrified. I couldn&#x27;t take it off. I struggled a lot, because I didn&#x27;t read the instructions. You must prep your skin first with an oil they provide, then apply the wax. Well I learned my lesson the hard way. I was ready to throw it away when my husband happened to find a little bottle. After I read the instructions, I decided to try it again. This wax was amazing! It was less painful than my other wax. One thing I would recommend is that if you have never waxed yourself before. Be careful and use it on a small area first to make sure you don&#x27;t peal off your skin or have an allergic reaction. Reading the instructions and practice help a lot. Also, please note if you wax your whole face for the first time you will break out. So if you have an event coming up do it months before and keep on doing it. If you stop waxing and start again you will break out. Your skin needs to get use to it</li>
            <li> works pretty good, although doesn&#x27;t get all the hair all the time.  also doesn&#x27;t as quickly and cleanly as it says, but this was my first kit that I bought and not a bad choice I would say for a beginner.</li>
            <li> My poor esthetician never saw it coming.  She probably wonders why she hasn&#x27;t seen me for weeks and weeks, and unless Amazon stops selling this stuff, she probably won&#x27;t see me ever again.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!  Can&#x27;t believe I never thought to look for hard wax online before.  I&#x27;ve been seeing an esthetician for underarm waxing for months now (had gotten waxed various places on an off over the years, but recently was going every couple weeks for underarms cause I just can&#x27;t stand shaving anymore).  Anyway, she uses \\&quot;hard wax\\&quot; and after spending way to much every month for her to wax my underarms, I decided to look for the same (or similar) kind of stuff online and came across this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant as a bunch of people said the \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; formula was terrible, but fortunately, I don&#x27;t know the difference and I love it just the way it is.  Super easy to use, not messy at all.  Doesn&#x27;t get everything, I have to pluck a little, but my esthetician always had to do the same for me.  So it&#x27;s the same, just faster and soooo much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - One jar of this stuff will easily last me 3 or 4 underarm waxes (3-4 times doing both underarms).  Just read the directions and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I have been using Surgi&#x27;s brazilian waxing kit for 2 years now, and though I have tried a few other name brands every now and then (a girl got to test the market!), nothing beats the fast &amp; smooth effects of Surgi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows pretty fast, &#x27;down there&#x27; &amp; everywhere, so I got to wax once every 3 weeks, but nevertheless, because of Surgi, every session only takes me 20 mins (almost the same time as a waxing salon will take).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I&#x27;ve noticed that, depending on the model of your microwave, the time to heat up the wax might varies, and it can be pretty annoying having to check the wax every 30 seconds just to make sure that I didn&#x27;t overheat the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I can&#x27;t say that the hair that grows back is softer, but its definitely more manageable (grows in one direction). This is my personal optional since my hair has always been thicker.</li>
            <li> its a breeze to use. Not really messy, unless you are a first timer..practice makes perfect (almost with anything!)</li>
            <li> When you apply thicker amounts the better it is! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and easy to use. Use it for my underarms, and also I use it on my male friends neck to get rid of horrible neck hair that grows back way to quickly!</li>
            <li> Did not like it all. Thought it would be like the paper version but not at all.</li>
            <li> First of all i had to heat the wax for WELL over how long it says just to get it somewhat melted. it did get messy but doing it yourself its gonna happen, but it is ridiculously hard getting a grip on it and keeping your skin taught all while trying to rip your hair out. Also that oil stuff that is supposed to keep the wax from tearing off your skin you have to put enough on but not to much because if you put too much it wont take the hair off. I tried this product well over 3 different times and each time i had to go over the same area because spots were missed. Honestly id rather pay someone to do this because at least then id know it was done right! Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> this isnt the product it says. i used it so i dont have to shave every other day. but it was messy as putty it sticks every where and hard to get off ur skin. plus when u put on the oil on ur skin before hand, it makes the wax not stick well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for quite sometime now and I love it. Although you don&#x27;t need strips, I use them because it makes it easier for me to apply more wax and pull it. And also, I&#x27;d rather it didn&#x27;t get stuck on my hand. I mean, this wax is by far the less \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; but, it is wax after all so something sticks to your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Pre-Epilation Oil as it prepares my skin for the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for private parts and under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a solid product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product did not do as it says, it&#x27;s very messy and painful</li>
            <li> The local drug stores stopped selling this wax and I was broken hearted. When I saw that it was on Amazon, I was skeptical and wondered if the product would have the same quality. When I used my new wax purchase, I was extremely satisfied. The wax was fresh, hardened quickly when applied and removed without residue. I love this particular Brazilian wax product because it doesn&#x27;t require wax strips. So, the waxing process is quicker. Since I&#x27;ve used this wax for over 10 years, I have it down to a science and it&#x27;s not messy. It was a bonus that I could order in bulk. Thanks Amazon for selling great products like this Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> Just completely easy to use and no skin irritation. Smoothness lasts as long as anything has for me (8-10 days).</li>
