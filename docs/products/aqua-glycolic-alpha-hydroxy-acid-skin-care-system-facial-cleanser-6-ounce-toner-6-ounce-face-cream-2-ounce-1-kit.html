            <li>All good stuff!</li>
            <li>All that being said, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t Asians supposed to have great skin?  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>The body wash works great as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working great, too.  </li>
            <li>All three of these products are great.</li>
            <li>It works great for blackheads, oily skin and skin discoloration from post acne.</li>
            <li>all of the products are great.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase to find in packaged deal.  </li>
            <li>Great feel for your face.  </li>
            <li>A great skincare system from a trusted company.  </li>
            <li>Great AHA products.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have recommended it to many...and now to you.</li>
            <li>I experienced no stinging, burning or redness.  </li>
            <li>Out of all 3 products the cleanser works the best and is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, like I said before, this is great for oily and acne skinned people.</li>
            <li>This product is working great for me.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks great and has plenty of moisture.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my body though, so that is what I am going to use it for from now on.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Great for men and women.</li>
            <li>Looks great under makeup.</li>
            <li>The toner is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a remarkable product</li>
            <li>Better than trashing  :D</li>
            <li>I have had fairly good skin since I came out of puberty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>i have used this product for years with good results.</li>
            <li>Friends, family and even strangers often make comments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I worked in Dermatology for 4 years and would recommend this as a good alternative to the pricy skin care systems.  </li>
            <li>Good for my skin, keeps age spots under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid before with good results</li>
            <li>I did have a friend say my skin was looking good, and asked me what I was using.</li>
            <li>Smooth flawless skin.</li>
            <li>Now it is available online of course, which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>So, I read the reviews about this brand that I have never heard of before (not even from the many dermatologists I have seen in many years) and was impressed.  </li>
            <li>i have found that the toner and face cream are excellent, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I can say that my skin looks great and one of the things I find is that my skin now accepts the Dermalogic skin care products much better</li>
            <li>love this product, I have been using it for 5 years and it keeps my skin discoloration under control, and works great for acne also.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the cleanser, toner and cream!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I really love how this makes my skin look and feel!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I am seeing more improvement from them!  </li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Do wish it helped shrink my pores better, but it is doing what I bought it to do!</li>
            <li>it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing group of products I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Aqua Glycolic system for 2 weeks now and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing and clears up my skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks amazing and my husband even said so tonight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results after 1 month.  </li>
            <li>Nice, that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance smell.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a try after using another brand of glycolic face wash which worked well for me and can say that it is gentler and non-drying yet just as effective.</li>
            <li>I have told all my friends about this with my own disclaimer: &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>I have been looking for some kind of skin care line with glycolic acid</li>
            <li>My acne is gone and skin turns over faster (especially great if you have older skin).</li>
            <li>(The cleanser isn&#x27;t ideal for removing makeup, so at night I wash my face first with Cetaphil bar soap then follow with AG.)</li>
            <li>Aqua Glycolic from Amazon fit the bill, the price was the best I found on the web, and so far I love the results!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and I will be buying more it really helps,</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and in the morning my face is smooth and bright, and my acne heals.</li>
            <li>The body cream is more effective for the ace.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients, affordable, well packaged and really good results consistently day in and day out.</li>
            <li>It leaves you skin feeling bright and clean without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Toner and cleanser feels really good on the skin, totally clean and not drying out your skin</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with these.</li>
            <li>You should also be well pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems more taut and even after continued used of Aqua Glycolic products.  </li>
            <li>I love to tan a bit</li>
            <li>My face is noticeably softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Just a note: I do use this cleanser with my Clarisonic brush every nite and most mornings.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to be more even toned and smoother.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is nothing more than a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t lather and feels like I am rubbing grease on my face.  </li>
            <li>After using all three products for two weeks, I have been breaking out more and my skin has a film on it.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for many, many years now after my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and receive many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product line for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I would deffinitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>A bottle lasts me a many months.</li>
            <li>Some people react better to benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>I especially love the laboratory style dispenser - minimizes any potential contamination of product, also prevents spilling even when I dropped it.  </li>
            <li>This might be useful if you have alot of sun damage (that&#x27;s what glycolic acid is good for)</li>
            <li>No need to over scrub your face, the product does most of the work.</li>
            <li>I enjoy all 3 products and plan to repurchase!</li>
            <li>You will love it.  </li>
            <li>It was good, but this is far superior in terms of healthful and helpful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Best total skin care I have found for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for three months now, and my skin is visibly softer, lines diminished, and the tone is more</li>
            <li>You place your cotton pad on top and pump it.</li>
            <li>However, after a month, my skin is used to it and my face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>and I fear my skin will never get better.</li>
            <li>I do agree with another reviewer that it works better with the toner.  </li>
            <li>I order this product all the time and love it.  </li>
            <li>I used them for many years.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive,inexpensive, prescription, and over-the-counter skin care systems</li>
            <li>My acne prone face has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the cream too.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but my skin adjusted and now I am really satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li>The toner is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the benefits of all the aqua glycolic skin care products I purchased  ...</li>
            <li>I love these skin care products.</li>
            <li>Love that I Aqua Glycolic found wipes too.</li>
            <li>Wish it would have worked better-</li>
            <li>I love Aqua Glycolic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>Love cleanser and toner, but</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>My GF has even mentioned how much better</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Excellent basic system that works well for my acne, as an adjunct to my derm visits.</li>
            <li>I have to remove the toner bottle top.</li>
            <li>The cleaner takes more of your getting-ready time since you wash your face with it, but the toner can be applied anytime even if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I use to work in a dermatologist office many years ago.</li>
            <li>I am so in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards my skin feels very clean but not tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, but I can honestly say THIS ONE WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>my pores are clean!  </li>
            <li>I noticed fine lines diminished and a fresher look to my skin, Love it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t available at most drugstores but can be found at stores that specialize in dermatological needs.</li>
            <li>Toner has awesome dispenser where you just put a cotton ball on top of the bottle and press down.</li>
            <li>Works great and super fast shipping</li>
            <li>Excellent price for quality compared too other products used.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT BURN.</li>
            <li>I also have some very mild (probably unnoticeable to anyone but me and my hyper-critical mother)</li>
            <li>I tan easily</li>
            <li>The consistency is like a  cream gel that emulsifies into a cream-oil and then washes away easily.</li>
            <li>and he said that it was as good as any prescription for that particular problem.</li>
            <li>My skin is super happy with this product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I first got samples for this from a plastic surgeon friend, and liked it.  </li>
            <li>and it is hands down the best regime that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is also very good for diabetic dry skin.</li>
            <li>I can see an improvement in my skin and also fine lines.</li>
            <li>The side benefit is that is gets rid of fine lines and improves the look of your skin.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles have all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>I have even noticed a huge reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>(I believe this info is still accurate).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May have been to early to write a review, but I&#x27;m really impressed so far and wanted to spread the news.</li>
            <li>I have told both my teenage kids to use it and they to have had great luck with it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great and my pores are visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>i use this set at night and a oil free spf during the day to protect from sun.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer much, but it feels nice.</li>
            <li>After doing some reasearch, I found that glycolic acid isn&#x27;t really that effective against acne since it can&#x27;t exfoliate inside the pores.  </li>
            <li>After reading great reviews on several sites &amp; having a family member swear by it, I decided to try Aqua Glycolic.  </li>
            <li>They used that on me at my local day spa and it worked great.</li>
            <li>After using twice a day for about a month, my skins looks smooth, pores are</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it from you!&amp;#34; The skin on my body feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I started with the soap and liked so much</li>
            <li>and I believe this product has helped maintain smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The Face Cream is great too, but will leave your face shiny, so you might not want to use it if you are going to be in public afterwards.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully and much cheaper than Dr. Office pricing on same quality item.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is indeed a non-lathering lotion and while mild, my skin feels so clean afterwards; not greasy, not oily and yay!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a high SPF, as the label does warn that your skin is a lot more prone to get sun burn.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product because it is effective</li>
            <li>At first they might seem a bit strong and may cause some redness, but you will quickly adapt to these products and love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li>at first i wasn&#x27;t so sure about this product.  </li>
            <li>it is well worth the try!</li>
            <li>: This is a rather unique cleanser as it is used like a cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>and you THINK you get it clean, but then use this toner on a cotton pad and you&#x27;ll be amazed.  </li>
            <li>I AM PLEASED SO FAR :)</li>
            <li>Your skin feels clean and tingly without over drying.</li>
            <li>, I think I can finally say I have found the best product for my adult acne-prone, super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, although effective in many ways, I find these products a tad drying, which is why I add a little bit of another moisturizer on top of the AG cream.</li>
            <li>(Note: the cleanser at first won&#x27;t feel very effective because it doesn&#x27;t sting on regular skin nor does it work into a rich lather, but just stick with it.</li>
            <li>It is the most reasonable skin care product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>However, It might be good for younger acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and have loved the way this system has given my skin a balanced look and feel and it has definitely given me smoother looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product that does what it</li>
            <li>I used this line of products faithfully in college after a dermatologist recommended it and had great success for many years, even with less than stellar lifestyle factors.</li>
            <li>The stuff is inexpensive, works great, I am 42 with hardly any lines, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s firmed my face tremendously.</li>
            <li>I bought the product looking for something to help control my oily skin (I have a mildly oily t-zone) as well as cleanse it and help fight against wrinkles.</li>
            <li>When used under makeup  it made my skin super greasy even on my cheeks and temples.  </li>
            <li>i started getting mild breakouts here and there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50, still have super oily skin and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It works great, my skin feels as soft as if I were paying for professional chemical peels (I use to get them monthly).</li>
            <li>This system has helped both - my breakouts have cleared up and my skin tone is more vibrant and fresh-looking.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as a good general maintenance kit for anyone interested in exfoliating/antiaging, but not specifically as an acne solution unless your acne is mild.</li>
            <li>and luckily it has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I super recommend this for oily and acne skinned people.</li>
            <li>very great, really helped clear up my moderate acne when used twice a day!</li>
            <li>You can really feel the glycolic acid but not to strong-</li>
            <li>I shall hope (keeping my finger crossed) that this brand, Aqua Glycolic, will be the last product that I ever have to \\&quot;experience\\&quot; with and will continue to work for my skin type for the many years to come!</li>
            <li>These products really exceed all my expectations!!</li>
            <li>I tried so many things to clear it up and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I rarely breakout in this area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many adult acne-prone skincare products including an all-natural, organic stuff.  </li>
            <li>It helps my oily skin stay clear and blemish free, tightens my pores and makes my skin smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>i am not crazy about the cleanser, it does not give you that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling(i understand the reviews with the filmy feeling).</li>
            <li>: No sunscreen (which I prefer, but you do get more sensitive to sun without it).</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this system is the toner by far.  </li>
            <li>short - this product has worked effectively for me, but in conjunction with an exfoliator (purchased separately).  </li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>I use dermalogica for my facial products, but have not been feeling like they are effective.  </li>
            <li>This itchy and red bumps indicate that my face hasn&#x27;t yet adopt these kind of chemicals.</li>
            <li>This set is a convenient and economical way to start this AHA regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser</li>
            <li>Make sure you use sunblock with this product, as it can make you sensitive to sunburn.</li>
            <li>nice products that work well if you use them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>You could spend more money on other brands, but I doubt they would deliver any more results.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum 50+), then gentle makeup primer (Fresh Rose Primer)</li>
            <li>The cream (which I use day/night) is very moisturizing and rich.     </li>
            <li>&quot; right off.</li>
            <li>I will say right away you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with what this has done for my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin really feels clean.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks so clear and clean!</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 only because I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks now, but so far it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>The breakout issue might have been a little better, not a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recomment these products as I have noticed significant changes in age spots, scars and discolorations on my face.  </li>
            <li>but it was too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>3-product kit is most economical, but I have excess cream left.  </li>
            <li>I really believe that these products are the most effective when used together because they are complementary - and this is coming from a girl who usually isn&#x27;t brand or collection-loyal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleansers to help clear up my acne and Aqua Glycolic is by far the most effective product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I liked then well enough but in the last month I was starting to realize my skin wasn&#x27;t looking as good as it was.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I have also had problematic skin (acne - pimples and cysts), but this seems to be a worthwhile product regarding my Asian skin.  </li>
            <li>Fading hyperpigmentation areas (again, daily sunscreen is key here) and smoother skin are awesome bonuses - not to mention help in reducing future wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Fading hyperpigmentation areas (again, daily sunscreen is key here) and smoother skin are awesome bonuses - not to mention help in reducing future wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need moisturizing during the hot summer days.</li>
            <li>My Dior AirFlash makeup looks much better on my skin since I started following this regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am pleased to get the entire kit with one click.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin free and clear of zee zits.</li>
            <li>I actually use the cleanser after I have cleaned my makeup off - more like a three minute mask.  </li>
            <li>The first week I used it</li>
            <li>skin can take the higher concentrations of AHA</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I always have had compliments on how smooth and young my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I had another brand and it helped a bit, but I felt I needed something with a higher %</li>
            <li>At times you can feel burning and when I first began using it</li>
            <li>I first read about it in shape magazine about 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>but after my first peel (2 weeks not even)&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I felt a burning sensation so I need to get close to the fan to ease this burning.</li>
            <li>Overall, my skin looks much better than before I used it.  </li>
            <li>I love the aqua glycolic products, especially the face cream!</li>
            <li>Saw results on the first day.</li>
            <li>Packaging is &amp;#34;cheapish&amp;#34; and the cleanser pump top would stick on first order, but not second.</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase it  as long as I am able.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Toner: The toner has alcohol in it so it might be drying, but I find that it is very effective on cutting oil from my face and getting it super clean, if you have acne this will sting your pimples, which means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I have some melasma spots on my forehead and upper lip area that are fading very quickly</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry him out as most would.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to continue as my skin was getting dry &amp; bumpy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moisturizer: This moisturizer can also cause flaking if you have dry skin, or if used more than once or twice a day.</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue using this product.</li>
            <li>Somehow I got the short end of the stick, but this stuff helps tremendously!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d describe my skin as pretty decent, but</li>
            <li>Once I switched back to my Clinique oil free lotion I was much happier.  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge different in my skin and my husband</li>
            <li>Wish they sold a huge bottle for entire body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser and face cream for a few months now and got such great results that I decided to get the toner as well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>The cleanser works very well at cleaning the face,neck and decolletage areas and then follow with the toner.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking fresh and clear.  </li>
            <li>The three steps are easy-breezy, and the results are really very satisfactory.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, removes makeup, and helps mattify the oiliness of my facial skin also keeps me breakout free.  </li>
            <li>It has a very oily feel to it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and this stuff really works well for me.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is so gentle, I&#x27;ve even used it as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>did find the bottle of toner a bit unusual.</li>
            <li>It said the products where gentle.</li>
            <li>My doctor says that it is really helpful with acne problems, which I don&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I can really see the results and difference after trying the kit for just a week.</li>
            <li>Then I use the toner and gently spread throughout the my face and to the areas where the treatment is needed.</li>
            <li>and you can really see the maximum results.</li>
            <li>Very well balanced with no stinging or dryness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the moisturizer at all greasy, yet very drying?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>I believe they come from the lab that makes some very pricey brands.</li>
            <li>If you use it every day, your skin will feel like glass without much irritation at all.</li>
            <li>This product sounded like a fantastic daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really amazed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a normal pimple, people!</li>
            <li>No it doesn&#x27;t get soapy, but many other acne cleansers don&#x27;t get soapy either,</li>
            <li>this has helped more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as a former user of Obagi Nu Derm (for 2.5 years), Aveda Outer Peace (4 weeks), Cetaphyl, Neutrogena, ProActive, Clinique 3-step system (6mos.), Peter Thomas Roth (3 mos.), Estee Lauder Sparkling Clean (1month),</li>
            <li>: I use just one squirt of the cleanser to clean my entire face in the shower each day.</li>
            <li>I use the cleanser everyday 2 times and the toner everyother day, and the moisturizer from time to time because it is very very strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and most other otc products with little to no success in helping to clear my skin, which is also sensitive, so some products seem to cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it will be my perfect, forever cleanser because I have not used it long enough.  </li>
            <li>I usually avoid using any kind of moisturizer on my face because they always make me break out.</li>
            <li>My skin exfoliated at a faster rate than normal, and it didn&#x27;t cause any unusual dryness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without the cleanser and toner!</li>
            <li>but it is important to apply it in to a dry face as directed</li>
            <li>The cleanser is not like your typical cleanser - it doesn&#x27;t lather or foam, but it does its magic regardless.  </li>
            <li>Even the acne scars I had are disappearing &amp; my skin looks better &amp; is less oily.  </li>
            <li>MY MAIN PROBLEM IS THE BLACKHEADS ON MY NOSE, AND</li>
            <li>Now Im just left with some scarring but luckily make up can cover that.</li>
            <li>This may irritate some with sensitive skin and they may need to ease into usage, but I have been using salycilic acid and retin-a for some time now, so may skin easily tolerates twice daily usage - and seems to be the only product I need right now, so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer works as well as any high end department store $90.00 moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So my expectation were high when I received it.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended to anyone who&#x27;s thinking about getting it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you have problem skin, I highly recommend using these products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for adults who still have problems with zits.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and look 50ish!!</li>
            <li>My skin might have been a little smoother, but not so noticeable that I could tell for sure.  </li>
            <li>This product did not work well for me, but does not mean that it won&#x27;t work well for others.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several products clean n clear, proactive, Stridex, etc.</li>
            <li>I just received my 3 piece skincare system and have only used it once so far, but my face already feels clean and softer.</li>
            <li>Gentle bits breaks up the oil and keeps my skin clear and radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very milky, soft liquid face wash</li>
            <li>First, let me preface this by saying I am 50 years old, and I am ALWAYS mistaken for being in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m almost 37 &amp; recently developed what I think was hormone induced moderate acne &amp; possibly mild rosacea.  </li>
            <li>, you actually feel it stinging those pimples right off your face.</li>
            <li>I went right over and bought the facial cleanser and the face cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen that my right side of my face are starting get smoother and lighter.</li>
            <li>I can only recommend this for people with acne or oily skin because it might be too strong for dry skin users and they probably wont benefit as much from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AG is really effective at clearing away dead skin, fading red marks, and smoothing fine lines without the harshness/dryness of the other brands.</li>
            <li>For those who experience breakouts, just keep in mind that changing to any new product can seemingly increase breakouts in the beginning.</li>
            <li>and many other brands I have used, returned or trashed because it only worked for 4 weeks or less (and I&#x27;m kinda broke now from buying so many products that promised to clear my acne and control the MEGA shine and oiliness)</li>
            <li>skin has definitely improved and every month I don&#x27;t get those huge forever red mosquito looking bumps</li>
            <li>The one big difference I could really see was that this product really \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; my skin - not an effect I wanted to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous about using it as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>however my sking looks clear and radiant!</li>
            <li>have spots on my face and this has substantially diminished the appearance of my blemishes I plan to continue using it to rid my face of these spots completely!</li>
            <li>i first wash my face with regular soap and then use the face wash.</li>
            <li>I normally have medium tone, oily-combination &amp; somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Over the past 6 months I&#x27;ve tried so many products for acne but NOTHING worked.  </li>
            <li>my face is smoother , more even toned and if i do get a small breakout ,it disappears in about a day.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist first gave it to me to use and then report my \\&quot;opinion\\&quot; on the product back to him.  </li>
            <li>This is the first treatment that has actually made a difference.  </li>
            <li>My experience using these products, at first I&#x27;ve felt the burning sensation and my face became itchy and had some red bumps</li>
            <li>The cleanser and toner might sting in particularly broken-out areas during this time but unless you suspect a larger allergic reaction, try to put up with this as much as you can.</li>
            <li>yet it may irritate dry or super sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li>I also use Retin-A to treat my acne, and using these high concentration AHA products at the same time has saved me from the unsightly peeling that many who use Retin-A complain about (especially in the first few months of Retin-A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has made my old skin new again.</li>
            <li>However, after trying countless products (to cleanse, exfoliate, tone, mask, spot treat, moisturize - you name it) and a variety of methods (such as oil cleansing, spa facials, IPL photofacials, antibiotics, vitamin supplements, different hormone combinations, blue light therapy) in addition to improved lifestyle factors (such as a healthier diet, consistent exercise and more sleep)...I&#x27;m once again back to the Aqua Glycolic products and hormone combo that worked so well for me during those college years and my stubborn hormonal acne seems to finally be under control again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive facial skin (I break out in eczema with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), but haven&#x27;t had a reaction to any of Aqua Glycolic&#x27;s products, and they&#x27;ve helped to keep my mild to moderate acne in check.  </li>
            <li>my face began to clear up</li>
            <li>It smooths out my skin and helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning and it has managed to keep my skin so clear.</li>
            <li>It took about a month to really clear up all breakouts.</li>
            <li>I turned to this as a milder treatment that cleansed my face and kept it clear withoit drying it.</li>
            <li>This stuff just does wonders on old skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 35 yrs old and never had problems with acne when I was in school</li>
            <li>Being a Military wife we have lived in many different climates and I wish I had known about these products earlier!!</li>
            <li>I am especially sensitive to all skin lotions and facial stuff but to my surprise, I can tolerate these.</li>
            <li>I really like these products and especially the fact that you can buy them in a set.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that the cream cleanser (does not lather at all) did not remove the makeup.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOURMONEY  </li>
            <li>and wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li>My skin has changed almost completely.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and my wrinkles are softening.</li>
            <li>My skin is balanced and soft.</li>
            <li>Aqua Glycolic was recommended to me 10 years ago by my dermatologist for my adult cystic acne</li>
            <li>and then I developed a chemical rash.</li>
            <li>Completely changed the way my skin acts.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 and worshipped the sun too much when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m ALL in &amp; would really recommend this product to anyone especially if you suffer from acne!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old skincare junky with combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of adult acne and this works just as well as ProActiv.  </li>
            <li>Although I am not young, I still get breakouts in the hot humid summer weather.</li>
            <li>It keeps my acne under control, it&#x27;s gentle, AND it makes my skin look younger.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on how young I look and my &amp;#34;great skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Adult acne has also disappeared.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have been using the products for at about six weeks and still no acne, and even fine lines around my mouth and forehead are less apparent.</li>
            <li>I use the moisturizer only at night and my skin is not greasy the next morning, but looks fresh.</li>
            <li>Ok this stuff is so serious.</li>
            <li>My skin usually doesn&#x27;t do well with such products, causing me to break out more.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this set.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on switching regimes any time soon, and I highly recommend this product if you are having the same problems that I was having.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these Aqua Glycolic products: Toner and Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after only a few uses which is more than I can say for most products with false promises.</li>
            <li>But I have very few fine lines</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally on the dry side, and this product had my face very oily not even two hours after application.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>Massage it around, during this time you should really massage your face because you&#x27;ll notice the cleanser will really get into the pores and little flecks of dirt and roughness will come out of your skin.</li>
            <li>So I have been trying new products containing glycolic acid since this is the only thing that ever worked for controlling my acne.  </li>
            <li>I live in San Diego, CA, and we have very low humidity.</li>
            <li>But even just using products that minimize active breakouts (that for me were often painful and deep jawline cysts) by bringing gunk to the surface more quickly has alone made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>But even just using products that minimize active breakouts (that for me were often painful and deep jawline cysts) by bringing gunk to the surface more quickly has alone made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Although I realize that there isn&#x27;t one solution for everyone, I&#x27;m concerned that previous reviewers who were less enthusiastic about these products either gave up too soon or altogether have a different trigger for their acne.</li>
            <li>I also found I stopped getting those white bumps too that have started to accumulate on my chin and near my eye socket near my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had some success with some medication (pill form) previously but prefer not to go that route if it can be helped.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this product a few years ago and it cleared my mild acne.</li>
            <li>and my skin just looked older and stiff, especially around my smile lines.</li>
            <li>but nothing major...</li>
            <li>I have been using all three for a couple of week now, and I really feel that my overall skin condition has dramatically improved - smoother, no new acnes, old acne scars and freckles are fading.</li>
            <li>I was a loyal user for a long time, but eventually decided to try a couple other brands (Dermadoctor Wrinkle Revenge Glycolic Acid Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads).</li>
            <li>An amazing product but quite expensive)</li>
            <li>I generally wear the cream at night after I use the toner.</li>
            <li>MY ACNE AND SCARS ARE STARTING TO CLEAR UP.</li>
            <li>and I FINALLY have clear skin.</li>
            <li>and now I barely have any age spots!I have been using this product for almost two years now</li>
            <li>Overall, I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference after a few weeks of using just the cleanser and toner</li>
            <li>The one dark spot that I was particularly interested in getting rid of did fade, but not disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re barely noticeable now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne as an adult and have tried numerous medications.  </li>
            <li>And the actual lotion is entirely too greasy for people with even normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>No breakouts beyond the stray spot or two since I began using this product; the pores on my nose are remarkably smaller; my shine has been reduced - now I only have to blot in the afternoons as opposed to mid-morning; and I find my sun spots and acne scarring are slowly fading as my skin tone grows more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather cover flat scars than big bumpy red pimples.</li>
            <li>Those pimples take a long time to form and can be under the skin before you use the product, some new products can just accelerate the eruptions (not the formation of) and once those are done, your skin will normalize.  </li>
            <li>I had used this product a few years back with no success but decided to give another try after reading how many users use the cleaner as a mask.</li>
            <li>It was just a little to much for my sensitive, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>With this product, I really not need to, my skin is soft and clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I ended up throwing the whole set in the trash after several tries.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on your skin and less irritating, and more affordable.</li>
            <li>I wait a minute or two for this to absorb before applying a little bit of gentle day moisturizer (I like Aveeno Ultra-Calming Day Lotion), then sunscreen (IMPERATIVE!</li>
            <li>Really helping with the dark spots</li>
            <li>However, after buying and using just this glycolic acid kit, I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark spots due to acne quickly fade away.</li>
            <li>I usually put the cleanser on dry, clean skin and leave it on for 20 minutes, then add water and rinse it off.</li>
            <li>Also during this time I strive to use all three products twice a day, however there are instances when my skin feels overly dry or sensitive</li>
            <li>I have combo oily skin and issues with blackheads, my mother has dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The wrinkles on the nape of my neck and top of my chest have disappeared!!&lt;br /&gt;There may be a small breakout as the toxins leave your skin, but that lasts only a few hours.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll give an update when I have some results, good or bad.</li>

            <li> I have been using this skin care line for 5 years and it is the best.  </li>
            <li> Aqua Glycolic is wonderful to use on your skin.  </li>

            <li> But I gave them a shot, even though I&#x27;d never heard or read anything about them, except the reviews on Amazon, and I am DELIGHTED!  </li>
            <li> All good stuff!</li>
            <li> All that being said, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t Asians supposed to have great skin?  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The body wash works great as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working great, too.  </li>
            <li> All three of these products are great.</li>
            <li> It works great for blackheads, oily skin and skin discoloration from post acne.</li>
            <li> all of the products are great.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase to find in packaged deal.  </li>
            <li> Great feel for your face.  </li>
            <li> A great skincare system from a trusted company.  </li>
            <li> Great AHA products.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have recommended it to many...and now to you.</li>
            <li> I experienced no stinging, burning or redness.  </li>
            <li> Out of all 3 products the cleanser works the best and is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, like I said before, this is great for oily and acne skinned people.</li>
            <li> This product is working great for me.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks great and has plenty of moisture.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my body though, so that is what I am going to use it for from now on.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Great for men and women.</li>
            <li> Looks great under makeup.</li>
            <li> The toner is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a remarkable product</li>
            <li> Better than trashing  :D</li>
            <li> I have had fairly good skin since I came out of puberty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years with good results.</li>
            <li> Friends, family and even strangers often make comments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I worked in Dermatology for 4 years and would recommend this as a good alternative to the pricy skin care systems.  </li>
            <li> Good for my skin, keeps age spots under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid before with good results</li>
            <li> I did have a friend say my skin was looking good, and asked me what I was using.</li>
            <li> Smooth flawless skin.</li>
            <li> Now it is available online of course, which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> So, I read the reviews about this brand that I have never heard of before (not even from the many dermatologists I have seen in many years) and was impressed.  </li>
            <li> i have found that the toner and face cream are excellent, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I can say that my skin looks great and one of the things I find is that my skin now accepts the Dermalogic skin care products much better</li>
            <li> love this product, I have been using it for 5 years and it keeps my skin discoloration under control, and works great for acne also.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser, toner and cream!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really love how this makes my skin look and feel!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> and I am seeing more improvement from them!  </li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> Do wish it helped shrink my pores better, but it is doing what I bought it to do!</li>
            <li> it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing group of products I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Aqua Glycolic system for 2 weeks now and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its amazing and clears up my skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks amazing and my husband even said so tonight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results after 1 month.  </li>
            <li> Nice, that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance smell.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> I gave this a try after using another brand of glycolic face wash which worked well for me and can say that it is gentler and non-drying yet just as effective.</li>
            <li> I have told all my friends about this with my own disclaimer: &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some kind of skin care line with glycolic acid</li>
            <li> My acne is gone and skin turns over faster (especially great if you have older skin).</li>
            <li> (The cleanser isn&#x27;t ideal for removing makeup, so at night I wash my face first with Cetaphil bar soap then follow with AG.)</li>
            <li> Aqua Glycolic from Amazon fit the bill, the price was the best I found on the web, and so far I love the results!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and I will be buying more it really helps,</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and in the morning my face is smooth and bright, and my acne heals.</li>
            <li> The body cream is more effective for the ace.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, affordable, well packaged and really good results consistently day in and day out.</li>
            <li> It leaves you skin feeling bright and clean without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Toner and cleanser feels really good on the skin, totally clean and not drying out your skin</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with these.</li>
            <li> You should also be well pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems more taut and even after continued used of Aqua Glycolic products.  </li>
            <li> I love to tan a bit</li>
            <li> My face is noticeably softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Just a note: I do use this cleanser with my Clarisonic brush every nite and most mornings.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems to be more even toned and smoother.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is nothing more than a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t lather and feels like I am rubbing grease on my face.  </li>
            <li> After using all three products for two weeks, I have been breaking out more and my skin has a film on it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for many, many years now after my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and receive many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product line for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I would deffinitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me a many months.</li>
            <li> Some people react better to benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I especially love the laboratory style dispenser - minimizes any potential contamination of product, also prevents spilling even when I dropped it.  </li>
            <li> This might be useful if you have alot of sun damage (that&#x27;s what glycolic acid is good for)</li>
            <li> No need to over scrub your face, the product does most of the work.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all 3 products and plan to repurchase!</li>
            <li> You will love it.  </li>
            <li> It was good, but this is far superior in terms of healthful and helpful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best total skin care I have found for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for three months now, and my skin is visibly softer, lines diminished, and the tone is more</li>
            <li> You place your cotton pad on top and pump it.</li>
            <li> However, after a month, my skin is used to it and my face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> and I fear my skin will never get better.</li>
            <li> I do agree with another reviewer that it works better with the toner.  </li>
            <li> I order this product all the time and love it.  </li>
            <li> I used them for many years.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive,inexpensive, prescription, and over-the-counter skin care systems</li>
            <li> My acne prone face has never been better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the cream too.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but my skin adjusted and now I am really satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> The toner is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the benefits of all the aqua glycolic skin care products I purchased  ...</li>
            <li> I love these skin care products.</li>
            <li> Love that I Aqua Glycolic found wipes too.</li>
            <li> Wish it would have worked better-</li>
            <li> I love Aqua Glycolic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> Love cleanser and toner, but</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> My GF has even mentioned how much better</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Excellent basic system that works well for my acne, as an adjunct to my derm visits.</li>
            <li> I have to remove the toner bottle top.</li>
            <li> The cleaner takes more of your getting-ready time since you wash your face with it, but the toner can be applied anytime even if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I use to work in a dermatologist office many years ago.</li>
            <li> I am so in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards my skin feels very clean but not tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, but I can honestly say THIS ONE WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> my pores are clean!  </li>
            <li> I noticed fine lines diminished and a fresher look to my skin, Love it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t available at most drugstores but can be found at stores that specialize in dermatological needs.</li>
            <li> Toner has awesome dispenser where you just put a cotton ball on top of the bottle and press down.</li>
            <li> Works great and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent price for quality compared too other products used.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT BURN.</li>
            <li> I also have some very mild (probably unnoticeable to anyone but me and my hyper-critical mother)</li>
            <li> I tan easily</li>
            <li> The consistency is like a  cream gel that emulsifies into a cream-oil and then washes away easily.</li>
            <li> and he said that it was as good as any prescription for that particular problem.</li>
            <li> My skin is super happy with this product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I first got samples for this from a plastic surgeon friend, and liked it.  </li>
            <li> and it is hands down the best regime that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is also very good for diabetic dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can see an improvement in my skin and also fine lines.</li>
            <li> The side benefit is that is gets rid of fine lines and improves the look of your skin.</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles have all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have even noticed a huge reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> (I believe this info is still accurate).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May have been to early to write a review, but I&#x27;m really impressed so far and wanted to spread the news.</li>
            <li> I have told both my teenage kids to use it and they to have had great luck with it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great and my pores are visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> i use this set at night and a oil free spf during the day to protect from sun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer much, but it feels nice.</li>
            <li> After doing some reasearch, I found that glycolic acid isn&#x27;t really that effective against acne since it can&#x27;t exfoliate inside the pores.  </li>
            <li> After reading great reviews on several sites &amp; having a family member swear by it, I decided to try Aqua Glycolic.  </li>
            <li> They used that on me at my local day spa and it worked great.</li>
            <li> After using twice a day for about a month, my skins looks smooth, pores are</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it from you!&amp;#34; The skin on my body feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I started with the soap and liked so much</li>
            <li> and I believe this product has helped maintain smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The Face Cream is great too, but will leave your face shiny, so you might not want to use it if you are going to be in public afterwards.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and much cheaper than Dr. Office pricing on same quality item.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is indeed a non-lathering lotion and while mild, my skin feels so clean afterwards; not greasy, not oily and yay!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a high SPF, as the label does warn that your skin is a lot more prone to get sun burn.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product because it is effective</li>
            <li> At first they might seem a bit strong and may cause some redness, but you will quickly adapt to these products and love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li> at first i wasn&#x27;t so sure about this product.  </li>
            <li> it is well worth the try!</li>
            <li> : This is a rather unique cleanser as it is used like a cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> and you THINK you get it clean, but then use this toner on a cotton pad and you&#x27;ll be amazed.  </li>
            <li> I AM PLEASED SO FAR :)</li>
            <li> Your skin feels clean and tingly without over drying.</li>
            <li> , I think I can finally say I have found the best product for my adult acne-prone, super oily skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, although effective in many ways, I find these products a tad drying, which is why I add a little bit of another moisturizer on top of the AG cream.</li>
            <li> (Note: the cleanser at first won&#x27;t feel very effective because it doesn&#x27;t sting on regular skin nor does it work into a rich lather, but just stick with it.</li>
            <li> It is the most reasonable skin care product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> However, It might be good for younger acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have loved the way this system has given my skin a balanced look and feel and it has definitely given me smoother looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product that does what it</li>
            <li> I used this line of products faithfully in college after a dermatologist recommended it and had great success for many years, even with less than stellar lifestyle factors.</li>
            <li> The stuff is inexpensive, works great, I am 42 with hardly any lines, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s firmed my face tremendously.</li>
            <li> I bought the product looking for something to help control my oily skin (I have a mildly oily t-zone) as well as cleanse it and help fight against wrinkles.</li>
            <li> When used under makeup  it made my skin super greasy even on my cheeks and temples.  </li>
            <li> i started getting mild breakouts here and there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50, still have super oily skin and breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It works great, my skin feels as soft as if I were paying for professional chemical peels (I use to get them monthly).</li>
            <li> This system has helped both - my breakouts have cleared up and my skin tone is more vibrant and fresh-looking.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as a good general maintenance kit for anyone interested in exfoliating/antiaging, but not specifically as an acne solution unless your acne is mild.</li>
            <li> and luckily it has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I super recommend this for oily and acne skinned people.</li>
            <li> very great, really helped clear up my moderate acne when used twice a day!</li>
            <li> You can really feel the glycolic acid but not to strong-</li>
            <li> I shall hope (keeping my finger crossed) that this brand, Aqua Glycolic, will be the last product that I ever have to \\&quot;experience\\&quot; with and will continue to work for my skin type for the many years to come!</li>
            <li> These products really exceed all my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I tried so many things to clear it up and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I rarely breakout in this area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many adult acne-prone skincare products including an all-natural, organic stuff.  </li>
            <li> It helps my oily skin stay clear and blemish free, tightens my pores and makes my skin smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li> i am not crazy about the cleanser, it does not give you that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling(i understand the reviews with the filmy feeling).</li>
            <li> : No sunscreen (which I prefer, but you do get more sensitive to sun without it).</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this system is the toner by far.  </li>
            <li> short - this product has worked effectively for me, but in conjunction with an exfoliator (purchased separately).  </li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> I use dermalogica for my facial products, but have not been feeling like they are effective.  </li>
            <li> This itchy and red bumps indicate that my face hasn&#x27;t yet adopt these kind of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This set is a convenient and economical way to start this AHA regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser</li>
            <li> Make sure you use sunblock with this product, as it can make you sensitive to sunburn.</li>
            <li> nice products that work well if you use them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> You could spend more money on other brands, but I doubt they would deliver any more results.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum 50+), then gentle makeup primer (Fresh Rose Primer)</li>
            <li> The cream (which I use day/night) is very moisturizing and rich.     </li>
            <li> &quot; right off.</li>
            <li> I will say right away you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with what this has done for my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin really feels clean.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks so clear and clean!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 only because I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks now, but so far it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> The breakout issue might have been a little better, not a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recomment these products as I have noticed significant changes in age spots, scars and discolorations on my face.  </li>
            <li> but it was too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> 3-product kit is most economical, but I have excess cream left.  </li>
            <li> I really believe that these products are the most effective when used together because they are complementary - and this is coming from a girl who usually isn&#x27;t brand or collection-loyal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleansers to help clear up my acne and Aqua Glycolic is by far the most effective product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I liked then well enough but in the last month I was starting to realize my skin wasn&#x27;t looking as good as it was.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I have also had problematic skin (acne - pimples and cysts), but this seems to be a worthwhile product regarding my Asian skin.  </li>
            <li> Fading hyperpigmentation areas (again, daily sunscreen is key here) and smoother skin are awesome bonuses - not to mention help in reducing future wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Fading hyperpigmentation areas (again, daily sunscreen is key here) and smoother skin are awesome bonuses - not to mention help in reducing future wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need moisturizing during the hot summer days.</li>
            <li> My Dior AirFlash makeup looks much better on my skin since I started following this regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am pleased to get the entire kit with one click.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin free and clear of zee zits.</li>
            <li> I actually use the cleanser after I have cleaned my makeup off - more like a three minute mask.  </li>
            <li> The first week I used it</li>
            <li> skin can take the higher concentrations of AHA</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I always have had compliments on how smooth and young my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I had another brand and it helped a bit, but I felt I needed something with a higher %</li>
            <li> At times you can feel burning and when I first began using it</li>
            <li> I first read about it in shape magazine about 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> but after my first peel (2 weeks not even)&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I felt a burning sensation so I need to get close to the fan to ease this burning.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin looks much better than before I used it.  </li>
            <li> I love the aqua glycolic products, especially the face cream!</li>
            <li> Saw results on the first day.</li>
            <li> Packaging is &amp;#34;cheapish&amp;#34; and the cleanser pump top would stick on first order, but not second.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase it  as long as I am able.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Toner: The toner has alcohol in it so it might be drying, but I find that it is very effective on cutting oil from my face and getting it super clean, if you have acne this will sting your pimples, which means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I have some melasma spots on my forehead and upper lip area that are fading very quickly</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry him out as most would.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to continue as my skin was getting dry &amp; bumpy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moisturizer: This moisturizer can also cause flaking if you have dry skin, or if used more than once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> I will certainly continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Somehow I got the short end of the stick, but this stuff helps tremendously!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d describe my skin as pretty decent, but</li>
            <li> Once I switched back to my Clinique oil free lotion I was much happier.  </li>
            <li> Makes a huge different in my skin and my husband</li>
            <li> Wish they sold a huge bottle for entire body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser and face cream for a few months now and got such great results that I decided to get the toner as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The cleanser works very well at cleaning the face,neck and decolletage areas and then follow with the toner.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking fresh and clear.  </li>
            <li> The three steps are easy-breezy, and the results are really very satisfactory.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper, removes makeup, and helps mattify the oiliness of my facial skin also keeps me breakout free.  </li>
            <li> It has a very oily feel to it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and this stuff really works well for me.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is so gentle, I&#x27;ve even used it as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> did find the bottle of toner a bit unusual.</li>
            <li> It said the products where gentle.</li>
            <li> My doctor says that it is really helpful with acne problems, which I don&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I can really see the results and difference after trying the kit for just a week.</li>
            <li> Then I use the toner and gently spread throughout the my face and to the areas where the treatment is needed.</li>
            <li> and you can really see the maximum results.</li>
            <li> Very well balanced with no stinging or dryness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the moisturizer at all greasy, yet very drying?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I believe they come from the lab that makes some very pricey brands.</li>
            <li> If you use it every day, your skin will feel like glass without much irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This product sounded like a fantastic daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a normal pimple, people!</li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t get soapy, but many other acne cleansers don&#x27;t get soapy either,</li>
            <li> this has helped more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as a former user of Obagi Nu Derm (for 2.5 years), Aveda Outer Peace (4 weeks), Cetaphyl, Neutrogena, ProActive, Clinique 3-step system (6mos.), Peter Thomas Roth (3 mos.), Estee Lauder Sparkling Clean (1month),</li>
            <li> : I use just one squirt of the cleanser to clean my entire face in the shower each day.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser everyday 2 times and the toner everyother day, and the moisturizer from time to time because it is very very strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and most other otc products with little to no success in helping to clear my skin, which is also sensitive, so some products seem to cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will be my perfect, forever cleanser because I have not used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I usually avoid using any kind of moisturizer on my face because they always make me break out.</li>
            <li> My skin exfoliated at a faster rate than normal, and it didn&#x27;t cause any unusual dryness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without the cleanser and toner!</li>
            <li> but it is important to apply it in to a dry face as directed</li>
            <li> The cleanser is not like your typical cleanser - it doesn&#x27;t lather or foam, but it does its magic regardless.  </li>
            <li> Even the acne scars I had are disappearing &amp; my skin looks better &amp; is less oily.  </li>
            <li> MY MAIN PROBLEM IS THE BLACKHEADS ON MY NOSE, AND</li>
            <li> Now Im just left with some scarring but luckily make up can cover that.</li>
            <li> This may irritate some with sensitive skin and they may need to ease into usage, but I have been using salycilic acid and retin-a for some time now, so may skin easily tolerates twice daily usage - and seems to be the only product I need right now, so</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer works as well as any high end department store $90.00 moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> So my expectation were high when I received it.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended to anyone who&#x27;s thinking about getting it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have problem skin, I highly recommend using these products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for adults who still have problems with zits.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and look 50ish!!</li>
            <li> My skin might have been a little smoother, but not so noticeable that I could tell for sure.  </li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me, but does not mean that it won&#x27;t work well for others.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several products clean n clear, proactive, Stridex, etc.</li>
            <li> I just received my 3 piece skincare system and have only used it once so far, but my face already feels clean and softer.</li>
            <li> Gentle bits breaks up the oil and keeps my skin clear and radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very milky, soft liquid face wash</li>
            <li> First, let me preface this by saying I am 50 years old, and I am ALWAYS mistaken for being in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m almost 37 &amp; recently developed what I think was hormone induced moderate acne &amp; possibly mild rosacea.  </li>
            <li> , you actually feel it stinging those pimples right off your face.</li>
            <li> I went right over and bought the facial cleanser and the face cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen that my right side of my face are starting get smoother and lighter.</li>
            <li> I can only recommend this for people with acne or oily skin because it might be too strong for dry skin users and they probably wont benefit as much from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AG is really effective at clearing away dead skin, fading red marks, and smoothing fine lines without the harshness/dryness of the other brands.</li>
            <li> For those who experience breakouts, just keep in mind that changing to any new product can seemingly increase breakouts in the beginning.</li>
            <li> and many other brands I have used, returned or trashed because it only worked for 4 weeks or less (and I&#x27;m kinda broke now from buying so many products that promised to clear my acne and control the MEGA shine and oiliness)</li>
            <li> skin has definitely improved and every month I don&#x27;t get those huge forever red mosquito looking bumps</li>
            <li> The one big difference I could really see was that this product really \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; my skin - not an effect I wanted to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about using it as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> however my sking looks clear and radiant!</li>
            <li> have spots on my face and this has substantially diminished the appearance of my blemishes I plan to continue using it to rid my face of these spots completely!</li>
            <li> i first wash my face with regular soap and then use the face wash.</li>
            <li> I normally have medium tone, oily-combination &amp; somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 6 months I&#x27;ve tried so many products for acne but NOTHING worked.  </li>
            <li> my face is smoother , more even toned and if i do get a small breakout ,it disappears in about a day.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist first gave it to me to use and then report my \\&quot;opinion\\&quot; on the product back to him.  </li>
            <li> This is the first treatment that has actually made a difference.  </li>
            <li> My experience using these products, at first I&#x27;ve felt the burning sensation and my face became itchy and had some red bumps</li>
            <li> The cleanser and toner might sting in particularly broken-out areas during this time but unless you suspect a larger allergic reaction, try to put up with this as much as you can.</li>
            <li> yet it may irritate dry or super sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li> I also use Retin-A to treat my acne, and using these high concentration AHA products at the same time has saved me from the unsightly peeling that many who use Retin-A complain about (especially in the first few months of Retin-A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has made my old skin new again.</li>
            <li> However, after trying countless products (to cleanse, exfoliate, tone, mask, spot treat, moisturize - you name it) and a variety of methods (such as oil cleansing, spa facials, IPL photofacials, antibiotics, vitamin supplements, different hormone combinations, blue light therapy) in addition to improved lifestyle factors (such as a healthier diet, consistent exercise and more sleep)...I&#x27;m once again back to the Aqua Glycolic products and hormone combo that worked so well for me during those college years and my stubborn hormonal acne seems to finally be under control again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive facial skin (I break out in eczema with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), but haven&#x27;t had a reaction to any of Aqua Glycolic&#x27;s products, and they&#x27;ve helped to keep my mild to moderate acne in check.  </li>
            <li> my face began to clear up</li>
            <li> It smooths out my skin and helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning and it has managed to keep my skin so clear.</li>
            <li> It took about a month to really clear up all breakouts.</li>
            <li> I turned to this as a milder treatment that cleansed my face and kept it clear withoit drying it.</li>
            <li> This stuff just does wonders on old skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 35 yrs old and never had problems with acne when I was in school</li>
            <li> Being a Military wife we have lived in many different climates and I wish I had known about these products earlier!!</li>
            <li> I am especially sensitive to all skin lotions and facial stuff but to my surprise, I can tolerate these.</li>
            <li> I really like these products and especially the fact that you can buy them in a set.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the cream cleanser (does not lather at all) did not remove the makeup.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOURMONEY  </li>
            <li> and wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li> My skin has changed almost completely.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and my wrinkles are softening.</li>
            <li> My skin is balanced and soft.</li>
            <li> Aqua Glycolic was recommended to me 10 years ago by my dermatologist for my adult cystic acne</li>
            <li> and then I developed a chemical rash.</li>
            <li> Completely changed the way my skin acts.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and worshipped the sun too much when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m ALL in &amp; would really recommend this product to anyone especially if you suffer from acne!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old skincare junky with combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of adult acne and this works just as well as ProActiv.  </li>
            <li> Although I am not young, I still get breakouts in the hot humid summer weather.</li>
            <li> It keeps my acne under control, it&#x27;s gentle, AND it makes my skin look younger.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on how young I look and my &amp;#34;great skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Adult acne has also disappeared.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for at about six weeks and still no acne, and even fine lines around my mouth and forehead are less apparent.</li>
            <li> I use the moisturizer only at night and my skin is not greasy the next morning, but looks fresh.</li>
            <li> Ok this stuff is so serious.</li>
            <li> My skin usually doesn&#x27;t do well with such products, causing me to break out more.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this set.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on switching regimes any time soon, and I highly recommend this product if you are having the same problems that I was having.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these Aqua Glycolic products: Toner and Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after only a few uses which is more than I can say for most products with false promises.</li>
            <li> But I have very few fine lines</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally on the dry side, and this product had my face very oily not even two hours after application.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> Massage it around, during this time you should really massage your face because you&#x27;ll notice the cleanser will really get into the pores and little flecks of dirt and roughness will come out of your skin.</li>
            <li> So I have been trying new products containing glycolic acid since this is the only thing that ever worked for controlling my acne.  </li>
            <li> I live in San Diego, CA, and we have very low humidity.</li>
            <li> But even just using products that minimize active breakouts (that for me were often painful and deep jawline cysts) by bringing gunk to the surface more quickly has alone made a huge difference.</li>

            <li> Although I realize that there isn&#x27;t one solution for everyone, I&#x27;m concerned that previous reviewers who were less enthusiastic about these products either gave up too soon or altogether have a different trigger for their acne.</li>
            <li> I also found I stopped getting those white bumps too that have started to accumulate on my chin and near my eye socket near my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had some success with some medication (pill form) previously but prefer not to go that route if it can be helped.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this product a few years ago and it cleared my mild acne.</li>
            <li> and my skin just looked older and stiff, especially around my smile lines.</li>
            <li> but nothing major...</li>
            <li> I have been using all three for a couple of week now, and I really feel that my overall skin condition has dramatically improved - smoother, no new acnes, old acne scars and freckles are fading.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal user for a long time, but eventually decided to try a couple other brands (Dermadoctor Wrinkle Revenge Glycolic Acid Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads).</li>
            <li> An amazing product but quite expensive)</li>
            <li> I generally wear the cream at night after I use the toner.</li>
            <li> MY ACNE AND SCARS ARE STARTING TO CLEAR UP.</li>
            <li> and I FINALLY have clear skin.</li>
            <li> and now I barely have any age spots!I have been using this product for almost two years now</li>
            <li> Overall, I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference after a few weeks of using just the cleanser and toner</li>
            <li> The one dark spot that I was particularly interested in getting rid of did fade, but not disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re barely noticeable now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne as an adult and have tried numerous medications.  </li>
            <li> And the actual lotion is entirely too greasy for people with even normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> No breakouts beyond the stray spot or two since I began using this product; the pores on my nose are remarkably smaller; my shine has been reduced - now I only have to blot in the afternoons as opposed to mid-morning; and I find my sun spots and acne scarring are slowly fading as my skin tone grows more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather cover flat scars than big bumpy red pimples.</li>
            <li> Those pimples take a long time to form and can be under the skin before you use the product, some new products can just accelerate the eruptions (not the formation of) and once those are done, your skin will normalize.  </li>
            <li> I had used this product a few years back with no success but decided to give another try after reading how many users use the cleaner as a mask.</li>
            <li> It was just a little to much for my sensitive, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> With this product, I really not need to, my skin is soft and clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I ended up throwing the whole set in the trash after several tries.</li>
            <li> They are gentle on your skin and less irritating, and more affordable.</li>
            <li> I wait a minute or two for this to absorb before applying a little bit of gentle day moisturizer (I like Aveeno Ultra-Calming Day Lotion), then sunscreen (IMPERATIVE!</li>
            <li> Really helping with the dark spots</li>
            <li> However, after buying and using just this glycolic acid kit, I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark spots due to acne quickly fade away.</li>
            <li> I usually put the cleanser on dry, clean skin and leave it on for 20 minutes, then add water and rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Also during this time I strive to use all three products twice a day, however there are instances when my skin feels overly dry or sensitive</li>
            <li> I have combo oily skin and issues with blackheads, my mother has dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The wrinkles on the nape of my neck and top of my chest have disappeared!!&lt;br /&gt;There may be a small breakout as the toxins leave your skin, but that lasts only a few hours.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll give an update when I have some results, good or bad.</li>
            <li> the whole \\&quot;acid peel\\&quot; angle sounded pretty caustic, especially with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The kind that are small and spread and don&#x27;t pop, and are OH SO difficult to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I was a a little hesitant ordering thinking it was going to be too strong or not effective.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful when in the sun (I use Oil of Olay regenersit moisturizer SPF 15 &amp; bare minerals</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve lasted me a long time too and the trick is to put the products in the cupboard and forget you bought them until a year later.</li>
            <li> typical daytime routine consists of applying a few pumps of the Aqua Glycolic cleanser to a DRY face with my DRY fingertips (as instructed on the bottle), waiting about a minute and then rinsing as usual with warm water.</li>
            <li> Well about two months ago I experienced a horrible case of adult acne</li>
            <li> I had a dry red mark for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I am a 44-year old woman with age spots, uneven skin tone and some middle age acne.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser did sting a little bit but certainly no worse than other cleansers I&#x27;ve used made to control acne.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin overall, but have some minor break-outs on my chin.  </li>
            <li> More expensive than other kits, but it works well and your skin doesn&#x27;t tire of it.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely only recommend the cream for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and still struggle a bit with a little bit of acne around the chin area.  </li>
            <li> I did breakout for a few weeks when I started using the product, but that has passed and my skin is crsytal clear.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been a few weeks now since I began this complete regimen.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks I&#x27;ve seen considerable change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Now in my late 20s, I&#x27;ve struggled (and I mean really struggled) with adult acne for several years as a result of switching contraception methods with different hormones.</li>
            <li> be even toned and soft and you will require less foundation!</li>
            <li> This product was less expensive and seemed to do a better job.</li>
            <li> These products are actually better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually use ProActiv, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> The toner is a little chemically-smelling, but it does a terrific job - and I think is probably the key to the results.  </li>
            <li> I think all in all this product lightened my skin a little, definitly did not cleanse properly, and the toner is toner any toner will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> Not enough glycolic in product to work the way I had hoped and what Im used to in other glycolic brands.</li>
            <li> The two stars were only because it seemed to work for other people.</li>
            <li> and this was only once a day or every other day.</li>
            <li> I posted almost the same review for other Aqua Glycolic products, because they deserve it...</li>
            <li> I can only use it every other day or my skin gets really dry.  </li>
            <li> But the only store That carried the entire system recently closed down.</li>
            <li> I have used Aqua Glycolic Alpha Hydroxy for a very long time -- It was recommended to me by my dermatologist --</li>
            <li> After rubbing it in dry</li>
            <li> then I rinse my face, dry my face</li>
            <li> The toner has alcohol in it so it helps dry and \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the acne-prone areas.  </li>
            <li> They are helping me with sluffing off the dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I think if I had dry skin, I might hesitate, however.  </li>
            <li> My skin ended up dry, itchy and upset.  </li>
            <li> The oily areas weren&#x27;t oily and the dry were no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I pat my face dry then apply the toner,</li>
            <li> To this day my skin has been dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I am elderly and my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone, with the rest of my face being dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> However, the cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my dry skin and leaves my oily zones well cleansed.  </li>
            <li> the Aqua Glycolic shampoo/body wash has also helped exfoliate my occasionally dry and dandruffy scalp...</li>
            <li> To use, you take dry hands and apply a liberal amount to dry face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it refreshed and blocks unwanted blackheads.  </li>
            <li> and it comes in a small, clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, so I was a little skeptical at first ...</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the key to clear skin</li>
            <li> although a little goes a long way - I tend to only use a dime-sized amount.  </li>
            <li> Not highly fragranced.</li>
            <li> I used it at night and the only difference i noticed in my skin was it was slightly softer but definitly looked shinier.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my left side of my face has still dark spots but they are also fading away.</li>
            <li> At night, I also apply an additional moisturizer but one that&#x27;s a little thicker such as the Cetaphil cream or Cerave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The real test is quickly approaching as my skin tends to be a little worse during the summer.  </li>
            <li> typical nighttime regime begins with makeup removal using a drugstore brand makeup remover, then again using the cleanser on a DRY face with DRY hands.</li>
            <li> I am not wrinkly, no real laugh lines or crows&#x27; feet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how long I will go, but I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> (13 years ago) Occasionally I would get a few pimples here and there</li>
            <li> and nothing seemed to help made it worse really.</li>
            <li> Not sellers fault but packaging was wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have already spent years and money on everything</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t stray again and anyone wanting my supply of these products will have to pry them out of my cold, dead fingers.overall skin texture to be smoother and more fresh-faced...</li>
            <li> The toner keeps the shine on my T-Zone down, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the rest of my face (even in the winter).  </li>
            <li> I ordered these products not because of acne problems, which I have very few, but I wanted to lighten my few years old freckles on cheeks and nose from the sun.</li>
            <li> Afterward use the cream on all areas but be careful to not use around the eye area!  </li>
            <li> Like I said before the toner is a toner any other will work just as well.  </li>
            <li> During this several week transitional period, spots will pop up in places on your face they usually don&#x27;t as the alpha hydroxy acids bring up the stuff that clogs pores, emulsifies it and then promotes faster cell turnover.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product before other neccessities.</li>
            <li> Like other users, I find the face cream a bit greasy</li>
            <li> Be careful in the sun!  </li>
            <li> so note that this is in conjunction with other products.  </li>
            <li> Give it a couple months to work it&#x27;s magic and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference in the size of the pores as the other reviewers say they can.  </li>
            <li> And also, these other products take time to see the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products besides this kit and a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some problem areas due to exposure to the sun...</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit on my cheeks where they can get dry due to weather.</li>
            <li> I had to start off using it every other day because it did dry my face a little in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of other products with salicylic acid as the active ingredient and this stuff blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> After cleansing, I apply the toner with a cotton ball and about a dime-sized amount of moisturizer all over my face, with a little extra on trouble areas.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> After having some bad acne breakouts this really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this line has helped clarify my skin by bringing deeply-rooted blemishes to the surface, fading leftover hyperpigmentation spots and improvingoverall skin texture to be smoother and more fresh-faced...especially now that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and a few faint lines that have appeared are already less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use the Aqua Glycolic cream on the rare painful pimple.  </li>
            <li> For acne that is still active, it helps it come to head faster.</li>
            <li> It is so not worth it.</li>
            <li> I think I will try a product with mandelic acid for the dark spot.</li>
            <li> After getting the dreaded dark spots on my face I&#x27;d read that glycolic acid helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have some uneven skin tones and small wrinkles starting, I know I&#x27;m not alone.</li>
            <li> I had severe acne as a teen and into my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The package was wet, the toner spilled and a lot was missing from it.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with annoying adult acne on and off, especially around my time of the month, and after using benzoyl peroxide for a while my skin had extra dry spots that would get inflamed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Olay Regenerist/Total Effects and Definity lines, and this beats all three of them, hands down.  </li>
            <li> It dries up my acne and causes the swelling to go down.</li>
            <li> It is a slight peel effect.</li>
            <li> From a facial cleansing standpoint, I can purchase something a lot less expensive and get the same results.</li>
            <li> If you experience dryness of flaking, you should either not use all the products at once, or use it less often.</li>
            <li> Had to throw this mess away because it broke me out.</li>
            <li> The face wash alone does not clean all the dirt off your face.     </li>
            <li> My skin problems are occasional breakouts that leave behind dark spots.</li>
            <li> This dried up my acne flare up within 2 days and after almost a week my skin is noticeably smoother, tighter, and less oily.</li>
            <li> I rub it with a little water l</li>
            <li> So I have little sun damage.  </li>
            <li> It takes getting used to --- the toner and face cream burn and itch a little</li>
            <li> and I prefer a little roughness to get my makeup off</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bit burning sensation that I feel using it.</li>
            <li> I had some little under-the-skin imperfections that I wanted him to work on</li>
            <li> They might seem expensive, but the quantities you receive will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is definitly one of those waste your time and money products.   </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll swap the trio out for something gentler like Cetaphil cleanser and Cerave moisturizer for a round before going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW WEEKS AND HAVE NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I used Erno Laszlo for decades and they changed ingredients a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It can be slightly harsh, but I don&#x27;t find it stripping at all</li>
            <li> As for the uneven tone and wrinkles, I&#x27;m hoping over time this product will help.</li>
            <li> To say I tried a few products is an understatement and eventually started taking accutane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other products to my face in order to get rid of my acne and especially my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The product has a very slight sting to it when using it, which makes me feel like its going to work for</li>
            <li> but they are not as bad as my first time using them.</li>
            <li> I do have dark circles under my eyes (again from allergies, and not treating my eyes delicately), which nothing seems to cure</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for my oily skin it only clogged my pores, the toner stung and the moisturizer was too heavy.</li>
            <li> especially now that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and a few faint lines that have appeared are already less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was my make up or vitamins that triggered it</li>
            <li> I had to use my usual routine for removing makeup and have since stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> It just takes some time, usually a week or two, to start seeing results).</li>
            <li> Had it under control the past couple years using Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> Then the past year I started getting acne bumps on my neck and under my jawline.  </li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find in local drug store</li>
            <li> I THINK I CAN NOTICE A SMALL CHANGE.</li>
            <li> This is from someone who usually slathers herself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I added a small amount of 85% glycolic acid to it, and use that for body cream.  </li>
            <li> and so was careless with my arms and legs when I was younger</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> bonus is no more acne.  </li>
            <li> I use Skinmedica moisturizer on my face, so the Aqua Glycolic moisturizer I usually use on my hands.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this product, but sometimes you gotta step out on faith and out of your comfort zone and try new things.</li>
            <li> The toner does sting and if you rub too hard it will burn your skin.  </li>
            <li> at least 1/4 of the product had leaked out.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is too thick for my liking though.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed when I opened this order and the toner had spilled, leaving only half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Both times I&#x27;ve seriously committed to these products</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out so not good for me....</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed to open my package to find that the cleanser had leaked all over the bag also holding the cream and the toner.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid these products would be too harsh...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t stray again and anyone wanting my supply of these products will have to pry them out of my cold, dead fingers.</li>
            <li> and while things could be worse, it was still irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have been dealing with acne since I was 13, I&#x27;m really tired of it.</li>
            <li> I am not one who likes to spend money on face creams, washes etc with false hopes of youth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and I&#x27;ve had annoying acne that I couldn&#x27;t get under control since I was about 16, and all the products I tried using made my skin really dry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in the middle of a very bad acne breakout.</li>
            <li> Although I have oily skin, I do not find the moisturizer too thick or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My skin used to feel like a reptile&#x27;s no matter which expensive cream or lotion I used.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> like I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be nothing but a bunch of dangerous chemicals for my face.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought that was really stupid of the creators of to do.</li>
            <li> Blech.  </li>
            <li> But this line is disgusting!  </li>
            <li> I had awful melasma</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff just does wonders on old skin.  I&#x27;m 63 and it&#x27;s firmed my face tremendously. I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> Have used these products for years! Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle! I have had fairly good skin since I came out of puberty. (13 years ago) Occasionally I would get a few pimples here and there but nothing major... Well about two months ago I experienced a horrible case of adult acne I&#x27;m not sure if it was my make up or vitamins that triggered it but my pores appeared to be so clogged and I had acne all over my face and nose. I tried so many things to clear it up and nothing worked. My brother told me about this product bc his dermatologist recommended it to him, I brought the product in within a week of using it my face began to clear up it has now been two weeks and my skin looks so clear and clean! This stuff really works! I use it twice a day but it is important to apply it in to a dry face as directed, you actually feel it stinging those pimples right off your face. After rubbing it in dry I rub it with a little water l then I rinse my face, dry my face and then I apply the toner and following that the moisturizer. It&#x27;s really good I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after a month if you&#x27;re having acne problems... Use this! It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spots on my face and this has substantially diminished the appearance of my blemishes I plan to continue using it to rid my face of these spots completely!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products clean n clear, proactive, Stridex, etc. and nothing seemed to help made it worse really. I have been to the dermatoligist and he has given me prescriptions for my acne. I am 35 yrs old and never had problems with acne when I was in school and now it seems it just won&#x27;t go away. He recommended Aqua Glycolic to me and told me where to purchase it from. I went right over and bought the facial cleanser and the face cream. I really could tell a difference in it after I started using it, in a few days my acne had improved and then went away. I have told both my teenage kids to use it and they to have had great luck with it. I have never used the toner before and I want to give it a try too! This is the cheapest place to purchase this product in a bundle! I WON&#x27;T purchase another acne cleanser or cream again! Being a Military wife we have lived in many different climates and I wish I had known about these products earlier!!</li>
            <li> I am grateful that my dermatologist recommemded these to me. She gave me some samples and I fell in love with these. I am especially sensitive to all skin lotions and facial stuff but to my surprise, I can tolerate these. My skin looks great and my pores are visibly smaller. I have lots of craters so this has helped.</li>
            <li> I really like these products and especially the fact that you can buy them in a set.  The cleanser works very well at cleaning the face,neck and decolletage areas and then follow with the toner.  Afterward use the cream on all areas but be careful to not use around the eye area!  I would highly recomment these products as I have noticed significant changes in age spots, scars and discolorations on my face.  You should also be well pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Will continue to purchase it  as long as I am able.  Has made my old skin new again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. My skin seems more taut and even after continued used of Aqua Glycolic products.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> First, let me preface this by saying I am 50 years old, and I am ALWAYS mistaken for being in my early 30s.  I have stayed out of the sun (because I have an allergic reaction to it).  So I have little sun damage.  I do have dark circles under my eyes (again from allergies, and not treating my eyes delicately), which nothing seems to cure so I rely on coverup.  And I am overweight so I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;too-thin, but still good-looking woman who looks like she works out a lot\\&quot; (the look all the over-40 women in Hollywood have).  Also, my skin is predisposed to dry/flakiness. And I have eczema.   I don&#x27;t tend to break out. I am not wrinkly, no real laugh lines or crows&#x27; feet. That&#x27;s the big picture.  But my skin does have a tendency to look \\&quot;dull.\\&quot;    All that being said, this stuff is great.  It keeps my skin looking fresh and clear.  I use the cleanser with a loofa sponge to give the exfoliating element an extra boost.  The toner is a little chemically-smelling, but it does a terrific job - and I think is probably the key to the results.  The cream (which I use day/night) is very moisturizing and rich.     I&#x27;ve used the Olay Regenerist/Total Effects and Definity lines, and this beats all three of them, hands down.  And all told, this is a cheaper product.    I was afraid these products would be too harsh...the whole \\&quot;acid peel\\&quot; angle sounded pretty caustic, especially with my dry skin.  But I gave them a shot, even though I&#x27;d never heard or read anything about them, except the reviews on Amazon, and I am DELIGHTED!  The three steps are easy-breezy, and the results are really very satisfactory.    I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product - it works well, especially the moisturizer.  Skin feels so smooth afterwards. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have also had problematic skin (acne - pimples and cysts), but this seems to be a worthwhile product regarding my Asian skin.  Aren&#x27;t Asians supposed to have great skin?  Somehow I got the short end of the stick, but this stuff helps tremendously!  It smooths out my skin and helps keep my skin clear.  The cleanser is not like your typical cleanser - it doesn&#x27;t lather or foam, but it does its magic regardless.  I just began the subscription and I&#x27;m not sure how long I will go, but I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years with good results. The only con is with the face wash. i first wash my face with regular soap and then use the face wash. The face wash alone does not clean all the dirt off your face.     These products were recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I bought the product looking for something to help control my oily skin (I have a mildly oily t-zone) as well as cleanse it and help fight against wrinkles. I used it for a week when I noticed my chin was starting to break out. I rarely breakout in this area. I continued to use the product hoping it would do as it states. On Sunday my daughter and I played with makeup afterwards washing our faces. I was surprised to see that the cream cleanser (does not lather at all) did not remove the makeup. I had to use my usual routine for removing makeup and have since stopped using this product. I do not have the time or patience to wash my face with two different cleansers twice a day. I prefer the nuetrogena daily face scrub. It&#x27;s cheaper, removes makeup, and helps mattify the oiliness of my facial skin also keeps me breakout free.  I think all in all this product lightened my skin a little, definitly did not cleanse properly, and the toner is toner any toner will do the same thing. I do not recommend this product for the use of cleansing. It may help fight wrinkles but I doubt that. This is definitly one of those waste your time and money products.   By the way I did not feel any tingling burning any sensation to let me know its working. The cream cleansers directions are to apply a generous amount to face and neck then add water and continue cleansing then rinse. When I did this the water rinsed the \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; right off. I also tried leaving it on my face a while while i took a shower to see if I would start feeling it nothing happend.   Like I said before the toner is a toner any other will work just as well.  The face cream does not smell at all. It has a very oily feel to it. Like it is oil based but it listes nothing of the sort in the ingredients. I used it at night and the only difference i noticed in my skin was it was slightly softer but definitly looked shinier. When used under makeup  it made my skin super greasy even on my cheeks and temples.  DO NOT WASTE YOURMONEY  It is so not worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally have medium tone, oily-combination &amp; somewhat sensitive skin.  However, I&#x27;m almost 37 &amp; recently developed what I think was hormone induced moderate acne &amp; possibly mild rosacea.  Over the past 6 months I&#x27;ve tried so many products for acne but NOTHING worked.  I researched some sites &amp; found AquaGlycolic products.  I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results after 1 month.  I also purchased the Clarisonic Pro &amp; use that along with the AquaGlycolic 3 part system (I use the face cream at night only) and wow what a difference.  Even the acne scars I had are disappearing &amp; my skin looks better &amp; is less oily.  My skin has changed almost completely.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the products or the price.  You have to be careful when in the sun (I use Oil of Olay regenersit moisturizer SPF 15 &amp; bare minerals make up also with SPF 15).  I love to tan a bit but I don&#x27;t need to tan my face when I have use make up &amp; bronzer anyway!</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser, toner and cream! My face is noticeably softer and more hydrated. Love it!</li>
            <li> I used this line of products faithfully in college after a dermatologist recommended it and had great success for many years, even with less than stellar lifestyle factors. Now in my late 20s, I&#x27;ve struggled (and I mean really struggled) with adult acne for several years as a result of switching contraception methods with different hormones. I never had any issues with my skin as a teenager or college student and it&#x27;s been quite a trying experience. However, after trying countless products (to cleanse, exfoliate, tone, mask, spot treat, moisturize - you name it) and a variety of methods (such as oil cleansing, spa facials, IPL photofacials, antibiotics, vitamin supplements, different hormone combinations, blue light therapy) in addition to improved lifestyle factors (such as a healthier diet, consistent exercise and more sleep)...I&#x27;m once again back to the Aqua Glycolic products and hormone combo that worked so well for me during those college years and my stubborn hormonal acne seems to finally be under control again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, take heed, this process doesn&#x27;t happen overnight! Both times I&#x27;ve seriously committed to these products **there has been a purging process** that takes about a month (in my experience) to resolve the hormonally-triggered skin issues. Although I realize that there isn&#x27;t one solution for everyone, I&#x27;m concerned that previous reviewers who were less enthusiastic about these products either gave up too soon or altogether have a different trigger for their acne. During this several week transitional period, spots will pop up in places on your face they usually don&#x27;t as the alpha hydroxy acids bring up the stuff that clogs pores, emulsifies it and then promotes faster cell turnover. The cleanser and toner might sting in particularly broken-out areas during this time but unless you suspect a larger allergic reaction, try to put up with this as much as you can. Also during this time I strive to use all three products twice a day, however there are instances when my skin feels overly dry or sensitive so I&#x27;ll swap the trio out for something gentler like Cetaphil cleanser and Cerave moisturizer for a round before going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My typical daytime routine consists of applying a few pumps of the Aqua Glycolic cleanser to a DRY face with my DRY fingertips (as instructed on the bottle), waiting about a minute and then rinsing as usual with warm water. (Note: the cleanser at first won&#x27;t feel very effective because it doesn&#x27;t sting on regular skin nor does it work into a rich lather, but just stick with it. It just takes some time, usually a week or two, to start seeing results). After cleansing, I apply the toner with a cotton ball and about a dime-sized amount of moisturizer all over my face, with a little extra on trouble areas. I wait a minute or two for this to absorb before applying a little bit of gentle day moisturizer (I like Aveeno Ultra-Calming Day Lotion), then sunscreen (IMPERATIVE! I use Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion+ Broad Spectrum 50+), then gentle makeup primer (Fresh Rose Primer) before my regular makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My typical nighttime regime begins with makeup removal using a drugstore brand makeup remover, then again using the cleanser on a DRY face with DRY hands. Just as before, after rinsing off the cleanser, I apply the toner and moisturizer. I really believe that these products are the most effective when used together because they are complementary - and this is coming from a girl who usually isn&#x27;t brand or collection-loyal. At night, I also apply an additional moisturizer but one that&#x27;s a little thicker such as the Cetaphil cream or Cerave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, although effective in many ways, I find these products a tad drying, which is why I add a little bit of another moisturizer on top of the AG cream. Otherwise, this line has helped clarify my skin by bringing deeply-rooted blemishes to the surface, fading leftover hyperpigmentation spots and improvingoverall skin texture to be smoother and more fresh-faced...especially now that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and a few faint lines that have appeared are already less noticeable. Yes, the transition period is a bummer. But even just using products that minimize active breakouts (that for me were often painful and deep jawline cysts) by bringing gunk to the surface more quickly has alone made a huge difference. Fading hyperpigmentation areas (again, daily sunscreen is key here) and smoother skin are awesome bonuses - not to mention help in reducing future wrinkles. I won&#x27;t stray again and anyone wanting my supply of these products will have to pry them out of my cold, dead fingers.overall skin texture to be smoother and more fresh-faced...especially now that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and a few faint lines that have appeared are already less noticeable.

            <li> I gave it a 4 only because I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks now, but so far it&#x27;s great!  Pores are smaller, skin is smoother, surface bumps gone.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many adult acne-prone skincare products including an all-natural, organic stuff.  I finally found out about this product through one of those blogs people write about their oily skin conditions and mentioned Amazon.  So, I read the reviews about this brand that I have never heard of before (not even from the many dermatologists I have seen in many years) and was impressed.  I gave it a try and it&#x27;s been a few weeks now since I began this complete regimen. Just a note: I do use this cleanser with my Clarisonic brush every nite and most mornings.  I do find that if I just use my hands to cleanse the makeup off, I can see makeup residue on the cotton pad saturated with their toner. Nice, that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance smell.  The toner has alcohol in it so it helps dry and \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the acne-prone areas.  I use the cream at night only since I am oily and I don&#x27;t need moisturizing during the hot summer days. My skin seems to be more even toned and smoother. My Dior AirFlash makeup looks much better on my skin since I started following this regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has definitely improved and every month I don&#x27;t get those huge forever red mosquito looking bumps \\&quot;then-turn-pimple\\&quot; anymore.  Since I began using the 3 products I don&#x27;t get 5 H-U-G-E pimples anymore on my chin.  Maybe just one, maybe... and it&#x27;s a normal pimple, people! I also found I stopped getting those white bumps too that have started to accumulate on my chin and near my eye socket near my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a former user of Obagi Nu Derm (for 2.5 years), Aveda Outer Peace (4 weeks), Cetaphyl, Neutrogena, ProActive, Clinique 3-step system (6mos.), Peter Thomas Roth (3 mos.), Estee Lauder Sparkling Clean (1month), Exuviance (2mos.) and many other brands I have used, returned or trashed because it only worked for 4 weeks or less (and I&#x27;m kinda broke now from buying so many products that promised to clear my acne and control the MEGA shine and oiliness), I think I can finally say I have found the best product for my adult acne-prone, super oily skin.  I shall hope (keeping my finger crossed) that this brand, Aqua Glycolic, will be the last product that I ever have to \\&quot;experience\\&quot; with and will continue to work for my skin type for the many years to come!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this set.  I am 32 and still dealing with bouts of acne.  Had it under control the past couple years using Alpha Hydrox products.  Then the past year I started getting acne bumps on my neck and under my jawline.  The kind that are small and spread and don&#x27;t pop, and are OH SO difficult to clear up.  So I have been trying new products containing glycolic acid since this is the only thing that ever worked for controlling my acne.  But this line is disgusting!  The cleanser is nothing more than a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t lather and feels like I am rubbing grease on my face.  And the actual lotion is entirely too greasy for people with even normal to oily skin.  My face is covered in oil within 15 minutes of putting it on and I&#x27;m having to blot with tissues.  Gross!  I tried just the toner in the afternoon, but oil also appeared on my face within 15 minutes of applying.  After using all three products for two weeks, I have been breaking out more and my skin has a film on it.  These products are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 16 years and I can tell you that I never have a blemish or breakout or have any lines and my skin looks great.  Before I would blemish and my skin was oily and shiny looking.  People compliment me on my complexion all the time now.  I look like I have baby skin now.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used it for many, many years now after my dermatologist recommended it. It helps my oily skin stay clear and blemish free, tightens my pores and makes my skin smooth and even toned. I can always tell a difference in the brightness of my skin when I use the Aqua Glycolic products. Friends, family and even strangers often make comments on how good my skin looks. I can&#x27;t live without the cleanser and toner! They are my favorites!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product by my gynocologist several years ago and to this day I refuse to use anything different.   It is a great product for a great price. If I am low on the face wash and I am low on money as well I will buy this product before other neccessities. It is the best product I have ever used on my face, and I have used everything.  I even got my sister using it and now she has it automatically sent to her once a month. She also refuses to use anything else.   Give it a try. I think you will like what you get.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and receive many compliments on my skin. It has become difficult to find in local drug store so I am pleased to get the entire kit with one click.  They will even set up a scheduled deliver every three months or so without you even ordering each time!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product! I use it every morning and it has managed to keep my skin so clear. It helps me to exfoliate, which is always helpful. Plus it helps to reduce redness on my skin, which has been quite a bit of a problem for quite a while. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I recently asked a Doctor about what skin care to use and he referred me to Aqua Glycolic. It is the most reasonable skin care product I have ever purchased.With the combination of Retin A 2x&#x27;s a week. My skin is soft and my wrinkles are softening.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this and it comes in a small, clear plastic bag. Nothing leaked and it was in perfect condition. Thank you! I discovered this product a few years ago and it cleared my mild acne. I use the hand and body lotion on my face because it&#x27;s a bit strronger than the face cream.</li>
            <li> Great product !  For all types of skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try and improve my skin. i started getting mild breakouts here and there and while things could be worse, it was still irritating. i switched  mineral makeups and tinted moisturizers thinking that could be the cause. after some research i decided to try this. it has been a month since i started using this. i am not crazy about the cleanser, it does not give you that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling(i understand the reviews with the filmy feeling). i have found that the toner and face cream are excellent, not greasy and absorbs quickly. the toner is alcohol based but it really deep cleans yet it may irritate dry or super sensitive  skin. i use this set at night and a oil free spf during the day to protect from sun. my face is smoother , more even toned and if i do get a small breakout ,it disappears in about a day. i only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the cleanser factor.</li>
            <li> I do not remember ordering this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product line for a reasonable cost. My skin is balanced and soft. I did breakout for a few weeks when I started using the product, but that has passed and my skin is crsytal clear. The body wash works great as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products faithfully since I bought them a month ago.They are helping me with sluffing off the dry winter skin. I would deffinitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and highly recommend it. Everything is unscented. I never became &amp;#34;immune&amp;#34; to the ingredients. My acne is gone and skin turns over faster (especially great if you have older skin). I can tell the difference when I stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I use just one squirt of the cleanser to clean my entire face in the shower each day. No redness or tightness. A bottle lasts me a many months. No smell. Toner has awesome dispenser where you just put a cotton ball on top of the bottle and press down. Plus it&#x27;s reusable. I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer much, but it feels nice. No benzoyl peroxide which can bleach clothing/linens. Some people react better to benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. I responded best to this.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No sunscreen (which I prefer, but you do get more sensitive to sun without it). Doesn&#x27;t come in travel size. More expensive than other kits, but it works well and your skin doesn&#x27;t tire of it.</li>
            <li> I worked in Dermatology for 4 years and would recommend this as a good alternative to the pricy skin care systems.  They are gentle on your skin and less irritating, and more affordable.</li>
            <li> This product actually works!  My dermatologist first gave it to me to use and then report my \\&quot;opinion\\&quot; on the product back to him.  My opinion would determine whether or not he would sell this product in his office or not.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, but I can honestly say THIS ONE WORKS!!  Cleanse your face and you THINK you get it clean, but then use this toner on a cotton pad and you&#x27;ll be amazed.  It&#x27;s just a remarkable product and I highly recommend it!  It also has the highest concentration of Glycolic Acid without an Rx. (I believe this info is still accurate).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW WEEKS AND HAVE NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. MY ACNE AND SCARS ARE STARTING TO CLEAR UP. MY MAIN PROBLEM IS THE BLACKHEADS ON MY NOSE, AND I THINK I CAN NOTICE A SMALL CHANGE. THIS PRODUCT IS EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT BURN. I AM PLEASED SO FAR :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Gentle bits breaks up the oil and keeps my skin clear and radiant.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;m over 50, still have super oily skin and breakouts.  The cleanser is indeed a non-lathering lotion and while mild, my skin feels so clean afterwards; not greasy, not oily and yay! my pores are clean!  I used the toner and it&#x27;s working great, too.  I especially love the laboratory style dispenser - minimizes any potential contamination of product, also prevents spilling even when I dropped it.  Because of my oily skin, I have always been hesitant to use any moisturizer. EVERYTHING I try makes me feel sticky, clammy and sweaty. I use just a little bit on my cheeks where they can get dry due to weather. Use a tiny bit on my throat and decolletage, too.  Glycolic Compound per their website 07/17/2015:  Cleanser 11%, Toner 11%, Moisturizer 10%.  For those who experience breakouts, just keep in mind that changing to any new product can seemingly increase breakouts in the beginning. Those pimples take a long time to form and can be under the skin before you use the product, some new products can just accelerate the eruptions (not the formation of) and once those are done, your skin will normalize.  I used Erno Laszlo for decades and they changed ingredients a few years ago. Blech.  Also, don&#x27;t ever throw out any moisturizer just because you don&#x27;t like it on  your face, use it on your forearms and the backs of your hands. Better than trashing  :D</li>
            <li> This is the only face care I have found that dramatically improved my age spots. I had awful melasma and now I barely have any age spots!I have been using this product for almost two years now and I will probobly use it for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> very great, really helped clear up my moderate acne when used twice a day!</li>
            <li> All three of these products are great. My dermotologist recommended to me for sun spots. I can see an improvement in my skin and also fine lines.The moisturizer works as well as any high end department store $90.00 moisturizer.  A great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Product leaked. Not sellers fault but packaging was wet and sticky. Not enough glycolic in product to work the way I had hoped and what Im used to in other glycolic brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered these products not because of acne problems, which I have very few, but I wanted to lighten my few years old freckles on cheeks and nose from the sun. I have been using all three for a couple of week now, and I really feel that my overall skin condition has dramatically improved - smoother, no new acnes, old acne scars and freckles are fading. These products really exceed all my expectations!! Highly recommended! Toner and cleanser feels really good on the skin, totally clean and not drying out your skin like I was afraid of. Like other users, I find the face cream a bit greasy so I just use it at night and wake up with a brighter skin daily - no exaggeration.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  I had to start off using it every other day because it did dry my face a little in the beginning.  The face cream, I used only as a night cream, because it caused my face to get too oily throughout the day.  Be careful in the sun!  Make sure you use a high SPF, as the label does warn that your skin is a lot more prone to get sun burn.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about 5 weeks ago as part of my daily evening routine.  I&#x27;m 30 and I&#x27;d describe my skin as pretty decent, but oily/combination with enlarged pores on my nose and a tendency to collect shine as well as breakout around my T-zone.  I also have some very mild (probably unnoticeable to anyone but me and my hyper-critical mother) sun spots and residual acne scarring.  These latter two are what I was specifically targeting with the purchase of the AGA system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with what this has done for my skin.  No breakouts beyond the stray spot or two since I began using this product; the pores on my nose are remarkably smaller; my shine has been reduced - now I only have to blot in the afternoons as opposed to mid-morning; and I find my sun spots and acne scarring are slowly fading as my skin tone grows more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I use it during the evening ONLY (I use Erno Laszlo during the day.  An amazing product but quite expensive) so note that this is in conjunction with other products.  I also will use an exfoliator - either face loofah or a scrub - prior to the facial cleanser as I find that the \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; texture insufficient in removing the day&#x27;s grime, sweat, dirt, etc.  My favorite part of this system is the toner by far.  It can be slightly harsh, but I don&#x27;t find it stripping at all and it&#x27;s thoroughly cleansing.  I think if I had dry skin, I might hesitate, however.  Some commentators have mentioned the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; moisturizer.  I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case, although a little goes a long way - I tend to only use a dime-sized amount.  This is from someone who usually slathers herself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - this product has worked effectively for me, but in conjunction with an exfoliator (purchased separately).  I recommend for night-time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser - 2 stars&lt;br /&gt;Toner - 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer - 3 stars</li>
            <li> I bought this in an attempt to try to get control of a sudden outbreak of moderate acne.  The cleanser and the toner were alright but the face cream was way, way too greasy for my skin!  My face practically shimmered from all of the grease.  Once I switched back to my Clinique oil free lotion I was much happier.  Overall, I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference after a few weeks of using just the cleanser and toner so I stopped using it.  After doing some reasearch, I found that glycolic acid isn&#x27;t really that effective against acne since it can&#x27;t exfoliate inside the pores.  Salycilic acid is what you need for that.  I&#x27;m now using Paula&#x27;s choice products and my acne is practically nonexistent.  This might be useful if you have alot of sun damage (that&#x27;s what glycolic acid is good for) and I would definitely only recommend the cream for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was a a little hesitant ordering thinking it was going to be too strong or not effective.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and can already feel and see the diff in my skin.  It has not caused any over drying or irritation. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality and results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but it was too strong for my sensitive skin.  My skin ended up dry, itchy and upset.  However, It might be good for younger acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Decent quality products that deliver what they promise for much less cost than similar competitors. Your skin feels clean and tingly without over drying. No need to over scrub your face, the product does most of the work.</li>
            <li> at first i wasn&#x27;t so sure about this product.  however, after a month of us, i can say that is it the best skin care product i have ever used.  the face cream i only use at night, however.  i have recommended it to everyone skin problems.  it is well worth the try!</li>
            <li> After reading great reviews on several sites &amp; having a family member swear by it, I decided to try Aqua Glycolic.  I do like the product, it works as promised.  I especially love the toner.  I am not sure if it will be my perfect, forever cleanser because I have not used it long enough.  But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for about 2 weeks and have noticed a change in my skin. It works great for blackheads, oily skin and skin discoloration from post acne. I will certainly continue using this product.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the glycolic acid but not to strong- I learned about from youtube. A must for any age and acne too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit to soon to see results since I have &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin but the product is giving it a softer look.</li>
            <li> A woman I work with recommended this product to me. One of the Doc&#x27;s we work with has a skin care clinic and told her about it. So my expectation were high when I received it. I have not been disappointed. It works great, my skin feels as soft as if I were paying for professional chemical peels (I use to get them monthly). With this product, I really not need to, my skin is soft and clear of breakouts. This will become my skin care of choice.</li>
            <li> My skin is super happy with this product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used Aqua Glycolic Alpha Hydroxy for a very long time -- It was recommended to me by my dermatologist -- all of the products are great.  The price was excellent!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this stuff really works well for me. Keeps my skin free and clear of zee zits. I&#x27;ve used a ton of other products with salicylic acid as the active ingredient and this stuff blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> I am not one who likes to spend money on face creams, washes etc with false hopes of youth. I have already spent years and money on everything and they never work. I really love how this makes my skin look and feel! NO it is not a miracle in a bottle and you won&#x27;t look 10 years younger, but your skin will glow... be even toned and soft and you will require less foundation! It is a slight peel effect. I enjoy all 3 products and plan to repurchase! I noticed a difference after only a few uses which is more than I can say for most products with false promises. The oily areas weren&#x27;t oily and the dry were no longer dry.</li>
            <li> Great purchase to find in packaged deal.  Great feel for your face.  You will love it.  Buy it now, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> A great skincare system from a trusted company.  Good ingredients, affordable, well packaged and really good results consistently day in and day out. I have combination skin and have loved the way this system has given my skin a balanced look and feel and it has definitely given me smoother looking and feeling skin. Pores are smaller as well. Ref: I&#x27;m 50-years-old and used the Alpha Hydroxy line before this.  It was good, but this is far superior in terms of healthful and helpful ingredients. The cleanser is so gentle, I&#x27;ve even used it as a moisturizer.  All good stuff!</li>
            <li> Good for my skin, keeps age spots under control. It is also very good for diabetic dry skin.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!!!! Makes my skin glow!!! And with this price?!! So worth it. Highly, highly recommended to anyone who&#x27;s thinking about getting it.</li>
            <li> Aqua Glycolic was recommended to me 10 years ago by my dermatologist for my adult cystic acne and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> Best total skin care I have found for my skin.  It leaves you skin feeling bright and clean without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I just received my 3 piece skincare system and have only used it once so far, but my face already feels clean and softer. The cleanser did sting a little bit but certainly no worse than other cleansers I&#x27;ve used made to control acne. No it doesn&#x27;t get soapy, but many other acne cleansers don&#x27;t get soapy either, so I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s an issue for some people.    I&#x27;m 39 and have been dealing with acne since I was 13, I&#x27;m really tired of it. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and most other otc products with little to no success in helping to clear my skin, which is also sensitive, so some products seem to cause more harm than good. I usually avoid using any kind of moisturizer on my face because they always make me break out. So, I&#x27;m giving this entire 3 piece system a try and I&#x27;m in the middle of a very bad acne breakout. I&#x27;ll see what happens and I&#x27;ll give an update when I have some results, good or bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for the anti-aging properties.  I love it!  I actually use the cleanser after I have cleaned my makeup off - more like a three minute mask.  I then use the toner, and then the moisturizer.  I have dry skin overall, but have some minor break-outs on my chin.  This system has helped both - my breakouts have cleared up and my skin tone is more vibrant and fresh-looking.  This may irritate some with sensitive skin and they may need to ease into usage, but I have been using salycilic acid and retin-a for some time now, so may skin easily tolerates twice daily usage - and seems to be the only product I need right now, so overfall, it&#x27;s also saving me money...will repurchase as soon as I need to.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and I will be buying more it really helps, all the stuff I&#x27;ve tried this is it! I will say with this.</li>
            <li> I first got samples for this from a plastic surgeon friend, and liked it.  Before buying, I checked percentages of glycolic acid and decided that this is the best deal.  I&#x27;ve used these for three months now, and my skin is visibly softer, lines diminished, and the tone is more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3-product kit is most economical, but I have excess cream left.  I added a small amount of 85% glycolic acid to it, and use that for body cream.  I tan easily and so was careless with my arms and legs when I was younger - this stronger mix has worked wonders on that old-lady skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Aqua Glycolic system for 2 weeks now and my skin looks amazing. The first week I used it I had some breakouts but I believe it was from the system clearing out my pores. I have some melasma spots on my forehead and upper lip area that are fading very quickly and my skin just glows. I have even noticed a huge reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  I had used this product a few years back with no success but decided to give another try after reading how many users use the cleaner as a mask. I keep the cleanser on for 2-3 minutes then was it off with a white facial cloth. I pat my face dry then apply the toner, wait until it drys then apply the cream. I am so impressed!</li>
            <li> The package was wet, the toner spilled and a lot was missing from it.Going to purchase from another vendor next time or hoping CVS has it</li>
            <li> I have been using this set for 3 years now after recommendation from my dermatologist. I have normal to oily skin with the occasional breakout. Since I have been using this no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this at week 6 of using this product. My skin does not exfoliate well so I&#x27;m always looking for a product with alpha hydroxy acids to help it along. My skin problems are occasional breakouts that leave behind dark spots. I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid before with good results so I thought this might work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does what it claims to. My skin exfoliated at a faster rate than normal, and it didn&#x27;t cause any unusual dryness. I did have a friend say my skin was looking good, and asked me what I was using. The one dark spot that I was particularly interested in getting rid of did fade, but not disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin can take the higher concentrations of AHA so I had no problem tolerating this. I think I will try a product with mandelic acid for the dark spot. They used that on me at my local day spa and it worked great. I would recommend this product as a good general maintenance kit for anyone interested in exfoliating/antiaging, but not specifically as an acne solution unless your acne is mild. Overall it&#x27;s a good product that does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the bottle of toner a bit unusual. You place your cotton pad on top and pump it. Took me a minute to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care system I have ever used.  I am a 44-year old woman with age spots, uneven skin tone and some middle age acne.  After using twice a day for about a month, my skins looks smooth, pores are smaller and skin tone is even...bonus is no more acne.  It takes getting used to --- the toner and face cream burn and itch a little but I am assuming it is because of the hydrolic acid.  However, after a month, my skin is used to it and my face has never looked better.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It said the products where gentle. I used them for 2 months and then I developed a chemical rash. To this day my skin has been dry and flaky. I believe I have Rosacea now. I&#x27;ts been 3 years and I fear my skin will never get better.</li>
            <li> Had to throw this mess away because it broke me out. I was trying to look for directions on how to use the system. There weren&#x27;t any written. Only how to apply. I thought that was really stupid of the creators of to do. Why create a 3-set product when you don&#x27;t even provide directions on how to use them in succession? What if you are a newbie to this? Anyway, I ended up throwing the whole set in the trash after several tries. It seemed to be nothing but a bunch of dangerous chemicals for my face. The two stars were only because it seemed to work for other people. So maybe it would for you. But it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I do not use it because it says for oily skin which I definitely do not have.  Can&#x27;t imagine how I got it . I am elderly and my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> When I saw my dermatologist recently, I asked him about skin care for my face.  I use dermalogica for my facial products, but have not been feeling like they are effective.  My dermatologist didn&#x27;t miss a beat in recommending Aqua Glycolic.  I was a bit nervous about using it as I have very sensitive skin.  I can only use it every other day or my skin gets really dry.  I do agree with another reviewer that it works better with the toner.  I can say that my skin looks great and one of the things I find is that my skin now accepts the Dermalogic skin care products much better and I am seeing more improvement from them!  I love this!  I would recommend this to anyone.  My doctor says that it is really helpful with acne problems, which I don&#x27;t have.  And as he says, &amp;#34;The best thing about it is that it works and it is cheap!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I order this product all the time and love it.  I was really disappointed to open my package to find that the cleanser had leaked all over the bag also holding the cream and the toner.</li>
            <li> Completely changed the way my skin acts. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months and I am very impressed! I recommend it to everybody. I have combo oily skin and issues with blackheads, my mother has dry sensitive skin and it works wonders for the both of us. Give it a couple months to work it&#x27;s magic and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It&#x27;s a very milky, soft liquid face wash and I prefer a little roughness to get my makeup off so I use it with my Clairsonic or a washcloth.</li>
            <li> This product works well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage son.  Works wonderfully and much cheaper than Dr. Office pricing on same quality item.  Doesn&#x27;t dry him out as most would.</li>
            <li> This will keep your skin moist and softer than a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue.</li>
            <li> I started using these products suggested by my dermatologist. I used them for many years. I always have had compliments on how smooth and young my skin looked. I am 53 years old. I have NO wrinkles. The way that these products work is not only do they deep cleanse your skin, but they speed up cell turnover. I have also used the shampoo and body wash as well as the body lotion. If you have problem skin, I highly recommend using these products. I started using them because I had enlarged pores. I now have none. Smooth flawless skin. Isn&#x27;t that what we all want?</li>
            <li> I am almost thirty, oily skin, prone to breakouts. This dried up my acne flare up within 2 days and after almost a week my skin is noticeably smoother, tighter, and less oily. I gave this a try after using another brand of glycolic face wash which worked well for me and can say that it is gentler and non-drying yet just as effective. Will definitely purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> After getting the dreaded dark spots on my face I&#x27;d read that glycolic acid helps. I had another brand and it helped a bit, but I felt I needed something with a higher % so I tried this. I will say right away you can tell the difference. At times you can feel burning and when I first began using it I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to continue as my skin was getting dry &amp; bumpy and this was only once a day or every other day. I had a hunch I should stick with it and hope my skin got used to it and luckily it has. Really helping with the dark spots and they&#x27;re barely noticeable now. Do wish it helped shrink my pores better, but it is doing what I bought it to do!</li>
            <li> I posted almost the same review for other Aqua Glycolic products, because they deserve it...Great AHA products.  I started by using the cleanser and toner once a day, and now use it twice. I have an oily T-zone, with the rest of my face being dry in the winter.  However, the cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my dry skin and leaves my oily zones well cleansed.  The toner keeps the shine on my T-Zone down, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the rest of my face (even in the winter).  I occasionally use the Aqua Glycolic cream on the rare painful pimple.  I also have sensitive facial skin (I break out in eczema with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), but haven&#x27;t had a reaction to any of Aqua Glycolic&#x27;s products, and they&#x27;ve helped to keep my mild to moderate acne in check.  I also use Retin-A to treat my acne, and using these high concentration AHA products at the same time has saved me from the unsightly peeling that many who use Retin-A complain about (especially in the first few months of Retin-A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. the Aqua Glycolic shampoo/body wash has also helped exfoliate my occasionally dry and dandruffy scalp...yes, I&#x27;m a Aqua Glycolic fan, but they&#x27;ve earned it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I first read about it in shape magazine about 6 years ago. It is a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have recommended it to many...and now to you. &lt;br /&gt;I started using these products maybe 15 years ago after being told about them by a friend.  She had a necessary procedure done on her face by a well known cosmetic surgeon. He suggested using this range of products. I know that scarring depends on quality of skin and the surgeons skill, but, virtually NO scarring. I swear its this stuff.  It worked just like he said it would, and after that example, I have been using it ever since. The stuff is inexpensive, works great, I am 42 with hardly any lines, I love this stuff.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> This trio has cleared up my acne and it makes my face look great!  I would highly recommend it for adults who still have problems with zits.  Plus, it is anti-aging!  Don&#x27;t pass this up!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing group of products I have ever used! I bought them all. My skin is smooth. No oil clogged pores, and my pores actually got smaller! People think I had Botox or filler! I have told all my friends about this with my own disclaimer: &amp;#34;If you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it from you!&amp;#34; The skin on my body feels silky and smooth. I live in San Diego, CA, and we have very low humidity. My skin used to feel like a reptile&#x27;s no matter which expensive cream or lotion I used. I shampoo with and use the body wash in the shower. I shave my legs with the body wash... razor glides over my skin... I am amazed at what comes off my face on a cotton ball when I use the toner, (even after cleansing)! The heels of my feet were cracking and snagged the sheets. Not any more. My feet are like a princess&#x27; ! My manicurist even noticed that my hands and cuticles were smoother. The wrinkles on the nape of my neck and top of my chest have disappeared!!&lt;br /&gt;There may be a small breakout as the toxins leave your skin, but that lasts only a few hours. Follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Never take this product off the market or have low or no stock... What would I do?? I am 66 years old and look 50ish!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some kind of skin care line with glycolic acid and I didn&#x27;t want to have to sign up for a monthly shipment type of thing.  Aqua Glycolic from Amazon fit the bill, the price was the best I found on the web, and so far I love the results!!</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive product! I have tried many expensive,inexpensive, prescription, and over-the-counter skin care systems but I really like this one. In about one week I could see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I started with the soap and liked so much I tried the toner and night cream.  My acne prone face has never been better.  This is the best face product line I have ever used and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out so not good for me....</li>
            <li> I used the product trio (cleanser, toner and lotion) twice daily for a month.  I experienced no stinging, burning or redness.  The cleanser is creamy and does not lather (I prefer lather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was not any \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; difference in my skin.  My skin might have been a little smoother, but not so noticeable that I could tell for sure.  The breakout issue might have been a little better, not a lot better.  I could not tell any difference in the size of the pores as the other reviewers say they can.  The one big difference I could really see was that this product really \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; my skin - not an effect I wanted to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who want to lighten your skin / fade your tan - go for it.  However, I won&#x27;t purchase these products again.  From a facial cleansing standpoint, I can purchase something a lot less expensive and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleansers to help clear up my acne and Aqua Glycolic is by far the most effective product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works great and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for several years - since my dermatologist recommended them to me.  My skin texture on my face improved  soon after I started using them.  I&#x27;m 45 and worshipped the sun too much when I was younger.  I thought by now I&#x27;d look like a leather handbag.  But I have very few fine lines and I believe this product has helped maintain smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne as an adult and have tried numerous medications.  This is the first treatment that has actually made a difference.  The side benefit is that is gets rid of fine lines and improves the look of your skin.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this product, but sometimes you gotta step out on faith and out of your comfort zone and try new things. Glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was a teenager. I&#x27;m 23 now and I FINALLY have clear skin. It took about a month to really clear up all breakouts. Now Im just left with some scarring but luckily make up can cover that. I&#x27;d much rather cover flat scars than big bumpy red pimples. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Out of all 3 products the cleanser works the best and is amazing. I would definitely order the cleanser again and from amazon</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, so I was a little skeptical at first ...but after my first peel (2 weeks not even)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ALL in &amp; would really recommend this product to anyone especially if you suffer from acne!</li>
            <li> Worked excellently just like my dermatologist predicted! I will be buying the cleanser and toner again. The moisturizer is too thick for my liking though.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me, but does not mean that it won&#x27;t work well for others.  My skin is naturally on the dry side, and this product had my face very oily not even two hours after application.  I only used sparce amounts.  This was recommended to me by my doctor, however, i&#x27;ll have to find something else.</li>
            <li> The toner is amazing! Love the cream too. Makes a huge different in my skin and my husband even says I look like I&#x27;m glowing</li>
            <li> I can really see the results and difference after trying the kit for just a week. In the morning and evening, I use these products. I use the cleanser and let it sit for one to three minutes before rinsing my face. There&#x27;s a little bit burning sensation that I feel using it. Then I use the toner and gently spread throughout the my face and to the areas where the treatment is needed. At first I felt a burning sensation so I need to get close to the fan to ease this burning. After that, I use the cream. My experience using these products, at first I&#x27;ve felt the burning sensation and my face became itchy and had some red bumps so I tried not to scratch my face. This itchy and red bumps indicate that my face hasn&#x27;t yet adopt these kind of chemicals. But after two days these effects were gone. I still feel the burning sensation when using them but they are not as bad as my first time using them. I&#x27;ve been using other products to my face in order to get rid of my acne and especially my dark spots. And also, these other products take time to see the results. However, after buying and using just this glycolic acid kit, I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark spots due to acne quickly fade away. I&#x27;ve seen that my right side of my face are starting get smoother and lighter. And also, my acne scars are also fading away. On the other hand, my left side of my face has still dark spots but they are also fading away. I don&#x27;t use any other products besides this kit and a sunscreen. I use Elta MD sunscreen spf 46 because it is designed for those who have oily face and acne prone face. I would highly recommend this product because it is effective and you can really see the maximum results.</li>
            <li> love this product, I have been using it for 5 years and it keeps my skin discoloration under control, and works great for acne also.</li>
            <li> So my face has seen years of sun and although I do take care of myself, I dont always use the best products. I&#x27;m 41 and have some uneven skin tones and small wrinkles starting, I know I&#x27;m not alone. After hours of internet research and questioning Microdermabrasion or a chemical peel I bought the Aqua Glycolic Alpha Hydroxy Acid Skin Care System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well its day 3 and already see results! I actually wasnt thinking Id even see/feel a difference for a month. My skin feels so soft. As for the uneven tone and wrinkles, I&#x27;m hoping over time this product will help. The product has a very slight sting to it when using it, which makes me feel like its going to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May have been to early to write a review, but I&#x27;m really impressed so far and wanted to spread the news.</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I use this product to minimize scarring on my face after a facial procedure. It worked!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some problem areas due to exposure to the sun...this has helped more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is just like Blitzkrieg for your skin, it will eliminate roughness and acne an multiple ways with Glycolic acid which is godsend for acne! This set is a convenient and economical way to start this AHA regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser: This is a rather unique cleanser as it is used like a cleansing oil. The consistency is like a  cream gel that emulsifies into a cream-oil and then washes away easily. To use, you take dry hands and apply a liberal amount to dry face. Massage it around, during this time you should really massage your face because you&#x27;ll notice the cleanser will really get into the pores and little flecks of dirt and roughness will come out of your skin. Afterwards, get some water on the tips of your finger and massage onto your face to melt the cream, which will then turn into an oil and carry away all the dirt and skinflakes. Then rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my skin feels very clean but not tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner: The toner has alcohol in it so it might be drying, but I find that it is very effective on cutting oil from my face and getting it super clean, if you have acne this will sting your pimples, which means it&#x27;s working. I can only recommend this for people with acne or oily skin because it might be too strong for dry skin users and they probably wont benefit as much from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: This moisturizer can also cause flaking if you have dry skin, or if used more than once or twice a day. However, like I said before, this is great for oily and acne skinned people. It dries up my acne and causes the swelling to go down. For acne that is still active, it helps it come to head faster. I put it on at night and in the morning my face is smooth and bright, and my acne heals. It is not oily as it absorbs in 10 mins.The acid in this can also sting the eyes so don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I super recommend this for oily and acne skinned people. If you have combination skin or regular skin, I can also see this helpingwith mattifiying your skin and or evening skin tone and making your overall appearance brighter. If you experience dryness of flaking, you should either not use all the products at once, or use it less often. I had some flaking in the beginning but my skin adjusted and now I am really satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> This product is working great for me.  After three weeks to one month my skin is smoother and looks firmer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been having problems with sun spots and this has dramatically lightened them. Even my husband asked what I was doing different. People at work asked what I was doing different too. I noticed fine lines diminished and a fresher look to my skin, Love it. Wish they sold a huge bottle for entire body.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old skincare junky with combination skin. Aqua Glycolic was recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago. I was a loyal user for a long time, but eventually decided to try a couple other brands (Dermadoctor Wrinkle Revenge Glycolic Acid Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads). Nothing else comes close to working as well as Aqua Glycolic. AG is really effective at clearing away dead skin, fading red marks, and smoothing fine lines without the harshness/dryness of the other brands. I usually put the cleanser on dry, clean skin and leave it on for 20 minutes, then add water and rinse it off. (The cleanser isn&#x27;t ideal for removing makeup, so at night I wash my face first with Cetaphil bar soap then follow with AG.) The toner is fantastic! Very well balanced with no stinging or dryness. I use Skinmedica moisturizer on my face, so the Aqua Glycolic moisturizer I usually use on my hands. I will not be switching brands again. Nothing else matches the effectiveness or price of AG. Highest of recommendations for this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use ProActiv, but I wanted to try something new.  I have a bit of adult acne and this works just as well as ProActiv.  The toner does sting and if you rub too hard it will burn your skin.  I had a dry red mark for a couple of days.  Overall, my skin looks much better than before I used it.  I don&#x27;t like the moisturizer at all greasy, yet very drying?  I would buy cleanser and toner again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I had been going to a dermatologist for months to try to control my breakouts.  I tried all the things that were recommended including the glycolic washes and toners sold through the doctors office.  This product was less expensive and seemed to do a better job.</li>
            <li> I have been using this skin care line for 5 years and it is the best.  I am going to be 43 this year and my skin looks great and has plenty of moisture.  Make sure you use sunblock with this product, as it can make you sensitive to sunburn.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the benefits of all the aqua glycolic skin care products I purchased  ... however, the facial cleanser does not ship well. at least 1/4 of the product had leaked out.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with annoying adult acne on and off, especially around my time of the month, and after using benzoyl peroxide for a while my skin had extra dry spots that would get inflamed. I turned to this as a milder treatment that cleansed my face and kept it clear withoit drying it. I use the cleanser everyday 2 times and the toner everyother day, and the moisturizer from time to time because it is very very strong. This stuff is seriously the key to clear skin</li>
            <li> Iv been using this product for 2 weeks and I can already see a difference in my face clarity!</li>
            <li> I love these skin care products. They truly improved my skin. Although I am not young, I still get breakouts in the hot humid summer weather. After using the Aqua Glycolic regime-cleanser, toner, and moisturizer for just a week, I saw my skin was smoother and NO breakouts. I have been using the products for at about six weeks and still no acne, and even fine lines around my mouth and forehead are less apparent. My skin really feels clean. I use the moisturizer only at night and my skin is not greasy the next morning, but looks fresh. I think you couldn&#x27;t find another skin care system for the price that helps both breakouts and aging skin. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Aqua Glycolic is wonderful to use on your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it refreshed and blocks unwanted blackheads.  Love that I Aqua Glycolic found wipes too. This was recommended to my Aunt, whom she told me to buy from her Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It works great on my body though, so that is what I am going to use it for from now on. It was just a little to much for my sensitive, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I saw results within a week!  Best over-the-counter regimen to date that I have found and for a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> I love the aqua glycolic products, especially the face cream! I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser and face cream for a few months now and got such great results that I decided to get the toner as well. I was quite disappointed when I opened this order and the toner had spilled, leaving only half of the bottle. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Been using these products for years. I believe they come from the lab that makes some very pricey brands. These products are actually better and less expensive. If you use it every day, your skin will feel like glass without much irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This product sounded like a fantastic daily cleanser. Unfortunately, for my oily skin it only clogged my pores, the toner stung and the moisturizer was too heavy. Wish it would have worked better- but it definitely did not work any wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I love Aqua Glycolic. I used to get it here in  the city. But the only store That carried the entire system recently closed down. I&#x27;m glad I found it here. It&#x27;s the only product that works on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok this stuff is so serious. Saw results on the first day. My hubby says \\&quot;what did you put on your skin?\\&quot; I was so unprepared for anyone to notice (especially him). This stuff is a knockout punch.</li>
            <li> The body cream is more effective for the ace.That is what my Dermatologist said.If it doesn&#x27;t burn on application use on face.</li>
            <li> Product recommended by my dermotologist (she uses it). Love cleanser and toner, but cream is way too greasy. Excellent price for quality compared too other products used.</li>
            <li> I always buy this set. Its amazing and clears up my skin. I would absolutely buy again. I generally wear the cream at night after I use the toner. The wash I put on before I get into the shower and I love it. Before using this I use to break out on my back but now I find that I have no backne!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve used many products. This one has actually shrunk my pores. I&#x27;m really amazed. In just a few weeks I&#x27;ve seen considerable change in my skin. I plan on continuing the use of this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks once a day at night and I LOVE IT... After having some bad acne breakouts this really helped clear up my skin. It doesn&#x27;t help with the scarring however my sking looks clear and radiant! I&#x27;m also doing a package of quemical peels at my dermatologist to help with the scarring! I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and still struggle a bit with a little bit of acne around the chin area.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING in the book...ProActiv, almost everything off the shelf.  I had some success with some medication (pill form) previously but prefer not to go that route if it can be helped.  I bought this as a kit as it was cheaper then just buying the face wash and the toner.  I do NOT use the face cream.  My skin usually doesn&#x27;t do well with such products, causing me to break out more.  This one just looks greasy when I opened it too.  However, I have been using the face wash and toner for 2-3 weeks and have noticed DRASTIC improvement. I also start with an Apricot scrub, you can get a $2 container from Target.  My GF has even mentioned how much better my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test is quickly approaching as my skin tends to be a little worse during the summer.  For now, I plan on purchasing this product again.  Unless I follow up with something, you can take it to the bank that its getting me through the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and I&#x27;ve had annoying acne that I couldn&#x27;t get under control since I was about 16, and all the products I tried using made my skin really dry and my skin just looked older and stiff, especially around my smile lines. I&#x27;ve been using the Aqua Glycolic regime for almost a year now and it is hands down the best regime that I&#x27;ve tried. It keeps my acne under control, it&#x27;s gentle, AND it makes my skin look younger. I don&#x27;t plan on switching regimes any time soon, and I highly recommend this product if you are having the same problems that I was having.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 13 years and I will never use anything else. I had severe acne as a teen and into my late 20&#x27;s. To say I tried a few products is an understatement and eventually started taking accutane. It helped a lot but still my skin was never &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;. I saw an ad for Aqua glycolic and gave it a try. It was and is, AMAZING!! I&#x27;m 40 now and I do get an occassional blemish but my skin looks great. I get compliments all the time on how young I look and my &amp;#34;great skin&amp;#34;. I still can&#x27;t believe it when I hear it.  :) Lisa</li>
            <li> nice products that work well if you use them on a regular basis. They&#x27;ve lasted me a long time too and the trick is to put the products in the cupboard and forget you bought them until a year later. A terrific savings.</li>
            <li> Have seen immediate results.  My dermatologist sells this product in her practice, but did not purchase on my last visit, so I ordered here.  Excellent basic system that works well for my acne, as an adjunct to my derm visits. Although I have oily skin, I do not find the moisturizer too thick or unpleasant. You could spend more money on other brands, but I doubt they would deliver any more results. Not highly fragranced. Great for men and women. Recommended by my dermatologist. Packaging is &amp;#34;cheapish&amp;#34; and the cleanser pump top would stick on first order, but not second. Toner bottle pump for cotton ball is impractical if you don&#x27;t use them, or if you are a man, since cotton balls on a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow makes no sense at all in the evening. I have to remove the toner bottle top.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me years ago by my dermatologist. I had some little under-the-skin imperfections that I wanted him to work on and he told me to use this product since I could get it whenever I needed it and he said that it was as good as any prescription for that particular problem. I found it and used it and IT WORKED! It isn&#x27;t available at most drugstores but can be found at stores that specialize in dermatological needs. Now it is available online of course, which is wonderful.  I highly recommend these Aqua Glycolic products: Toner and Facial Cleanser.  The Face Cream is great too, but will leave your face shiny, so you might not want to use it if you are going to be in public afterwards. The Toner and the Facial Cleanser will not make you shiny. At first they might seem a bit strong and may cause some redness, but you will quickly adapt to these products and love them. The cleaner takes more of your getting-ready time since you wash your face with it, but the toner can be applied anytime even if you are in a hurry. They might seem expensive, but the quantities you receive will last a very long time. Try it.</li>
            <li> Review from the wife: Fine lines and wrinkles have all but disappeared. Adult acne has also disappeared. During a recent meeting, someone I just met asked me what year I was in college! My skin is so soft and supple. Moisturizer works all day. Looks great under makeup.</li>
            <li> I use to work in a dermatologist office many years ago. And I was using glytone products. I liked then well enough but in the last month I was starting to realize my skin wasn&#x27;t looking as good as it was. So I was shopping around. And after reading all the reviews in this product and doing outside of amazon research I figured I would give it a try. I am so in LOVE with this product. My face looks amazing and my husband even said so tonight. I hopefully will never have to change.</li>
