    <ol>
            <li>My hubby&#x27;s go to product, great deal and great product</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It has done wonders for my childs hair, a great improvement.</li>
            <li>All in all seems the AC products are good products.</li>
            <li>But Crew is manly and makes my man feel good about his head.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good and tingles when on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>nice shampoo, keeps the hair looking good and dandruff free.  </li>
            <li>Love having a flake free hubby who smells nice too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders did a way better job.</li>
            <li>This nice shampoo from American Crew works better than Head &amp; Shoulders while being much more pleasant and easier on your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo off and on for almost 10yrs to help with dandruff (mine primarily occurs in the winter months).</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and packaged securely.</li>
            <li>Good to use on a  daily basis.</li>
            <li>After shampooing my hair the FIRST time with this shampoo, the flakes were gone!</li>
            <li>My hair is longer than most guys but not down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I purchased this from my local barber, it has worked great now for the last two months.</li>
            <li>and I really like what they&#x27;ve done with their packaging in their product lines not that it matters for the specific product but is just kind of neat.</li>
            <li>The only shampoo I use; American Crew seems to have replaced it with a product called &amp;#34;Anti-Dandruff and Sebum Control Shampoo&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t have as good an effect.</li>
            <li>Then, I found Anti Dandruff by American Crew, in one week it has been able to almost disappear or really diminish the dandruff.</li>
            <li>I was very embarressed by mine but didnt really want to talk to anyone about it.</li>
            <li>This really got rid of the dandruff</li>
            <li>I would use selsun blue the original and that was fantastic going back to that.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other comparable product without damaging the hair.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many other brands.</li>
            <li>Works Better than ANY other shampoo and my hair is getting thicker</li>
            <li>This product has natural tea tree ingredients and is far better for your hair than the over the counter productions such as Selson Blu.</li>
            <li>American crew seems to be a cool brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years to help with mild scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with some flake problems.</li>
            <li>I started having the same problems with a super, super dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I get flaky scalp in the winter, this was the first shampoo that actually stopped it.</li>
            <li>Also this shampoo tinges the scalp esp if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>because they seem to work at least as well, probably better.</li>
            <li>I had to clean the cap a few times and ended up just tossing it and using the bottle without</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that has ever had a visible effect on my dandruff (and that also smells decent).</li>
            <li>In one wash I felt better and noticed my scalp was less itchy and saw less dandruff.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other dandruff shampoos, this one has a pleasant mint smell to it, instead of some nasty chemical/medicine smell.</li>
            <li>Have tried all the low priced Anti-dandruff shampoos, stops itching but doesn&#x27;t remove the dry scalp completely.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in larger sizes and that it&#x27;s not more widely available.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have dry scalp the next day.</li>
            <li> I tried other dandruff shampoos such as Head &amp; Shoulder and Selsun Blue but they did NOTHING to get rid of the dandruff.</li>
            <li> This one is not a complete solution to dandruff.</li>
            <li> Also I been using tea tree by  american crew for two weeks and not really seeing benefits I used tea tree by dessert essence and my hair still had dandruff</li>
            <li> the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to other easier to get, and</li>
            <li> work for husband and is not gross like other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I can finally wear dark colored clothing again.</li>
            <li> I use all 3, usually the dandruff shampoo 2-3 times a week and the regular shampoo and conditioner daily.</li>
            <li> Especially for someone who likes to wear black suits all the time.</li>
            <li> I dont see the point of tea tree at least as far as hair goes.</li>
            <li> I left it on for a few minutes and then rinsed.</li>
            <li> At the age of 28, I developed a serious dandruff problem out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> I even tried washing my hair every other day to no avail.</li>
            <li> I cannot declare whether it does this or not, however, and I can say that it controls dandruff/dry scalp probably not as well as some other shampoos I have used.  </li>
            <li> Pert PLus just has such negative connotations associated with it.</li>
            <li> but there is significantly less dandruff.</li>
            <li> I purchased the AC shampoo and conditioner as well, not sure if it&#x27;s the Anti-dandruff shampoo itself or a combination of all three</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that a shampoo could do that after one use, but it did.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap gets clogged with the shampoo because it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other cosmetics I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job that&#x27;s required!</li>
            <li> Tgel was not effective at all (smelled bad - medicine like)  </li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t make him insecure to use Crew.</li>
            <li> Dandruff is lame.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and terrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> so I desperately searched the internet for a solution.</li>
            <li> and I was very skeptical of this one until I reluctantly tried this one.</li>
            <li> The handicapped man I take care of uses this and before he did his dandruff was horrible, now he hasn&#x27;t had a problem since.  </li>
            <li> I did however try head and shoulders and that was horrible</li>

            <li> Have tried all the low priced Anti-dandruff shampoos, stops itching but doesn&#x27;t remove the dry scalp completely. This one is not a complete solution to dandruff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my local barber, it has worked great now for the last two months. I get flaky scalp in the winter, this was the first shampoo that actually stopped it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks now. I purchased the AC shampoo and conditioner as well, not sure if it&#x27;s the Anti-dandruff shampoo itself or a combination of all three but there is significantly less dandruff. I use all 3, usually the dandruff shampoo 2-3 times a week and the regular shampoo and conditioner daily. I have stopped using any gel or mouse as well. All in all seems the AC products are good products.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use; American Crew seems to have replaced it with a product called &amp;#34;Anti-Dandruff and Sebum Control Shampoo&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t have as good an effect. Looks and smells like spearmint syrup, I don&#x27;t know how else to promote this.</li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s go to product, great deal and great product</li>
            <li> The handicapped man I take care of uses this and before he did his dandruff was horrible, now he hasn&#x27;t had a problem since.  This stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product. I did however try head and shoulders and that was horrible I used it once a week it did nothing when I was a kid I would use selsun blue the original and that was fantastic going back to that. Also I been using tea tree by  american crew for two weeks and not really seeing benefits I used tea tree by dessert essence and my hair still had dandruff I dont see the point of tea tree at least as far as hair goes.</li>
            <li> Having dandruff is something no one likes to talk about. I was very embarressed by mine but didnt really want to talk to anyone about it. I thought Head and Shoulders was the only product out there and it wasn&#x27;t helping. I went to go get my hair cut and the lady washed my hair with this product at the end and I didn&#x27;t have dry scalp the next day. I have been using it ever since. I massage it in for two minutes and use conditioner and it seems to work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo off and on for almost 10yrs to help with dandruff (mine primarily occurs in the winter months). I purchased it after my dad recommended it because his stylist had used it on him and he found it actually worked. Unlike many other dandruff shampoos, this one has a pleasant mint smell to it, instead of some nasty chemical/medicine smell.</li>
            <li> Love having a flake free hubby who smells nice too! And, it doesn&#x27;t make him insecure to use Crew. Pert PLus just has such negative connotations associated with it. But Crew is manly and makes my man feel good about his head.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wintertime since I always seem to get dandruff. This shampoo smells good and tingles when on the scalp. I left it on for a few minutes and then rinsed. In one wash I felt better and noticed my scalp was less itchy and saw less dandruff. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> This product has natural tea tree ingredients and is far better for your hair than the over the counter productions such as Selson Blu.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several years to help with mild scalp psoriasis.  My wife is a stylist, and she turned me on to this product and whenever I lapse in having some, I can tell within several days.</li>
            <li> I had an episode of dandruff so I desperately searched the internet for a solution. I had an european shampoo before called Kelual DS but I could not get it here in the US. Then, I found Anti Dandruff by American Crew, in one week it has been able to almost disappear or really diminish the dandruff. It also smells amazing. Totally Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and terrible dandruff. This is the only shampoo that has ever had a visible effect on my dandruff (and that also smells decent).</li>
            <li> At the age of 28, I developed a serious dandruff problem out of nowhere. My hair is longer than most guys but not down to my shoulders. I tried other dandruff shampoos such as Head &amp; Shoulder and Selsun Blue but they did NOTHING to get rid of the dandruff. I bought this product based on reviews and after a week I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some commented on the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other cosmetics I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job that&#x27;s required!</li>
            <li> I have tried literally every anti-dandruff shampoo out there over the years and I was very skeptical of this one until I reluctantly tried this one. I am so glad that I did. I no longer have to be concerned about itching and I can finally wear dark colored clothing again. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in larger sizes and that it&#x27;s not more widely available.</li>
            <li> Didnt work. Head and shoulders did a way better job. Also this shampoo tinges the scalp esp if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dandruff is lame. Especially for someone who likes to wear black suits all the time. This really got rid of the dandruff and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it trying out my scalp or anything like that. American crew seems to be a cool brand and I really like what they&#x27;ve done with their packaging in their product lines not that it matters for the specific product but is just kind of neat.</li>
            <li> I had doubts about this product, but after using I have seen results and I am amazed. Overall I am happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this four years ago and it saved my scalp. I started having the same problems with a super, super dry scalp. I even tried washing my hair every other day to no avail. My scalp was still flaking.......badly. I remembered that I had used this before so I ordered it. After shampooing my hair the FIRST time with this shampoo, the flakes were gone! It&#x27;s hard to believe that a shampoo could do that after one use, but it did. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks, and the flakes are gone.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product because it is supposed to have properties that help fight fungus, such as ringworm.  I cannot declare whether it does this or not, however, and I can say that it controls dandruff/dry scalp probably not as well as some other shampoos I have used.  Also, the cap gets clogged with the shampoo because it is very thick.  I had to clean the cap a few times and ended up just tossing it and using the bottle without the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to other easier to get, and cheaper products because they seem to work at least as well, probably better.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other comparable product without damaging the hair.  I highly recommend this for anyone with some flake problems.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find. It has done wonders for my childs hair, a great improvement. Have tried many other brands.</li>
            <li> work for husband and is not gross like other dandruff shampoos. Arrived on time and packaged securely. Good to use on a  daily basis.</li>
            <li> This nice shampoo from American Crew works better than Head &amp; Shoulders while being much more pleasant and easier on your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried T-gel, now this Crew.  Tgel was not effective at all (smelled bad - medicine like)  Crew gave temporary relief but still itched later in the day.  On to test the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works Better than ANY other shampoo and my hair is getting thicker</li>
            <li> nice shampoo, keeps the hair looking good and dandruff free.  only washing about once a week, and always cleans the grease well</li>
