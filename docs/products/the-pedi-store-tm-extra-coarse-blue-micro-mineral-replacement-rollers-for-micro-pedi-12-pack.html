            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Sorry they may fit emjoi</li>
            <li> I follow up with these after using the extreme coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> It seems to drag when spinning.</li>
            <li> I have ever owned - the little courser replacements work</li>
            <li> Also they were not own as advertised.  </li>

            <li> Item as described. Fast ship. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I like the convenient plastic case these replacement rollers are packaged in. It is very easy to open and store the extra rollers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as name brand, but then a bit cheaper in price.  I found that a detail sander works much better and is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Thia ia not even close the the quality of the  rollers that came from the manufacturer. They are not coarse but extra fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I have had a Emjoi Micro Pedi for about 4 yrs and it is the best product for the feet I have ever owned - the little courser replacements work just wonderful.  Highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> I follow up with these after using the extreme coarse rollers. Works great.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to do my pedicures with this, I i buffs off all the dead skin skin and the I can paint and have BEAUTIFUL feet.  the nail attachment is a bonus</li>

            <li> The refills fit my Micro Pedi and work beautifully!  Highly recommended for anyone who wants quality refills at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> These rollers have a line in them where the paper material is joined together.  It hits each revolution and wears off the grit every time.  Also they were not own as advertised.  I would not buy them again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Good fit and good life.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Fits the Emjoi Micro-Pedi perfect</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the emjoi micro pedi as well as the name brand. It seems to drag when spinning. Also does not have as much texture so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I will buy the original name brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Sorry they may fit emjoi but they do not perform well in the devce.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling these! They have changed my life and my feet are soooooo soft and feel so good :) The seller was A+</li>
