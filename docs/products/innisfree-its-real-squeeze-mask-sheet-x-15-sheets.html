            <li>This is by far the best korean masks I&#x27;ve tried, my favorite was the shea butter</li>
            <li>I have never tried sheet masks before, so this was really great to try at first.</li>
            <li>Thanks great value pack of quality sheet masks</li>
            <li>I love how these masks fit!</li>
            <li>Love the variety.</li>
            <li>That said I have already ordered more of these in the varieties I enjoyed and sent a box to my mom and two sisters as a gift.</li>
            <li>I have tried out a couple of the masks and I love them.</li>
            <li>Shipped in under 2 weeks from date of purchased, said shipping wouldn&#x27;t come for a month or more</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>They fit my face well, and feel really nice.</li>
            <li>Very good, refreshing and simple to use masks according to my wife.</li>
            <li>Much better fit for me than dermal Korea.</li>
            <li>I got some free serum in the package too :)</li>
            <li>Good masks and each of the 15 was a different kind.</li>
            <li>I would recommend people who prone to break out and want to smooth your skin,</li>
            <li>As advertised - nice variety and very relaxing to use one you get used to positioning the mask on your face and not feeling like Hannibal in escape scene from The Silence of the Lambs.</li>
            <li>No irritation so far, and the smell was good.</li>
            <li>Excited to try them all.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the 15, and they were all good.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have had a medium to strong fragrance which might bother some people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great buy as it allowed me to discover several masks that do work really well for me</li>
            <li>but they also work great for dry sensitive skin!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These masks are good for replenishing after just about anything that leaves your face dry - a day at the beach, outdoor winter activities, sunburn (esp the aloe), anything that works up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lime one was a bit too much for my skin, however I really appreciated being able to try it out in this pack.</li>
            <li>What I really enjoy about this pack is that I get to try many different kinds, and figure out which ones don&#x27;t work well with my skin and which do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to wash off the juice/gel, the package does say to \\&quot;allow the remaining formula to absorb into the skin\\&quot;, but this is too rich my skin and would be me break out, and apply any facial lotion after.</li>
            <li>I think this line of facial mask is okay</li>
            <li>Although they may be a bit big for my face, I still get a satisfying coverage around it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about half of these and so far I really like most of them, but as you might guess not all of them were great for my skin type (sensitive, oily, acne prone, large pores).</li>
            <li>I let my mom, sister and I try it , and our skin feels clean soft</li>
            <li>+ minutes after I remove the mask no matter how much I try to pat it into my skin, so I have to wait that much longer to put on the rest of the products in my routine.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it really work for me.  </li>
            <li>But I really like the scent and feeling though.  </li>
            <li>so that was a better than expected.</li>
            <li>The mask is very hydrating and gentle enough to use 3 times a week, my regular facial lotion absorbs better right after using the mask.  </li>
            <li>The honey one in particular smelled like beer for some reason.</li>
            <li>Each has done pretty much what it said on the back of the packaged, whether it be brightening, moisturizing, or soothing acne.</li>
            <li>themselves fit my small face very well without falling/sliding off.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry, and the masks help my skin stay moisturized whole day.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, my super sensitive skin didn&#x27;t like that very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thanks great value pack of quality sheet masks</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the 15, and they were all good. My skin is dry, and the masks help my skin stay moisturized whole day. No irritation so far, and the smell was good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best korean masks I&#x27;ve tried, my favorite was the shea butter</li>
            <li> I love how these masks fit! Much better fit for me than dermal Korea.</li>
            <li> Always leaves the skin smooth and bright</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time, all 15 packs of mask are there and they are all different kinds. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out. Would definitely buy again. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love the variety. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try the Innisfree masks without having to spend a lot on shipping from their website. This set covers a variety of skin concerns, from dehydration to wrinkles to oil control to brightening. I&#x27;ve used about half of these and so far I really like most of them, but as you might guess not all of them were great for my skin type (sensitive, oily, acne prone, large pores). It&#x27;s still a great buy as it allowed me to discover several masks that do work really well for me so I know what to purchase in the future. Nothing has caused me irritation or broken me out so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks themselves fit my small face very well without falling/sliding off. They are very saturated with essence but do not have a plastic backing so putting them on is a bit messy. Most of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have had a medium to strong fragrance which might bother some people. The honey one in particular smelled like beer for some reason. Each has done pretty much what it said on the back of the packaged, whether it be brightening, moisturizing, or soothing acne. The one exception is the blackberry mask which did not seem to do anything for my skin at all. The only real complaint I have about these is that unlike other brands I&#x27;ve used, they never seem to dry and the essence is very sticky. My face is sticky for 30+ minutes after I remove the mask no matter how much I try to pat it into my skin, so I have to wait that much longer to put on the rest of the products in my routine. That said I have already ordered more of these in the varieties I enjoyed and sent a box to my mom and two sisters as a gift.</li>
            <li> The mask is very hydrating and gentle enough to use 3 times a week, my regular facial lotion absorbs better right after using the mask.  It works best if you exfoliate beforehand. It&#x27;s better to wash off the juice/gel, the package does say to \\&quot;allow the remaining formula to absorb into the skin\\&quot;, but this is too rich my skin and would be me break out, and apply any facial lotion after.</li>
            <li> I think this line of facial mask is okay, I don&#x27;t think it really work for me.  But I really like the scent and feeling though.  I would recommend people who prone to break out and want to smooth your skin, purchase snail mask instead.</li>
            <li> Very good, refreshing and simple to use masks according to my wife.</li>
            <li> I buy that before,but this time not like before,it like fault .</li>
            <li> Loved Innisfree products!</li>
            <li> Good variety, good price. Great for pampering oneself</li>
            <li> I have tried out a couple of the masks and I love them. The lime one was a bit too much for my skin, however I really appreciated being able to try it out in this pack. What I really enjoy about this pack is that I get to try many different kinds, and figure out which ones don&#x27;t work well with my skin and which do. I have never tried sheet masks before, so this was really great to try at first. Although they may be a bit big for my face, I still get a satisfying coverage around it. I am happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this pack if you are looking for a favorite face mask, and you are unsure!</li>
            <li> Excellent products and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Shipped in under 2 weeks from date of purchased, said shipping wouldn&#x27;t come for a month or more so that was a better than expected. Good masks and each of the 15 was a different kind. Excited to try them all. Tried the Kiwi last night, skin looked moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li> Amazing masks. I had also tried one from The Face Shop, which I later found out had parabens in it. Needless to say, my super sensitive skin didn&#x27;t like that very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks are good for replenishing after just about anything that leaves your face dry - a day at the beach, outdoor winter activities, sunburn (esp the aloe), anything that works up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually been sick in bed the last few days with a fever. Cold compresses always leave my skin dehydrated but I was desperate to cool down the fever in my face a bit. I pulled out the green tea mask and laid down under the ceiling fan. It&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s made me feel human this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the variety but wish there was some info on the properties of each fruit/veggie/vitamin/herb blend and suggestion for which skin issues they work on.</li>
            <li> I got the item earlier than expected. it works great on my skin. I got some free serum in the package too :)</li>
            <li> Amazing sheet masks for all skin types. I have oily skin that is acne prone and it works amazingly for me but they also work great for dry sensitive skin!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these. They fit my face well, and feel really nice. I haven&#x27;t finished them all yet but I like the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love these masks, budget friendly and great quality.</li>
            <li> I let my mom, sister and I try it , and our skin feels clean soft</li>
            <li> As advertised - nice variety and very relaxing to use one you get used to positioning the mask on your face and not feeling like Hannibal in escape scene from The Silence of the Lambs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice mask and very quick ship to UK</li>
            <li> Awesome masks!! I shared with family and friends and they love it!</li>
