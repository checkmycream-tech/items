    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This polish is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Great purchase!!</li>
            <li>The product is great!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that I am very happy with.</li>
            <li>I havent seen any color transfer or yellowing in my nails - good news!</li>
            <li>Great polish.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are a great intro into the 2013 fall line and this way I can decide which shellac colors to buy.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work great.  </li>
            <li>a 5 star rating is because I don&#x27;t think the colors included are that great.</li>
            <li>This is great polish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider this a win if it lasts for 3-4 days, since I have problem nails.</li>
            <li>So nice!  </li>
            <li>NYC nail polish, at .99 cents (at the drugstore, awesome colors) plus the vinylux top coat could be a good thing . . .</li>
            <li>I gave it the one star because I loved the two metallic colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1st, the polish &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; into the nail surface and the shine wasn&#x27;t as good as I  hoped.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as the salon version with the cost, travel, and UV rays!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>after that, you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 stars for awesome colors, doesn&#x27;t seem very fresh.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I used this product, and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have not tried these colors yet, but I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more colors!</li>
            <li>Nice try CND.</li>
            <li>I liked the color sample idea and</li>
            <li>The glitter is nice and dense in both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of nail polish before and it&#x27;s great, but this particular one wasn&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li>kit, which features six fun fall colors and a mini topcoat, is a great way to try Vinylux.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay on the full 7 days, but I do get a good 3 to 4 days out of them.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this nail palish.</li>
            <li>You can use the top coat with any polish not just CND Vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li>continue to purchase and try more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so I will do three coats of some colors so that it looks better.  </li>
            <li>I love how they wear, the shine, the colors--</li>
            <li>I worked better on my toes</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>The colors in this set are adorable, too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easily fixable with a dab of the polish and a layer of top coat.  </li>
            <li>She really liked it and thought the colors were very pretty.</li>
            <li>Then you top with the special Vinylux topcoat (included in this package).  </li>
            <li>This promised a seven day, chip free polish.  </li>
            <li>Great polish overall.</li>
            <li>but that was also in part I was so excited to receive it....</li>
            <li>I liked being able to see the fall colors for a cheaper price before buying individual bottles in shellac.</li>
            <li>This polish is very nice, it wears very long as they say.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the kit, I liked all but one of the colors</li>
            <li>This product does make them feel a bit thicker and taking the product off is super quick, compared to Shellac.  </li>
            <li>well enough: three coats, before the top coat would be better,</li>
            <li>It still dries quickly and hasn&#x27;t shown to affect the wear of the polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Vinylux goes on easily, like a normal nail polish, with no base coat.  </li>
            <li>Compared to regular polish, which chips on my nails within 1 day, I am very pleased with the performance</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the new CND Vinylux nail polish.</li>
            <li>If I do a good job putting on the polish, it easily lasts a whole week with minimal chips.  </li>
            <li>CND recommends you use the Scrub Fresh nail prep solution before using the polish (sold separately), however I just wipe my nail beds with an alcohol swab &amp; that seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know that I wouldn&#x27;t have to -- the nail polish will look good for several days, not perfect, but definitely good.  </li>
            <li>This set is a great, great start -- larger nail polish bottles tend to get crappy before you&#x27;ve even used half the bottle, as we all know, so this collection of small bottles of polish is efficient -- amazing colors for anyone of the Goth persuasion or just wanting darker colors.  </li>
            <li>This is the first (non-UV cured) nail polish that I have actually had to remove and re-paint on all my nails because I wanted to change the color, and NOT because it was chipping off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how to - paint 2 coats of polish (no base coat) and then 1 coat of top coat.</li>
            <li>Also, it comes right off with polish remover.</li>
            <li>Even a professional manicure with normal polish will chip in less then a day for me, so 3 to 4 days is great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, at least for one buy, and $2.95 shipping is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>This polish dries VERY fast, so be warned.  </li>
            <li>And the polish dries very fast</li>
            <li>but I definitly like the larger bottles better.</li>
            <li>should invent a nail polish remover which works fast on this !</li>
            <li>, it chipped off the ends of my nails on the first day - and I followed the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li>I had chipping and wearing off on the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd, it does remove pretty well</li>
            <li>The second coat fixes the streaks, for the most part --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering, if you use just the weekly top coat, will any brand of nail polish last for 6 or 7 days --</li>
            <li>(last one is the top coat)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the directions EXACTLY as stated on the box...</li>
            <li>however, the polish started chipping off by the end of the first day, and then the polish started peeling off on day 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Tried this on 3 people and it did not last more than 5 days for any of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how people are getting it to last more than 5 days.</li>
            <li>After wearing Vinylux for the last 2 months, I&#x27;m in love, and I&#x27;ve sworn off the salon gel</li>
            <li>the colors themselves were pretty but the formula needs improvement</li>
            <li>I order samples, and was excited to try Top Coat, and bottle was EMPTY!!:</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d have to wait a bit for it to dry, just to be sure of not messing it up.  </li>
            <li>(This product will not last a week if you don&#x27;t clean the nails first - they will chip much sooner.)</li>
            <li>I loved the colors,,,great for fall but the nail polish seems hard to apply.  </li>
            <li>Have everything ready when you do your nails.  </li>
            <li>Did not go on smooth like regular polish.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this set as a whole a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>very upset</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed the Vinyluv stayed fresh, shiney and completely on my nails for almost two weeks.  </li>
            <li>There are a few nice ones</li>
            <li>The topcoat bottle is really small though, so if you like the product, be ready to buy more quickly.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this new polish.</li>
            <li>Maybe just the first textured polish I used and the top coat is not nearly enough to last for all the colors</li>
            <li>I use them like a screwdriver, a pot scrubber, and many other things I probably shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, the top coat polish was half empty and kind of gloopy, like old nail polish.</li>
            <li>So when I heard CND had a new product that offered a 7 day wear and came off with regular polish remover, I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>This polish does last me a full week if I put a second layer of top coat on the second day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another of these sets -- I already have it in my Save For Later section of my cart.</li>
            <li>I have a few issues with the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; nail polishes, but the solids are not only great colors, but really do last the whole week.</li>
            <li>Long story short, the polish didn&#x27;t last the seven days chip-free for me that it says, but it definitely does last longer than most normal polishes with top coats.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m psyched it&#x27;s dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the same as regular polish if not worse.</li>
            <li>I knew they were the small bottles which I was ok with</li>
            <li>The same exact thing happened:  </li>
            <li>(so I could get a variety of other colors as well) along with the CND Vinylux Top Coat, which is necessary to bond to the polish.</li>
            <li>Love these fall colors, especially the Dark Dahlia.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only positive</li>
            <li>The orange &amp; blue are a little streaky, but I think if I tried thicker coats &amp; with more practice I could eliminate that problem.</li>
            <li>The top coat included is also a tiny little bottle.</li>
            <li>The two glitters looked almost the same in the bottle and photo, but really the lighter one is a gunmetal silver, and the slightly darker one is a rich brownish bronze.  </li>
            <li>I do the ScrubFresh followed by three coats of polish and then the clear coat by CND as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you get closer to a week than 10 days of not chipping, but either way much longer wear than regular polish.  </li>
            <li>I put this to the test and it absolutely does last a week without chipping.</li>
            <li>really like the mini polishes, since it gives you different options.</li>
            <li>I like this size bottle for trial and will buy the larger size of the ones I really like.</li>
            <li>If you want a professional finish, go to a professional.</li>
            <li>I usually use two quick coats, which dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>The colors are unusual, i get lots of compliments and it is long ladting as advertised</li>
            <li>Not quite as thick and rigid as gel, but definitely more than regular polish.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on other members positive comments.  </li>
            <li>to note on no base coat - I&#x27;ve now had this about a month, and tried out each color for at least a week.</li>
            <li>Does last for days on my soft nails.  </li>
            <li>It does dry really fast, which is an extra bonus (probably explains the streaks).  </li>
            <li>After two thicker polish coats and a really thick top coat they are still dry to the touch in about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately with this particular collection, you do not get nearly enough of the top coat.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and stays on a lot longer than other salon brands- except for shellac</li>
            <li>This polish was dry within just a few minutes, and feels nice and hard on my nails.  </li>

            <li> When I received this product, the top coat polish was half empty and kind of gloopy, like old nail polish.</li>
            <li> So when I heard CND had a new product that offered a 7 day wear and came off with regular polish remover, I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> This polish does last me a full week if I put a second layer of top coat on the second day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another of these sets -- I already have it in my Save For Later section of my cart.</li>
            <li> I have a few issues with the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; nail polishes, but the solids are not only great colors, but really do last the whole week.</li>
            <li> Long story short, the polish didn&#x27;t last the seven days chip-free for me that it says, but it definitely does last longer than most normal polishes with top coats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m psyched it&#x27;s dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the same as regular polish if not worse.</li>
            <li> I knew they were the small bottles which I was ok with</li>
            <li> The same exact thing happened:  </li>
            <li> (so I could get a variety of other colors as well) along with the CND Vinylux Top Coat, which is necessary to bond to the polish.</li>
            <li> Love these fall colors, especially the Dark Dahlia.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only positive</li>
            <li> The orange &amp; blue are a little streaky, but I think if I tried thicker coats &amp; with more practice I could eliminate that problem.</li>
            <li> The top coat included is also a tiny little bottle.</li>
            <li> The two glitters looked almost the same in the bottle and photo, but really the lighter one is a gunmetal silver, and the slightly darker one is a rich brownish bronze.  </li>
            <li> I do the ScrubFresh followed by three coats of polish and then the clear coat by CND as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you get closer to a week than 10 days of not chipping, but either way much longer wear than regular polish.  </li>
            <li> I put this to the test and it absolutely does last a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> really like the mini polishes, since it gives you different options.</li>
            <li> I like this size bottle for trial and will buy the larger size of the ones I really like.</li>
            <li> If you want a professional finish, go to a professional.</li>
            <li> I usually use two quick coats, which dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> The colors are unusual, i get lots of compliments and it is long ladting as advertised</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick and rigid as gel, but definitely more than regular polish.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on other members positive comments.  </li>
            <li> to note on no base coat - I&#x27;ve now had this about a month, and tried out each color for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Does last for days on my soft nails.  </li>
            <li> It does dry really fast, which is an extra bonus (probably explains the streaks).  </li>
            <li> After two thicker polish coats and a really thick top coat they are still dry to the touch in about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately with this particular collection, you do not get nearly enough of the top coat.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and stays on a lot longer than other salon brands- except for shellac</li>
            <li> This polish was dry within just a few minutes, and feels nice and hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It did last a long time on my toes tho.</li>
            <li> --I feel like it is normally set in about 10 minutes and really dry in about a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got it on, it did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of CNDs Shelac line of nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> colors look like dried (from left to right): dark brown, dark raspberry, dark purple, dark teal, gunmetal glitter, clear gold-silver glitter.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would at least last a few days but chipped the first day.</li>
            <li> It starts to chip after only two days even though I am very careful, use gloves when washing dishes etc.</li>
            <li> Dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I bought this, but figured it was worth it if it cut back on the amount of time</li>
            <li> This set is tiny little bottles which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it.</li>
            <li> which is ,I guess, why it&#x27;s harder to get off.&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>
            <li> I spent weekly polishing my nails.  </li>
            <li> The most silver-looking polish in the bottle ends up looking almost black once you&#x27;ve applied two coats so that was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The other customer maybe did not apply it well...</li>
            <li> For the money, it is not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s a little streaky.  </li>
            <li> In less then 24 hours after putting the vinylux nail polish on it had chipped.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the cheaper Sally Hansen stuff lasts on my nails for days.</li>
            <li> Also the polish was clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> Unlike gel if you bump into something heavy or sleep on them it will miff your polish even though it feels</li>
            <li> if you let the cotton ball with the remover sit on the nail for a few seconds before trying to remove the polish.</li>
            <li> Colors appear lighter in the bottle than they are once they&#x27;re dried on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> If I try to do thin coats one half of the nail is drying and tacky by the time I do a second swipe making the coat look very uneven.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious.</li>
            <li> In the past I always would get my nails Shellaced</li>
            <li> (seriously, I usually chip my nails in one day).</li>
            <li> A little thick and hard to spread.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, however it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The shimmery ones also were dull looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely hard on my nails</li>
            <li> I am REALLY hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes the polish is a bit translucent (not sure if it&#x27;s due to not having a base coat?)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this nail palish. Unfortunately with this particular collection, you do not get nearly enough of the top coat. It runs out way before the rest of the polish does.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I used this product, and it worked perfectly. I have a week wearing it! The other customer maybe did not apply it well...</li>
            <li> This polish is amazing!!! It truly stays on for well over a week. You can use the top coat with any polish not just CND Vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li> Great polish. Packed and shipped well. I knew they were the small bottles which I was ok with but I definitly like the larger bottles better. I won&#x27;t buy the teenie size again. I prefer working from a larger bottle with a larger brush. But that&#x27;s a personal preference thing. Shipping seemed to take a while but that was also in part I was so excited to receive it....I was anxious.</li>
            <li> I like the polish and it stays on longer which is ,I guess, why it&#x27;s harder to get off.&lt;br /&gt;Someone should invent a nail polish remover which works fast on this !</li>
            <li> I was so dissappointed. I&#x27;ve been using shellac polish from CND and was satisfied with that lasting about a week without chipping but needed a break from the tedious removal. I hoped this would at least last a few days but chipped the first day. Also the polish was clumpy and messy. Maybe just the first textured polish I used and the top coat is not nearly enough to last for all the colors so u would have to order another too coat. It&#x27;s pretty much the same as regular polish if not worse. I gave it the one star because I loved the two metallic colors. Nice try CND.</li>
            <li> I grabbed these because I&#x27;m completely addicted to Shellac nails and wanted to try to give my nails a bit of a break from the gels.  They don&#x27;t stay on the full 7 days, but I do get a good 3 to 4 days out of them.  I have very weak nails that tend to split and peel. Even a professional manicure with normal polish will chip in less then a day for me, so 3 to 4 days is great!! This product does make them feel a bit thicker and taking the product off is super quick, compared to Shellac.  This polish dries VERY fast, so be warned.  Have everything ready when you do your nails.  I do a bit thicker polish coats just so I get even coverage.  If I try to do thin coats one half of the nail is drying and tacky by the time I do a second swipe making the coat look very uneven.  After two thicker polish coats and a really thick top coat they are still dry to the touch in about 2 minutes.  Unlike gel if you bump into something heavy or sleep on them it will miff your polish even though it feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are a great intro into the 2013 fall line and this way I can decide which shellac colors to buy.  Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, however it was very disappointing. I work as a teller and needed a sturdy polish that was easier to remove than the soak off gels and would stand up to the type of work I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st, the polish &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; into the nail surface and the shine wasn&#x27;t as good as I  hoped. The cream colors looked streaky and uneven and very matte.  The shimmery ones also were dull looking. Everything had a matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd, it chipped off the ends of my nails on the first day - and I followed the directions to the letter. I tried the different colors and the result was the same. I had chipping and wearing off on the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd, it does remove pretty well if you let the cotton ball with the remover sit on the nail for a few seconds before trying to remove the polish. That&#x27;s the only positive I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I will not use this product again. For the money, it is not worth it at all. I will use regular polish when I want to give my nails a break from the soak off gels.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Did not go on smooth like regular polish.  I</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the salon version with the cost, travel, and UV rays!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase and try more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Also, ordered Friday, shipped Friday and received Monday.</li>
            <li> I just received the vinylux nail polish and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It was said that the nail polish would last a week without chipping. In less then 24 hours after putting the vinylux nail polish on it had chipped. In the past I always would get my nails Shellaced but I thought changing to vinylux I would save money and a trip to the beauty shop. I&#x27;m very disappointed and would not suggest this product to any one. Save your money on this one don&#x27;t buy Vinylux nail polish.</li>
            <li> CND Vinylux nail polish, to my surprise, does last several days, longer than I even need because I get the urge to change my nail polish every 3 or 4 days, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I wouldn&#x27;t have to -- the nail polish will look good for several days, not perfect, but definitely good.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s a little streaky.  The second coat fixes the streaks, for the most part -- well enough: three coats, before the top coat would be better, but you&#x27;d have to wait a bit for it to dry, just to be sure of not messing it up.  It does dry really fast, which is an extra bonus (probably explains the streaks).  I&#x27;m wondering, if you use just the weekly top coat, will any brand of nail polish last for 6 or 7 days -- NYC nail polish, at .99 cents (at the drugstore, awesome colors) plus the vinylux top coat could be a good thing . . . I will see.  This set is a great, great start -- larger nail polish bottles tend to get crappy before you&#x27;ve even used half the bottle, as we all know, so this collection of small bottles of polish is efficient -- amazing colors for anyone of the Goth persuasion or just wanting darker colors.  Buy it, try it.  It&#x27;s worth it, at least for one buy, and $2.95 shipping is a great deal.  I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another of these sets -- I already have it in my Save For Later section of my cart.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I bought this, but figured it was worth it if it cut back on the amount of time I spent weekly polishing my nails.  I was pleasantly surprised with the kit, I liked all but one of the colors and they really do last.  I&#x27;d say you get closer to a week than 10 days of not chipping, but either way much longer wear than regular polish.  I got some acetone nail polish remover from the beauty supply and it takes off the polish in seconds.  My only complaint is that sometimes the polish is a bit translucent (not sure if it&#x27;s due to not having a base coat?) so I will do three coats of some colors so that it looks better.  It still dries quickly and hasn&#x27;t shown to affect the wear of the polish.  Overall, I would recommend giving it a try to get back some time in your week!</li>
            <li> I have not tried these colors yet, but I love this nail polish! Dries fast and stays on a lot longer than other salon brands- except for shellac</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the new CND Vinylux nail polish. The purpose of the polish is that it is supposed to last a week without chipping. I put this to the test and it absolutely does last a week without chipping. I do suggest doing what is recommended though and getting the CND Scrubfresh as well and pre treating the nail with that then apply the polish. I do the ScrubFresh followed by three coats of polish and then the clear coat by CND as well. This seems to work great.  The only reason I did not give this specific polish collection a 5 star rating is because I don&#x27;t think the colors included are that great. There are a few nice ones but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I am giving this set as a whole a 5 star rating. I have a few issues with the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; nail polishes, but the solids are not only great colors, but really do last the whole week. This is the first (non-UV cured) nail polish that I have actually had to remove and re-paint on all my nails because I wanted to change the color, and NOT because it was chipping off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how to - paint 2 coats of polish (no base coat) and then 1 coat of top coat. Dry for 10-15 minutes. after that, you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the mini polishes, since it gives you different options. Colors appear lighter in the bottle than they are once they&#x27;re dried on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;What colors look like dried (from left to right): dark brown, dark raspberry, dark purple, dark teal, gunmetal glitter, clear gold-silver glitter. (last one is the top coat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues with the 2 glitters: 1) gun metal glitter does get clumpy. 2) gold-silver glitter is thin, so I think it is meant to be an accent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just to note on no base coat - I&#x27;ve now had this about a month, and tried out each color for at least a week. I havent seen any color transfer or yellowing in my nails - good news!</li>
            <li> does not match the description at all. horrible quality. didn&#x27;t work as promised. then i couldn&#x27;e even return it! very upset</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I am very happy with. CND recommends you use the Scrub Fresh nail prep solution before using the polish (sold separately), however I just wipe my nail beds with an alcohol swab &amp; that seems to work just as well. (This product will not last a week if you don&#x27;t clean the nails first - they will chip much sooner.) Some of the colors last longer than others. The orange &amp; blue are a little streaky, but I think if I tried thicker coats &amp; with more practice I could eliminate that problem.</li>
            <li> Love these fall colors, especially the Dark Dahlia.  I get tons of compliments in this color.  You get a small sample size of four colors plus a small bottle of the top coat.  This polish does last me a full week if I put a second layer of top coat on the second day.  If u do happen to get a chip it&#x27;s easily fixable with a dab of the polish and a layer of top coat.  This is great polish.  I even told my nail tech about it because she never heard of it.  She may get it for the salon.  Now I no longer go there for the shellac.  I do this myself.  I always got bored with the color I chose for two weeks.  Now I change it after one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on other members positive comments.  I followed the directions EXACTLY as stated on the box...however, the polish started chipping off by the end of the first day, and then the polish started peeling off on day 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took all the polish off and tried it again just in case I had followed the directions incorrectly.  The same exact thing happened:  polish chipping by the end of day 1, and then peeling off on day 2 and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have asked seller for a refund and I will wait and see if it will be approved.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the top coat polish was half empty and kind of gloopy, like old nail polish. I have used this brand of nail polish before and it&#x27;s great, but this particular one wasn&#x27;t so good. If I put the brush into the pot, there wasn&#x27;t enough polish to even paint one nail with what came out on the brush. Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely hard on my nails so I was looking for a polish that would last longer than one day (seriously, I usually chip my nails in one day). This promised a seven day, chip free polish.  I was looking for silver the for the holidays so bought the Forbidden Fall mini collection (so I could get a variety of other colors as well) along with the CND Vinylux Top Coat, which is necessary to bond to the polish. The most silver-looking polish in the bottle ends up looking almost black once you&#x27;ve applied two coats so that was a little disappointing. Long story short, the polish didn&#x27;t last the seven days chip-free for me that it says, but it definitely does last longer than most normal polishes with top coats.</li>
            <li> Vinylux lasts on my nails about 4 to 5 days. Compared to regular polish, which chips on my nails within 1 day, I am very pleased with the performance</li>
            <li> The product is great!  The colors are unusual, i get lots of compliments and it is long ladting as advertised</li>
            <li> Tried this on 3 people and it did not last more than 5 days for any of them. I don&#x27;t know how people are getting it to last more than 5 days. It had chips in it by 3 days. I will definitely stick with CND shellac from here on out</li>
            <li> Everything I had hopef for. I like this size bottle for trial and will buy the larger size of the ones I really like.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of CNDs Shelac line of nail polishes.  I love how they wear, the shine, the colors--well everything except for the soak off removal process.  So when I heard CND had a new product that offered a 7 day wear and came off with regular polish remover, I was excited to try it.  After wearing Vinylux for the last 2 months, I&#x27;m in love, and I&#x27;ve sworn off the salon gel manicures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vinylux goes on easily, like a normal nail polish, with no base coat.  I usually use two quick coats, which dry quickly.  Then you top with the special Vinylux topcoat (included in this package).  If I do a good job putting on the polish, it easily lasts a whole week with minimal chips.  So nice!  And the polish dries very fast--I feel like it is normally set in about 10 minutes and really dry in about a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit, which features six fun fall colors and a mini topcoat, is a great way to try Vinylux.  The topcoat bottle is really small though, so if you like the product, be ready to buy more quickly.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again.  If you want a professional finish, go to a professional.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this new polish. It starts to chip after only two days even though I am very careful, use gloves when washing dishes etc. I liked the color sample idea and the colors themselves were pretty but the formula needs improvement</li>
            <li> I loved the colors,,,great for fall but the nail polish seems hard to apply.  A little thick and hard to spread.  When I got it on, it did not last very long.  Maybe 3 days before it started to chip.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference from regular polish.  I worked better on my toes but so does regular polish and they don&#x27;t get the wear and tear of fingers.</li>
            <li> My job entails a lot of typing and paper handling.  Regular nail polish lasts about 3 days.  I&#x27;m amazed the Vinyluv stayed fresh, shiney and completely on my nails for almost two weeks.  Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> It does chip quicker than shellac. It did last a long time on my toes tho. I liked being able to see the fall colors for a cheaper price before buying individual bottles in shellac.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine saw this and ordered it. She really liked it and thought the colors were very pretty.</li>
            <li> This polish was dry within just a few minutes, and feels nice and hard on my nails.  Not quite as thick and rigid as gel, but definitely more than regular polish.  I&#x27;m psyched it&#x27;s dry so quickly.  The colors in this set are adorable, too.  The two glitters looked almost the same in the bottle and photo, but really the lighter one is a gunmetal silver, and the slightly darker one is a rich brownish bronze.  The glitter is nice and dense in both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if it doesn&#x27;t wear as well as hoped.  I&#x27;d consider this a win if it lasts for 3-4 days, since I have problem nails.</li>
            <li> Great polish overall. Does last for days on my soft nails.  I order samples, and was excited to try Top Coat, and bottle was EMPTY!!:(</li>
            <li> This polish is very nice, it wears very long as they say. This set is tiny little bottles which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it. The top coat included is also a tiny little bottle.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY hard on my nails. I use them like a screwdriver, a pot scrubber, and many other things I probably shouldn&#x27;t. I am also a mom to a newborn and a toddler. I don&#x27;t have time to redo my nails daily. This polish will last a week without chipping. At the end of the week I do notice some wear on the tips, but no chipping. Also, it comes right off with polish remover. It&#x27;s just as easy&lt;br /&gt;To take off as regular nail polish, maybe easier. I will be purchasing more colors!</li>
            <li> Vinylux does not work for me.  It chips and/or wears off in a day or two.  I will not be buying again.  Oddly, the cheaper Sally Hansen stuff lasts on my nails for days.</li>
            <li> 3 stars for awesome colors, doesn&#x27;t seem very fresh.</li>
