            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to get myself one now. :-)</li>
            <li>It has caught many of my clients&#x27; attention, as well as the attention of my colleagues.  </li>
            <li>It adds such a nice, warm light, &amp; just feels good to look at.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to keep clean since it&#x27;s in the kitchen</li>

            <li>An awesome value for a STONE handcrafted and shipped round</li>

            <li>it is worth it sure to by another one soon thank you for your quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The first one was the Himalayan Salt Lamp, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and makes a fabulous night light.</li>
            <li>I did not have a kitchen scale at the time of the original purchase.</li>
            <li>The company should really invest in something more eco friendly, and something that doesn&#x27;t cover the floor when removing the item from the box.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the health benefits, but I do know that I like this style of salt lamp better than the natural, &amp;#34;chunk of rock&amp;#34; style.</li>
            <li>It gives off such a warm and comforting glow not to mention the inherent benefits of a salt lamp.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it looks lit up, but if its anything like my other lamp, I&#x27;m sure I will love it.</li>
            <li>representative of the company was not willing to do anything about the weight as it had been more than 30 days since the original purchase.</li>
            <li>but it is so pretty, even when its not lit.</li>
            <li>My only concern was that the bulb assembly has two wires that easily slip out of the connection holes.</li>
            <li>Mine is on a light wooden one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We got these because someone told me that they were very healthful.</li>
            <li>The light that is inserted is too big for the lamp</li>
            <li>I guess just expect this item to look very trashy and damaged when you receive it.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was done very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone complaining about the weight of the item - does it really matter that much ?  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>It is nice an heavy so very stable on any table as well.</li>
            <li>Was real happy the base was a light wood and not white like in the picture.</li>
            <li>The crystal in both was the very white stuff, not the healthy pink.</li>
            <li>This tear drop salt lamp arrived in a timely manner, but I was surprised to find there was no bulb in the box!</li>
            <li>I was at first promised an 8 pound one for the second purchase when that fell through money was refunded to me.</li>
            <li>My shipping cost was less than originally quoted because of the weight</li>
            <li>This item has clearly been dropped.  </li>
            <li>The cord was missing and when the seller was contacted about this sent me one right away.</li>

            <li> I bought two. I wasn&#x27;t incredibly disappointed; but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled. The crystal in both was the very white stuff, not the healthy pink. The cord is awkward and doesn&#x27;t have a dimmer. Packaging was fine. Customer service was excellent and friendly, going out of their way to contact me when there was a minor delay in shipping.</li>
            <li> This lamp gives a beautiful golden glow in a room.  It is great for some atmosphere lighting plus the benefits from the salt.  The price is very good.  It will probably last for years.  Actually, mine fell on the floor from about 3 feet, and it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> This is the second Salt lamp I have ordered from Amazon. The first one was the Himalayan Salt Lamp, which I LOVE. I creates a wonderful glow in my living room, and I have received so many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;  This tear drop salt lamp arrived in a timely manner, but I was surprised to find there was no bulb in the box! Other reviews said it came with one. The lamp was buried in a box covered by POPCORN, who uses popcorn anymore?? The company should really invest in something more eco friendly, and something that doesn&#x27;t cover the floor when removing the item from the box. And the lamp wasn&#x27;t wrapped in anything but plastic.... Also, the lamp is not on a white base like the one in the provided picture. Mine is on a light wooden one.&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t put a bulb in (because it didn&#x27;t come with one) I don&#x27;t know how it looks lit up, but if its anything like my other lamp, I&#x27;m sure I will love it. This one is going in my bedroom!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Beautiful good quality it is worth it sure to by another one soon thank you for your quick shipping.</li>
            <li> We got these because someone told me that they were very healthful. I don&#x27;t know about the health benefits, but I do know that I like this style of salt lamp better than the natural, &amp;#34;chunk of rock&amp;#34; style. It&#x27;s very pretty and makes a fabulous night light. It&#x27;s unusual shape has sparked many interesting conversations.</li>
            <li> Love the shape &amp; size. Was real happy the base was a light wood and not white like in the picture. The light that is inserted is too big for the lamp so it sticks out of the bottom a little further than the base. It does not sit completely flat, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I think it is very beautiful and brings charm to my living room. This is my second salt lamp. I notice a reduction in allergens.</li>
            <li> This item has clearly been dropped.  A lot.  And they were not even able to send me what I asked for (teardrop instead of egg shape) though they did give me the option of a refund or a substitute item.  Evdently there was an earthquake?  I guess that&#x27;s the excuse for damaged property?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly disappointed in the product though it&#x27;s not actually \\&quot;broken\\&quot; just covered in strike marks and inclusions (circular, from where it&#x27;s been dropped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been told by the shipper that this is how it is supposed to look.  This is very different from the picture on Amazon.  I guess just expect this item to look very trashy and damaged when you receive it.  I guess it&#x27;s still salt and will still \\&quot;work,\\&quot; lol, but it looks crappy and I can&#x27;t put it outside where people can see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I have five of these lamps and this is my favorite1 The packaging was done very well. The cord was missing and when the seller was contacted about this sent me one right away. Also, it is different than the others I have so the seller called me and told me how to make it work. I am very impressed with this item, the prompt delivery and their helpfulness.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful lamp.  It gives off such a warm and comforting glow not to mention the inherent benefits of a salt lamp.  I love it.  It is nice an heavy so very stable on any table as well.</li>
            <li> The color of the lamp is gorgeous and I liked that it&#x27;s carved.  My only concern was that the bulb assembly has two wires that easily slip out of the connection holes.</li>
            <li> I loved this lamp when I saw the pic and loved it even more when I opened it. Now that it&#x27;s been in my kitchen/ familyroom for over a month I love it even more. It&#x27;s so easy to keep clean since it&#x27;s in the kitchen I can take a damp cloth to it and the dust falls off.</li>
            <li> This lamp weighs less than 5 pounds. My husband and I weighed it on the kitchen scale and then he took it to the post office and they weighed it. Packaging included less than 8 lbs. It is advertised on amazon as 8 to 10 pounds. Not true.&lt;br /&gt;The representative of the company was not willing to do anything about the weight as it had been more than 30 days since the original purchase. I did not have a kitchen scale at the time of the original purchase. I did have one when I made a second purchase. Then I weighed the second one which I returned and of course I weighed the one I already had had for a month. I was at first promised an 8 pound one for the second purchase when that fell through money was refunded to me. Conclusion they have no 8 pound lamps to sell!</li>
            <li> The lamp itself was nice, but the cord wasn&#x27;t made for the lamp. It had a piece that stuck out of the lamp so it didn&#x27;t sit flat. Horrible design. I would not order this again or recommend it to anyone because of this design until they fix it.</li>
            <li> We leave ours on all the time since turning it off makes it sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so beautiful that it just makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> beautiful as described</li>
            <li> I just received my lamp in the mail. I love it, it is sooo beautiful but it is not the 8 lbs that is advertised. Mine with the porcelain base is still only 4 lbs. It arrived in perfect condition. I will see how it works on my allergies. My shipping cost was less than originally quoted because of the weight but it is so pretty, even when its not lit. I would like to purchase more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I added a dimmer and LED light bulb to it.&lt;br /&gt;Here is an interesting tid bit.  I don&#x27;t have central air, so I only have Air Conditioning when I turn it on in my room.  The salt lamp absorbs the humidity in the air, but when I turn my AC on it starts to sweat and salty water beads off it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sort of cool!</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  Nice glow. An awesome value for a STONE handcrafted and shipped round the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone complaining about the weight of the item - does it really matter that much ?  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get myself one now. :-)</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the size and shape. It gives off a wonderful soft glow and really seems to be helping with my sinus issues! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I actually use this in my office where I do therapy sessions. It has caught many of my clients&#x27; attention, as well as the attention of my colleagues.  It adds such a nice, warm light, &amp; just feels good to look at.  I&#x27;m uncertain if it purifies the air, as the claims of Himalayan salt lamps purport, but I think its attractiveness alone warrant its purchase.  It was reasonably priced as well.</li>
