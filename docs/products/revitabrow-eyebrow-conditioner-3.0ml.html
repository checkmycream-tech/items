            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for 2 months and couldn&#x27;t be more astounded or happier.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have been blah for so many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just bought more and continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>Very excited for this item.</li>
            <li>in all very worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I saw such a remarkable difference, I purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li>After they grow in I use the product maybe twice a week to keep them full.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if the tube was clear so you can see when you are nearing the end and need to reorder.</li>
            <li>I actually use it on my lashes more than my brows because I like the applicator better than the one that comes with the Revita Lash and my lashes have never been longer.</li>
            <li>I will be a loyal user from now on.</li>
            <li>The results were nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>Six weeks in, using it once a day, I&#x27;m surprised and happy to report that my over-tweezed eyebrows are filling in and growing back!</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first 30 days and have been using for 2 years.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by how fast the shipping was!</li>
            <li>This really does work!  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows look exactly as they did before I purchased and used this product.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY brow conditioners with limited success and had given up hope that I would find a product that would grow in my brows from overtweezing.</li>
            <li>For some reason my right eye brow had thinned so much I was having to fill in with a pencil.</li>
            <li>Overzealous plucking and waxing in the 90s left me with almost no eyebrows, would never even consider leaving the house without them filled  in.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than retail.</li>
            <li>and it really paid off.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t worked much yet after a month</li>
            <li>It started really showing results at 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I am glad it worked for other people.</li>
            <li>Fast forward 3 months, I have full eyebrows back!  </li>
            <li>It does grow new brows, darkens them &amp; thickens them!  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows have thinned out over the years in particular the so called wings.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn or itch and while pricey, a tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>But, it has not helped grow any new hairs in the patchy or overplucked areas of my brows, nor has it helped thicken what is existing.</li>
            <li>The applicator has a little sponge at the end and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It may just be too early to tell?</li>
            <li>So far, no eyebrow hair growth.</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows have grown back from non-existent, heavily over plucked, to bushy.  :-)</li>
            <li>Revita Brow began darkening my brows within a few days of daily application (which is ridiculously easy).</li>
            <li>I began to see results after 2 weeks of using this product and MAJOR results after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>The middle to end parts have been barely visible without makeup.</li>

            <li> Within a few weeks my brows were one consistent color from end to end and as thick as they were when I was in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> After using it for a little over a month, my eyebrows are definitely fuller and darker.</li>

            <li> You can regrow your eyebrows as long as you use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I started to notice new growth at approximately 10 days.</li>
            <li> Details of previous reveiw: forgot some info.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I do have a little redness around my brows, but use Medline Remedy lotion (got this during radiation) on the brow area during the day and it seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little less expensive as you need to apply it daily</li>
            <li> , I did notice a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this stuff works</li>
            <li> I want to return it, but not sure how.</li>
            <li> Unless you can&#x27;t commit to using this as directed, please don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> Very disappointed especially since I played over $70.00.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It actually works.  You can regrow your eyebrows as long as you use it everyday.  My eyebrows have thinned out over the years in particular the so called wings.  Using this product is the best thing I have ever done.  I would recommend this to any woman with thinning eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any change. I&#x27;ve been using it every day.</li>
            <li> It may just be too early to tell?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months, since December. It&#x27;s almost gone, and I have seen no change in my brows at all! Big disappointment given the other stellar reviews. But, it has not helped grow any new hairs in the patchy or overplucked areas of my brows, nor has it helped thicken what is existing. Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!!  Overzealous plucking and waxing in the 90s left me with almost no eyebrows, would never even consider leaving the house without them filled  in.  Fast forward 3 months, I have full eyebrows back!  Will say though, you have to keep using it every day.  I was away and didn&#x27;t bring it with me, by the time I got home, I did notice a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Much cheaper on Amazon than retail. Works great!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this stuff works but it DOES make brows thicker. Amazing.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any doubts about this product like I did, give it a try. I&#x27;d never even heard about eyebrow enhancers, until I ran across this product in a celebrity endorsement. I bought this hoping it would work, but not really expecting it to. Six weeks in, using it once a day, I&#x27;m surprised and happy to report that my over-tweezed eyebrows are filling in and growing back!</li>
            <li> The best product for enhancing your eyebrows. I saw results within the first 30 days and have been using for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I actually use it on my lashes more than my brows because I like the applicator better than the one that comes with the Revita Lash and my lashes have never been longer. I get compliments on them all the time. It took a few months for it to really start working, I almost gave up, but I kept at it and it really paid off. I&#x27;m hooked for life! This seller was great as well. I received my order 2 days after I ordered it. I was blown away by how fast the shipping was! I will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It was great!  I had almost no brows on the inside position and after using Revita Brow they are all grown in.  This is my second order and I only hope that the product is not ever discontinued.  After they grow in I use the product maybe twice a week to keep them full.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked much yet after a month but I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! Have been using this for 2 months and couldn&#x27;t be more astounded or happier. My eyebrows have been blah for so many years. The middle to end parts have been barely visible without makeup. Looking in the mirror first thing in the morning was depressing as the lack of brows made me look older and haggard.  Revita Brow began darkening my brows within a few days of daily application (which is ridiculously easy). Then, I started noticing a lot of brow growth. Thought maybe I was hallucinating!! Within a few weeks my brows were one consistent color from end to end and as thick as they were when I was in my 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 59). I no longer need brow pencil. The brows frame my eyes beautifully and the color is perfect. I&#x27;ll never stop using this product or Revita Lash.</li>
            <li> This really does work!  It does grow new brows, darkens them &amp; thickens them!  Great stuff! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> After tryong ten different products, I have the only one I will ever use again. And again. It&#x27;s the best on the market</li>
            <li> It started really showing results at 4 weeks.  My chemo brows are coming back and I love it!  I do have a little redness around my brows, but use Medline Remedy lotion (got this during radiation) on the brow area during the day and it seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all very worth it.  I will continue to use daily until my brows completely fill in and then use every other day as some have suggested for a maintenance plan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it did before. Maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> it did nothing in my eyebrows i used it day and night until i finsh it...waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I have used this eyebrow conditioner, it seems like forever, and it works for me.  My eyebrows are healthier, fuller and look like they did when I was a teenager.  This product works!</li>
            <li> So far, no eyebrow hair growth. Not happy</li>
            <li> A product that works. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and my eyebrows have grown back from non-existent, heavily over plucked, to bushy.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on with the wand and dries immediately. You dont have to wait to do the rest of your regime. I noticed my eyebrows are starting to fill in too. Very excited for this item.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a clue how good this is...but my wife says it works well. She recommends it and even bought some for her sister. Mark up in a salon that sells this product is about 50%, so good value on Amazon</li>
            <li> This works great.  Noticed eyebrows filling-in within about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Can also be used on eyelash line.  The sponge applicator makes eyelash application a little harder, but still possible.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY brow conditioners with limited success and had given up hope that I would find a product that would grow in my brows from overtweezing. When nothing worked, I resigned myself to using brow pencils. A friend started using revita and I saw such a remarkable difference, I purchased it for myself. The results were nothing short of amazing. I now have thick eyebrows where I previously had bald spots and can&#x27;t believe I actually have to tweeze my brows for the first time in 15 years! I apply it once in the evening. It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn or itch and while pricey, a tube lasts a long time. The applicator has a little sponge at the end and is easy to apply. I started to notice new growth at approximately 10 days. By 6 weeks I had to start tweezing. After 3 months I am still amazed when I look in the mirror. I don&#x27;t know if revita will work for everyone but it worked beyond my expectations for me. Just wish it was a little less expensive as you need to apply it daily but it is worth every penny to me. It would also be nice if the tube was clear so you can see when you are nearing the end and need to reorder.</li>
            <li> Used regularly it did nothing.</li>
            <li> i am using it daily and see no improvement yet..perhaps it takes months to achieve results..check with me in september</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. I tried rivitalash wich worked amazingly!!! Thought this would work as well, but it did nothing it actually made my brow hairs fall and broke me out in a rash around my brow area. Disappointed!! I want to return it, but not sure how. Haven&#x27;t had to return anything before.</li>
            <li> An amazing product. After using it for a little over a month, my eyebrows are definitely fuller and darker. I have the eyebrows from my youth again!</li>
            <li> Details of previous reveiw: forgot some info.&lt;br /&gt;Like I stated, it&#x27;s definitely not a miracle product, but I did find baby hairs sprouting where they would not sprout before, but also in some areas where I severely over plucked I have yet to see any growth what so ever. I have been using the product for just over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Information: This product usually arrives quickly, even to remote locations.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> This product has not worked at all. My eyebrows look exactly as they did before I purchased and used this product. I was using it regularly. I am glad it worked for other people. It could be the company from which I bought it.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> My wife says it is a wonderful product, but should be used every day for best effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my brows religiously for almost 2 months.  It doesn&#x27;t even last one month per wand.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth in my brows where there was/is no hair.  Very disappointed especially since I played over $70.00.  Will stop purchasing this product. :((</li>
            <li> This works!  For some reason my right eye brow had thinned so much I was having to fill in with a pencil. During a facial, the esthetician told me Revita Brow, in 4 weeks of &amp;#34;faithfully&amp;#34; using every night, hair was growing in brow.  I just bought more and continuing to use it. I am thrilled over my thicking eyebrows.  Unless you can&#x27;t commit to using this as directed, please don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Pricey but it works!! I began to see results after 2 weeks of using this product and MAJOR results after 4 weeks. I will be a loyal user from now on.</li>
