            <li>one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>men&#x27;s fragrance, in that most men&#x27;s fragrances have either overly spicy or musky scents.</li>

            <li>RUBBING ALCOHOL IN CUTE PACKAGE</li>
            <li>There is a metallic tinge to most Lomani knock-offs, and in this one, it is the most pronounced I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Case had a dent, inside it the board was broke that the Cologne was laying on,thank God I was able to switch it out wit my dads.</li>

            <li>Shipped quickly... love it</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s available on the market, although my wife prefers Obsession, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cologne comes on very strong and a bit harsh but with time it calms down to a very nice scent that smells great!</li>
            <li>First of all, let me start off by saying that I am a man who loves colognes!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is some unique cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, this isn&#x27;t even one of their good knock-offs - it doesn&#x27;t smell enough like 1 Million to make the synthetic grossness worth it.</li>
            <li>Get more comments of how good it smelled then probably any other toilette spray ever</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a sweet and&lt;br</li>
            <li>smell like cool water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet yet has some spice to it in a manly way.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not a bad rip off.  </li>
            <li>Very long lasting with good projection, nice scent for men</li>
            <li>I know when a cologne sucks or when a cologne is very good.....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for the amount</li>
            <li>Bought two bottles one for a realy good friend and the other for my man.</li>
            <li>Now this fragrance really makes you feel like a million dollars just from the rich alluring scent that it has.</li>
            <li>good product similar to I million paco rabane but much shipper fast delivery</li>
            <li>smells really good and last long</li>
            <li>This item arrived at the designated time however, while the box was intact and undamaged, the bottle inside had a whole punched in it and</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time....</li>
            <li>, paco&#x27;s is a hair sweeter though ,but barely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Listen, if you don&#x27;t buy this juice right here then you are going to be missing out&lt;br /&gt;until</li>

            <li> last long sa</li>
            <li> and  the smell last a long time.</li>
            <li> I mean for real men...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> , as the product aged, it got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I did not tested the product, but I am sure and hope I would not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my wife and I go out on dates, I&#x27;ll wear Obsession, but on other occasions, this one is my go-to scent.</li>
            <li> I will admit i went to a perfume shop smelled it and decided it was something that my boyfriend could add to his 80 other bottles of cologne</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay long as expected not more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li> it did because some of the fragance is water down that you can&#x27;t smell them at all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li> this product never came to my hands everything else I get upset about it, it&#x27;s not fair that you pay for an item and never reaches our hands</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> A rip-off of Paco Rabanne&#x27;s 1 Million.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this juice, you will not be mad at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> All I can is that I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> it actually stinks, smelled like \\&quot;Raid\\&quot;, yes, the bug spray!!</li>

            <li> Hello everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a Eau De Toilette Spray for men I mean for real men... this is your deal.</li>
            <li> Prompt and without a problem. I needed this for a gift so I did not tested the product, but I am sure and hope I would not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The cologne comes on very strong and a bit harsh but with time it calms down to a very nice scent that smells great!</li>
            <li> Warning.... For the price of this juice, you will not be mad at all. :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is some unique cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very long lasting, people will smell you even&lt;br /&gt;before you walk by (if you know how to apply)&lt;br /&gt;and not offensive like woodsy cologne can be&lt;br /&gt;(I do ware them too.) Yes, it is a sweet and&lt;br /&gt;lingering smell. If your wondering, it does&lt;br /&gt;not smell like cool water. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, if you don&#x27;t buy this juice right here then you are going to be missing out&lt;br /&gt;until you finally just buy one for around $18.00 buck&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s for listing to my input.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that smelled similar to Eryo by Yves Rocher, which is no longer made, and I stumbled upon this. It&#x27;s different from your &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; men&#x27;s fragrance, in that most men&#x27;s fragrances have either overly spicy or musky scents. This one has a different, but pleasing aroma, including hints of citrus. It&#x27;s currently my favourite that&#x27;s available on the market, although my wife prefers Obsession, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my wife and I go out on dates, I&#x27;ll wear Obsession, but on other occasions, this one is my go-to scent.</li>
            <li> A rip-off of Paco Rabanne&#x27;s 1 Million.  But it&#x27;s not a bad rip off.  The longevity on this is actually really good, as well.  Might save yourself 50$.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Millionaire years ago for my husband.  I was in love with it.  Can&#x27;t remember who made it, but when I found it again, I purchased it.  Not what I expected at all.  Not the same fragrance.  Sorry, but I was disappointed.  Is it a different company?  Don&#x27;t know.  Is it the same and my tastes have changed?  Don&#x27;t know that either.  All I can is that I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> A perfect scent that lasts. You don&#x27;t need a lot of either. Definitely worth the price for the amount you get</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne and smell wonderful for a really really cheap price, now I have a great smell thanks to this cologne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset xq this product never came to my hands everything else I get upset about it, it&#x27;s not fair that you pay for an item and never reaches our hands</li>
            <li> good product similar to I million paco rabane but much shipper fast delivery</li>
            <li> It has a really nice fragrance!!! I used for every moment of the day from the morning at school util the disco in the night.</li>
            <li> excellent product I love</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles one for a realy good friend and the other for my man. They both loved the smell! it&#x27;s sweet yet has some spice to it in a manly way. great buy. I will admit i went to a perfume shop smelled it and decided it was something that my boyfriend could add to his 80 other bottles of cologne and no I&#x27;m not over extraggerating ... He loves to smell good! Anyway 54 bucks in stores! What a steal on Amzon, just gotta love them!</li>
            <li> Great eau de toilette</li>
            <li> I want to change the shipping adress and the fullname</li>
            <li> Actually smells REALLY GOOD!  It&#x27;s mostly just office decor for my stock trading office but I do use it and it does smell great</li>
            <li> Descubrí y compré recientemente este perfume en USA, y me sorprendió. Es maravilloso, intenso y perdura mucho. Es mucho mejor que otros perfumes de &amp;#34;marcas&amp;#34; conocidas y más caras. Me sorprendió positivamente..</li>
            <li> Seeing the reviews ordered this. It smells great but it doesn&#x27;t stay long as expected not more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> The name says it all!!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me start off by saying that I am a man who loves colognes!! I know when a cologne sucks or when a cologne is very good.....this cologne is a joke and the production team of this cologne knows it as well!! Do not waste your time....it actually stinks, smelled like \\&quot;Raid\\&quot;, yes, the bug spray!!</li>
            <li> my husband love the smell of this fragance he was so happy with this  smell that it last long sa it did because some of the fragance is water down that you can&#x27;t smell them at all and you have to sprAY THEM  MORE THAN one time to get a good smell for the cologne. Thank You!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smell good,  not for the summer tho, Love it,  Great winter fragrance winter!!!</li>
            <li> Now this fragrance really makes you feel like a million dollars just from the rich alluring scent that it has. I&#x27;m totally loving this one.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. . Shipped quickly... love it</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It smells so good and  the smell last a long time. Best cologne I have ever tried and the ladies like it too.</li>
            <li> RUBBING ALCOHOL IN CUTE PACKAGE</li>
            <li> very  good ,  excellent ,  accordance with the received  , RECEIVED IN TIME  very  good ,  excellent ,  accordance with the received  , RECEIVED IN TIME  very  good ,  excellent ,  accordance with the received  , RECEIVED IN TIME</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty terrible. There is a metallic tinge to most Lomani knock-offs, and in this one, it is the most pronounced I have ever smelled. It&#x27;s so synthetic that it makes my stomach turn a bit. On top of that, this isn&#x27;t even one of their good knock-offs - it doesn&#x27;t smell enough like 1 Million to make the synthetic grossness worth it. Just save your money and buy 1 Million. Don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li> Very good the recommended product, arrived in perfect condition, without mishap, it seems a good smell of perfume and cheaply</li>
            <li> I my husband wanted the One Million but I bough this one thinking it was it but I was not disappointed the smell is nice loud but nice , this is my second bottle</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, not as cloying as 1million but sweeter and amazing longevity. Great stuff lomani. keep it up.</li>
            <li> It was a gift. Case had a dent, inside it the board was broke that the Cologne was laying on,thank God I was able to switch it out wit my dads.</li>
            <li> omg this cologne is noooooooooo joke. i always keep this stocked!!! it smells that good, and the smell does not wear off at ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, this smells JUST like Paco Rabanne&#x27;s 1 Million.  Lomani did an amazing job re-creating 1 Million.  It&#x27;s about 97% the same in my opinion.  Good sillage and longevity as well.  It is to 1 Million, what Perry Ellis 360 Red is to Acqua di Gio, and 360 White is to Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male.  If you are thinking about buying Paco&#x27;s fragrance and looking to save big bucks, look no further.</li>
            <li> Get more comments of how good it smelled then probably any other toilette spray ever and I used many kinds.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband as a gift. when he got it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how good the smell is. I would recommend this product for anyone to try something different.</li>
            <li> Best Smelling Cologne. Not Too Strong Just Like I Love,</li>
            <li> smells great, great price , definately a quality product, comes in a nice tin box , comes with a bracelet (not that i will wear it) smells just like paco rabanne 1 million , paco&#x27;s is a hair sweeter though ,but barely. would definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, and scent fills a room on the first spray</li>
            <li> Great fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> This item arrived at the designated time however, while the box was intact and undamaged, the bottle inside had a whole punched in it and the liquid gone. As noted the external packaging was intact, so Amazon must have known the contents were damaged, but they sent it anyway. Nice of them to do since this is a non-returnable item....</li>
            <li> To whom it may concern,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did NOT SMELL like the store product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, as the product aged, it got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would appreciate a replacement item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you in advance,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl Haggerty</li>
