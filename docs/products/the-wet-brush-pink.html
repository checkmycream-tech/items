            <li>daughter&#x27;s hair has also been a major pain to brush, and we have had many battles with me trying to get the tangles out of her hair.</li>

            <li>Not so far.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old no longer cries in the morning when brushing her hair.</li>

            <li> I have tried many brushes and other product claiming to de tangle hair. &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; is the only one the actually works. This thing is great!</li>
            <li> This brush has been life changing *I&#x27;m not exaggerating*. I have long, thick and very curly hair and I have always dreaded the brushing out process after a shower but this brush makes it painless. It is so gentle that I bought it for my nieces as well and now they are not fussy when they are getting their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair looks better after using this, other brushes made my hair look and feel worse. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This comes with a bigger brush and a smaller one, and the smaller one is so cute, and I share with my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> The brush works fine, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the hype is about, but I like it. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it still smells like gasoline.  I like the little brush for stashing in my purse so that I can quickly rake through my hair before going back to my office after lunch.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best thing since sliced bread, no joke!  Oh my gosh, I have the thickest, most tangled hair ever, and brushing/combing it after a shower has been the biggest pain for me for the majority of my life. Enter the wet brush into the equation, and I no longer have these issues! It seriously just glides through my wet hair in a matter of seconds with little to no pulling and absolutely no pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair has also been a major pain to brush, and we have had many battles with me trying to get the tangles out of her hair. Now, she brushes her own hair effortlessly with this brush. Seriously, buy one now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even works great on dry hair. I was skeptical about paying this much for a hair brush considering I have tried it ALL! Nothing has ever made brushing mine or my daughters&#x27;s any easier until now!</li>
            <li> There are no other brushes like wet brush.  Not so far.  Works amazingly.  I bought another brush that said it detangled for wet hair...no, not the same, did not work.  This...worth it.  I used to pick my hair out or use a large comb, because brushes would tangle my hair...this was recommended to me from a mom who swore on it for herself and her two girls, one very young sensitive head.  She was right.  My hair is fine and naturally curly&#x3D; easy tangles and always tangles, even when I have knarly knots, this still gets them out faster and with less pain, hassle, broken hair, and hair loss then anything else I&#x27;ve used before.  It&#x27;s so cost effective, try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> My kids never let me brush their hair until we found the wet brush! Just awesome</li>
            <li> Only difference between this and a regular cushion brush is that the brush bristles are extremely thin and very flexible. However, be warned- this make it so that only the surface of your hair is brushed. it is very deceiving. Run a wide toothed comb in your hair after using this and you will immediately run into knots. The large brush also smells strongly of cheap plastic and fertilizer - like a Home Depot. The first time I used it I had to rewash my hair because I could smell the plastic in my hair. Basically these are a giant waste of money. Also worth mentioning- the bristles are threaded so that the back end of the bristle is bent and pokes back up through the same hole as the bristle. I imagine this will cause damage if you brush when wet or use long-term. If I could return these I would. Not worth damaging my hair over.</li>
            <li> We refer to this as the magical brush in our home. We have 4 year old twin boys with long blonde wavy hair- this sucker is amazing for post swimming pool, bath and even dry hair. The mornings before school have become so much easier.</li>
            <li> I have straight, medium length hair and this brush works great on my damp hair after I shower. I notice much less hair pulling out compared to using a comb and the brush works through the hair very easily.</li>
            <li> Love them! Keeps my hair tangle free throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This brush is my new best friend! I will never use another brush. I use this brush for detangling and follow up with a 100% boar bristle brush and I am in love with it. I am South Asian and my hair is long, very wavy and very frizzy. Does nothing for the frizz but it detangles perfectly with  out excess pulling. I did not know different brushes made that big of a difference. You will not be disappointed with this brush. ^.^</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is super ........ detangles w/no discomfort ...... works on wet or dry hair. Fantastic! I bought little brushes (Squirts) for both of my great-granddaughters. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great deal, but they aren&#x27;t quite the miracle brush I was expecting.  My daughters still complain about getting their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for wet hair! It does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Great value to have the mini brush come with it. My six year old has an extremely soft and sensitive head. This brush has made for much happier mornings! This is the only brush she will use. I have given several as gifts to children and adults. They have all loved them! I keep them I brushes in my glove compartment and purse. They are great for travel too! Very lightweight. Work great in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush you can buy to get tangles painlessly out of your hair when wet. Works perfectly. I was recommended it by my hairdresser who uses them. It&#x27;s definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I now have about four of them. The small one is great for your gym bag.</li>
            <li> Works for WET hair GREAT !</li>
            <li> Great for kids hair and travel size is perfect</li>
            <li> Seriously makes brushing my tangly wet hair doable!</li>
            <li> This brush changed our life! My 8 year old no longer cries in the morning when brushing her hair. The Wet Brush gets tangles out of wet or dry hair easily. I would highly recommend this brush!!</li>
