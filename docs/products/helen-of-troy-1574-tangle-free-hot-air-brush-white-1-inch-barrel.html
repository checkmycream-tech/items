            <li>This brush dryer is a good idea.</li>

            <li>It is the best hot air brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find the Helen of Troy at an affordable price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want curls - just shape - and this hot air brush is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>Really love this product.!  </li>
            <li>and I really love it!  </li>
            <li>so this hot air brush was a perfect solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is perfect and exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>One of the best things is that it doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>I was replacing my burned out Helen of Troy hot air brush, and this was the best price.</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine hair for providing volume and curl at the crown of my head</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an airbrush that will give my shoulder length hair a nice curve but not curly.  </li>
            <li>Really a nice curling brush for the price..</li>
            <li>Nice for the price.</li>
            <li>It is very substantial and will be perfect for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me nice fullness and bounce.</li>
            <li>which is nice for positioning the brush.</li>
            <li>This is great for a quick fix when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li>It has been a great asset to me when I needed a quick style.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled very easily around them</li>
            <li>Very easy to use ...</li>
            <li>Very easy to use - no fancy tricks - no burning hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it grips my hair good for styling.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I use the Helen of Troy hot air brush and it finishes my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>This hot hair brush works great to convince my hair to curl under instead of</li>
            <li>It is the right size, blows the right amount of air, and \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; my hair perfectly when I pull the air brush through.  </li>
            <li>I have a dryer by them and love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love this product.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the concept.</li>
            <li>but I love how it adds volume and straightens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron based on many reviews that said it did not tangle.  </li>
            <li>This takes some practice or more coordination than I have.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it IS considerably better than it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li>sincerely, Mary Carlson</li>
            <li>and I love the rubber brush.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than bristles that do not hold my hair or just get tangled.</li>
            <li>love the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is just what I wanted and ordered.  </li>
            <li>I panicked until I looked online and was able to find another one.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this model for many years</li>
            <li>I love the handle on this curling brush..</li>
            <li>and I do notice her hair looks much better.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to curl my hair with the curling iron because it takes 2 hands.  </li>
            <li>and I use it more than a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love this item I had one before</li>
            <li>This is my favorite curling brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting a better style.</li>
            <li>I love using my &#x27;Helen Troy 1574 Tangle Barrel&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I had a 3/4\\&quot; prior to ordering the 1\\&quot;, its the best product for curling my hair.</li>
            <li>I should have been more cautious.</li>
            <li>The hair turns out more relaxed.</li>
            <li>They work best if your hair is almost completely dry.</li>
            <li>nice soft bristles, easy to grip handle, good air flow and temp . . .</li>
            <li>very happy I replaced my old hot air brush with this one . . .</li>
            <li>My old one is still working great</li>
            <li>I got the 1 inch barrel and it works just great so far  </li>
            <li>I think most women could use this process to keep hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries my hair fast  giving it good bounce and shape.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good hair drier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and quicker.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I wear it just below shoulder length</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair - this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning  hair and a shortish A-line bob with a lot of layering, and need the brush to straighten and shape (add volume and turn the ends under).  </li>
            <li>I have fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see it offered on Amazon and at a much lower price than I am accustomed to pay.  </li>
            <li>The picture makes it look fancy, but once I opened the box, I could tell this was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It does style much better than others, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it compared to others.</li>
            <li>Its a great hair wand for short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a tad cheaply made also.  </li>
            <li>I lightly misted my hair with water, applied  the serum and curled.</li>
            <li>So far, so good</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, smooth, curled and dry hair all in one wonderful tool!!!</li>
            <li>So easy to clean, ( unscrew the brush tip pull off the brush and clean  </li>
            <li>I find the 1\\&quot; size barrel is the best for me and the soft bristles are strong enough to go through hair.</li>
            <li>The soft handle is easy to hang onto and the settings simple and perfect.  </li>
            <li>Curly is okay, but with the front of my hair being longer, it is really fun to scrunch up my curls in the back and then relax the front into a soft page-boy look - and this is the PERFECT tool to do that.</li>
            <li>And most of all it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off from getting too hot before I can finish my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I had already resigned myself to not being able to get a rotating hot air brush that had 4+ star ratings.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this 1 inch, plus the 1 1/2 inch hot air brush - and I am totally satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to negotiate (barrel not too big), it comes in more than one size, and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li>I wish they made it with a  filter that pulls out so that you can clean it.. but still and excellant product..</li>
            <li>the way, my daughter was a hair stylist for 32 years in her own very busy salon</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product but for me</li>
            <li>the brush gives my hair a nice soft curl.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tangle-free&amp;#34; part is true.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and this brush gives it volume and a stylish wave.</li>
            <li>It handles well and the tip stays cool</li>
            <li>I was a great product and I gave it this review due to that.</li>
            <li>I had this same Hot Air Brush before and really liked it so wanted another one to keep at my Lake Cabin!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Learned about this product from someone, and quickly made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>bought this model through a beauty supplys store, but finding it here at almost half the price is great.</li>
            <li>There great, but they start shutting off after about a year and a half,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and you get very hair air</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s easy to work with and left her hair with more volume and managemability.  </li>
            <li>Great little implement.</li>
            <li>All in all I am extremely pleased with this item and would highly recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid it&#x27;s going to slip out of my hands into the sink.</li>
            <li>However it does a nice job with curling and drying your hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice product</li>
            <li>I am not unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li>does not get warm enough for my hair but</li>
            <li>It is not extrememly powerful.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It is definitely tangle free and dries my hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I broke my right arm (i&#x27;m right handed)</li>
            <li>This is a long lasting hot air brush and works great on fine hair as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this in November and was enjoying using it, getting great results but this week, less than 4 months later, it quit while I was using it.  </li>
            <li>This blower brush is fantastic especially for ladies with baby fine hair my me.</li>
            <li>My hair is short and very fine.  </li>
            <li>Even though my hair is fine I started using a clear styling serum.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is clean the lint out of the end of the hot air brush and it is like new.  </li>
            <li>I have used this type of curling rod forever now and I will most likely always use this brand.  </li>
            <li>First time using this brand for my curler.</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for a rotating hot air brush and this model came up with them.</li>
            <li>Thought I would love only having to hold one appliance for drying and styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not so hot that it fries your hair, and it has a button to push if your hair tangles in the brush.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are more for smoothing and drying at the same time and not for curling.</li>
            <li>I use this hot air brush every day.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased as I&#x27;ve use them for many years.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with short hair would love this product.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is a must have for me - I use it every day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks goodness!</li>
            <li>My wife was looking for this exact product .</li>
            <li>Some cheaper models have gotten too hot and shut off.</li>
            <li>I bought this hot air brush about seven years ago</li>
            <li>this hot air brush is just the ticket.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hot air brush at the recommendation of a friend and it lives up to the praise.  </li>
            <li>I have short, wavy hair and love this product.</li>
            <li>Hot Air Brush and this is not &#x27;it&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The rotator button got stuck and at first, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on until I hit the try button and then took the plug out of the outlet and hit reset.</li>
            <li>her hair, it looks like the hot air styler is doing the job.</li>
            <li>With the hot air brush I could because you can use it with one hand.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brand and style hot air brush for 10 years plus.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do my hair without this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush features a rotating barrel release button that lets hair glide off brush without tangling.</li>
            <li>I have used this same model for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that people with short hair love this brush/dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li>It is about the only safe curling device you should use on synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this air brush everyday, so it gets a good work out.  </li>
            <li>I had surgery on my right arm and had much difficulty doing my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hot air brush I&#x27;ve owned, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This does such a nice job of drying my hair and I&#x27;m able to style with a little fullness that I need.  </li>
            <li>Since it is not as hot nor does it blow as much air as the ConAir hot air brush this replaced, it does take longer to get the same results on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it would last longer, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this produce anyway.</li>
            <li>Barrel was too large.</li>
            <li>it was too large for my needs.</li>
            <li>I place the brush underneath a section of hair and smooth it downward to smooth slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It was $10.00 cheaper than the original one I had and is exactly the same!</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair, but this curling iron found a way to tangle my hair into a knot.  </li>
            <li>Besides, if your hair DOES get caught, just push the handy little button and the bristles go inside the barrel right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dries my hair in no time and gives me a little bit of curl, which is nice since I cant use a curling iron either.</li>
            <li>I was afraid the smaller barrel might be too small, but to my surprise and delight, it is perfect and gives me such beautiful curls and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Was hard to find a good replacement, so this serves the purpose well.</li>
            <li>This may be good for a little girl&#x27;s hair, except the noise from the brush may be too loud for her.  </li>
            <li>much depends on the type of hair you have and</li>
            <li>It works really well and does the job well..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and then I go through a pain getting untangled or my straight hair just won&#x27;t wrap around it.</li>
            <li>I much prefer it over a blow dryer, which does not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li>which is what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>It gives a reasonable curl and does not tangle.  </li>
            <li>She had a perm, and her hair was always looking very \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I know mine will work very well as I know how to style hair.</li>
            <li>So they are very dependable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work very well for longer hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this air brush.</li>
            <li>This is much lighter than a blow dryer and much easier to use.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>the brush almost arrived before I ordered it they were so fast..</li>
            <li>The rubber like grips are gentle to the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than using a brush and blow dryer</li>
            <li>I like this brush so much I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>In fact I now use it on my real hair too.  </li>
            <li>Once I figured out what product to use in my hair it was much easier to use.</li>
            <li>so thanks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for short hair, pretty short and maybe fine hair!</li>
            <li>I bought my original curling brush locally, and then kicked myself when I looked for a replacement online.  </li>
            <li>It could probably do better with a little higher heat.  </li>
            <li>I have other stylers, but this one looks better made than those others I have.</li>
            <li>I bought this one after my other one stopped working after many years of service.</li>
            <li>the only downside is that if you do not keep the filter clean  the  brush overheats and cuts out..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only feasible if i have extra time to get ready which most of the time i dont.</li>
            <li>I do have short hair that dries quickly with a blow dryer</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>You really need to mostly dry hair first and then finish off with the hot air brush.</li>
            <li>The remaining hot air tool will be available for these two interchangeable heads when the first unit dies and they eventually do when you least expect it.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the extra money!!!  </li>
            <li>Love not having to bother with a round brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing two of them in two different sizes means I will only use one of hot air tools at a time but both styling heads are quickly interchanged to produce whatever styling effect I desire for the day.  </li>
            <li>The Helen of Troy brush cost a little more than my old brush; and the only difference between my old hot air brush and the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush seemed to be the color, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This particular hot air brush has only 250 watts.</li>
            <li>It is new, in the box.  </li>
            <li>The new Air Brush is a replacement for one I had for years.  </li>
            <li>Strong, but soft and at the same time with just enough grip to get my hair to curve around it.</li>
            <li>If i want a nice round brushed look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hot air brush and the larger 1 1/2 inch brush for about a month now</li>
            <li>She had one before and replaced it with the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd Helen of Troy hot air brush I have owned.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than a curling iron or flat iron - and much easier on my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>This is my third purchase of this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I read a review from someone else who had the same problem with an old brush and purchased the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I had read other reviews saying it had to cool off before it would restart but that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>oh well..Will more than likely buy in another year and a half.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my hair getting caught in brush-style hot rollers, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>I put it in the drawer and got the old hair dryer/curling iron out.  </li>
            <li>and so far it is working well.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with overheating</li>
            <li>I purchased this air brush to replace my old air brush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural inclination to curl up.</li>
            <li>Brushes are too soft to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li>I like this model because it has a 1\\&quot; barrel (very hard to fine) and you can unscrew the barrel for cleaning (very unusual).</li>
            <li>you have to wait for it to cool down..</li>
            <li>This brush works the best if I take the time to dry my hair entirely using the brush, but it also works if I partially blast my hair dry and then use the brush, as long as I don&#x27;t get it too dry.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because this particular description said it was a rotating brush.  </li>
            <li>i was so excited when buying this product, but i find this brush too weak, the hot level dont do anything to the hair.</li>
            <li>Plus with the two temperture settings I can start with high and finish styling my hair on low.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very misleading when you look for a specific item and something similar turns up</li>
            <li>My experience is that they last pretty long.  </li>
            <li>Was very excited about this product, but it arrived broken in packaging that had clearly been repackaged and product used.</li>
            <li>It is about a quarter of the usual strength  of most hot air brushes, including some Helen of Troy versions that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>My old brush kept overheating and would shut-off in the middle of trying to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a senior citizen and really need a lightweight hose to drag around to water my flowers....</li>
            <li>The hot air styler seems to have tamed it down a lot.</li>
            <li>have a short to medium bob haircut and thick fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried ironing my hair before, but the result is too stick-straight for me, but this makes my hair straight without making it too straight, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>I have no talent using a round brush and hair dryer, but this hot air brush combines the two into one.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like going to work with half your hair curled and the rest straight.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is the best hot air brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find the Helen of Troy at an affordable price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want curls - just shape - and this hot air brush is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> Really love this product.!  </li>
            <li> and I really love it!  </li>
            <li> so this hot air brush was a perfect solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is perfect and exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> One of the best things is that it doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li> I was replacing my burned out Helen of Troy hot air brush, and this was the best price.</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine hair for providing volume and curl at the crown of my head</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an airbrush that will give my shoulder length hair a nice curve but not curly.  </li>
            <li> Really a nice curling brush for the price..</li>
            <li> Nice for the price.</li>
            <li> It is very substantial and will be perfect for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me nice fullness and bounce.</li>
            <li> which is nice for positioning the brush.</li>
            <li> This is great for a quick fix when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li> It has been a great asset to me when I needed a quick style.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled very easily around them</li>
            <li> Very easy to use ...</li>
            <li> Very easy to use - no fancy tricks - no burning hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it grips my hair good for styling.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I use the Helen of Troy hot air brush and it finishes my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> This hot hair brush works great to convince my hair to curl under instead of</li>
            <li> It is the right size, blows the right amount of air, and \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; my hair perfectly when I pull the air brush through.  </li>
            <li> I have a dryer by them and love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product.</li>
            <li> Again, I love the concept.</li>
            <li> but I love how it adds volume and straightens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron based on many reviews that said it did not tangle.  </li>
            <li> This takes some practice or more coordination than I have.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> it IS considerably better than it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li> sincerely, Mary Carlson</li>
            <li> and I love the rubber brush.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than bristles that do not hold my hair or just get tangled.</li>
            <li> love the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> I love it and it is just what I wanted and ordered.  </li>
            <li> I panicked until I looked online and was able to find another one.</li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this model for many years</li>
            <li> I love the handle on this curling brush..</li>
            <li> and I do notice her hair looks much better.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to curl my hair with the curling iron because it takes 2 hands.  </li>
            <li> and I use it more than a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love this item I had one before</li>
            <li> This is my favorite curling brush.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting a better style.</li>
            <li> I love using my &#x27;Helen Troy 1574 Tangle Barrel&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I had a 3/4\\&quot; prior to ordering the 1\\&quot;, its the best product for curling my hair.</li>
            <li> I should have been more cautious.</li>
            <li> The hair turns out more relaxed.</li>
            <li> They work best if your hair is almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> nice soft bristles, easy to grip handle, good air flow and temp . . .</li>
            <li> very happy I replaced my old hot air brush with this one . . .</li>
            <li> My old one is still working great</li>
            <li> I got the 1 inch barrel and it works just great so far  </li>
            <li> I think most women could use this process to keep hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries my hair fast  giving it good bounce and shape.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good hair drier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and quicker.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I wear it just below shoulder length</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair - this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning  hair and a shortish A-line bob with a lot of layering, and need the brush to straighten and shape (add volume and turn the ends under).  </li>
            <li> I have fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see it offered on Amazon and at a much lower price than I am accustomed to pay.  </li>
            <li> The picture makes it look fancy, but once I opened the box, I could tell this was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It does style much better than others, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it compared to others.</li>
            <li> Its a great hair wand for short hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a tad cheaply made also.  </li>
            <li> I lightly misted my hair with water, applied  the serum and curled.</li>
            <li> So far, so good</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, smooth, curled and dry hair all in one wonderful tool!!!</li>
            <li> So easy to clean, ( unscrew the brush tip pull off the brush and clean  </li>
            <li> I find the 1\\&quot; size barrel is the best for me and the soft bristles are strong enough to go through hair.</li>
            <li> The soft handle is easy to hang onto and the settings simple and perfect.  </li>
            <li> Curly is okay, but with the front of my hair being longer, it is really fun to scrunch up my curls in the back and then relax the front into a soft page-boy look - and this is the PERFECT tool to do that.</li>
            <li> And most of all it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off from getting too hot before I can finish my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I had already resigned myself to not being able to get a rotating hot air brush that had 4+ star ratings.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this 1 inch, plus the 1 1/2 inch hot air brush - and I am totally satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to negotiate (barrel not too big), it comes in more than one size, and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li> I wish they made it with a  filter that pulls out so that you can clean it.. but still and excellant product..</li>
            <li> the way, my daughter was a hair stylist for 32 years in her own very busy salon</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product but for me</li>
            <li> the brush gives my hair a nice soft curl.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tangle-free&amp;#34; part is true.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and this brush gives it volume and a stylish wave.</li>
            <li> It handles well and the tip stays cool</li>
            <li> I was a great product and I gave it this review due to that.</li>
            <li> I had this same Hot Air Brush before and really liked it so wanted another one to keep at my Lake Cabin!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Learned about this product from someone, and quickly made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> bought this model through a beauty supplys store, but finding it here at almost half the price is great.</li>
            <li> There great, but they start shutting off after about a year and a half,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and you get very hair air</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s easy to work with and left her hair with more volume and managemability.  </li>
            <li> Great little implement.</li>
            <li> All in all I am extremely pleased with this item and would highly recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid it&#x27;s going to slip out of my hands into the sink.</li>
            <li> However it does a nice job with curling and drying your hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice product</li>
            <li> I am not unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> does not get warm enough for my hair but</li>
            <li> It is not extrememly powerful.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It is definitely tangle free and dries my hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I broke my right arm (i&#x27;m right handed)</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting hot air brush and works great on fine hair as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this in November and was enjoying using it, getting great results but this week, less than 4 months later, it quit while I was using it.  </li>
            <li> This blower brush is fantastic especially for ladies with baby fine hair my me.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and very fine.  </li>
            <li> Even though my hair is fine I started using a clear styling serum.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is clean the lint out of the end of the hot air brush and it is like new.  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of curling rod forever now and I will most likely always use this brand.  </li>
            <li> First time using this brand for my curler.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for a rotating hot air brush and this model came up with them.</li>
            <li> Thought I would love only having to hold one appliance for drying and styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not so hot that it fries your hair, and it has a button to push if your hair tangles in the brush.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are more for smoothing and drying at the same time and not for curling.</li>
            <li> I use this hot air brush every day.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased as I&#x27;ve use them for many years.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with short hair would love this product.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is a must have for me - I use it every day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks goodness!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for this exact product .</li>
            <li> Some cheaper models have gotten too hot and shut off.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush about seven years ago</li>
            <li> this hot air brush is just the ticket.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush at the recommendation of a friend and it lives up to the praise.  </li>
            <li> I have short, wavy hair and love this product.</li>
            <li> Hot Air Brush and this is not &#x27;it&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The rotator button got stuck and at first, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on until I hit the try button and then took the plug out of the outlet and hit reset.</li>
            <li> her hair, it looks like the hot air styler is doing the job.</li>
            <li> With the hot air brush I could because you can use it with one hand.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brand and style hot air brush for 10 years plus.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do my hair without this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush features a rotating barrel release button that lets hair glide off brush without tangling.</li>
            <li> I have used this same model for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that people with short hair love this brush/dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have always used a hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li> It is about the only safe curling device you should use on synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this air brush everyday, so it gets a good work out.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery on my right arm and had much difficulty doing my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first hot air brush I&#x27;ve owned, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This does such a nice job of drying my hair and I&#x27;m able to style with a little fullness that I need.  </li>
            <li> Since it is not as hot nor does it blow as much air as the ConAir hot air brush this replaced, it does take longer to get the same results on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it would last longer, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this produce anyway.</li>
            <li> Barrel was too large.</li>
            <li> it was too large for my needs.</li>
            <li> I place the brush underneath a section of hair and smooth it downward to smooth slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It was $10.00 cheaper than the original one I had and is exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair, but this curling iron found a way to tangle my hair into a knot.  </li>
            <li> Besides, if your hair DOES get caught, just push the handy little button and the bristles go inside the barrel right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dries my hair in no time and gives me a little bit of curl, which is nice since I cant use a curling iron either.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the smaller barrel might be too small, but to my surprise and delight, it is perfect and gives me such beautiful curls and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Was hard to find a good replacement, so this serves the purpose well.</li>
            <li> This may be good for a little girl&#x27;s hair, except the noise from the brush may be too loud for her.  </li>
            <li> much depends on the type of hair you have and</li>
            <li> It works really well and does the job well..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and then I go through a pain getting untangled or my straight hair just won&#x27;t wrap around it.</li>
            <li> I much prefer it over a blow dryer, which does not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li> which is what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li> It gives a reasonable curl and does not tangle.  </li>
            <li> She had a perm, and her hair was always looking very \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I know mine will work very well as I know how to style hair.</li>
            <li> So they are very dependable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work very well for longer hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this air brush.</li>
            <li> This is much lighter than a blow dryer and much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> the brush almost arrived before I ordered it they were so fast..</li>
            <li> The rubber like grips are gentle to the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for having it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than using a brush and blow dryer</li>
            <li> I like this brush so much I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li> and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> In fact I now use it on my real hair too.  </li>
            <li> Once I figured out what product to use in my hair it was much easier to use.</li>
            <li> so thanks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for short hair, pretty short and maybe fine hair!</li>
            <li> I bought my original curling brush locally, and then kicked myself when I looked for a replacement online.  </li>
            <li> It could probably do better with a little higher heat.  </li>
            <li> I have other stylers, but this one looks better made than those others I have.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after my other one stopped working after many years of service.</li>
            <li> the only downside is that if you do not keep the filter clean  the  brush overheats and cuts out..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only feasible if i have extra time to get ready which most of the time i dont.</li>
            <li> I do have short hair that dries quickly with a blow dryer</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> You really need to mostly dry hair first and then finish off with the hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The remaining hot air tool will be available for these two interchangeable heads when the first unit dies and they eventually do when you least expect it.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the extra money!!!  </li>
            <li> Love not having to bother with a round brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing two of them in two different sizes means I will only use one of hot air tools at a time but both styling heads are quickly interchanged to produce whatever styling effect I desire for the day.  </li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy brush cost a little more than my old brush; and the only difference between my old hot air brush and the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush seemed to be the color, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This particular hot air brush has only 250 watts.</li>
            <li> It is new, in the box.  </li>
            <li> The new Air Brush is a replacement for one I had for years.  </li>
            <li> Strong, but soft and at the same time with just enough grip to get my hair to curve around it.</li>
            <li> If i want a nice round brushed look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hot air brush and the larger 1 1/2 inch brush for about a month now</li>
            <li> She had one before and replaced it with the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Helen of Troy hot air brush I have owned.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than a curling iron or flat iron - and much easier on my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I read a review from someone else who had the same problem with an old brush and purchased the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews saying it had to cool off before it would restart but that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> oh well..Will more than likely buy in another year and a half.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my hair getting caught in brush-style hot rollers, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> I put it in the drawer and got the old hair dryer/curling iron out.  </li>
            <li> and so far it is working well.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with overheating</li>
            <li> I purchased this air brush to replace my old air brush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural inclination to curl up.</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this model because it has a 1\\&quot; barrel (very hard to fine) and you can unscrew the barrel for cleaning (very unusual).</li>
            <li> you have to wait for it to cool down..</li>
            <li> This brush works the best if I take the time to dry my hair entirely using the brush, but it also works if I partially blast my hair dry and then use the brush, as long as I don&#x27;t get it too dry.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because this particular description said it was a rotating brush.  </li>
            <li> i was so excited when buying this product, but i find this brush too weak, the hot level dont do anything to the hair.</li>
            <li> Plus with the two temperture settings I can start with high and finish styling my hair on low.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very misleading when you look for a specific item and something similar turns up</li>
            <li> My experience is that they last pretty long.  </li>
            <li> Was very excited about this product, but it arrived broken in packaging that had clearly been repackaged and product used.</li>
            <li> It is about a quarter of the usual strength  of most hot air brushes, including some Helen of Troy versions that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> My old brush kept overheating and would shut-off in the middle of trying to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen and really need a lightweight hose to drag around to water my flowers....</li>
            <li> The hot air styler seems to have tamed it down a lot.</li>
            <li> have a short to medium bob haircut and thick fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ironing my hair before, but the result is too stick-straight for me, but this makes my hair straight without making it too straight, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have no talent using a round brush and hair dryer, but this hot air brush combines the two into one.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like going to work with half your hair curled and the rest straight.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure a hot air brush would curl my hair w/o the metal base</li>
            <li> (Shame on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;However,  I also have some responsibility here because I have been buying hot air brushes for at least 15 years</li>
            <li> Last one she had lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I have short hair with no natural body.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s somewhat underpowered for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not enough heat to completely dry hair.</li>
            <li> They would also work well with short hair to style and dry simultaneously.</li>
            <li> It has never shut off prematurely; and it actually seems to dry my hair faster.  </li>
            <li> I thought the brush would rotate, dry and curl my hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> but this item allows time to style and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> It doesnt blow ou enough air to curl and dry damp hair.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry a while and then use the low setting and curling option.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend hot air brushes for really long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had to use that little feature.  </li>
            <li> This is the brand and type of hot air brush I have used for years, but it is not available in my little town.  </li>
            <li> They work well for as long as they work.</li>
            <li> I think maybe my hair was too long, as it kept getting caught in the brush.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair is too long.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to purchase a new one about every 9 to 12 months</li>
            <li> Takes too long to dry and style my hair</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the other brand.</li>
            <li> Air was not hot enough to curl.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to medications I am on--my hairdresser recently gave me layers</li>
            <li> This Hot Air Brush is too slow!  </li>
            <li> When my hair is almost dry</li>
            <li> She uses it every time she washes her hair to dry it and put some curl in it.</li>
            <li> The main complaint that people have of this model is that it cuts off and won&#x27;t restart immediately.  </li>
            <li> I had not clean out the filter and the roller often enough and it started overheating and would automatically shut down, which is good for safety but bad for hair styling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned the brush because the power cut off as the cord swiveled, so there was only power about half the time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to wrap my hair tightly around such cheap plastic - I would be afraid of damage.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s at least 5 or 6 years old.</li>
            <li> They are getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> After partially drying my hair, I finish with this to get volume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru quite a few of them though as they seem to short out or something.  </li>
            <li> It arrived before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected.</li>
            <li> It is not an expensive product, but it&#x27;s not even worth what it cost.</li>
            <li> But this brush is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other models that have very flexible bristles like an old-style hair brush or a very hard plastic bristle; neither of these styles work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit for my wife who always has a difficult time holding on to a hot air curler while attempting to roll a curl or dry her hair.  </li>
            <li> I broke my right arm &amp; am unable to use a hair dryer and a brush</li>
            <li> Second, the curl-release feature worked less than half the time</li>
            <li> so it does not overheat due to residue build up.  </li>
            <li> All other descriptions for this model did not mention that it rotated</li>
            <li> which is something lacking in the other blower I had to return.</li>
            <li> other&#x27;s may like it.</li>
            <li> I recomend anyone to try it, you won&#x27;t purchase any other brand.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not rate it higher is that the release button on the wand does not work all the time making it difficult to remove it from the hair.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY careful with it too....</li>
            <li> Barrel tool for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> When this brush breaks down, I will be buying another one just like it.</li>
            <li> Just dry your hair as usual &amp; then leave slightly damp &amp; use this to shape &amp;/or curl.</li>
            <li> Instead, just wind it a couple of times to get a slight curl on the ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been six years since my last purchase of this same model, I had forgotten that it burned out too, and silly me, I bought another.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta, even though the Amazon price was much less.</li>
            <li> Third, the \\&quot;cap\\&quot; that holds the plastic brush on the base, flew off almost right away</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but it took a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to give you tight spiral type curls.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little button to flip to release the brush so your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  </li>
            <li> Size because my hair is a little shorter now.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little softer, making it nicer to use.</li>
            <li> Which is a few months.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes &amp; done.</li>
            <li> I still have some trouble with some of my hair not releasing</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat wavy hair that needs to be coaxed into doing something other than what it wills and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, because I apparently ordered the wrong size.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t unfortunately because my hair is a little long</li>
            <li> what a waste of money I will never buy anything else from this company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten my hair twisted up in the brush a couple times, but with the touch of a button the brush was instantly and painlessly detangled with no damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and will always buy it when mind needs to be replace.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it was easier than my usual struggle with a brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> it is nearly impossible to get it back on and really is not built for user removal.  </li>
            <li> Hard to give it even one star.</li>
            <li> It was defective, only the tip end heated, the rest blew cold air.</li>
            <li> Just the thing I needed for those thickly maned customers....</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all.  </li>
            <li> secret to avoiding tangles is to not wind the brush all the way up into the hair.</li>
            <li> On high heat, the plastic smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have bad hands and have trouble holding on to a brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It is too Weak!</li>
            <li> Sorry - I have no idea if this works or not.</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say the hose broke after 2 uses......</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t have bristles it doesn&#x27;t get stuck  or twisted in your hair.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to have to give you a bad rating......</li>
            <li> To bad it has become pricy though.</li>
            <li> I truly hated this product it doesn&#x27;t do anything that the consumer said it will do so</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will be returning the item</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s terrible!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works well with finer hair as a styling tool. Not enough heat to completely dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought my original curling brush locally, and then kicked myself when I looked for a replacement online.  It was $10.00 cheaper than the original one I had and is exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I have used this type of curling rod forever now and I will most likely always use this brand.  To bad it has become pricy though.</li>
            <li> First time using this brand for my curler. I have a dryer by them and love it. So far, so good</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. They are getting harder to find. Work great! I can get my hair to do what I want with ease. Absolutely Love this product.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for a rotating hot air brush and this model came up with them. It is not a rotating brush. It&#x27;s very misleading when you look for a specific item and something similar turns up and you think you ordered correctly. Came today &amp; will be returned tomorrow. Sorry - I have no idea if this works or not.</li>
            <li> Again, I love the concept. They work well for as long as they work. Which is a few months. Then they start overheating and shut off.</li>
            <li> I truly hated this product it doesn&#x27;t do anything that the consumer said it will do so I threw it away...just didn&#x27;t think to get my money back for it.  what a waste of money I will never buy anything else from this company!</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly in very good condition.  It is new, in the box.  I haven&#x27;t used it, because I apparently ordered the wrong size.</li>
            <li> Not for me with short hair ,  would like to&lt;br /&gt; Return it.</li>
            <li> Thought I would love only having to hold one appliance for drying and styling my hair.  This Hot Air Brush is too slow!  I put it in the drawer and got the old hair dryer/curling iron out.  (I have short hair)</li>
            <li> This is the first hot air brush I&#x27;ve owned, and I really like it.  I was hesitant to buy it because some reviewers mentioned it gets tangled in their hair, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet to me.  I have long, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my hair getting caught in brush-style hot rollers, but not this one.  Besides, if your hair DOES get caught, just push the handy little button and the bristles go inside the barrel right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much depends on the type of hair you have and what style you like, but I love how it adds volume and straightens.  I don&#x27;t want curls - just shape - and this hot air brush is perfect for that.  I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an airbrush that will give my shoulder length hair a nice curve but not curly.  This one works great...Not so hot that it fries your hair, and it has a button to push if your hair tangles in the brush.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had to use that little feature.  I haven&#x27;t found anything I don&#x27;t like about this product.</li>
            <li> Great ease and control with plastic bristles. Doesn&#x27;t tangle. This is my 3rd one, if that&#x27;s indication. And not my last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hot air brush and the larger 1 1/2 inch brush for about a month now and so far it is working well. I have been using hot air brushes for over 15 years and usually buy Conair because they are found everywhere. But, the Conair brushes I&#x27;ve had tend to not even last a year. The motor dies too soon and they overheat a lot. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with overheating and I think this one will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to avoiding tangles is to not wind the brush all the way up into the hair. Instead, just wind it a couple of times to get a slight curl on the ends. I place the brush underneath a section of hair and smooth it downward to smooth slightly wavy hair. Then, I just curl the ends under a turn or two to prevent tangles. If you wind these brushes all the way up you will get the brush stuck in your hair. These brushes are more for smoothing and drying at the same time and not for curling. They would also work well with short hair to style and dry simultaneously. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend hot air brushes for really long or thick hair. My hair is fine and I wear it just below shoulder length so they have always worked well for me</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron based on many reviews that said it did not tangle.  I should have listened to my gut.  I have short fine hair, but this curling iron found a way to tangle my hair into a knot.  It also uses a system that locks the barrel for curling and then requires that you push a lever to release it.  This takes some practice or more coordination than I have.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rotate. You need to push the button and get it rotate yourself. I still like it. It  works well on my short hair.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.!  Didn&#x27;t know it existed until my daughter showed me hers and how well it worked.  Had done research and knew Helen of Troy products have excellent reputation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this air brush to replace my old air brush.  My old brush kept overheating and would shut-off in the middle of trying to style my hair.  I read a review from someone else who had the same problem with an old brush and purchased the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush to replace it.  The Helen of Troy brush cost a little more than my old brush; and the only difference between my old hot air brush and the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush seemed to be the color, but I decided to give it a try.  It is well worth the extra money!!!  It has never shut off prematurely; and it actually seems to dry my hair faster.  I love it.  I will never go back to the other brand.</li>
            <li> I use this hot air brush every day. After partially drying my hair, I finish with this to get volume.  This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased as I&#x27;ve use them for many years.  These are difficult to find in stores so I always order them.  Anyone with short hair would love this product.</li>
            <li> Was very excited about this product, but it arrived broken in packaging that had clearly been repackaged and product used. The brush did not turn as advertised. The packaging was torn, weathered, and had been packaging-taped shut -- like how you would find a previously-used clearance item in a store. Was looking forward to it, oh well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say the hose broke after 2 uses......I was VERY careful with it too....I&#x27;m a senior citizen and really need a lightweight hose to drag around to water my flowers....my husband repaired it but I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him it wasn&#x27;t going to hold.....it started leaking at the connector.....it IS considerably better than it&#x27;s &amp;#34;counter part&amp;#34;  .....the yellow pocket hose.....that&#x27;s terrible!!!  I&#x27;m sad to have to give you a bad rating......the lightweight was a good idea!!....sincerely, Mary Carlson</li>
            <li> I have no talent using a round brush and hair dryer, but this hot air brush combines the two into one.  What a great way to style your hair and I love the rubber brush.  This is much better than bristles that do not hold my hair or just get tangled. Plus with the two temperture settings I can start with high and finish styling my hair on low.  I no longer have to risk heat damage to have perfectly curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was a great product I do recommend. It did great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase another Helen of Troy products.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best one that i have ever gotten.  love the feel of the handle. I&#x27;m not afraid it&#x27;s going to slip out of my hands into the sink. It dries very nicely also. I would have to thank my sister-in-law for telling me about this air dryer. She has it and loves it too.</li>
            <li> This is great for a quick fix when you are in a hurry.Really a nice curling brush for the price..</li>
            <li> I love it and it is just what I wanted and ordered.  It works really well and does the job well..Thank You</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is a must have for me - I use it every day.  I&#x27;ve gone thru quite a few of them though as they seem to short out or something.  I was very pleased to find the Helen of Troy at an affordable price at Amazon. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years...and mine is starting to go on the blink. I panicked until I looked online and was able to find another one. Thanks goodness!</li>
            <li> I have moderately curly medium-length hair that&#x27;s cut into a bob. Curly is okay, but with the front of my hair being longer, it is really fun to scrunch up my curls in the back and then relax the front into a soft page-boy look - and this is the PERFECT tool to do that. I&#x27;ve tried ironing my hair before, but the result is too stick-straight for me, but this makes my hair straight without making it too straight, if you know what I mean. This brush works the best if I take the time to dry my hair entirely using the brush, but it also works if I partially blast my hair dry and then use the brush, as long as I don&#x27;t get it too dry. The untangle feature works great. I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten my hair twisted up in the brush a couple times, but with the touch of a button the brush was instantly and painlessly detangled with no damage to my hair. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just love it.  My hair comes out great.  I have been using this model for many years and I&#x27;m going to continue its use for years to come.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for this exact product . Last one she had lasted a long time. Would buy this product again if the need arises</li>
            <li> I had this same Hot Air Brush before and really liked it so wanted another one to keep at my Lake Cabin!</li>
            <li> Just the thing I needed for those thickly maned customers....</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair and I&#x27;ve used air brushes for years. This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.  It has also been reliable. Some cheaper models have gotten too hot and shut off. There&#x27;s nothing like going to work with half your hair curled and the rest straight.  I find the 1\\&quot; size barrel is the best for me and the soft bristles are strong enough to go through hair. I have tried other models that have very flexible bristles like an old-style hair brush or a very hard plastic bristle; neither of these styles work well. My hair gets tangled very easily around them and then I go through a pain getting untangled or my straight hair just won&#x27;t wrap around it. These bristles are made of something different. Strong, but soft and at the same time with just enough grip to get my hair to curve around it. Then the heat can take over to put the curl in. It doesn&#x27;t burn like some of the others either. I&#x27;ve had my air brush for 3 months now and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this model through a beauty supplys store, but finding it here at almost half the price is great. Now I can get a second one that I can keep in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Fast, easy, smooth, curled and dry hair all in one wonderful tool!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush about seven years ago it worked great.  I now need to replace it with one of the same.  So easy to clean, ( unscrew the brush tip pull off the brush and clean  the brush slide brush back on screw tip back on.)  This is a long lasting hot air brush and works great on fine hair as well.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for! It does the job of smoothing and gives body at the same time. Makes it easy to shape and style and it lasts!! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I thought the brush would rotate, dry and curl my hair at the same time.  It doesn&#x27;t rotate at all.  However it does a nice job with curling and drying your hair at the same time.  I much prefer it over a blow dryer, which does not work for me at all.  Overall, this is a nice product and I think you will like it.  Very easy to use ... Nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I have short hair with no natural body.  I use this tool every morning and it looks like I have great skills with blow drying.  (Which I do not.)  I like this model because it has a 1\\&quot; barrel (very hard to fine) and you can unscrew the barrel for cleaning (very unusual).</li>
            <li> There great, but they start shutting off after about a year and a half, oh well..Will more than likely buy in another year and a half.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this item.  She had one before and replaced it with the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> It was shipped the day I ordered it.  The only problem was it didn&#x27;t have the instructions but I have the instructions from the one I already have that is breaking.  I just wanted to have a backup and the price was great.</li>
            <li> It was defective, only the tip end heated, the rest blew cold air. I didn&#x27;t want to try again, just got a refund.</li>
            <li> nice soft bristles, easy to grip handle, good air flow and temp . . . very happy I replaced my old hot air brush with this one . . . highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great little implement. The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Did not give my hair any bounce or fullness.  Just didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair is thin but it took a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these brushes in the 1&amp;#34; and the 1 1/2&amp;#34; styles.  I have used them for years and they are truly excellent styling tools.  I have thick somewhat wavy hair that needs to be coaxed into doing something other than what it wills and this hot air brush is just the ticket.  The 1&amp;#34; and 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrels are interchangeable on the styling tool. Purchasing two of them in two different sizes means I will only use one of hot air tools at a time but both styling heads are quickly interchanged to produce whatever styling effect I desire for the day.  The remaining hot air tool will be available for these two interchangeable heads when the first unit dies and they eventually do when you least expect it.  Having a backup is my best plan.  My experience is that they last pretty long.  One thing that keeps them ticking is vacuuming and brushing out the air intake end of the tool so it does not overheat due to residue build up.  If you take the end cover off for cleaning,  it is nearly impossible to get it back on and really is not built for user removal.  Just clean the vent as best you can.</li>
            <li> This is the brand and type of hot air brush I have used for years, but it is not available in my little town.  I was thrilled to see it offered on Amazon and at a much lower price than I am accustomed to pay.  I am a low maintenance person and like the fact that this brush  both dries and curls in one operation.</li>
            <li> I love the handle on this curling brush..It is sturdy, lightweight and the non slip grip handle feels good in my hand when using.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my hair fast  giving it good bounce and shape. I do have short hair that dries quickly with a blow dryer but this item allows time to style and dry at the same time. And most of all it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off from getting too hot before I can finish my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I know that is a safety feature and perhaps with longer hair I would experience that. All in all I am extremely pleased with this item and would highly recommend it to anyone interested. It arrived before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I bought this in November and was enjoying using it, getting great results but this week, less than 4 months later, it quit while I was using it.  I had read other reviews saying it had to cool off before it would restart but that didn&#x27;t work.  It was just done for!  Oh well - on the hunt for a different brand this time!</li>
            <li> Air was not hot enough to curl.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I think maybe my hair was too long, as it kept getting caught in the brush.  I might change my mind if/when I cut my hair shorter.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because this particular description said it was a rotating brush.  All other descriptions for this model did not mention that it rotated which is what I really wanted.  However, I had already resigned myself to not being able to get a rotating hot air brush that had 4+ star ratings.  So I ordered this.  I am not unhappy with it.  I had surgery on my right arm and had much difficulty doing my hair.  It does work well one handedly, grabbing and holding the hair as you turn the brush.  It gives a reasonable curl and does not tangle.  It could probably do better with a little higher heat.  I will keep it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this air brush 4 times now and I really love it!  It is the right size, blows the right amount of air, and \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; my hair perfectly when I pull the air brush through.  I use this air brush everyday, so it gets a good work out.  I usually have to purchase a new one about every 9 to 12 months cause the motor finally gives out.  My only wish is that it would last longer, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this produce anyway.</li>
            <li> This blower brush is fantastic especially for ladies with baby fine hair my me. It gives it bounce and volume and shine. It&#x27;s easy to use and you get very hair air which is something lacking in the other blower I had to return. I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have owned this Helen of Troy style brush for several years and can&#x27;t imagine being without it.&lt;br /&gt;This one will go into my travel bag.....forgot it once, never again!</li>
            <li> The best!  Because it doesn&#x27;t have bristles it doesn&#x27;t get stuck  or twisted in your hair.  It has rubber tipped &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; that glide through your hair and release tangle-free!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I bought the spin air brush by conair, I figured this would work. It didn&#x27;t unfortunately because my hair is a little long and it didn&#x27;t put out enough air. I gave it to my mom and she seems to like it alot. I would recommend this for short hair, pretty short and maybe fine hair!</li>
            <li> Product is everything that I was looking for in a hand held barrel hair dryer.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good hair drier.</li>
            <li> LIFE OF THIS PRODUCT IS ABOUT 1/2 YEAR</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great.  This hot hair brush works great to convince my hair to curl under instead of it&#x27;s natural inclination to curl up.</li>
            <li> i was so excited when buying this product, but i find this brush too weak, the hot level dont do anything to the hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used Helen of Troy products before..  I have fine hair and it grips my hair good for styling.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product but for me it&#x27;s only feasible if i have extra time to get ready which most of the time i dont. If i want a nice round brushed look i use this and it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush at the recommendation of a friend and it lives up to the praise.  It does a great job on wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected. Since it is not as hot nor does it blow as much air as the ConAir hot air brush this replaced, it does take longer to get the same results on my fine hair. Was hard to find a good replacement, so this serves the purpose well.</li>
            <li> does not get warm enough for my hair but other&#x27;s may like it.</li>
            <li> I have short, wavy hair and love this product. When my hair is almost dry I use the Helen of Troy hot air brush and it finishes my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> I broke my right arm &amp; am unable to use a hair dryer and a brush so this hot air brush was a perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my hair in no time and gives me a little bit of curl, which is nice since I cant use a curling iron either.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a 1&amp;#34; ROTATING&amp;#34; Hot Air Brush and this is not &#x27;it&#x27;.  I was very disappointed and will be returning the item</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Helen of Troy hot air brush I have owned. Works well and is a quality item. The switches do wear out over time but am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> The rotator button got stuck and at first, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on until I hit the try button and then took the plug out of the outlet and hit reset. The picture makes it look fancy, but once I opened the box, I could tell this was cheaply made. It does style much better than others, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it compared to others.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair - this is the product for you. Very easy to use - no fancy tricks - no burning hair. Just dry your hair as usual &amp; then leave slightly damp &amp; use this to shape &amp;/or curl. Takes a few minutes &amp; done.</li>
            <li> Actually, I bought two.... one for me and one for a friend. I have not used mine because it is in my travel bag and I have not been traveling. My friend has been using hers and I do notice her hair looks much better. She had a perm, and her hair was always looking very \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot;. The hot air styler seems to have tamed it down a lot. Although she does not take time to \\&quot;style\\&quot; her hair, it looks like the hot air styler is doing the job. I know mine will work very well as I know how to style hair. I have other stylers, but this one looks better made than those others I have. It is very substantial and will be perfect for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my daughter was a hair stylist for 32 years in her own very busy salon and she wanted me to say that this is \\&quot;a very good brand\\&quot;. When she had to buy curling irons, blow dryers, etc. she preferred this brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Styles and dries at the same time. I replaced an identical dryer that I had for years. I had not clean out the filter and the roller often enough and it started overheating and would automatically shut down, which is good for safety but bad for hair styling. I say this because I think it would have lasted forever if I took the time to keep the air flow unobstructed.</li>
            <li> I broke my right arm (i&#x27;m right handed) and I wasn&#x27;t able to curl my hair with the curling iron because it takes 2 hands.  With the hot air brush I could because you can use it with one hand.  Even after my arm is healed I will still use it.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and quicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand and style hot air brush for 10 years plus.  It works great on my fine hair for providing volume and curl at the crown of my head and I use it more than a blow dryer.  The handle is easy to negotiate (barrel not too big), it comes in more than one size, and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and will always buy it when mind needs to be replace. This is the third Helen of Troy product I have bought.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 1 inch, plus the 1 1/2 inch hot air brush - and I am totally satisfied with them.  They give my hair volume, style, and just everything I want.  So much easier to use than a curling iron or flat iron - and much easier on my hair and scalp.  There&#x27;s a little button to flip to release the brush so your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  This is just a wonderful product.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The new Air Brush is a replacement for one I had for years.  This is an excellent product and works well if you are not proficient in using a hair dryer and brush style your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this item I had one before and it lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> I already have been using the 1 1/2 in. Barrel tool for at least ten years. I purchased this 1 in. Size because my hair is a little shorter now. I couldn&#x27;t do my hair without this hot air brush. My old one is still working great and it&#x27;s at least 5 or 6 years old. So they are very dependable. They work best if your hair is almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite curling brush. I bought this one after my other one stopped working after many years of service. I don&#x27;t think it would work very well for longer hair but mine is somewhat short and the brush gives my hair a nice soft curl. When this brush breaks down, I will be buying another one just like it.</li>
            <li> Barrel was too large.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush features a rotating barrel release button that lets hair glide off brush without tangling. Next I do need the smaller 1/2 inch barrel for my shorter lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> It is the best hot air brush I have ever used! Works great on my medium length hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was a great product and I gave it this review due to that. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I really like this air brush. I have bad hands and have trouble holding on to a brush and blow dryer. This is much lighter than a blow dryer and much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  The 1 inch barrel is the perfect size for shaping medium length hair.  The soft handle is easy to hang onto and the settings simple and perfect.  The &amp;#34;tangle-free&amp;#34; part is true.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit for my wife who always has a difficult time holding on to a hot air curler while attempting to roll a curl or dry her hair.  She totally loves it and I have gained some points with her.  I love it.  Great unit.</li>
            <li> I gave this item as a gift to my sister, and she has indicated that she loves it.  She said it&#x27;s easy to work with and left her hair with more volume and managemability.  Based on her feedback, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to dry and style my hair and I have very short hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this same model for many years.  The main complaint that people have of this model is that it cuts off and won&#x27;t restart immediately.  All you have to do is clean the lint out of the end of the hot air brush and it is like new.  I have two of these as we have two residences and I keep one at each place.  It has been a great asset to me when I needed a quick style.  I have short hair and use the 1\\&quot; brush size.  My hair is straight and this brush gives it volume and a stylish wave.</li>
            <li> I cannot seem to get used to it.  Perhaps after I try enough times, I will. I wish I would have gotten the smaller size.</li>
            <li> this is my third  time buying this product. the only downside is that if you do not keep the filter clean  the  brush overheats and cuts out.. you have to wait for it to cool down.. I wish they made it with a  filter that pulls out so that you can clean it.. but still and excellant product.. this company are great .. the brush almost arrived before I ordered it they were so fast..</li>
            <li> One of my friennds had one of these brushes and couldn&#x27;t find one locally.  This is perfect and exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> This does such a nice job of drying my hair and I&#x27;m able to style with a little fullness that I need.  The rubber like grips are gentle to the hair shaft.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Its a great hair wand for short hair. It dries well and it doesnt burn your fingers. Thanks for having it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Learned about this product from someone, and quickly made the purchase.  It works great on my wigs for effortless styling.</li>
            <li> This brush dryer is a good idea. However, I have not been as successful as I want in executing a great hairdo.  Perhaps my hair is too long.  I have heard that people with short hair love this brush/dryer.  I find it somewhat lacking.</li>
            <li> I had my hair cut short and like using a curling brush.  This works really well and it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair.  It&#x27;s much easier than using a brush and blow dryer and I&#x27;m getting a better style.</li>
            <li> Now I remember why I don&#x27;t like this curler. This is my third purchase of this hot air brush. They last for 3-5 uses then the heating element burns out,every time. It&#x27;s been six years since my last purchase of this same model, I had forgotten that it burned out too, and silly me, I bought another. Third time was NOT a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned the brush because the power cut off as the cord swiveled, so there was only power about half the time.  It&#x27;s really cheaply made.  The plastic bristles do not grip hair at all, which is a problem for me because my hair is short.  I have fine, thinning  hair and a shortish A-line bob with a lot of layering, and need the brush to straighten and shape (add volume and turn the ends under).  This brush sort of worked as a hot comb, but not much more.  On high heat, the plastic smelled terrible.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to wrap my hair tightly around such cheap plastic - I would be afraid of damage.  I&#x27;m going to try a more expensive brush with a ceramic barrel.  On the plus side, it was easier than my usual struggle with a brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love using my &#x27;Helen Troy 1574 Tangle Barrel&#x27;. I had a 3/4\\&quot; prior to ordering the 1\\&quot;, its the best product for curling my hair. I recomend anyone to try it, you won&#x27;t purchase any other brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta, even though the Amazon price was much less. I can&#x27;t recommend it! First of all, it&#x27;s somewhat underpowered for anyone with thick hair. Second, the curl-release feature worked less than half the time and I wound up having to physically untangle and pull my hair out of the plastic bristle brush. Third, the \\&quot;cap\\&quot; that holds the plastic brush on the base, flew off almost right away and I had to search the bathroom for it and screw it back on. It is not an expensive product, but it&#x27;s not even worth what it cost. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; product in a number of ways.</li>
            <li> I need to use my hairdryer to get the curl I want. It doesnt blow ou enough air to curl and dry damp hair.</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all.  Brushes are too soft to hold the hair.  Heat only is at the end of the barrel.  This may be good for a little girl&#x27;s hair, except the noise from the brush may be too loud for her.  My hair is short and very fine.  But this brush is not what I expected.  Not at all recommended.  Hard to give it even one star.</li>
            <li> I like this brush so much I ordered another one.  I wasn&#x27;t sure a hot air brush would curl my hair w/o the metal base but I was wrong this works just great,  One of the best things is that it doesn&#x27;t get too hot so you can curl some hair and hold it for 10-15 seconds next to your scalp without getting burnt.&lt;br /&gt;I have a short to medium bob haircut and thick fine hair. I got the 1 inch barrel and it works just great so far  Some reviews said it didn&#x27;t have enough power but it has plenty of power for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t bother with is the curl release to me it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  I just unwind the curl like I would do with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; that comes with the brush.  I hope they never stop making these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for my mom and she loves them.  They are durable and don&#x27;t tangle your hair.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and she really likes it.  She uses it every time she washes her hair to dry it and put some curl in it.</li>
            <li> I have always used a hot air curling brush.  This is one of the best ever.  The bristles are a little softer, making it nicer to use.</li>
            <li> This particular hot air brush has only 250 watts. It is too Weak! It is about a quarter of the usual strength  of most hot air brushes, including some Helen of Troy versions that I have bought in the past. Hot air brush power can vary, but it is usually 1200 watts. The Amazon product description does not give power specifications, just barrel size. (Shame on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;However,  I also have some responsibility here because I have been buying hot air brushes for at least 15 years and I assumed standard product power and didn&#x27;t double check. I should have been more cautious.</li>
            <li> I bought this to handle some of my synthetic wigs.  It is about the only safe curling device you should use on synthetic hair.  It does a great job.  In fact I now use it on my real hair too.  The reason I did not rate it higher is that the release button on the wand does not work all the time making it difficult to remove it from the hair.  It does feel a tad cheaply made also.  I will continue to try to master the release button.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out what product to use in my hair it was much easier to use. I have fine shoulder length hair. Even though my hair is fine I started using a clear styling serum. I need to have that &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so my hair won&#x27;t tangle. I lightly misted my hair with water, applied  the serum and curled. I think most women could use this process to keep hair tangle free. I still have some trouble with some of my hair not releasing but that&#x27;s just me. It gives me nice fullness and bounce. This isn&#x27;t going to give you tight spiral type curls. The hair turns out more relaxed.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my needs. It&#x27;s a good styler. You really need to mostly dry hair first and then finish off with the hot air brush. It is not extrememly powerful. It handles well and the tip stays cool which is nice for positioning the brush. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> it was too large for my needs.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my burned out Helen of Troy hot air brush, and this was the best price. so thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to medications I am on--my hairdresser recently gave me layers and I was looking for an air brush with a smaller barrel.  I read the reviews on this air brush and decided I would go with this brand--one I haven&#x27;t tried before.  I was afraid the smaller barrel might be too small, but to my surprise and delight, it is perfect and gives me such beautiful curls and is so easy to use.  It is definitely tangle free and dries my hair quickly and easily.  Love not having to bother with a round brush and dryer.  This just makes drying my hair such a breeze.  It is lightweight and does not come in a clam shell.  I let my hair air dry a while and then use the low setting and curling option.  Great product for me and I would recommend it.</li>
