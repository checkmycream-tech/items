            <li>I was trying it for a dirk strider cosplay and wasn&#x27;t to happy when I saw the condition it came in...probably going to return it when I get the chance...</li>

            <li>Either way, still a great wig.</li>

            <li>AMAZING quality!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my DirkStrider cosplay :)</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for my Tweek Tweak cosplay and was happy that it came looking like the picture color wise.</li>
            <li>I actually really liked it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived within a week of it being shipped out, well before the estimated delivery time, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a pit brighter and poofy when you wear it but its still good quality.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s good and looks</li>
            <li>Everything was great accept that the top was not in good condition.</li>
            <li>My cos-playing teenager loved the wig - the quality and the care taken in sending it to us was top notch!  </li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with this wig.  </li>
            <li>It fits great , I just absolutely love this wig .</li>
            <li>I did have to style it myself, which is okay!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it, it was styled line in the picture and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite wig!</li>
            <li>Nice texture&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But worked perfectly for a older Dave if the color matches your headcanon.</li>
            <li>The color matched the picture and was very easy to style.</li>
            <li>It is really soft and perfect for my Dave or Dirk cosplay</li>
            <li>Easy to spike in a variety of ways and looks nice</li>
            <li>The hair fibers worked great with my hair straightener to style it to look like honey senpai&#x27;s hair...not to mention the quality was nice and soft!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>This wig is her favorite</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic wig!</li>
            <li>so i just simply trimmed them and the wig looks perfect for me now.</li>
            <li>Cute handwritten note and adorable hair band</li>
            <li>I will surely buy from Cf-fashion again :)</li>
            <li>I made sure the clips were not attached and everything.</li>
            <li>When I went to try it on I was pleased to find that it had a hair cap to go with it to help get all of my hair out of the way.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in love with the feel of the wig.</li>
            <li>Comes with a cute hairtie, and a wig cap.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with it!</li>
            <li>This was WAY more than the company had to do.  </li>
            <li>The wig was okay.</li>
            <li>The top is a bit rougher than the bottom layers</li>
            <li>The wig is more yellowish than the picture shown.</li>
            <li>I was very excited that it came the WEEK after I ordered it, instead of having to wait a month.  </li>
            <li>many of the reviews, I think my expectations were higher for this wig, but it is definitely good for its price, and not a bad wig at all.</li>
            <li>Some wigs can go for around $30 and leave much to be desired quality wise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to style and looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Overall, it looked good for my cosplay!</li>
            <li>Easy to style&lt;</li>
            <li>It went well with my costume and was easy to style and adjust on my head.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quite easy.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t come with &#x27;spikes&#x27; but they are really easy to made.</li>
            <li>The hair is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>, I had to style it with a strong gel</li>
            <li>if youre looking for a good teasing wig but cosplaying on a budget, i highly suggest buying this wig!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a bit lighter than in the picture though, thats fine by me</li>
            <li>I will be ordering from Cf-fashion quickly!</li>
            <li>on this wig works perfectly along with a little hairspray.</li>
            <li>It styled perfectly and has a great cut to it, though the back could be shortened a little as it reads a bit as mullet, but that was fine for my late-70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>i believe, WELL BEFORE the estimated arrival time, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li>And its so cheap.</li>
            <li>Looks real, the style is perfect, and it&#x27;s fantastic for those parties where you just want something different.</li>
            <li>However, taking the wig out of the bag i noticed in areas i was able to see the wefts, especially around the area where its layered, and this was before i fluffed it up, many more wefts are able to be seen when the wig is fluffed up.</li>
            <li>Fantastic wig and the color is just like the picture</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Free wig net&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>the timing was great and it arrived in the same box with my Usa chan I ordered!</li>
            <li>This wig is so fluffy and perfect!</li>
            <li>i may order a second for ringabel (bravely default)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig itself is really high quality and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I first saw it in the bag it was a good decent color</li>
            <li>Color is almost the same just a bit more darker but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li>Came in both the right colors AND style!  </li>
            <li>Good wig a bit too much yellow</li>
            <li>It took a lot of styling but the finished product was good enough for my Dirk cosplay</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the softest ever, but it it full and will get the job done.</li>
            <li>A good wig overall.</li>
            <li>Over-all it was cool</li>
            <li>i love this wig so much.</li>
            <li>and i got so many compliments that people thought it was real,</li>
            <li>It is the same color as the picture, very easy to put on and keep on, easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Dirk Strider cosplay and i was really surprised at how easy it was to style !</li>
            <li>like I bought it the first time!</li>
            <li>I did use this for a Tweek Tweak cosplay, so with a little bit of gel it style great.</li>
            <li>shorter than the picture suggests, much paler in color, not at all accurate.</li>
            <li>Im using this for Dirk strider it takes constant styling but its nice quality</li>
            <li>Nice thickness, not as yellow as it appears in the picture and was a bit longer.</li>
            <li>The wig was a great price without the personal touch; which was greatly appreciated and again is one more reason to order from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>It came with a wig cap as well, which was incredibly useful.</li>
            <li>It took a week for it to come ,  but was worth the wait .  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re not wearing a hat in your cosplay you&#x27;ll need some lots of gel and time to style it so it&#x27;ll look right.</li>
            <li>sent my mom a picture of me in this wig right after I opened it, without styling, and she thought I had cut and dyed my hair.</li>
            <li>just it needs the right products to make the spikes stay in place</li>
            <li>Also a good excuse to not brush your real hair.</li>
            <li>The color is kind of off from the pictures, it&#x27;s actually more of a white blonde</li>
            <li>There are adjustment straps in the back for size and has a very comfortable shape.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I really recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li>Alright, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been sent a product from Amazon that is nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time this company has screwed up orders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about my products, and me giving a 5 star review is saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some strands came out at first</li>
            <li>totally looks cute.</li>
            <li>exactly as described and pictured</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying a wig online</li>
            <li>this wig is nice and thick so it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
            <li>Honestly, read the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when this came in a week early in the mail.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very full, and it actually feels and is layered</li>
            <li>and it arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Top looks very messy (easy to hide if you style it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy and simply to style</li>
            <li>Came in super early considering that it came all the way from china.</li>
            <li>The first picture is its original before I styled and the second is after I styled.</li>
            <li>The item is pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li>Very layered.  </li>
            <li>There also isn&#x27;t as much hair.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It came fast</li>
            <li>you letter I received and the free gifts: a scrunchie and a hair net!!</li>
            <li>I tried for over two hours to get this to fit last night and it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The front was much shorter than I anticipated form the photos and ended up having to buy extensions to make up for it.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected I will say that.</li>
            <li>thanks so much uvu</li>
            <li>Was really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wearing it to a con than you really should use hairspray.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems,  it came fast</li>
            <li>so well it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>This wig was absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li>The bangs at the top, however, are a bit harder to manage and require a lot of styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wig for the price but not amazing by any means</li>
            <li>so I was excited to open it</li>
            <li>so at first it had shed a few pieces but it stopped and I haven&#x27;t had any more shedding</li>
            <li>Better to get a regular short blond wig and style that than get this.</li>
            <li>It was very soft too!</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes.</li>
            <li>Really high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted pics of the wig from multiple sides i.e. front, left, right, back, and top</li>
            <li>so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I will attach a photo comparing my old wig with this new one, the old one on the left and the new one on the right.</li>
            <li>First of all, this wig is a yellow, almost orangey colour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the exact same from this conpany before and got what was pictured, so I figured I&#x27;d order another one for a friend.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more for other cosplays.</li>
            <li>Epic Wig!</li>
            <li>It styles easily, but does shed a little.</li>
            <li>Very nice, was a little small on my head though.</li>
            <li>A little water will do and you might have to cut it to fit your styl .</li>
            <li>But no seriously, I plan on ordering another one (same exact one) for another friend who wishes to cosplay the same character.</li>
            <li>I suspect that they were shipped the wrong wig, but I can&#x27;t be certain because the one i received was good enough for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the wig fibers are very very soft and realistic, little to no artificial shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay quality, at least.</li>
            <li>early 80&#x27;s proto-punk inspired rococopunk outfit.</li>
            <li>wow was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>I probably should&#x27;ve chosen something smaller for Bill Cipher but plenty of people recognized me so it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li>The only issue with my wig is that the hair clumps together on the nott of the head and makes some hairs stick straight up.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, thick red hair, and it covers it perfectly!</li>
            <li>the wefts in top were very easy to style, just tease the base of the fibers in the direction you want, spray it with got2be, and pull the ends to a point</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s full and fluffy to the extent of your imagination.</li>
            <li>Soft, no loose threads inside.</li>
            <li>Thick and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I definitely suggest getting ( it even came early!)</li>
            <li>wig is very thick and have many layers so it&#x27;s great for styling especially if you want to cosplay various characters with crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this item for a link cosplay but it seems that it&#x27;s smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li>This wig shedded a little when I first got it</li>
            <li>I might just need to mess around with it a bit to get it to look long in the right places.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to fluff the wig up again and work with it to get the exact same style as seen in its photos, but this is expected when the wig has been flattened by being in a box for shipping.  </li>
            <li>You can see the lace at some points but the wig has a fair amount of thick hair, so much that I&#x27;ve had to thin it down a bit.</li>
            <li>Its missing a little fluff but its overall allright, good fitting (and I have long hair and a little bigger than average head), color is a little yellower than expected but barely noticeable.</li>

            <li> I was trying it for a dirk strider cosplay and wasn&#x27;t to happy when I saw the condition it came in...probably going to return it when I get the chance...</li>
            <li> Great color&lt;</li>
            <li> Then the quality was really great.  </li>
            <li> It came already styled (though I will have to make some changes for my link cosplay) and it is great quality.  </li>
            <li> I used with my cosplay of Dirk Strider and it was great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> For the price that I got it for, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> but it looks great.</li>
            <li> Either way, still a great wig.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see through the hair to the wig scalp, which was very nice.</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice for cos</li>
            <li> AMAZING quality!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my DirkStrider cosplay :)</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Tweek Tweak cosplay and was happy that it came looking like the picture color wise.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived within a week of it being shipped out, well before the estimated delivery time, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a pit brighter and poofy when you wear it but its still good quality.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s good and looks</li>
            <li> Everything was great accept that the top was not in good condition.</li>
            <li> My cos-playing teenager loved the wig - the quality and the care taken in sending it to us was top notch!  </li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with this wig.  </li>
            <li> It fits great , I just absolutely love this wig .</li>
            <li> I did have to style it myself, which is okay!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it, it was styled line in the picture and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite wig!</li>
            <li> Nice texture&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> But worked perfectly for a older Dave if the color matches your headcanon.</li>
            <li> The color matched the picture and was very easy to style.</li>
            <li> It is really soft and perfect for my Dave or Dirk cosplay</li>
            <li> Easy to spike in a variety of ways and looks nice</li>
            <li> The hair fibers worked great with my hair straightener to style it to look like honey senpai&#x27;s hair...not to mention the quality was nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This wig is her favorite</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic wig!</li>
            <li> so i just simply trimmed them and the wig looks perfect for me now.</li>
            <li> Cute handwritten note and adorable hair band</li>
            <li> I will surely buy from Cf-fashion again :)</li>
            <li> I made sure the clips were not attached and everything.</li>
            <li> When I went to try it on I was pleased to find that it had a hair cap to go with it to help get all of my hair out of the way.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m in love with the feel of the wig.</li>
            <li> Comes with a cute hairtie, and a wig cap.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with it!</li>
            <li> This was WAY more than the company had to do.  </li>
            <li> The wig was okay.</li>
            <li> The top is a bit rougher than the bottom layers</li>
            <li> The wig is more yellowish than the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I was very excited that it came the WEEK after I ordered it, instead of having to wait a month.  </li>
            <li> many of the reviews, I think my expectations were higher for this wig, but it is definitely good for its price, and not a bad wig at all.</li>
            <li> Some wigs can go for around $30 and leave much to be desired quality wise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to style and looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> Overall, it looked good for my cosplay!</li>
            <li> Easy to style&lt;</li>
            <li> It went well with my costume and was easy to style and adjust on my head.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite easy.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t come with &#x27;spikes&#x27; but they are really easy to made.</li>
            <li> The hair is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> , I had to style it with a strong gel</li>
            <li> if youre looking for a good teasing wig but cosplaying on a budget, i highly suggest buying this wig!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a bit lighter than in the picture though, thats fine by me</li>
            <li> I will be ordering from Cf-fashion quickly!</li>
            <li> on this wig works perfectly along with a little hairspray.</li>
            <li> It styled perfectly and has a great cut to it, though the back could be shortened a little as it reads a bit as mullet, but that was fine for my late-70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> i believe, WELL BEFORE the estimated arrival time, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li> And its so cheap.</li>
            <li> Looks real, the style is perfect, and it&#x27;s fantastic for those parties where you just want something different.</li>
            <li> However, taking the wig out of the bag i noticed in areas i was able to see the wefts, especially around the area where its layered, and this was before i fluffed it up, many more wefts are able to be seen when the wig is fluffed up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic wig and the color is just like the picture</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Free wig net&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> the timing was great and it arrived in the same box with my Usa chan I ordered!</li>
            <li> This wig is so fluffy and perfect!</li>
            <li> i may order a second for ringabel (bravely default)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig itself is really high quality and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I first saw it in the bag it was a good decent color</li>
            <li> Color is almost the same just a bit more darker but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li> Came in both the right colors AND style!  </li>
            <li> Good wig a bit too much yellow</li>
            <li> It took a lot of styling but the finished product was good enough for my Dirk cosplay</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the softest ever, but it it full and will get the job done.</li>
            <li> A good wig overall.</li>
            <li> Over-all it was cool</li>
            <li> i love this wig so much.</li>
            <li> and i got so many compliments that people thought it was real,</li>
            <li> It is the same color as the picture, very easy to put on and keep on, easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dirk Strider cosplay and i was really surprised at how easy it was to style !</li>
            <li> like I bought it the first time!</li>
            <li> I did use this for a Tweek Tweak cosplay, so with a little bit of gel it style great.</li>
            <li> shorter than the picture suggests, much paler in color, not at all accurate.</li>
            <li> Im using this for Dirk strider it takes constant styling but its nice quality</li>
            <li> Nice thickness, not as yellow as it appears in the picture and was a bit longer.</li>
            <li> The wig was a great price without the personal touch; which was greatly appreciated and again is one more reason to order from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> It came with a wig cap as well, which was incredibly useful.</li>
            <li> It took a week for it to come ,  but was worth the wait .  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re not wearing a hat in your cosplay you&#x27;ll need some lots of gel and time to style it so it&#x27;ll look right.</li>
            <li> sent my mom a picture of me in this wig right after I opened it, without styling, and she thought I had cut and dyed my hair.</li>
            <li> just it needs the right products to make the spikes stay in place</li>
            <li> Also a good excuse to not brush your real hair.</li>
            <li> The color is kind of off from the pictures, it&#x27;s actually more of a white blonde</li>
            <li> There are adjustment straps in the back for size and has a very comfortable shape.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I really recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> Alright, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been sent a product from Amazon that is nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time this company has screwed up orders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my products, and me giving a 5 star review is saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some strands came out at first</li>
            <li> totally looks cute.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and pictured</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying a wig online</li>
            <li> this wig is nice and thick so it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
            <li> Honestly, read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this came in a week early in the mail.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very full, and it actually feels and is layered</li>
            <li> and it arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Top looks very messy (easy to hide if you style it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy and simply to style</li>
            <li> Came in super early considering that it came all the way from china.</li>
            <li> The first picture is its original before I styled and the second is after I styled.</li>
            <li> The item is pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> Very layered.  </li>
            <li> There also isn&#x27;t as much hair.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It came fast</li>
            <li> you letter I received and the free gifts: a scrunchie and a hair net!!</li>
            <li> I tried for over two hours to get this to fit last night and it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The front was much shorter than I anticipated form the photos and ended up having to buy extensions to make up for it.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected I will say that.</li>
            <li> thanks so much uvu</li>
            <li> Was really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wearing it to a con than you really should use hairspray.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems,  it came fast</li>
            <li> so well it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> This wig was absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li> The bangs at the top, however, are a bit harder to manage and require a lot of styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig for the price but not amazing by any means</li>
            <li> so I was excited to open it</li>
            <li> so at first it had shed a few pieces but it stopped and I haven&#x27;t had any more shedding</li>
            <li> Better to get a regular short blond wig and style that than get this.</li>
            <li> It was very soft too!</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes.</li>
            <li> Really high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted pics of the wig from multiple sides i.e. front, left, right, back, and top</li>
            <li> so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I will attach a photo comparing my old wig with this new one, the old one on the left and the new one on the right.</li>
            <li> First of all, this wig is a yellow, almost orangey colour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the exact same from this conpany before and got what was pictured, so I figured I&#x27;d order another one for a friend.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more for other cosplays.</li>
            <li> Epic Wig!</li>
            <li> It styles easily, but does shed a little.</li>
            <li> Very nice, was a little small on my head though.</li>
            <li> A little water will do and you might have to cut it to fit your styl .</li>
            <li> But no seriously, I plan on ordering another one (same exact one) for another friend who wishes to cosplay the same character.</li>
            <li> I suspect that they were shipped the wrong wig, but I can&#x27;t be certain because the one i received was good enough for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the wig fibers are very very soft and realistic, little to no artificial shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay quality, at least.</li>
            <li> early 80&#x27;s proto-punk inspired rococopunk outfit.</li>
            <li> wow was I surprised.  </li>
            <li> I probably should&#x27;ve chosen something smaller for Bill Cipher but plenty of people recognized me so it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li> The only issue with my wig is that the hair clumps together on the nott of the head and makes some hairs stick straight up.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, thick red hair, and it covers it perfectly!</li>
            <li> the wefts in top were very easy to style, just tease the base of the fibers in the direction you want, spray it with got2be, and pull the ends to a point</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s full and fluffy to the extent of your imagination.</li>
            <li> Soft, no loose threads inside.</li>
            <li> Thick and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I definitely suggest getting ( it even came early!)</li>
            <li> wig is very thick and have many layers so it&#x27;s great for styling especially if you want to cosplay various characters with crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this item for a link cosplay but it seems that it&#x27;s smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> This wig shedded a little when I first got it</li>
            <li> I might just need to mess around with it a bit to get it to look long in the right places.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to fluff the wig up again and work with it to get the exact same style as seen in its photos, but this is expected when the wig has been flattened by being in a box for shipping.  </li>
            <li> You can see the lace at some points but the wig has a fair amount of thick hair, so much that I&#x27;ve had to thin it down a bit.</li>
            <li> Its missing a little fluff but its overall allright, good fitting (and I have long hair and a little bigger than average head), color is a little yellower than expected but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> bought this as a Dirk Strider wig, and with a bit of styling it certainly does the trick, however if you want to have it lay flat, it will reveal the messy crown.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t been over to his place to see it myself, but he says it&#x27;s soft and not shiny, and it&#x27;s got just enough layering and lift to it to style it with only a little hairspray and some bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Made it a bit difficult to style, but it looked nice once I thinned it out a little.</li>
            <li> for the QUALITY of the wig, the top/crown of the wig is VERY full and fluffy, almost as thick as a well-made arda wig!</li>
            <li> (including ordering other various wigs from this same company)</li>
            <li> Certainly isnt as thick as the pictures depict it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also rather long, almost shoulder length.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit long</li>
            <li> Also came much earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> It is a bit long, but I prefer it that way</li>
            <li> I used it for my Dirk Strider Cosplay and it looked far too fluffy</li>
            <li> and it was long.</li>
            <li> Also you&#x27;d have to straighten it if you want it to look as long as it does in the picture</li>
            <li> It is very durable and thick.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for Dirk or any other spiky haired blond though.</li>
            <li> In the pictures you can see it is really short and does not fit in the back.</li>
            <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t quite as long as I had expected it to be, but that&#x27;s just me being picky</li>
            <li> Complete chunks of hair would fall out if I gently brushed my hands through it, which was a bit necessary as the bangs were ridiculous and stiff.  </li>
            <li> There is a little difference between the picture of the wig and the actually wig.</li>
            <li> you may need to cut the back a little</li>
            <li> the most part it is as described and the only issue I have is that while it is thick in the front, the back of the wig is a little thin, meaning the cap (which is a strange netting instead of the usual wig cap) can be seen even with slight movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the sides are also fairly thick, but the back could be better, theres a few thinner spots where the base of the wefts are slightly visible, but only if youre REALLY looking for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s really no complaints because it looks so real.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be here on time because of the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> The color is WAAAAAY off and the center of the hair where the hairline is supposed to be is to the side.</li>
            <li> I was goign to use it for a Dave STrider and Ben Drowned cosplay</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking to have it be anything other than what you&#x27;re sent, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
            <li> but that should always be expected when buying a wig that isn&#x27;t pre-styled or -cut!</li>
            <li> And it arrived WAY sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> This can probably be solved by wetting the wig down or by pulling out some of these hairs to lessen the effect.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have any gel or hair spray you can always just mess around with it and just kinda put the hair where you want it with a brush.</li>
            <li> fibers are a bit softer and a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> Like a previous customer said, all you need is hairspray and patience to work with!</li>
            <li> The wig has these weird &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; which makes your wig net/cap and even hair clearly visible, so technically, the color of my wig is orange with weird brown splotches.</li>
            <li> poorly made as well and lots of loose strands that fall out.</li>
            <li> There is very little if any shedding</li>
            <li> Wig is a little too thick in the front.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure now....</li>
            <li> Only the wig I recieved was very yellow, very thin, long, and shed badly.</li>
            <li> It came in and I was very excited, since I&#x27;ve gone through five blond wigs and they&#x27;ve either been terrible quality</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that sometimes strands of hair get pushed inside and those can be quite annoying to put back out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin on the ends (the hairs by the nape of the neck)</li>
            <li> but it was way to thin and short for me to use it for anything sadly.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with it being improperly done or shipping late.  </li>
            <li> so if you wanted something thick all the way to the bottom don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> i just wish it came in black!!!</li>
            <li> The wigs look nothing like the pictures and they are very thin and the fibers are rough and broken.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t help but noticed how similar that bad wig was to another of tengs wigs</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t have that fake hair look like the instore wigs usually do.</li>
            <li> Its very hard to style.</li>
            <li> The wig is WAY to short, wrong color and barley fits my head!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, how can you mess up this bad?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your time on this wig, I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible it&#x27;s a spongebob yellow.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> he did a bit of cutting on the sides and the bangs</li>
            <li> but when I opened it, it was all frizzy and crazy</li>
            <li> The bad part is the wig did NOT look like the picture.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really disappointed with what I got.</li>
            <li> When I opened it I was sorta disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve fired whoever made this crap wig.</li>
            <li> The roots are horribly frayed, making it impossible to work with or style.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this wig before (the one pictured) and in comparison, this wig I have just received is terrible.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the worst thing.</li>

            <li> This wig is amazing, it was perfect for my dirk coaplay ( all you need is hair spray and 5 minutes ) its become my go to for any short haired blondes I definitely suggest getting ( it even came early!)</li>
            <li> Im using this for Dirk strider it takes constant styling but its nice quality</li>
            <li> The wig was beautiful and had great quality. The blonde was a big lighter than the picture but nothing that ink and rubbing alcohol can&#x27;t fix. So glad with how the wig turned out! :D</li>
            <li> poofy, but i think i can work with it, no cap on the inside so the hair can come through</li>
            <li> Very layered.  Was a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dirk Strider cosplay and i was really surprised at how easy it was to style !</li>
            <li> The item is pretty decent quality. I&#x27;m planning on using it for Link. The wig wasn&#x27;t quite as long as I had expected it to be, but that&#x27;s just me being picky I guess. I might just need to mess around with it a bit to get it to look long in the right places.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my DirkStrider cosplay :)</li>
            <li> Horrible it&#x27;s a spongebob yellow. and it&#x27;s not cut nor styled like the pic. And its so cheap. Almost looks like plastic...very dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li> Bought for cosplay. Looks real, the style is perfect, and it&#x27;s fantastic for those parties where you just want something different. Also a good excuse to not brush your real hair. LOL. But no seriously, I plan on ordering another one (same exact one) for another friend who wishes to cosplay the same character.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig. Just a bit...poofy as others mentioned. It definitely does not come styled like the photograph. However the wig itself is the same shade and has tons of volume, so with a lot of work you could probably get it to look like the photograph. Otherwise it&#x27;s kinda poofy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Personally though I used it for my Link cosplay so I didn&#x27;t bother styling it, just threw a hat over it and it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re not wearing a hat in your cosplay you&#x27;ll need some lots of gel and time to style it so it&#x27;ll look right. Overall, it looked good for my cosplay!</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect for my Dave strider cospla . Even though it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture. It was a pit brighter and poofy when you wear it but its still good quality. A little water will do and you might have to cut it to fit your styl .</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a dirk strider cosplay and the color was perfect! It was very soft too! I really recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> Alright, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been sent a product from Amazon that is nothing like the picture. First of all, this wig is a yellow, almost orangey colour. It&#x27;s also rather long, almost shoulder length. I have ordered this wig before (the one pictured) and in comparison, this wig I have just received is terrible. It&#x27;s an okay quality, at least. I will attach a photo comparing my old wig with this new one, the old one on the left and the new one on the right.</li>
            <li> The wig isn&#x27;t the same as the one pictured, so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are a bit softer and a few shades lighter. There also isn&#x27;t as much hair.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part it is as described and the only issue I have is that while it is thick in the front, the back of the wig is a little thin, meaning the cap (which is a strange netting instead of the usual wig cap) can be seen even with slight movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived within a week of it being shipped out, well before the estimated delivery time, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From many of the reviews, I think my expectations were higher for this wig, but it is definitely good for its price, and not a bad wig at all.</li>
            <li> The roots are horribly frayed, making it impossible to work with or style. So if you&#x27;re looking to have it be anything other than what you&#x27;re sent, you&#x27;re out of luck. Better to get a regular short blond wig and style that than get this.</li>
            <li> I got this for a virus cosplay, and his hair requires a wig with a lot of volume. However, taking the wig out of the bag i noticed in areas i was able to see the wefts, especially around the area where its layered, and this was before i fluffed it up, many more wefts are able to be seen when the wig is fluffed up. It came fast so I was excited to open it but I&#x27;m really disappointed with what I got. Certainly isnt as thick as the pictures depict it.</li>
            <li> Good wig a bit too much yellow though</li>
            <li> This wig has been put through some stuff and still looks great. Easy to spike in a variety of ways and looks nice</li>
            <li> Perfect and fashionable!</li>
            <li> When I opened it I was sorta disappointed. It looks nothing like the picture. Its very hard to style. I was trying it for a dirk strider cosplay and wasn&#x27;t to happy when I saw the condition it came in...probably going to return it when I get the chance...</li>
            <li> It is really soft and perfect for my Dave or Dirk cosplay I absolutely love it it&#x27;s a bit long but I can deal with that and it arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Nice thickness, not as yellow as it appears in the picture and was a bit longer. It took a lot of styling but the finished product was good enough for my Dirk cosplay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the exact same from this conpany before and got what was pictured, so I figured I&#x27;d order another one for a friend. Only the wig I recieved was very yellow, very thin, long, and shed badly. Complete chunks of hair would fall out if I gently brushed my hands through it, which was a bit necessary as the bangs were ridiculous and stiff.  Honestly, read the other reviews. This is not the first time this company has screwed up orders.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves to do cosplay. This wig is her favorite</li>
            <li> It is the same color as the picture, very easy to put on and keep on, easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;I sent my mom a picture of me in this wig right after I opened it, without styling, and she thought I had cut and dyed my hair.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic wig! It styled perfectly and has a great cut to it, though the back could be shortened a little as it reads a bit as mullet, but that was fine for my late-70&#x27;s early 80&#x27;s proto-punk inspired rococopunk outfit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig around 6 weeks ago. I had really high hopes. The wig is WAY to short, wrong color and barley fits my head!! the netting is ripped and the wig is shedding everywhere. I also bought a white wig from the same seller and i have the same complaints. The wigs look nothing like the pictures and they are very thin and the fibers are rough and broken. Ive seen some of the pictures people put in reviews and my wig looks nothing like those!!! In the pictures you can see it is really short and does not fit in the back.</li>
            <li> I used this wig for my Tamaki cosplay and it worked perfectly. It is very durable and thick. Fantastic wig and the color is just like the picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my products, and me giving a 5 star review is saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so at first it had shed a few pieces but it stopped and I haven&#x27;t had any more shedding so that&#x27;s good. But I&#x27;d rather have it shed some in the beginning than to have it shed a tiny bit at a time throughout the course of owning it. (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the length of the bangs so i just simply trimmed them and the wig looks perfect for me now. I was wanting something because I had a blonde wig that got burned and I was looking through various wigs and this one had just caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is very thick and have many layers so it&#x27;s great for styling especially if you want to cosplay various characters with crazy hair. It&#x27;s a little thin on the ends (the hairs by the nape of the neck) so if you wanted something thick all the way to the bottom don&#x27;t get it but that&#x27;s how everybody&#x27;s hair gets so there&#x27;s really no complaints because it looks so real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend and buy again. (including ordering other various wigs from this same company)</li>
            <li> I was going to use this for Dirk Strider From homestuck but it was way to thin and short for me to use it for anything sadly.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to style&lt;br /&gt;- Great color&lt;br /&gt;- Nice texture&lt;br /&gt;- Shipped in 1 and 1/2 week&lt;br /&gt;- Free wig net&lt;br /&gt;- Cute handwritten note and adorable hair band&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Top looks very messy (easy to hide if you style it)&lt;br /&gt;- Needs to be self-styled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a Dirk Strider wig, and with a bit of styling it certainly does the trick, however if you want to have it lay flat, it will reveal the messy crown. I would definitely recommend for Dirk or any other spiky haired blond though. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Tweek Tweak cosplay and was happy that it came looking like the picture color wise. It was not styled but I am working on styling it myself. You can see the lace at some points but the wig has a fair amount of thick hair, so much that I&#x27;ve had to thin it down a bit. It&#x27;s a good wig for the price but not amazing by any means</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be here on time because of the expected arrival date. But as of yesterday, I am officially the proud owner of this awesome wig! It isn&#x27;t the softest ever, but it it full and will get the job done. Not to mention the hand-written thank you letter I received and the free gifts: a scrunchie and a hair net!! I will surely buy from Cf-fashion again :)</li>
            <li> I had a couple of requests for costumes.  Ordered these wigs and wow was I surprised.  They arrived like 7 days after order.  Then the quality was really great.  I even received a signed and addressed letter from the owner, Florence.  I will def be ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> I used this for Dirk and Dave Strider as well as Bill Cipher. I probably should&#x27;ve chosen something smaller for Bill Cipher but plenty of people recognized me so it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem. It did need a bit of styling with Dirk. But worked perfectly for a older Dave if the color matches your headcanon. There are adjustment straps in the back for size and has a very comfortable shape. Some strands came out at first but I just had to brush it and it&#x27;s full and fluffy to the extent of your imagination.</li>
            <li> I tried for over two hours to get this to fit last night and it just didn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t the length that was a problem but the cap inside the wig itself. I made sure the clips were not attached and everything. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> The wig has lots of hair all around. I can style the wig without worrying about the wig cap being visible. There is very little if any shedding</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Dirk Strider cosplay, thinking that it&#x27;s style and color would suit the character perfectly. I was so wrong. Instead of the dark-ish blonde color the image shows, my wig was orange! That&#x27;s not the worst thing. The wig has these weird &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; which makes your wig net/cap and even hair clearly visible, so technically, the color of my wig is orange with weird brown splotches. I do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this wig for my friends Dirk cosplay and it was simply perfect! It was easy and simply to style just it needs the right products to make the spikes stay in place, barley needed to cut it simce my friends head shape was perfect sized for the bangs and so on. Definantly buying myself this one for my Roxas cosplay!</li>
            <li> The front was much shorter than I anticipated form the photos and ended up having to buy extensions to make up for it. A good wig overall.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected I will say that. There is a little difference between the picture of the wig and the actually wig. Over-all it was cool</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect for my Dirk Strider cosplay, and I didn&#x27;t even have to cut it at all. All you need is hairspray and patience.</li>
            <li> shorter than the picture suggests, much paler in color, not at all accurate. poorly made as well and lots of loose strands that fall out.</li>
            <li> I did have to style it myself, which is okay! I did use this for a Tweek Tweak cosplay, so with a little bit of gel it style great. I can post pictures after October, which is when I&#x27;ll use it again. I will be ordering from Cf-fashion quickly!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this came in a week early in the mail. When I went to try it on I was pleased to find that it had a hair cap to go with it to help get all of my hair out of the way. It went well with my costume and was easy to style and adjust on my head. It also didn&#x27;t have that fake hair look like the instore wigs usually do.</li>
            <li> Does not come as shown , needs a bit of styling but I&#x27;m in love with the feel of the wig. Comes with a cute hairtie, and a wig cap. Also came much earlier then expected. Wonderful experience</li>
            <li> Its missing a little fluff but its overall allright, good fitting (and I have long hair and a little bigger than average head), color is a little yellower than expected but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked it! the timing was great and it arrived in the same box with my Usa chan I ordered! The hair fibers worked great with my hair straightener to style it to look like honey senpai&#x27;s hair...not to mention the quality was nice and soft! Overall I am happy with it!</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my friend&#x27;s roxas cosplay on august 7th and it arrived on the 18th, WAY earlier than the estimated date of delivery! i haven&#x27;t been over to his place to see it myself, but he says it&#x27;s soft and not shiny, and it&#x27;s got just enough layering and lift to it to style it with only a little hairspray and some bobby pins. he did a bit of cutting on the sides and the bangs but that should always be expected when buying a wig that isn&#x27;t pre-styled or -cut! thanks so much uvu</li>
            <li> Brilliant wig! Just added it to my wig collection and it is instantly my favourite. I will definitely be ordering more for other cosplays.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this wig is perfect for dirk, Dave, and bro strider cosplayers. It is a bit long, but I prefer it that way so I can style it the way I want! It&#x27;s very easy to style and looks exactly like the picture! I&#x27;m very happy with it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the photo, but came in 17 days&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw it in the bag it was a good decent color but when I opened it, it was all frizzy and crazy, I had to style it with a strong gel then some hair started falling off, but it stopped, so now it&#x27;s good and looks totally looks cute.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with this wig.  It came already styled (though I will have to make some changes for my link cosplay) and it is great quality.  I was very excited that it came the WEEK after I ordered it, instead of having to wait a month.  I will definitely be ordering from this company again. AMAZING quality!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig before but I messed it up while trimming so I bought a new one. The first time I bought it, it was styled line in the picture and was very happy with it. I bought it recently and it&#x27;s nothing like I bought it the first time! It&#x27;s not styled at all! I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> My experience with this item was excellent.</li>
            <li> this wig is perfect for dirk strider. you may need to cut the back a little but it&#x27;s quite easy. this wig is nice and thick so it&#x27;s easy to style. got2be on this wig works perfectly along with a little hairspray. if you don&#x27;t have any gel or hair spray you can always just mess around with it and just kinda put the hair where you want it with a brush. i recomend this to any one doing a dirk cosplay or even a dave cosplay if you want to cut it. i just wish it came in black!!! i love this wig so much.</li>
            <li> I used with my cosplay of Dirk Strider and it was great</li>
            <li> Was really fast shipping. I&#x27;m so happy with this &amp;#60;3 ~ Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for Shizuo Heiwajima from Durarara or Naruto. Thick and easy to style. Would recommend</li>
            <li> My cos-playing teenager loved the wig - the quality and the care taken in sending it to us was top notch!  We will order from Cf-fashion again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item came with a personalized handwritten thank you note (written in English) and a wig cap and a hair scrunchie both gifts.  This was WAY more than the company had to do.  The wig was a great price without the personal touch; which was greatly appreciated and again is one more reason to order from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Really high quality I think. Wig is a little too thick in the front. Made it a bit difficult to style, but it looked nice once I thinned it out a little. Can&#x27;t see through the hair to the wig scalp, which was very nice. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The color matched the picture and was very easy to style. However if you want it to stay the same for a while you&#x27;ll have to apply some hair spray. If you&#x27;re wearing it to a con than you really should use hairspray. It came with a wig cap as well, which was incredibly useful. The wig itself is really high quality and looks amazing. For the price that I got it for, it&#x27;s a great deal. Some wigs can go for around $30 and leave much to be desired quality wise. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The wig was okay. I used it for my Dirk Strider Cosplay and it looked far too fluffy and it was long. The color is off putting but after styling it improved. The first picture is its original before I styled and the second is after I styled.</li>
            <li> Looks great, fits well!</li>
            <li> exactly as described and pictured</li>
            <li> Came in super early considering that it came all the way from china. Comes with a wig cap and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out. The color is kind of off from the pictures, it&#x27;s actually more of a white blonde but it looks great. Also you&#x27;d have to straighten it if you want it to look as long as it does in the picture but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Dirk Strider cosplay, and it is perfect! Like a previous customer said, all you need is hairspray and patience to work with! The top is a bit rougher than the bottom layers but it just makes it easier to spike, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this item for a link cosplay but it seems that it&#x27;s smaller than expected.  It&#x27;s short from the back and I kinda wish it was a bit longer.  But I still wear it with beanies. Color is almost the same just a bit more darker but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li> Daughter was very happy with the wig.  Will order from here again.</li>
            <li> I got this wig just today. It was suppose to come September 14th but it is August 21st, I am very happy with the shipping! The wig is more yellowish than the picture shown. Also it doesn&#x27;t come with &#x27;spikes&#x27; but they are really easy to made. The hair is easy to manipulate. Everything was great accept that the top was not in good condition. The hair almost felt like a hairball.</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice for cos</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems,  it came fast and it&#x27;s great quality!</li>
            <li> This wig shedded a little when I first got it but it&#x27;s very full, and it actually feels and is layered so well it looks like real hair. I had everyone fooled. The only complaint I have is that sometimes strands of hair get pushed inside and those can be quite annoying to put back out.</li>
            <li> This wig was absolutely horrid. It came in and I was very excited, since I&#x27;ve gone through five blond wigs and they&#x27;ve either been terrible quality or I messed up styling, and let me tell you that this wig was another to the list and it was not my fault. The hair was gross and plasticky, it felt like it was party city quality. The color is WAAAAAY off and the center of the hair where the hairline is supposed to be is to the side. Seriously, how can you mess up this bad? Don&#x27;t even waste your time on this wig, I was so disappointed. I would&#x27;ve fired whoever made this crap wig.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig! but it looks nothing like the pictures. but i will still give it a 5 star</li>
            <li> This wig is so fluffy and perfect! I have thick, thick red hair, and it covers it perfectly! I wore it to work a couple times and i got so many compliments that people thought it was real, a customer even asked who did my hair i would 100% reccommend this wig. Its a bit lighter than in the picture though, thats fine by me though</li>
            <li> Great wig! A bit smaller than it looks. Some strands of hair fall apart so you have to take extra care for the wig! And it arrived WAY sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Very nice, was a little small on my head though.</li>
            <li> I got it! :D It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for my Link cosplay costume. It styles easily, but does shed a little. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive after rereading the 1 star reviews, but took my chance with the wig color. It was the same color as in the picture. The wig is cut in layers as described. The bangs at the top, however, are a bit harder to manage and require a lot of styling. I may need to trim some of the bangs to my liking too. Either way, still a great wig. Soft, no loose threads inside. Also arrived in a week.</li>
            <li> hello amazon goers!! if youre looking for a good teasing wig but cosplaying on a budget, i highly suggest buying this wig!&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this wig on february 10th and i recieved it in the mail february 28th i believe, WELL BEFORE the estimated arrival time, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;as for the QUALITY of the wig, the top/crown of the wig is VERY full and fluffy, almost as thick as a well-made arda wig! the sides are also fairly thick, but the back could be better, theres a few thinner spots where the base of the wefts are slightly visible, but only if youre REALLY looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;the wig fibers are very very soft and realistic, little to no artificial shine. the wefts in top were very easy to style, just tease the base of the fibers in the direction you want, spray it with got2be, and pull the ends to a point and youre good!&lt;br /&gt;i purchased this wig for my roxas (kingdom hearts) cospaly, it turned out so beautifully i may order a second for ringabel (bravely default)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;photos attached as before and after example!!</li>
            <li> Epic Wig! Came in both the right colors AND style!  I had no problems with it being improperly done or shipping late.  It&#x27;s my first time buying a wig online and I don&#x27;t regret it.  I&#x27;ve noticed that one reviewer received what looked like an orangeish wig with no styling done to it and I couldn&#x27;t help but noticed how similar that bad wig was to another of tengs wigs the &amp;#34;12.5&amp;#34; Blonde Cosplay Wig -- Dino¡¤Cavallone&amp;#34;. I suspect that they were shipped the wrong wig, but I can&#x27;t be certain because the one i received was good enough for my purposes.  The only issue with my wig is that the hair clumps together on the nott of the head and makes some hairs stick straight up.  This can probably be solved by wetting the wig down or by pulling out some of these hairs to lessen the effect. You&#x27;ll need to fluff the wig up again and work with it to get the exact same style as seen in its photos, but this is expected when the wig has been flattened by being in a box for shipping.  I&#x27;ve posted pics of the wig from multiple sides i.e. front, left, right, back, and top</li>
            <li> It took a week for it to come ,  but was worth the wait .  It looks the same as the picture .  It fits great , I just absolutely love this wig .</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice, the color and length is perfect !</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to arrive mid February but it arrived today. The bad part is the wig did NOT look like the picture. It is an yellowish color and styled way different. I was goign to use it for a Dave STrider and Ben Drowned cosplay but I&#x27;m not sure now....</li>
            <li> My favorite wig! I wear it all the time!</li>
