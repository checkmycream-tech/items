            <li>Top of the lone skin care system!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>me, the best products in the package are the serum and the night cream.</li>
            <li>The eye cream isn&#x27;t the best product that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>This is the best skin care line on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>My stylist remarked on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li>Price on Amazon is great, too.</li>
            <li>my skin was looking so great.</li>
            <li>The place I purchased the product from is great too.</li>
            <li>Great line of products, have purchased the set twice.</li>
            <li>my skin looks amazing and I am 62!</li>
            <li>My skin is gorgeous and with no makeup I get tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Love Vivite!</li>
            <li>It has been about 8 weeks and still love it!</li>
            <li>By morning my skin is looking supple and amazing.  </li>
            <li>She is someone who is bluntly honest, so for her to notice my skin and comment on the texture and tone...</li>
            <li>All the products are nice.</li>
            <li>I noticed a women at my church had the most beautiful skin and asked her what she used.&lt;br /&gt;She told me about this product, and that she originally purchased it from a dermatologist but could not pay those prices so ordered it online.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this system!  </li>
            <li>It feels and looks so good that I actually enjoy using the product every morning and night ...</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing skin care line EVER.</li>
            <li>, obviously this was the best price!  </li>
            <li>I love the Vivite product line.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Vivite for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Then brought the serum at Amazon (much better price).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to pay the price for more...</li>
            <li>Love love love this prodtc, and on Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;The glycolic acid is also supposed to moisturize your skin as well, which is interesting, since you wouldn&#x27;t think that acid does that, but i think it helps prep your skin to allow for better moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt better...</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>first used I experienced a tingling sensation and then a mild breakout</li>
            <li>Also, I feel like the sizes of the products are really off, as I could probably use the scrub for a good number of years, while the serum in this package will probably be used up within 3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that by looking at my skin!!</li>
            <li>I suddenly realized that my face, without make up, is looking really good!  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results after the  first month of use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li>We loved how our skin felt after using the exfoliation cleanser (it was instantly so soft!)  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this product line which my dermatologist introduced me to.  </li>
            <li>The night cream is light and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>ordered multiple times.. great product and cheaper than my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The serum is good however to wear it under makeup - it does give you a considerable amount of shine.  </li>
            <li>Now having used it for about 6 weeks, I notice a visible difference in my skin texture, my skin tone (much more even), fine lines are reduced and the eye cream has really helped my crow&#x27;s feet.     </li>
            <li>My complexion is bright and smooth will definitely recommend I wish there was a toner and a face wash included in this deal</li>
            <li>Plus it really made a huge difference with my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Since getting pregnant I had to stop using my rx acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>However, it showed up in a nice purple box, original packaging, at half of the original price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you who are first time users of the core system, I would actually suggest that you sample and buy their travel size first, as the large amounts of glycolic acid that are in their products are not necessarily the best fit for everyone.</li>
            <li>My skin is more even tone and it helped with the adult acne I started getting.</li>
            <li>As for the other products, you really can expect to get a good 6 months out of the set.</li>
            <li>Now my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Within the first week of using it I notice that my face had lines that I had never seen before, speacially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin not only shows fewer wrinkles but looks better and feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff except the night renewal looked like a figner was stuck in it,so I went to American Laser Skincare and bought a new one for kit because this was a gift.</li>
            <li>It is the real product, package and sealed in the signature mauve &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; box.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 and paid way too much for Vivite cleanser and moisterizer from a doctor&#x27;s office.   </li>
            <li>I felt my products weren&#x27;t really doing anything anymore.</li>
            <li>for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper then at my doctors office.</li>
            <li>and this has lightened them sooo much</li>
            <li>My skin has occasional breakouts but for the most part unlined &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>the 4 pieces inside the purple box had their individual original packaging as well.</li>
            <li>My face felt great, soft and not greasy or too dry (unlike with some other cleansers).</li>
            <li>It does contain glycolic acid , so have your skin checked by a professional first.</li>
            <li>I cant live without the exfoliating scrub!  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly like the scrub.</li>
            <li>It truly has never felt better either, yes it can be drying but alternate the facial scrub</li>
            <li>It has also reduced my fine lines, softened my face more than I ever thought possible, and erased tiny dark spots that have appeared on my face as I have aged!    </li>
            <li>I am a 48-year-old African American Woman...and this product is absolutely the truth!!</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and polished looking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is old or what,</li>
            <li>After using this over priced product (recommended by a friend) for nearly two months I see no visible difference in my skin</li>
            <li>My skin is considered sensitive.</li>
            <li>The face wash is an exfoliates and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this item at my dermatologist and loved it, but hated the price (double what I paid here)!</li>
            <li>I am a 40yr old female that regularly gets IPL laser treatments and facials to even my skin tone and remove freckles.</li>
            <li>It compliments my IPL &amp; facial routine like no other.  </li>

            <li> It compliments my IPL &amp; facial routine like no other.  </li>
            <li> The product has a high level of glicolic acid that I guess it&#x27;s not good for sensitive skin because it dries it to the max, now my skin</li>
            <li> And FaceMedix offers it at HALF what I pay at my doctors office.  </li>
            <li> That is really my only complaint about the whole system.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I give this product four stars, is that the quantity of the facial serum is not equivalent to the quantity of the other products in the set.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use one to two pumps, and I only use one, and it only lasts 1/2 as long as the other products ...</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of use ( the trial size lasted that long! )</li>
            <li> The products tend to make you breakout at first, but the logic behind it is that they bring out all the dirt beneath your skin to the surface, but then hopefully you won&#x27;t be breaking out anymore afterward...</li>
            <li> It reduced the size of my pores, decreased the smile lines and dark circles under my eyes, and lightens the hyper-pigmentations I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have suffered adult acne for 20 years, and now, other than an occasion small pimple, my face has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> but I have had two skin breakouts, something I&#x27;ve not had for over 40 years and then not much.  </li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I was concerned that this kit would come in 4 different packaging/shipments or not as a gift box set.</li>
            <li> The scrub included in the set is only for a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Other than that the products helped my acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I started out slow just using the facial cleanser and night renewal cream...</li>
            <li> My order shipped and I received it in less than a week.      </li>
            <li> Now that I have found it on Amazon for less than half the price at the Dr.&#x27;s office my husband told me not to let it run out again.</li>
            <li> This kit was much less than I paid at the Spa.</li>
            <li> I was using a 10% AHA everyday along with serems, creams, tones, moisturizers, etc.  </li>
            <li> I also started getting a few small brown spots on my cheek</li>
            <li> I have wasted a lot of money on skin care lines which made similar promises, so I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product or any product that has glicolic acid for anyone that has either dry or sensitive skin. :(</li>
            <li> not sure I wanted to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> Blemishes and wrinkles are hardly noticable.  </li>
            <li> I may still try to return at this late date.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order on line because I didn&#x27;t want outdated or improperly stored product.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and was without it for awhile because it was too expensive from my Dr.  </li>
            <li> I was not initially impressed.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that there was anything wrong, but if I&#x27;m spending $100</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so dehydrated that I am searching like a crazy nut for products that helps with that problem.</li>
            <li> by the way it has gotten rid of those nasty ingrown hairs that happens with age, so no more flare ups!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Since getting pregnant I had to stop using my rx acne treatment.  My dermatologist gave me samples of this and I am amazed.  My skin is clear and beautiful.  I will use it from now on.  Very impressed with this product</li>
            <li> I have used Vivite products for some time.  Some of these have a \\&quot;hardened\\&quot; texture and my skin has been burned by both the sun blocking moisturizer and the night renewal cream.  I don&#x27;t know if it is old or what, but I reacted separately to the products.</li>
            <li> After using this over priced product (recommended by a friend) for nearly two months I see no visible difference in my skin but I have had two skin breakouts, something I&#x27;ve not had for over 40 years and then not much.  I may still try to return at this late date.</li>
            <li> I picked up a trial size of this line from a skin care clinic.  I have wasted a lot of money on skin care lines which made similar promises, so I was skeptical.  After about 3 weeks of use ( the trial size lasted that long! ) I had a hair appointment. My stylist remarked on how great my skin looked. THAT was enough to sell me! She is someone who is bluntly honest, so for her to notice my skin and comment on the texture and tone...well, it had to be working!  I shopped around in the internet and found prices from $160 to $249, obviously this was the best price!  My order shipped and I received it in less than a week.      Now having used it for about 6 weeks, I notice a visible difference in my skin texture, my skin tone (much more even), fine lines are reduced and the eye cream has really helped my crow&#x27;s feet.     I did not notice any breakouts, in fact my skin looks clearer than it has for years. I&#x27;m 48 years old and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that by looking at my skin!! I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!!</li>
            <li> I love the Vivite product line.  I think it has made a big difference in my skin, and I just can&#x27;t go to sleep at night without the night cream.  Price on Amazon is great, too.</li>
            <li> My complexion is bright and smooth will definitely recommend I wish there was a toner and a face wash included in this deal</li>
            <li> I love this stuff except the night renewal looked like a figner was stuck in it,so I went to American Laser Skincare and bought a new one for kit because this was a gift.Its the risk I took buying on here instead. Other than that the products helped my acne and oily skin. Now my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this system!  And FaceMedix offers it at HALF what I pay at my doctors office.  I tried the 4pc sample kit and got hooked.  I cant live without the exfoliating scrub!  The serum is good however to wear it under makeup - it does give you a considerable amount of shine.  That is really my only complaint about the whole system.  The eye cream is WONDERFUL.  Fully absorbs in a couple seconds so you can put on your concelar.  Plus it really made a huge difference with my fine lines.  The night cream is light and luxurious.  By morning my skin is looking supple and amazing.  I am 33 and have normal/oily skin and I think the world of the Vivete line.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item at my dermatologist and loved it, but hated the price (double what I paid here)! Within one week of using the product I started to notice a softness and brightness to my skin. Within two weeks, others started to notice. After two months of religious use, I was actually asked if I had had a facial peel my skin was looking so great. It feels and looks so good that I actually enjoy using the product every morning and night ... and I have never been one to take care of my skin    An added benefit ... I have suffered adult acne for 20 years, and now, other than an occasion small pimple, my face has never been clearer. It has also reduced my fine lines, softened my face more than I ever thought possible, and erased tiny dark spots that have appeared on my face as I have aged!    The only reason I give this product four stars, is that the quantity of the facial serum is not equivalent to the quantity of the other products in the set. The instructions say to use one to two pumps, and I only use one, and it only lasts 1/2 as long as the other products ... so plan on buying an extra bottle of the facial serum. As for the other products, you really can expect to get a good 6 months out of the set.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! I bought the starter kit. Within the first week of using it I notice that my face had lines that I had never seen before, speacially around the eyes. I immediatly stop using it. My skin is considered sensitive. The product has a high level of glicolic acid that I guess it&#x27;s not good for sensitive skin because it dries it to the max, now my skin it&#x27;s so dehydrated that I am searching like a crazy nut for products that helps with that problem. I do not recommend this product or any product that has glicolic acid for anyone that has either dry or sensitive skin. :(</li>
            <li> It takes about 3 weeks of using this product to see the results.  My skin not only shows fewer wrinkles but looks better and feels softer and smoother. I ran out and was without it for awhile because it was too expensive from my Dr.  Now that I have found it on Amazon for less than half the price at the Dr.&#x27;s office my husband told me not to let it run out again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line after it was recommended by a Doctor at a Medical Spa. It does contain glycolic acid , so have your skin checked by a professional first. I am thrilled with the results after the  first month of use. This kit was much less than I paid at the Spa. It is the real product, package and sealed in the signature mauve &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; box. I will continue to order my Vivite from Amazon. Very pleased with the product and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite line. Made by Botox brand. It really works. All the products are nice. Buy on Amazon because if you go through your doc, it is way more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vivite for years and love it. I don&#x27;t see me changing product lines anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Top of the lone skin care system!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and paid way too much for Vivite cleanser and moisterizer from a doctor&#x27;s office.   Then brought the serum at Amazon (much better price).  I was not initially impressed.  That was a couple months ago and I am running out.  So I looked in the mirror not sure I wanted to spend the money.  I suddenly realized that my face, without make up, is looking really good!  I can&#x27;t believe the difference...can&#x27;t even believe I didn&#x27;t notice the change.  My skin is so clear and polished looking.  Blemishes and wrinkles are hardly noticable.  This is a very good product.  I&#x27;m going to pay the price for more...what choice do I have...</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times.. great product and cheaper than my dermatologist. I now have my daughter hooked.</li>
            <li> I am a 40yr old female that regularly gets IPL laser treatments and facials to even my skin tone and remove freckles. My skin has occasional breakouts but for the most part unlined &amp; clear. I had been using Paula&#x27;s Choice products for years, but when I turned 40yr I felt my products weren&#x27;t really doing anything anymore. I was using a 10% AHA everyday along with serems, creams, tones, moisturizers, etc.  It wasn&#x27;t that there was anything wrong, but if I&#x27;m spending $100+ I want to SEE that it&#x27;s doing something. So I just recently went in for my 4wk facial and my gal convinced me to try Vivite.  I only bought the night cream because the kit at the derm&#x27;s office was $250!  After three days of using it day &amp; night (her recommendation for week one) I&#x27;m hooked. This is the most amazing skin care line EVER. It compliments my IPL &amp; facial routine like no other.  I cleanse with a sonicare twice a day with the gritty cleanser &amp; it&#x27;s awesome.  My skin is gorgeous and with no makeup I get tons of compliments.  Love love love this prodtc, and on Amazon it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vivite System for about one year now. It&#x27;s the only product I have tried that does not make my skin breakout. Pimples are disolved with the morning lotion and night cream. The place I purchased the product from is great too.</li>
            <li> Some of the dangers of buying products on Amazon is that they aren&#x27;t actually legitimate products. My brother works at Allergan, the company that owns and produced Vivite, so I can vouch for this product&#x27;s trustworthiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a the suede purple box that is signature of Vivite products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are first time users of the core system, I would actually suggest that you sample and buy their travel size first, as the large amounts of glycolic acid that are in their products are not necessarily the best fit for everyone. The products tend to make you breakout at first, but the logic behind it is that they bring out all the dirt beneath your skin to the surface, but then hopefully you won&#x27;t be breaking out anymore afterward...basically to declog your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glycolic acid is also supposed to moisturize your skin as well, which is interesting, since you wouldn&#x27;t think that acid does that, but i think it helps prep your skin to allow for better moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best products in the package are the serum and the night cream. The eye cream isn&#x27;t the best product that I&#x27;ve used and I don&#x27;t particularly like the scrub. Also, I feel like the sizes of the products are really off, as I could probably use the scrub for a good number of years, while the serum in this package will probably be used up within 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you&#x27;re a fan of the core system, go for it!</li>
            <li> Great line of products, have purchased the set twice.</li>
            <li> I am a 48-year-old African American Woman...and this product is absolutely the truth!! It reduced the size of my pores, decreased the smile lines and dark circles under my eyes, and lightens the hyper-pigmentations I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;When first used I experienced a tingling sensation and then a mild breakout but this was just a reaction to the product working to repair my skin.  The price on Amazon is 1/2 of what you would spend in a dermatologist office.  Beware...some sellers do not include the velvet purple box which encloses the product.  This seller DID provide that.  I will be purchasing this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better... Love Vivite!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this product line which my dermatologist introduced me to.  I was hesitant to order on line because I didn&#x27;t want outdated or improperly stored product.  The product was the same as what my doctor had- for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I must admit I am a product junkie! I noticed a women at my church had the most beautiful skin and asked her what she used.&lt;br /&gt;She told me about this product, and that she originally purchased it from a dermatologist but could not pay those prices so ordered it online. I started out slow just using the facial cleanser and night renewal cream...within two days I ordered the therapy and serum...my skin looks amazing and I am 62! It truly has never felt better either, yes it can be drying but alternate the facial scrub so you are not using it daily..now I am going to order the rest of the products and could not be happier...by the way it has gotten rid of those nasty ingrown hairs that happens with age, so no more flare ups!</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I was concerned that this kit would come in 4 different packaging/shipments or not as a gift box set. However, it showed up in a nice purple box, original packaging, at half of the original price! the 4 pieces inside the purple box had their individual original packaging as well. I bought this because I had used the travel size kit when I was traveling with my friend during vacation. My friend&#x27;s roommate works at Allergan and it was recommended to her. We loved how our skin felt after using the exfoliation cleanser (it was instantly so soft!)  and then the night cream. My face felt great, soft and not greasy or too dry (unlike with some other cleansers). Hightly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care line on the market. Trust me I have tried them all. I am African American and it does wonders for my skin. You also have to buy the daily facial cleanser though. The scrub included in the set is only for a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended after I received a facial at a local spa.  I used the samples given and saw a noticeable improvement.  My face seemed brighter and I received compliments on how my face had a glow to it.  I found it cheaper here on Amazon and use the system daily with improved results continously.  It has been about 8 weeks and still love it!</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper then at my doctors office. My skin is more even tone and it helped with the adult acne I started getting. I also started getting a few small brown spots on my cheek and this has lightened them sooo much I feel I only need to wear powder makeup now. It does not come with a moisturizer so I ordered one. The face wash is an exfoliates and it makes my skin so soft. There is no sun protection in this pack but the moisturizer has it in.</li>
