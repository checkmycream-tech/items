            <li>and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My nails haven&#x27;t looked this good in years!</li>
            <li>Just got sucked into the marketing hype and wanted to believe all the good &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned!</li>
            <li>But I am happy to be rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li>Great it got rid of fugus immediately.</li>
            <li>This one worked great for me</li>
            <li>It has all worked, I am very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li>I ordered one bottle and had remarkable results.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>it,s a good product .</li>
            <li>If the product was as good as the manufacturer claims, then it would have 4 or 5 stars here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the good reviews i&#x27;ve seen on youtube and online.</li>
            <li>Based on the price they wanted thought it might be good.</li>
            <li>Good luck, I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d done my research because I found a bunch of sites that proclaimed that Zetaclear was the best nail fungus remedy available.</li>
            <li>Having said that, for a homeopathic product, it&#x27;s darn good.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was great, surely 5 star.</li>
            <li>It explained a lot of reasons why it is the best seller right now, and yet it says that over 45% of those who used it see almost no improvement.</li>
            <li>my nail right up awesome !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, NEVER put \\&quot;oils\\&quot; of any kind on the type of fungus being advertised here.</li>
            <li>; your discolored toe nails will remain even after the fungus is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Vicks VapoRub; it&#x27;s as effective as any of the scam fungal medicines you will ever see.</li>
            <li>I end up having to cut the nails closely to keep from catching the nail and tearing it off.</li>
            <li>I googled it and the Mayo Clinic says it&#x27;s being replaced by more effective medicines.  </li>
            <li>the reviews i read were put up by zeta clear and touted the product as the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I have a severe case of fungus, but it didn&#x27;t even make it look slightly better.</li>
            <li>I bought two more bottles for my mom and brother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please DO NOT BUY to support unethical people to make more money on something that does not work.</li>
            <li>He told me that some people are more resistant than others  to the fungi that causes athletes foot and nail infections.</li>
            <li>For anyone with health insurance, the cost of three months supply of ZetaClear is greater than the cost of the prescriptions and the trip to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with nail fungus for many years.</li>
            <li>All of the reviews on these sites are anonymous for the most part.</li>
            <li>more time when I have used it</li>
            <li>and this was a problem that was persistent for 10 years,without relief!!!I talked about the product at a family reunion and now 3 more folks have now found relief of all symptoms...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product for one more month and probably keep some on hand in case the fungus returns.</li>
            <li>but they make you pay for return shipping and on top of all that they dont refund the tax or &amp;#34;Insurance&amp;#34; cost,</li>
            <li>to give a better evaluation wii take more time.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, the nail is beginning to look much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read through most of the reviews for this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So considering this, most of the 5 star reviews should not be taken into account.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me a shellac and pills to take but it didn&#x27;t seem to get any better.</li>
            <li>, my sister in-law was always talking about the many things she&#x27;s cured with Absorbine.</li>
            <li>Nails for the most part are water proof.</li>
            <li>would suggest that if you plan to try it, do make sure you get the spray and the paint together.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox</li>
            <li>but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...</li>
            <li>JUST SEE THE DOCTOR FIRST BEFORE TRYING ZETACLEAR!!!</li>
            <li>Fungus grows best in dark , warm and damp places.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>After many summer months of hiding my(big toe)nail fungus with nail polish, I decided to go polish free and see if this product works.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, ZetaClear is a Healthbuy.com product.  </li>
            <li>a rep; talked and declined his credit card offer, i discussed with him my trials of many products and if this were true cure i would order more.</li>
            <li>are others that are cheaper and more effective but will not mention them here because this review is purely to expose the scam that ZetaClear is.</li>
            <li>Results have not made themselves evident, by the way, so don&#x27;t count on wearing your cute shoes in 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and no foul oder.  </li>
            <li>I used this product and it got rid of my toenail fungus quite easily.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and much more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a fungal infection in my great toe for 30 yrs-and have taken the Lamisil regimen twice, as well as multiple anti fungal creams</li>
            <li>Try this cheap solution before you go blowing it on this stuff.  </li>
            <li>There was a spectacular difference in thickness between the healthy growing nail bed and the affected upper parts.&lt;br /&gt;Today my nails are healthy again.</li>
            <li>One star really is being too nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using Absorbine Horse Liniment, available at feed stores and online.  </li>
            <li>The 16 day free trial promised noticable results in that time.</li>
            <li>The most powerful medicine in the world was made by God, not drug companies.</li>
            <li>So far good..</li>
            <li>Waited more than 21 days to receive it, but they were nice enough to resend another order free of charge.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>careful because then you can get infections easily!!!</li>
            <li>Someone changed it to make it look like zeta clear was the 2nd best seller instead of a scam!</li>
            <li>On the bright side, a bottle says it has 30 doses, but unless you&#x27;re pouring it on it will go a lot further.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 1 week into it (that&#x27;s 21 doses, folks) and the bottle is still full.  </li>
            <li>In all fairness I have not finished the treatment yet and will do the full time as suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used Zeta Clear, because I don&#x27;t think it can be as effective as Absorbine,  judging by the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Hi, so it is true.</li>
            <li>I continued for several more weeks just to be sure it did not return...</li>
            <li>- I have found many on Amazon and read many of them and have to advise that I have had a COMPLETELY different experience with this</li>
            <li>After taking the pills for about 6 months 2 of my 10 nails cleared up and looked normal and healthy.</li>
            <li>There is no phone number to reach them only by email how appropriate!</li>
            <li>It was pretty severe; so I ordered another bottle and voila!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an honest answer because I haven&#x27;t used it constantly.</li>
            <li>So the only thing in here that is actually effective is the acid.  </li>
            <li>Refused to take antibiotics for months on end with no guarantee of success anyway.</li>
            <li>so I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I have to give Zeta Clear some credit for creative marketing.  </li>
            <li>have had severe toe nail fungus for 13years now on eight of my toes and have tried MANY prescription as well as natural remedies to combat &amp; cure it -</li>
            <li>Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone.</li>
            <li>I take natural remedies that are way more powerful (and that includes antibiotics) than any drug.  </li>
            <li>Having used other medications, this one worked the best in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this product that I highly recommend it!    </li>
            <li>the negatives right.</li>
            <li>phone rang right after the order placed.</li>
            <li>That is right there suspicious.</li>
            <li>The only product we have found to be time tested and consistently proven effective is \\&quot;Undecylenic Acid,\\</li>
            <li>I did some research and found the main ingredient was &amp;#34;vinegar&amp;#34; used what I had available in the kitchen and steeped my finger nail for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Also it is important to make sure your feet are dry and aerated.</li>
            <li>As the saying goes, if it&#x27;s too good to be true...it&#x27;s probably not true.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m encouraged that in a few weeks while in FL, I&#x27;ll be able to wear sandals with no fear of the \\&quot;FUN GUY\\&quot; showing!!  </li>
            <li>:) It is obvious that it is a scam.</li>
            <li>Had tried many different products and none did much of anything!</li>
            <li>I would love to try the laser treatment in hopes that something would actually work.</li>
            <li>I tried it consistently for a month with no change whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The first day I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>It is working great and my problem is slowly fading.    </li>
            <li>Has done more in a short time than anything else</li>
            <li>If there was, there would not be so-o-o many topical cures on the market.  </li>
            <li>and, when I asked the company to honor their guarantee, I was first told that my husband must not have followed their instructions.</li>
            <li>When I insisted he did, the customer disservice rep told me that if their product didn&#x27;t clear the fungus my hubby must have some bizarre skin condition and he should go see a skin specialist.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 6 months exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>I think any of the products out there containing 10% or higher undecylenic acid will work.</li>
            <li>I know exactly what is in the spray</li>
            <li>try lamisil oral it works on me but is not easy to get it with out prescription ,is a long treatment(from 1 month to 3 months to get ride of fungus )but its the best that i know</li>
            <li>The damaged part of the nail has almost completely grown out and the new nail is absolutely clear and healthy!</li>
            <li>While the oils smell nice and keep the nails moisturized, I would caution others to try other cheaper remedies before using this.  </li>
            <li>I actually originally purchased it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I was sold on the positive reviews on a web site I looked at.</li>
            <li>I purchased the pack that contains the paint and the spray and started seeing positive results within a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much !</li>
            <li>Although I love Zetaclear brushed applicator for my toenail fungus, I am hesitant in trying this particular product because I took it to my M.D.</li>
            <li>Being an oil based product, it may help your nail lose some discoloring caused by the fungus, but this is a purely a COSMETIC change.</li>
            <li>The infection is clearing up and the new nail bed is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I think the reason everything on-line is positive towards zetaclear is because they have a good computer wiz who is searching for negative reviews and changing them.</li>
            <li>Of course, when I actually received the product and go through the fine print, I realise how dodgy it is.</li>
            <li>It actually \\&quot;fed the fungus,\\&quot; which quickly returned with a vengeance!</li>
            <li>I can not find enough positive results to spend that kind of money only to find out</li>
            <li>A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS - especially in light of so many negative reviews.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I bought zetaclear and followed their directions, but it did absolutely nothing to my feet.</li>
            <li>There are both oral and topical treatments that will kill the fungi and they are available  by prescription.  </li>
            <li>Well it turns out to be a woman who \\&quot;just wants to verify\\&quot; my order, my name, my address, and what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t want to try anymore</li>
            <li>If not worse sine</li>
            <li>the problem really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very deceiving ad practice, I have no intention of spraying this product under my tongue</li>
            <li>My doctor was reluctant to treat it because of the potential side effects of the available drugs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any sores at all so this could be unrelated but seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>There is a simple cheap solution in your kitchen which cures your fungus within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I think this is a real scam.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all who posted the reviews here about this scam.  </li>
            <li>I supposed this is my fault for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
            <li>ordered a free trial, s&amp;h only.</li>
            <li>I saw this product and really didnt expect anything but hope.</li>
            <li>While I became concerned that it was a symptom of something worse; I googled for products/solutions for the symptoms I experienced.</li>
            <li>Without doing that important step no topical treatment will work.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for about a month now, and don&#x27;t really notice much change in my fungus condition.</li>
            <li>Going to stay with it a bit longer and see if it really works.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>had any real impact on my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Many of the web sites you will find that speak about ZetaClear such as publichealthforums.com, healthynailsworld.com and others like them seem to be directly associated with the product manufacturer.</li>
            <li>There are many different types of toe fungus out there and Zeta Clear does not treat and cure all of them.</li>
            <li>I have been using Zeta Clear for about two months, and I although they state 4-6 months to be fully fungus free, I am astonished at the results thus far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God provides in the leaves, the bark, and so many other places, all we need to heal and cure.  </li>
            <li>We tried this product for private research purposes from requests due to this company&#x27;s exceptional media blitz campaign.</li>
            <li>ha ha if that were only possible, then the movie stars would be doing it, and a whole lot more.  </li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by a so called doctor or doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Although I am still in shock, I highly recommend it for anyone at their wits end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too early to tell.</li>
            <li>But so far, it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus.</li>
            <li>In the process, the thickness has also diminished to almost normal.  </li>
            <li>after I received the product I found out that it only helps with the symptoms and dose not clear any fungal bacteria make sure it what you want</li>
            <li>Do yourself a big favor by using the right product.</li>
            <li>But after she slowly mulls though my order she blurts out a 30-second sales gimmick about becoming a free trial member to something, disguising it as further confirmation, and then says,</li>
            <li>ThereforeI&#x27;ll probably have to live with this the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>And practice and live with the word \\&quot;HYGEINE\\&quot; for the rest of your life</li>
            <li>It helps to physically remove as much of the nail surface as you can by gently filing the surface of the nail and getting to the fungus inside.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the results!</li>
            <li>Been using this product about 5 months and all nails (all 10 were infected) are now growing in clear and normal....  </li>
            <li>Just be aware of this possible side effect.    </li>
            <li>SO FAR, IT HAS NOT WORKED!</li>
            <li>I bought Zeta clear to use on my big toenail, which had a pretty severe case of fungus.</li>
            <li>I am super careful at swimming pools.</li>
            <li>I have seen absolutely no improvement in my rather mild case of nail fungus.  </li>
            <li>You will note that the positive reviewers tend to only have one product - ZetaClear - as a part of their review portfolio.    </li>
            <li>and you only find positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Imagine the number of sources that review, so if you are only finding positive, gee, I guess it&#x27;s because the stuff</li>
            <li>If you do the same, you&#x27;ll notice that a large quantity of 5 star reviews are from customers who have not used the product long enough to provide an accurate assessment of the product&#x27;s function.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is the wave of the future for the internet, until one day, the internet is so crammed full of information, we&#x27;ll all be back to the beginning, where you might as well ask your neighbor for advice.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely helping, but I am applying it twice a day, not 3 times as recommended, and you can only see the progress as quickly as the nail grows.</li>
            <li>Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Zeta Clear is a scam.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from the Zeta Clear site on a weekend.  </li>
            <li>Zeta Clear made it go away.</li>
            <li>I have just begun using Zeta Clear because of my brother&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Zeta Clear now for a year</li>
            <li>The picture shows oral spray and clear nail solution.</li>
            <li>so I tried Zeta Clear and bingo---</li>
            <li>all clear in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought Zeta Clear</li>
            <li>If you have nail infections or fungus try Zeta Clear before getting a prescription.</li>
            <li>Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clear</li>
            <li>The fungus needs to grow out completely so you can&#x27;t stop using this until the nail has grown out.</li>
            <li>People need to know that they must continue to use it until ALL symptoms are gone and the nail has grown out completely ...</li>
            <li>I bought 3 packs of Zeta Clear for a considerable sum (£50) for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product maybe a week ago and have been using it consistently as directly.</li>
            <li>I have gotten in the habit of never wearing flip flops or being barefoot in public but this product really delivered for me.</li>
            <li>To early to tell how well it works.  </li>
            <li>So far as what you use to treat it</li>
            <li>bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;</li>
            <li>I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...</li>
            <li>Like one of your reviewers I am hesitate about homeopathic BUT NOT ORGANIC AND NATURAL cures.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>good, expensive...</li>
            <li>Its almost cleared up except my two big toes on my left and right foot.</li>
            <li>Due to this technique of clogging the internet with their advertising, I will have nothing to do with this company that is most likely selling you a vastly overpriced product.  </li>
            <li>First off - it does not work, second of all the company offers a money back guarantee</li>
            <li>The paint is straight forward with its list of ingredients - the tea tree and urea are the primary active ingredients to combat the fungus, the oils help to spread the active ingredients evenly &amp; also suffocate the fungus (it needs air &amp; a moist environment to spread) and the oil prevents this - the Vit E / grapeseed extract help to prevent the formulation going rancid.  </li>
            <li>If  high prices and extensive advertising were an indication of a products efficacy, then ZetaClear would work.</li>
            <li>However, I highly recommend the brushed applicator.</li>
            <li>It will be a long process as toe nails take so long to grow, but this is the first positive results I have ever had in finally being rid of this persistent fungus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks my nail had turned a much darker color, and I acually lost most of my nail which must have been dead already.</li>
            <li>By the 9th day the layers of brittleness have subsided &amp; the nails have started to regress back to their normal state of lying on the skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>What finally helped me get rid of it was when my DPM treated the fungus with a new laser treatment.</li>
            <li>So I am absolutely amazed after just a few months of consistent use, my toenail is actually growing back normally.  </li>
            <li>He used Zeta Clear religiously three times a day, and the fungus completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>After making my own essential oil blend and that didn&#x27;t work, I was pretty desperate and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>The other nails never improved anymore after the first couple applications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this product works for other people,  but it doesn&#x27;t work at all for him, so he&#x27;ll be off to the GP to get some real treatment!</li>
            <li>Homeopathic IS governed, and therefore generally weaker so that people feel that they must go to drugs.  </li>
            <li>And as an aside, Zeta Clear obviously used the cheapest brush applicator they could find.  </li>
            <li>this request for an evaluation comes far to soon  relative to the condition it clai,s to treat..</li>
            <li>However, I will be surprised if what they sent will last the month as they say.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 6 month supply because I figured if it worked it would take some time as any \\&quot;nail treatment\\&quot; takes and in the long run it was much cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;First off I filled down my nails as suggested but other reviewers and suggestions I&#x27;ve found on the net.</li>
            <li>They are clever to list it in their product ingredients, but there was no need to even analyze such percentages as the combination has already destroyed THE ONLY actual working ingredient - \\&quot;Undecylenic</li>
            <li>Following early enough detection and confirmation of this change, immediate corrective measures were implemented.</li>
            <li>yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few days after stopping usage, the oils will dissipate, with showering and such, and your nail will look EXACTLY as it was when you started, except that you gave your money to crooks.</li>
            <li>I am not sponsored to endorse this product by any means but various negative reviews have made assertions without having a true understanding of what the various ingredients in the formulations do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have completely blitzed the internet with multiple versions of their own advertising, so it makes it very difficult to search for any unbiased information.  </li>
            <li>I have a toenail fungus that wants to make my nails separate from the bed at the corners crossing a third to half the nail.</li>
            <li>Based on this the true average review score for this product should be less than two stars.  </li>
            <li>After a few years of batteling onychomycosis I am now super careful as to not reinfect myself.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> (Its VERY IMPORTANT)!!!!</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My nails haven&#x27;t looked this good in years!</li>
            <li> Just got sucked into the marketing hype and wanted to believe all the good &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned!</li>
            <li> But I am happy to be rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li> Great it got rid of fugus immediately.</li>
            <li> This one worked great for me</li>
            <li> It has all worked, I am very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bottle and had remarkable results.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> it,s a good product .</li>
            <li> If the product was as good as the manufacturer claims, then it would have 4 or 5 stars here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good reviews i&#x27;ve seen on youtube and online.</li>
            <li> Based on the price they wanted thought it might be good.</li>
            <li> Good luck, I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d done my research because I found a bunch of sites that proclaimed that Zetaclear was the best nail fungus remedy available.</li>
            <li> Having said that, for a homeopathic product, it&#x27;s darn good.  </li>
            <li> The customer service was great, surely 5 star.</li>
            <li> It explained a lot of reasons why it is the best seller right now, and yet it says that over 45% of those who used it see almost no improvement.</li>
            <li> my nail right up awesome !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, NEVER put \\&quot;oils\\&quot; of any kind on the type of fungus being advertised here.</li>
            <li> ; your discolored toe nails will remain even after the fungus is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Vicks VapoRub; it&#x27;s as effective as any of the scam fungal medicines you will ever see.</li>
            <li> I end up having to cut the nails closely to keep from catching the nail and tearing it off.</li>
            <li> I googled it and the Mayo Clinic says it&#x27;s being replaced by more effective medicines.  </li>
            <li> the reviews i read were put up by zeta clear and touted the product as the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I have a severe case of fungus, but it didn&#x27;t even make it look slightly better.</li>
            <li> I bought two more bottles for my mom and brother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please DO NOT BUY to support unethical people to make more money on something that does not work.</li>
            <li> He told me that some people are more resistant than others  to the fungi that causes athletes foot and nail infections.</li>
            <li> For anyone with health insurance, the cost of three months supply of ZetaClear is greater than the cost of the prescriptions and the trip to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with nail fungus for many years.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews on these sites are anonymous for the most part.</li>
            <li> more time when I have used it</li>
            <li> and this was a problem that was persistent for 10 years,without relief!!!I talked about the product at a family reunion and now 3 more folks have now found relief of all symptoms...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product for one more month and probably keep some on hand in case the fungus returns.</li>
            <li> but they make you pay for return shipping and on top of all that they dont refund the tax or &amp;#34;Insurance&amp;#34; cost,</li>
            <li> to give a better evaluation wii take more time.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the nail is beginning to look much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read through most of the reviews for this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So considering this, most of the 5 star reviews should not be taken into account.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a shellac and pills to take but it didn&#x27;t seem to get any better.</li>
            <li> , my sister in-law was always talking about the many things she&#x27;s cured with Absorbine.</li>
            <li> Nails for the most part are water proof.</li>
            <li> would suggest that if you plan to try it, do make sure you get the spray and the paint together.  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox</li>
            <li> but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...</li>
            <li> JUST SEE THE DOCTOR FIRST BEFORE TRYING ZETACLEAR!!!</li>
            <li> Fungus grows best in dark , warm and damp places.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> After many summer months of hiding my(big toe)nail fungus with nail polish, I decided to go polish free and see if this product works.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, ZetaClear is a Healthbuy.com product.  </li>
            <li> a rep; talked and declined his credit card offer, i discussed with him my trials of many products and if this were true cure i would order more.</li>
            <li> are others that are cheaper and more effective but will not mention them here because this review is purely to expose the scam that ZetaClear is.</li>
            <li> Results have not made themselves evident, by the way, so don&#x27;t count on wearing your cute shoes in 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no foul oder.  </li>
            <li> I used this product and it got rid of my toenail fungus quite easily.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and much more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a fungal infection in my great toe for 30 yrs-and have taken the Lamisil regimen twice, as well as multiple anti fungal creams</li>
            <li> Try this cheap solution before you go blowing it on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> There was a spectacular difference in thickness between the healthy growing nail bed and the affected upper parts.&lt;br /&gt;Today my nails are healthy again.</li>
            <li> One star really is being too nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using Absorbine Horse Liniment, available at feed stores and online.  </li>
            <li> The 16 day free trial promised noticable results in that time.</li>
            <li> The most powerful medicine in the world was made by God, not drug companies.</li>
            <li> So far good..</li>
            <li> Waited more than 21 days to receive it, but they were nice enough to resend another order free of charge.</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> careful because then you can get infections easily!!!</li>
            <li> Someone changed it to make it look like zeta clear was the 2nd best seller instead of a scam!</li>
            <li> On the bright side, a bottle says it has 30 doses, but unless you&#x27;re pouring it on it will go a lot further.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 1 week into it (that&#x27;s 21 doses, folks) and the bottle is still full.  </li>
            <li> In all fairness I have not finished the treatment yet and will do the full time as suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used Zeta Clear, because I don&#x27;t think it can be as effective as Absorbine,  judging by the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Hi, so it is true.</li>
            <li> I continued for several more weeks just to be sure it did not return...</li>
            <li> - I have found many on Amazon and read many of them and have to advise that I have had a COMPLETELY different experience with this</li>
            <li> After taking the pills for about 6 months 2 of my 10 nails cleared up and looked normal and healthy.</li>
            <li> There is no phone number to reach them only by email how appropriate!</li>
            <li> It was pretty severe; so I ordered another bottle and voila!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an honest answer because I haven&#x27;t used it constantly.</li>
            <li> So the only thing in here that is actually effective is the acid.  </li>
            <li> Refused to take antibiotics for months on end with no guarantee of success anyway.</li>
            <li> so I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I have to give Zeta Clear some credit for creative marketing.  </li>
            <li> have had severe toe nail fungus for 13years now on eight of my toes and have tried MANY prescription as well as natural remedies to combat &amp; cure it -</li>
            <li> Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone.</li>
            <li> I take natural remedies that are way more powerful (and that includes antibiotics) than any drug.  </li>
            <li> Having used other medications, this one worked the best in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this product that I highly recommend it!    </li>
            <li> the negatives right.</li>
            <li> phone rang right after the order placed.</li>
            <li> That is right there suspicious.</li>
            <li> The only product we have found to be time tested and consistently proven effective is \\&quot;Undecylenic Acid,\\</li>
            <li> I did some research and found the main ingredient was &amp;#34;vinegar&amp;#34; used what I had available in the kitchen and steeped my finger nail for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Also it is important to make sure your feet are dry and aerated.</li>
            <li> As the saying goes, if it&#x27;s too good to be true...it&#x27;s probably not true.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m encouraged that in a few weeks while in FL, I&#x27;ll be able to wear sandals with no fear of the \\&quot;FUN GUY\\&quot; showing!!  </li>
            <li> :) It is obvious that it is a scam.</li>
            <li> Had tried many different products and none did much of anything!</li>
            <li> I would love to try the laser treatment in hopes that something would actually work.</li>
            <li> I tried it consistently for a month with no change whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The first day I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> It is working great and my problem is slowly fading.    </li>
            <li> Has done more in a short time than anything else</li>
            <li> If there was, there would not be so-o-o many topical cures on the market.  </li>
            <li> and, when I asked the company to honor their guarantee, I was first told that my husband must not have followed their instructions.</li>
            <li> When I insisted he did, the customer disservice rep told me that if their product didn&#x27;t clear the fungus my hubby must have some bizarre skin condition and he should go see a skin specialist.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 months exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> I think any of the products out there containing 10% or higher undecylenic acid will work.</li>
            <li> I know exactly what is in the spray</li>
            <li> try lamisil oral it works on me but is not easy to get it with out prescription ,is a long treatment(from 1 month to 3 months to get ride of fungus )but its the best that i know</li>
            <li> The damaged part of the nail has almost completely grown out and the new nail is absolutely clear and healthy!</li>
            <li> While the oils smell nice and keep the nails moisturized, I would caution others to try other cheaper remedies before using this.  </li>
            <li> I actually originally purchased it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I was sold on the positive reviews on a web site I looked at.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pack that contains the paint and the spray and started seeing positive results within a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much !</li>
            <li> Although I love Zetaclear brushed applicator for my toenail fungus, I am hesitant in trying this particular product because I took it to my M.D.</li>
            <li> Being an oil based product, it may help your nail lose some discoloring caused by the fungus, but this is a purely a COSMETIC change.</li>
            <li> The infection is clearing up and the new nail bed is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think the reason everything on-line is positive towards zetaclear is because they have a good computer wiz who is searching for negative reviews and changing them.</li>
            <li> Of course, when I actually received the product and go through the fine print, I realise how dodgy it is.</li>
            <li> It actually \\&quot;fed the fungus,\\&quot; which quickly returned with a vengeance!</li>
            <li> I can not find enough positive results to spend that kind of money only to find out</li>
            <li> A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS - especially in light of so many negative reviews.    </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought zetaclear and followed their directions, but it did absolutely nothing to my feet.</li>
            <li> There are both oral and topical treatments that will kill the fungi and they are available  by prescription.  </li>
            <li> Well it turns out to be a woman who \\&quot;just wants to verify\\&quot; my order, my name, my address, and what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t want to try anymore</li>
            <li> If not worse sine</li>
            <li> the problem really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very deceiving ad practice, I have no intention of spraying this product under my tongue</li>
            <li> My doctor was reluctant to treat it because of the potential side effects of the available drugs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any sores at all so this could be unrelated but seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> There is a simple cheap solution in your kitchen which cures your fungus within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I think this is a real scam.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all who posted the reviews here about this scam.  </li>
            <li> I supposed this is my fault for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
            <li> ordered a free trial, s&amp;h only.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and really didnt expect anything but hope.</li>
            <li> While I became concerned that it was a symptom of something worse; I googled for products/solutions for the symptoms I experienced.</li>
            <li> Without doing that important step no topical treatment will work.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a month now, and don&#x27;t really notice much change in my fungus condition.</li>
            <li> Going to stay with it a bit longer and see if it really works.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> had any real impact on my nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Many of the web sites you will find that speak about ZetaClear such as publichealthforums.com, healthynailsworld.com and others like them seem to be directly associated with the product manufacturer.</li>
            <li> There are many different types of toe fungus out there and Zeta Clear does not treat and cure all of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using Zeta Clear for about two months, and I although they state 4-6 months to be fully fungus free, I am astonished at the results thus far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God provides in the leaves, the bark, and so many other places, all we need to heal and cure.  </li>
            <li> We tried this product for private research purposes from requests due to this company&#x27;s exceptional media blitz campaign.</li>
            <li> ha ha if that were only possible, then the movie stars would be doing it, and a whole lot more.  </li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by a so called doctor or doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Although I am still in shock, I highly recommend it for anyone at their wits end.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too early to tell.</li>
            <li> But so far, it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus.</li>
            <li> In the process, the thickness has also diminished to almost normal.  </li>
            <li> after I received the product I found out that it only helps with the symptoms and dose not clear any fungal bacteria make sure it what you want</li>
            <li> Do yourself a big favor by using the right product.</li>
            <li> But after she slowly mulls though my order she blurts out a 30-second sales gimmick about becoming a free trial member to something, disguising it as further confirmation, and then says,</li>
            <li> ThereforeI&#x27;ll probably have to live with this the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> And practice and live with the word \\&quot;HYGEINE\\&quot; for the rest of your life</li>
            <li> It helps to physically remove as much of the nail surface as you can by gently filing the surface of the nail and getting to the fungus inside.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the results!</li>
            <li> Been using this product about 5 months and all nails (all 10 were infected) are now growing in clear and normal....  </li>
            <li> Just be aware of this possible side effect.    </li>
            <li> SO FAR, IT HAS NOT WORKED!</li>
            <li> I bought Zeta clear to use on my big toenail, which had a pretty severe case of fungus.</li>
            <li> I am super careful at swimming pools.</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no improvement in my rather mild case of nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> You will note that the positive reviewers tend to only have one product - ZetaClear - as a part of their review portfolio.    </li>
            <li> and you only find positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Imagine the number of sources that review, so if you are only finding positive, gee, I guess it&#x27;s because the stuff</li>
            <li> If you do the same, you&#x27;ll notice that a large quantity of 5 star reviews are from customers who have not used the product long enough to provide an accurate assessment of the product&#x27;s function.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is the wave of the future for the internet, until one day, the internet is so crammed full of information, we&#x27;ll all be back to the beginning, where you might as well ask your neighbor for advice.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely helping, but I am applying it twice a day, not 3 times as recommended, and you can only see the progress as quickly as the nail grows.</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear is a scam.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the Zeta Clear site on a weekend.  </li>
            <li> Zeta Clear made it go away.</li>
            <li> I have just begun using Zeta Clear because of my brother&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Zeta Clear now for a year</li>
            <li> The picture shows oral spray and clear nail solution.</li>
            <li> so I tried Zeta Clear and bingo---</li>
            <li> all clear in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought Zeta Clear</li>
            <li> If you have nail infections or fungus try Zeta Clear before getting a prescription.</li>
            <li> Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clear</li>
            <li> The fungus needs to grow out completely so you can&#x27;t stop using this until the nail has grown out.</li>
            <li> People need to know that they must continue to use it until ALL symptoms are gone and the nail has grown out completely ...</li>
            <li> I bought 3 packs of Zeta Clear for a considerable sum (£50) for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product maybe a week ago and have been using it consistently as directly.</li>
            <li> I have gotten in the habit of never wearing flip flops or being barefoot in public but this product really delivered for me.</li>
            <li> To early to tell how well it works.  </li>
            <li> So far as what you use to treat it</li>
            <li> bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;</li>
            <li> I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...</li>
            <li> Like one of your reviewers I am hesitate about homeopathic BUT NOT ORGANIC AND NATURAL cures.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> good, expensive...</li>
            <li> Its almost cleared up except my two big toes on my left and right foot.</li>
            <li> Due to this technique of clogging the internet with their advertising, I will have nothing to do with this company that is most likely selling you a vastly overpriced product.  </li>
            <li> First off - it does not work, second of all the company offers a money back guarantee</li>
            <li> The paint is straight forward with its list of ingredients - the tea tree and urea are the primary active ingredients to combat the fungus, the oils help to spread the active ingredients evenly &amp; also suffocate the fungus (it needs air &amp; a moist environment to spread) and the oil prevents this - the Vit E / grapeseed extract help to prevent the formulation going rancid.  </li>
            <li> If  high prices and extensive advertising were an indication of a products efficacy, then ZetaClear would work.</li>
            <li> However, I highly recommend the brushed applicator.</li>
            <li> It will be a long process as toe nails take so long to grow, but this is the first positive results I have ever had in finally being rid of this persistent fungus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks my nail had turned a much darker color, and I acually lost most of my nail which must have been dead already.</li>
            <li> By the 9th day the layers of brittleness have subsided &amp; the nails have started to regress back to their normal state of lying on the skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> What finally helped me get rid of it was when my DPM treated the fungus with a new laser treatment.</li>
            <li> So I am absolutely amazed after just a few months of consistent use, my toenail is actually growing back normally.  </li>
            <li> He used Zeta Clear religiously three times a day, and the fungus completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> After making my own essential oil blend and that didn&#x27;t work, I was pretty desperate and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> The other nails never improved anymore after the first couple applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this product works for other people,  but it doesn&#x27;t work at all for him, so he&#x27;ll be off to the GP to get some real treatment!</li>
            <li> Homeopathic IS governed, and therefore generally weaker so that people feel that they must go to drugs.  </li>
            <li> And as an aside, Zeta Clear obviously used the cheapest brush applicator they could find.  </li>
            <li> this request for an evaluation comes far to soon  relative to the condition it clai,s to treat..</li>
            <li> However, I will be surprised if what they sent will last the month as they say.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I bought a 6 month supply because I figured if it worked it would take some time as any \\&quot;nail treatment\\&quot; takes and in the long run it was much cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;First off I filled down my nails as suggested but other reviewers and suggestions I&#x27;ve found on the net.</li>
            <li> They are clever to list it in their product ingredients, but there was no need to even analyze such percentages as the combination has already destroyed THE ONLY actual working ingredient - \\&quot;Undecylenic</li>
            <li> Following early enough detection and confirmation of this change, immediate corrective measures were implemented.</li>
            <li> yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few days after stopping usage, the oils will dissipate, with showering and such, and your nail will look EXACTLY as it was when you started, except that you gave your money to crooks.</li>
            <li> I am not sponsored to endorse this product by any means but various negative reviews have made assertions without having a true understanding of what the various ingredients in the formulations do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have completely blitzed the internet with multiple versions of their own advertising, so it makes it very difficult to search for any unbiased information.  </li>
            <li> I have a toenail fungus that wants to make my nails separate from the bed at the corners crossing a third to half the nail.</li>
            <li> Based on this the true average review score for this product should be less than two stars.  </li>
            <li> After a few years of batteling onychomycosis I am now super careful as to not reinfect myself.</li>
            <li> You must file down the nail (like right down so the nail bed is almost exposed and almost bleeding...</li>
            <li> I pump a few applications on the nail, a few times a day, and then cover with a clean sock.  </li>
            <li> I just read some other peoples reviews that state that zeta clear does not take returns unless the bottle is unopened and there is a 10 dollar restocking fee per bottle.</li>
            <li> But what you actual get is only the oral spray, no clear nail solution.</li>
            <li> And, I put my toe in the sun for a while nearly every day, as I know fungus grows where its dark &amp; damp.</li>
            <li> have since tried for nail fungus a few different products, and I am in no way affiliated with these companies, at the very bottom I am leaving my on personal experience with a cure that did work - filing down the nail and using a combo of tea tree oil, Gehwol Med foot spray, and castor oil acid - aka undecenoic acid.</li>
            <li> This was from a volunteer subject whose \\&quot;end-stage\\&quot; fungal status was nearly cleared up by our recommended care</li>
            <li> When you buy this product they tell you that it could take as much as 6 months to a year to see results but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you only have three months to return product and by then is too late.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different ways to clear up my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have been following the instructions on usage (3xs daily) since Oct 5, 2008 with the same bottle to help w/ toes, one of which has turned black.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find out the &#x27;real deal&#x27; about these kinds of products because all the website information is for sales purposes.  </li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money and you get only a portion of your money back if you try to return it.     </li>
            <li> I was one of the people with almost no natural resistance.  </li>
            <li> however long that takes.  </li>
            <li> It required a long time, persistence and ZetaClear.</li>
            <li> The one thing it didn&#x27;t explain was, how long do I take it?  </li>
            <li> I am seeing a change, but the nails are not clear.  </li>
            <li> It did not clear my husbands nails</li>
            <li> Have tried a number of other products on the market prior to ordering Zeta Clear, with little or no results,so I was a bit hesitant about another product.</li>
            <li> I gave my daughter half of my second bottle and the second bottle of the spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied Zeta Clear for a little more than a week now and already the nail is losing that disgustingly ugly yellow color and is turning darker.</li>
            <li> It started spreading from my big toe to the other toes.</li>
            <li> based on other reviewers : only laser works, or Gehwol, or castor bean oil aka undecenoic acid ...</li>
            <li> only received the oral spray, outside box was missing</li>
            <li> Shortly after placing my one and only order of 3 bottles I began receiving frequent obnoxious sales calls from the Zeta Clear company attempting to sell me other useless products.</li>
            <li> but only if you keep filing your nail down to the nail bed...</li>
            <li> Then I remembered a solution that was mentioned in my initial research which suggested trying Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub (in the small blue container.)</li>
            <li> There were some changes, but only slight ones.</li>
            <li> After less than one month, I noticed a definite improvement but was not absolutely certain.</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s a sure bet that within a couple weeks after I quit using this they will look just as bad as they did before I started using the product.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff comes in all sorts of forms, and paying so much for a bottle of this stuff seems like a rip-off.      </li>
            <li> And suddenly, a few weeks later, the nail beds were visible again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no effect on my toe nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, the &#x27;yellow&#x27; discolouration of the nails started to dissipate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Grapefruit seed extract - minimally helped control itch, did nothing for nails&lt;</li>
            <li> However my physician said the only treatment was a long course of Oral anti fungal meds which were very expensive,and some possible bad side effects....</li>
            <li> But, I also cut the old, bad nail as much off and out as possible, weekly, so the medicine can get in down to where the nail grows.</li>
            <li> the lady who said Zeta Clear take down negative press....</li>
            <li> on my review and my use: only product containing undecenoic acid and gehwol med foot spray, and filing the nail down obsessively to bottom of nail bed ( like 2 times a week!!)</li>
            <li> The other issue is you go thru the oral spray a lot faster than you go thru the nail solution.</li>
            <li> The other day, I found an unbiased review on the product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this over any other product over the counter.</li>
            <li> It started with one thumb and seems to be spreading to other fingers.  </li>
            <li> would seek other treatment before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I also read other reviews that say laser works.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Using bleach OR hydrogen peroxide on nail - use one or the other</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail fungus treatments and this is by far the worst one.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give one star is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to prove how useless it is.    </li>
            <li> The base of the nail is growing back clean and</li>
            <li> I am still using it, I have like about 3 weeks using it, the results are very slow, but I have faith that zeta clear is going to work.i would recommend.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t put down my laptop and listened I would have said \\&quot;fine\\&quot; and been enrolled into something verbally.  </li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be taken down.</li>
            <li> Get a Vogue rechargeable nail filer so you can text with one hand while filing with the other ( just kidding about the texting!)</li>
            <li> While I have seen a slight difference it has not cleared up the fungus.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a month and a half ago</li>
            <li> It look like it started working clearing up some of my nails, but it stop working, I follow all instructions  as directed but sorry to say I had high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;Did&#x27;nt work for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a epic fail like all other treatments.</li>
            <li> The prescription formulations have varied in price from $90-$120 per bottle of paint, all of them smaller bottles then the Zeta clear and not worked; now that is expensive!  </li>
            <li> Sorry folks, there is NO topical cure for long term fungal nail.  </li>
            <li> ,with little or no results.  </li>
            <li> At this point they look a little clearer (that&#x27;s debatable) but in no way are they cured.</li>
            <li> By the third week I noticed something I have not seen in 13 years - the mother (nail bed) of at least 3 nails!  </li>
            <li> I heard about this product, but now that I know they sell a completely useless &amp;#34;oral spray&amp;#34; as part of the package, I&#x27;m giving a wide berth, and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> What I wish I had known before using Zetaclear was what a podiatrist told me after I wasted months and lots of money using ZetaClear.  </li>
            <li> It appears they are heavily involved in a sort of official looking viral marketing campaign.</li>
            <li> I recommend talking to your doctor or pharmacist at Walgreens before buying this stuff because it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> It recently has gotten worse, so I thought I would go to the web and try to figure out a way to get rid of the problem.  </li>
            <li> , it is a bothersome condition with few remedies.</li>
            <li> and I will rate it after a few months.</li>
            <li> wouldnt waste money on it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this...</li>
            <li> I have had a discolored big toe for years and it had continually gotten worse by chipping/flaking and practically disentegrating on my foot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few months</li>
            <li> Now, after two and one half months, I can say with certainty that this stuff is working for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It performed worse than simply being negative.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and packaged well, I do not have anything bad to say, can not complain about anything really except for I don&#x27;t see any immediate results after 1 month</li>
            <li> Not sure why no one is mentioning this.</li>
            <li> not sure if it will work 100%.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day for one month and no more fungus.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working, but still using.</li>
            <li> I used the spray under the tongue, and the formula on my nail twice daily without fail.  </li>
            <li> treatment had no meaningful or noticeable effect on my 3 toes with fungus</li>
            <li> small bottle would run out in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> after reading comparisons, learned it was a fake web review later.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you will loose with this product is an ugly toe nail.</li>
            <li> Well, instead of shelling out $70, I should have tried this for less than $5!!  </li>
            <li> Ingenious, scary, annoying, deceptive, and devious.</li>
            <li> but you may hardly recognize that</li>
            <li> I do NOT take any drugs, not even an over the counter pain killer, because I refuse to support that hugely profit based copies of cures found in nature that add horrible side effects.  </li>
            <li> Agree with customers with negative comments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d at least give this stuff a shot as it can&#x27;t hurt....</li>
            <li> Use it for at least a month,  before bed when you won&#x27;t be washing it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks &amp; have been getting the results that the website stated but to allay my self doubt that perhaps I was just imagining things I decided to try to find some negative reviews</li>
            <li> This product does not work and the company unethically deletes negative reviews off the internet.</li>
            <li> Nail fungus is very difficult to treat, most medications cost hundreds of dollars and have very dangerous side effects.</li>
            <li> After years of trying other expensive products that did nothing, even after going to a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> Lamisil due to my insurance would no longer help cover the cost, it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> It took about a year, but I have NO MORE FUNGUS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had toenail fungus for years and each year it got worse, more painful and ugly.</li>
            <li> no matter what I do so far :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have such a terrible problem, but applying 2 times a day worked in a month, my big toes were cleared of yellow-ness.</li>
            <li> They are still thick and yellow but I will have to admit they are not as bad as they were 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil for about 3 months now, and the base of my toe nail looks clear.</li>
            <li> dumb</li>
            <li> I have been using ZetaClear for about 11 months now and it showed a very slow improvement..</li>
            <li> Of all the prescription &#x27;cures&#x27; I have tried they either haven&#x27;t done anything or have been very slow to see any progress (up to 6 weeks before seeing any change).  </li>
            <li> and I was told that this product contains some type of chemical unhealthy to consume;therefore</li>
            <li> and you cannot wear nail polish while using this product or it will make it worse or not work at all.</li>
            <li> in fact it is rated poorly.</li>
            <li> if you want to try it, beware of tactics, amazon may stand behind the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So annoyed with myself for not picking up on this before I laid out the dosh.</li>
            <li> Poor</li>
            <li> Also, the oral prescribed crazy antibiotic dosage works based on other people&#x27;s reviews but careful, this is also a very dangerous remedy...</li>
            <li> I only had 1 bad nail!!!</li>
            <li> If the vendor is selling it way below retail price (go to Zetaclear&#x27;s Site), you should be skeptical about it.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible not only does it not work</li>
            <li> but desperate times lead to dumb and desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - some nurses swear by this dangerous remedy of EITHER bleach or EITHER hydrogen peroxide 10% ( put it with q-tip on their nail</li>
            <li> but be carefull - dangerous, toxic, and can damage integrity of your skin temporarily ...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s happened on my worst toe is one side of the nail has improved, not sure why there is a line.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and did not drink their Kool-aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The laser treatment was very expensive.</li>
            <li> and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to buy it by itself (and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all).</li>
            <li> Now THAT is bad business practice.</li>
            <li> Do not work and smell bad for no reason i still applying to buy nail to see what is going to happen</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes it takes longer depending on how bad it is.  </li>
            <li> thing I will agree on with every review is the customer service is atrocious.  </li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting and sadly couldn&#x27;t tell it did anything.  </li>
            <li> and I hate to know what it did or might do to my liver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hate it without even using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have one of the worst cases of fungus on both of my feet and on three toes on each foot that has fungus.</li>
            <li> but it could make your problem even worst!</li>
            <li> The worst affected nails are now no longer sore to the touch either.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an honest answer because I haven&#x27;t used it constantly.</li>
            <li> my mom is using the product and works</li>
            <li> After making my own essential oil blend and that didn&#x27;t work, I was pretty desperate and decided to try this. I bought mine from ultra herbal. It is definitely helping, but I am applying it twice a day, not 3 times as recommended, and you can only see the progress as quickly as the nail grows. The fungus needs to grow out completely so you can&#x27;t stop using this until the nail has grown out. What&#x27;s happened on my worst toe is one side of the nail has improved, not sure why there is a line. The other issue is you go thru the oral spray a lot faster than you go thru the nail solution. Not sure why no one is mentioning this. So I am hoping the oral spray is not crucial to it working, because I will be out of it soon and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to buy it by itself (and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all).</li>
            <li> This product did nothing. ..I use till the product was gone and srill have the same issue...would like a refund</li>
            <li> After many summer months of hiding my(big toe)nail fungus with nail polish, I decided to go polish free and see if this product works.  What a surprise! I&#x27;ve applied Zeta Clear for a little more than a week now and already the nail is losing that disgustingly ugly yellow color and is turning darker. In the process, the thickness has also diminished to almost normal.  The base of the nail is growing back clean and I&#x27;m encouraged that in a few weeks while in FL, I&#x27;ll be able to wear sandals with no fear of the \\&quot;FUN GUY\\&quot; showing!!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> You will note that the positive reviewers tend to only have one product - ZetaClear - as a part of their review portfolio.    A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS - especially in light of so many negative reviews.    Whenever I find a product that is 50/50 - the negatives right.</li>
            <li> have been using it daily,except during the summer. not sure if it will work 100%.</li>
            <li> Zetaclear does not work at all. I used it for 8 months and no effect. This is a total waste of money and you get only a portion of your money back if you try to return it.     I only had 1 bad nail!!!</li>
            <li> I bought zetaclear and followed their directions, but it did absolutely nothing to my feet. I have a severe case of fungus, but it didn&#x27;t even make it look slightly better. The other day, I found an unbiased review on the product. It explained a lot of reasons why it is the best seller right now, and yet it says that over 45% of those who used it see almost no improvement. Then, a couple days later, I look for the review again, and it has changed. Someone changed it to make it look like zeta clear was the 2nd best seller instead of a scam! So- I think the reason everything on-line is positive towards zetaclear is because they have a good computer wiz who is searching for negative reviews and changing them. :) It is obvious that it is a scam.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! I used it once a day for one month and no more fungus. The only thing that you will loose with this product is an ugly toe nail. I bought two more bottles for my mom and brother.</li>
            <li> I bought Zeta clear to use on my big toenail, which had a pretty severe case of fungus. Within a few weeks my nail had turned a much darker color, and I acually lost most of my nail which must have been dead already. I have been using the oil for about 3 months now, and the base of my toe nail looks clear. I was pleasantly surprised with the results! Nail fungus is very difficult to treat, most medications cost hundreds of dollars and have very dangerous side effects. I thought this product was well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> After years of trying other expensive products that did nothing, even after going to a podiatrist. This is the only thing I have found relief from. Thank you</li>
            <li> Agree with customers with negative comments.  Cant even get spray to work Should be taken off market.  Doesn&#x27;t FDA check these bogus products?</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working, but still using.</li>
            <li> The results are not instant, you have to apply the solution several times a day for weeks but it does work. I had a nail fungus, used this product, and now it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Zeta Clear is a scam. They get you to buy 2 to 5 bottles of there product. The liquid you apply to the nail did nothing. They also, give you a liquid you are suppose to drink. I was very skeptical and did not drink their Kool-aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please DO NOT BUY to support unethical people to make more money on something that does not work.</li>
            <li> If  high prices and extensive advertising were an indication of a products efficacy, then ZetaClear would work. It didn&#x27;t work for me.  What I wish I had known before using Zetaclear was what a podiatrist told me after I wasted months and lots of money using ZetaClear.  He told me that some people are more resistant than others  to the fungi that causes athletes foot and nail infections. I was one of the people with almost no natural resistance.  There are both oral and topical treatments that will kill the fungi and they are available  by prescription.  Once the infection is gone and the nails healed, I could maintain fungi-free feet with over the counter anti-fungal creams applied once or twice a week.  For anyone with health insurance, the cost of three months supply of ZetaClear is greater than the cost of the prescriptions and the trip to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a fungal infection in my great toe for 30 yrs-and have taken the Lamisil regimen twice, as well as multiple anti fungal creams etc.,with little or no results.  So I am absolutely amazed after just a few months of consistent use, my toenail is actually growing back normally.  I used the spray under the tongue, and the formula on my nail twice daily without fail.  But, I also cut the old, bad nail as much off and out as possible, weekly, so the medicine can get in down to where the nail grows. And, I put my toe in the sun for a while nearly every day, as I know fungus grows where its dark &amp; damp. It has all worked, I am very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have such a terrible problem, but applying 2 times a day worked in a month, my big toes were cleared of yellow-ness. If I would have used it 3x a day like it said, it probably would have worked faster.</li>
            <li> Let me runthrough the ingredients on this bottle:  Undecyclenic acid, Tea tree oil, Clove Oil, Almond Oil, Jajoba oil, Lemongrass oil, Lavendar oil, Vitamin E oil.    So the only thing in here that is actually effective is the acid.  I googled it and the Mayo Clinic says it&#x27;s being replaced by more effective medicines.  However, this stuff comes in all sorts of forms, and paying so much for a bottle of this stuff seems like a rip-off.      And as an aside, Zeta Clear obviously used the cheapest brush applicator they could find.  On the bright side, a bottle says it has 30 doses, but unless you&#x27;re pouring it on it will go a lot further.  I&#x27;m 1 week into it (that&#x27;s 21 doses, folks) and the bottle is still full.  Results have not made themselves evident, by the way, so don&#x27;t count on wearing your cute shoes in 2 weeks!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give one star is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to prove how useless it is.    I want to add the I bought this product from the Zeta Clear site on a weekend.  Two minutes after my order, my phone rings.  Oh look, I say, it&#x27;s a local number.  Well it turns out to be a woman who \\&quot;just wants to verify\\&quot; my order, my name, my address, and what I ordered.  I&#x27;ve never recieved a call like this, and am zoning her out... yeah, yeah, whatever lady.  But after she slowly mulls though my order she blurts out a 30-second sales gimmick about becoming a free trial member to something, disguising it as further confirmation, and then says, \\&quot;ok?\\&quot;  If I hadn&#x27;t put down my laptop and listened I would have said \\&quot;fine\\&quot; and been enrolled into something verbally.  Now THAT is bad business practice.</li>
            <li> Having used other medications, this one worked the best in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have been following the instructions on usage (3xs daily) since Oct 5, 2008 with the same bottle to help w/ toes, one of which has turned black.  After 3.5 months I have noticed no improvement at all.  While the oils smell nice and keep the nails moisturized, I would caution others to try other cheaper remedies before using this.  It may work for some, but did nothing for me.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Although I love Zetaclear brushed applicator for my toenail fungus, I am hesitant in trying this particular product because I took it to my M.D. and I was told that this product contains some type of chemical unhealthy to consume;therefore,I don&#x27;t trust it. However, I highly recommend the brushed applicator. I have tried everything with my toenail fungus and this is the only product that has worked. However, you need to buy it from a reliable source because some Sites I&#x27;ve discovered sell water-down products which are not as efficient. If the vendor is selling it way below retail price (go to Zetaclear&#x27;s Site), you should be skeptical about it.  Hope that helped.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would.  It does not work.  If you think it works, you are only seeing a cosmetic effect or it is not nail fungus you are treating.  Most importantly, ZetaClear is a Healthbuy.com product.  Healthbuy.com practices predatory sales techniques and return policies.  There are plenty of legitimate e-commerce companies that sell alternative medicines, but Healthbuy.com is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I felt that it is too overrated</li>
            <li> Do not work and smell bad for no reason i still applying to buy nail to see what is going to happen I usig it for 3 month with no result</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting and sadly couldn&#x27;t tell it did anything.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this over any other product over the counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with nail fungus for many years. Refused to take antibiotics for months on end with no guarantee of success anyway. Had tried many different products and none did much of anything! Been using this product about 5 months and all nails (all 10 were infected) are now growing in clear and normal....  Why it works for some and not others have no idea. I only care the product worked for me so I got my money&#x27;s worth. If your suffering from nail fungus I&#x27;d at least give this stuff a shot as it can&#x27;t hurt....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different ways to clear up my toenail fungus. Only one I found of any help was Lamisil. After taking the pills for about 6 months 2 of my 10 nails cleared up and looked normal and healthy. Then I figured I would give Zetaclear a shot and here&#x27;s what I got out of it. Really didn&#x27;t want to try anymore Lamisil due to my insurance would no longer help cover the cost, it&#x27;s expensive and I hate to know what it did or might do to my liver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on with my luck with Zetaclear...&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 6 month supply because I figured if it worked it would take some time as any \\&quot;nail treatment\\&quot; takes and in the long run it was much cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;First off I filled down my nails as suggested but other reviewers and suggestions I&#x27;ve found on the net. Then after a couple applications my nails were looking clearer. For the next 6 months I applied the liquid to my nails and used the spray as directed. In that time one of the nails that had been cured by using Lamisil actually started turning yellow again. The other nails never improved anymore after the first couple applications. At this point they look a little clearer (that&#x27;s debatable) but in no way are they cured. They are still thick and yellow but I will have to admit they are not as bad as they were 6 months ago. But I think it&#x27;s a sure bet that within a couple weeks after I quit using this they will look just as bad as they did before I started using the product. If not worse sine now I have 9 of my nails with the fungus instead of 8. I think the liquid just soaks into the nail and clears out the yellowness some but doe not attack the actual fungus on the toenail bed which is where the problem really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I am convinced there is NO cure for nail fungus! I would love to try the laser treatment in hopes that something would actually work. I can not find enough positive results to spend that kind of money only to find out it&#x27;s a epic fail like all other treatments. ThereforeI&#x27;ll probably have to live with this the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Picture shows 2 bottles... Very deceiving ad practice, I have no intention of spraying this product under my tongue&lt;br /&gt;I hate it without even using it.</li>
            <li> I am still using it, I have like about 3 weeks using it, the results are very slow, but I have faith that zeta clear is going to work.i would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a fungus on two of my toes that I&#x27;ve tried everything on. Different products have helped to control the fungus and keep it from spreading. Zeta Clear made it go away. It took about a year, but I have NO MORE FUNGUS!</li>
            <li> I have just begun using Zeta Clear because of my brother&#x27;s recommendation.  He had fungus under his finger and toe nails for 40 years.  He used Zeta Clear religiously three times a day, and the fungus completely cleared up.  I am already beginning to see results myself, and I have been using it only two weeks.  I have hopes!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff twice daily and it&#x27;s working !  People need to know that they must continue to use it until ALL symptoms are gone and the nail has grown out completely ... however long that takes.  Thanks so much !</li>
            <li> Many of the web sites you will find that speak about ZetaClear such as publichealthforums.com, healthynailsworld.com and others like them seem to be directly associated with the product manufacturer. It appears they are heavily involved in a sort of official looking viral marketing campaign. The same woman appears under different names, on different sites as a moderator or official source of information. All of the reviews on these sites are anonymous for the most part. It may be legitimate but my readings suggest otherwise. I recommend talking to your doctor or pharmacist at Walgreens before buying this stuff because it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with fingernail fungus for years.  It started with one thumb and seems to be spreading to other fingers.  It recently has gotten worse, so I thought I would go to the web and try to figure out a way to get rid of the problem.  ZetaClear seemed like the solution, but it wasn&#x27;t!  I tried it consistently for a month with no change whatsoever.  Then I remembered a solution that was mentioned in my initial research which suggested trying Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub (in the small blue container.) The people that mentioned this said it would take awhile to work.  Well, instead of shelling out $70, I should have tried this for less than $5!!  The first day I noticed a difference.  It is working great and my problem is slowly fading.    Use a Q-tip to work the medicine into the area under the nail, and cover with a band-aid for maximum effect.  Try this cheap solution before you go blowing it on this stuff.  Maybe it does work, but not for what ails me... good luck, it is a bothersome condition with few remedies.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for one month, three times a day and my fungus is the same. I have seen no progress!!</li>
            <li> I am seeing a change, but the nails are not clear.  There is plenty of product left, so I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> I have been using Zeta Clear now for a year and yes it does work. There are many different types of toe fungus out there and Zeta Clear does not treat and cure all of them. I have one of the worst cases of fungus on both of my feet and on three toes on each foot that has fungus. I even lost my toe nails and since they have started growing back it has helped a lot. My toes are almost heeled. You have to give it time to work it&#x27;s not going to happen in a month or two and you cannot wear nail polish while using this product or it will make it worse or not work at all.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT CURE ANYTHING!... Being an oil based product, it may help your nail lose some discoloring caused by the fungus, but this is a purely a COSMETIC change. A few days after stopping usage, the oils will dissipate, with showering and such, and your nail will look EXACTLY as it was when you started, except that you gave your money to crooks.</li>
            <li> Have not had enough time to tell. John more time when I have used it then I will know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Beware the picture is not what you are ordering. The picture shows oral spray and clear nail solution. The product description only talks about the nail solution.  But what you actual get is only the oral spray, no clear nail solution.</li>
            <li> It will be several months before I know anything about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Joe</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Got it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product fo over a month and received no response. I want my money back for my purchase.</li>
            <li> We tried this product for private research purposes from requests due to this company&#x27;s exceptional media blitz campaign. Herewith the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performed worse than simply being negative. It actually \\&quot;fed the fungus,\\&quot; which quickly returned with a vengeance! Following early enough detection and confirmation of this change, immediate corrective measures were implemented. Yet, the minimum recovery period was still 6-8 weeks of intensive care and concerns. This was from a volunteer subject whose \\&quot;end-stage\\&quot; fungal status was nearly cleared up by our recommended care methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, NEVER put \\&quot;oils\\&quot; of any kind on the type of fungus being advertised here. The only product we have found to be time tested and consistently proven effective is \\&quot;Undecylenic Acid,\\&quot; - ALONE! Mixing anything else with it only dilutes and reduces effectiveness. They are clever to list it in their product ingredients, but there was no need to even analyze such percentages as the combination has already destroyed THE ONLY actual working ingredient - \\&quot;Undecylenic Acid.\\&quot; You can get it here at Amazon.com, Pharmacy chain stores nationwide and even Wal-Mart. Do yourself a big favor by using the right product.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and packaged well, I do not have anything bad to say, can not complain about anything really except for I don&#x27;t see any immediate results after 1 month</li>
            <li> It look like it started working clearing up some of my nails, but it stop working, I follow all instructions  as directed but sorry to say I had high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;Did&#x27;nt work for me</li>
            <li> Has done more in a short time than anything else</li>
            <li> Have tried a number of other products on the market prior to ordering Zeta Clear, with little or no results,so I was a bit hesitant about another product.However my physician said the only treatment was a long course of Oral anti fungal meds which were very expensive,and some possible bad side effects....so I tried Zeta Clear and bingo---all clear in 3 weeks.I continued for several more weeks just to be sure it did not return...and this was a problem that was persistent for 10 years,without relief!!!I talked about the product at a family reunion and now 3 more folks have now found relief of all symptoms...This is the Miracle in a Blue Bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had toenail fungus for years and each year it got worse, more painful and ugly. It started spreading from my big toe to the other toes. My doctor was reluctant to treat it because of the potential side effects of the available drugs. So, I bought two months supply of Zetaclear. After less than one month, I noticed a definite improvement but was not absolutely certain. Now, after two and one half months, I can say with certainty that this stuff is working for me! My nails haven&#x27;t looked this good in years! The damaged part of the nail has almost completely grown out and the new nail is absolutely clear and healthy! I&#x27;m so excited about this product that I highly recommend it!    One caution. I gave my daughter half of my second bottle and the second bottle of the spray. She used it two days and got some sores on the tip of her tongue and under her tongue. She stopped using the spray and in two days after stopping the spray the sores started to go away. I didn&#x27;t get any sores at all so this could be unrelated but seems very suspicious. Just be aware of this possible side effect.    I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product for one more month and probably keep some on hand in case the fungus returns. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 packs of Zeta Clear for a considerable sum (£50) for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product works for other people,  but it doesn&#x27;t work at all for him, so he&#x27;ll be off to the GP to get some real treatment!</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail fungus treatments and this is by far the worst one.&lt;br /&gt;There are others that are cheaper and more effective but will not mention them here because this review is purely to expose the scam that ZetaClear is. First off - it does not work, second of all the company offers a money back guarantee but they dont tell you that they charge a $10.00 restocking fee per item - so if you had three items in your order you will be charged 30$. They also dont refund the shipping cost which I can understand but they make you pay for return shipping and on top of all that they dont refund the tax or &amp;#34;Insurance&amp;#34; cost, so on a purchase of $112.95 I was refunded $65</li>
            <li> good, expensive...but did do some difference. I did not know, but another bottle of solution was needed. would have to consider if buying again</li>
            <li> While I have seen a slight difference it has not cleared up the fungus. In all fairness I have not finished the treatment yet and will do the full time as suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li> some improvement was observed! nothing harmful occurred. it,s a good product . to give a better evaluation wii take more time. this request for an evaluation comes far to soon  relative to the condition it clai,s to treat..</li>
            <li> I have to give Zeta Clear some credit for creative marketing.  They have completely blitzed the internet with multiple versions of their own advertising, so it makes it very difficult to search for any unbiased information.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is the wave of the future for the internet, until one day, the internet is so crammed full of information, we&#x27;ll all be back to the beginning, where you might as well ask your neighbor for advice.  Due to this technique of clogging the internet with their advertising, I will have nothing to do with this company that is most likely selling you a vastly overpriced product.  Which is how they can afford to spend all day filling the forums and websites all over the place with quite biased information.  Ingenious, scary, annoying, deceptive, and devious.</li>
            <li> This product does not help to get rid of fungus. It doesn&#x27;t kill the fungus under your nail.     I tried this product (and a number of competing products) several times for several month and only saw cosmetic improvements. The fungus would not go away.     What finally helped me get rid of it was when my DPM treated the fungus with a new laser treatment. The laser treatment was very expensive. But I am happy to be rid of the fungus. This will be my second summer with no fungus! After a few years of batteling onychomycosis I am now super careful as to not reinfect myself. I pay extra attention at the nail salon. I am super careful at swimming pools. And I sanitize my shoes and flip flops using a UV based shoe sanitizer called Sterishoe that kills all the fungus and bacteria in your shoes.</li>
            <li> When I discovered that I had caught a nail fungus, I immediately went to my local pharmacy to get something to heal it. They recommended Excilor, so I applied that for four months. There were some changes, but only slight ones. The fungus kept migrating downwards and would not disappear. Then I bought ZetaClear and applied both for some time. And suddenly, a few weeks later, the nail beds were visible again. There was a spectacular difference in thickness between the healthy growing nail bed and the affected upper parts.&lt;br /&gt;Today my nails are healthy again. It required a long time, persistence and ZetaClear. Believe me, it works!</li>
            <li> Cleared up all the fungus on fingernails &amp; toenails.  Actually improves all the nails.  I was Very Happy!  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all, I use it every day,3 times a day, no results, its a time lost.</li>
            <li> Still waiting on results. I bought this over a month and a half ago but yet I am not seeing any changes yet. Still somewhat hopeful that this works!</li>
            <li> I bought Zeta Clear and it did not work.  Only had one toenail that has fungus.  My friend suggested that I use a hand sanitizer with aloe in it.  Guess what?  After a week of use, the nail is beginning to look much better.  I pump a few applications on the nail, a few times a day, and then cover with a clean sock.  Much cheaper and much more effective.</li>
            <li> The nails are clearer and it seems to be working.  The one thing it didn&#x27;t explain was, how long do I take it?  I am going to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The ZETA oral/sublingual spray is pleasing to the palate and the fungus formula is ez to apply . I would re-purchase for year-round use and definitely recommend. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great it got rid of fugus immediately. Easy to use. Will use this  from now on, it is the only meds you will need.</li>
            <li> So far good.. I received this product on time..</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on the massive online advertising this company does&lt;br /&gt;Applied and consumed as directed&lt;br /&gt;This treatment had no meaningful or noticeable effect on my 3 toes with fungus&lt;br /&gt;I would seek other treatment before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;m using ZetaClear.  It should perform as well as it did the last two times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read through most of the reviews for this product on Amazon.  If you do the same, you&#x27;ll notice that a large quantity of 5 star reviews are from customers who have not used the product long enough to provide an accurate assessment of the product&#x27;s function.  So considering this, most of the 5 star reviews should not be taken into account.  Based on this the true average review score for this product should be less than two stars.  As the saying goes, if it&#x27;s too good to be true...it&#x27;s probably not true.  This product and the website that promotes the item, reads like a scam.  If the product was as good as the manufacturer claims, then it would have 4 or 5 stars here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Oral homeopathic spray? Give me a break. Homeopathy has been thoroughly debunked. I heard about this product, but now that I know they sell a completely useless &amp;#34;oral spray&amp;#34; as part of the package, I&#x27;m giving a wide berth, and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> I suffered with a nail fungus for over a year. My dermatologist gave me a shellac and pills to take but it didn&#x27;t seem to get any better. After a lot of research, I came across reviews on ZetaClear. They all praised the results they had with ZetaClear. I tried it and within a week I started noticing a difference. My nail has finally cleared up and I have started getting pedicures again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good reviews i&#x27;ve seen on youtube and online. Based on the price they wanted thought it might be good. I used this product as directed and did not see any change. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this product. But it may have different results for different people. Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> Cleare3 my nail right up awesome !</li>
            <li> There is a simple cheap solution in your kitchen which cures your fungus within a couple of weeks. I had this problem and tried these over the counter products to no avail. I did some research and found the main ingredient was &amp;#34;vinegar&amp;#34; used what I had available in the kitchen and steeped my finger nail for 2 weeks. Bingo! gone and never returned.</li>
            <li> One star really is being too nice. This stuff is totally worthless. I was sold on the positive reviews on a web site I looked at. It was highly recommended by a so called doctor or doctor&#x27;s. I think this is a real scam.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work!</li>
            <li> SO FAR, IT HAS NOT WORKED!</li>
            <li> Sorry folks, there is NO topical cure for long term fungal nail.  NONE!!  If there was, there would not be so-o-o many topical cures on the market.  The truths are:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  The fungus affecting your toes is systemic; i.e., it is in your body and not just local to your toes.&lt;br /&gt;(2)  This systemic fungus CANNOT be cured by sprinkling holy water (or ointment) on your toes.  The exception to this is if you catch and treat the toes before they even&lt;br /&gt;  hint at getting discolored or hardening.&lt;br /&gt;(3)  Only a systemic medicine (e.g. Lamisil) has a chance of getting at the fungus.  Such a medicine has side effects, some possibly affecting your liver.  That&#x27;s why you have&lt;br /&gt;  to get blood work (and possibly a liver function test) before a physician will prescribe it legally.&lt;br /&gt;(4)  Your discolored toes are here forever.  Get over it.  Whatever treatment you try will NOT cure the discoloration or hardening.&lt;br /&gt;(5)  Lazer treatment can kill the fungus but you may hardly recognize that; your discolored toe nails will remain even after the fungus is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Vicks VapoRub; it&#x27;s as effective as any of the scam fungal medicines you will ever see.</li>
            <li> I had some inconvenience with my order. Waited more than 21 days to receive it, but they were nice enough to resend another order free of charge. I do appreciate the gesture. I started using the product and I will rate it after a few months.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible not only does it not work but it could make your problem even worst! When you buy this product they tell you that it could take as much as 6 months to a year to see results but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you only have three months to return product and by then is too late. There is no phone number to reach them only by email how appropriate!</li>
            <li> try lamisil oral it works on me but is not easy to get it with out prescription ,is a long treatment(from 1 month to 3 months to get ride of fungus )but its the best that i know</li>
            <li> used it twice. had zero results. small bottle would run out in a matter of weeks. wouldnt waste money on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too early to tell. I have a toenail fungus that wants to make my nails separate from the bed at the corners crossing a third to half the nail. I end up having to cut the nails closely to keep from catching the nail and tearing it off. I received this product maybe a week ago and have been using it consistently as directly. It appears that it may be helping but time will tell. However, I will be surprised if what they sent will last the month as they say.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all who posted the reviews here about this scam.  It&#x27;s hard to find out the &#x27;real deal&#x27; about these kinds of products because all the website information is for sales purposes.  I will not be buying this!</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving because you only get the spray not both products. I supposed this is my fault for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all, did nothing..........</li>
            <li> I have been using Absorbine Horse Liniment, available at feed stores and online.  It will cure nail fungus.  You may have a recurrance, so simply use it anytime it pops up. I apply with a Q-tip.  I discovered this when my Dr. told me that removing the nails is one form of treatment.  Noooooo!&lt;br /&gt; I found out that the problem with all these treatments is the nail&#x27;s inability to absorb the medication.  Then it hit me, my sister in-law was always talking about the many things she&#x27;s cured with Absorbine. ( both human and animal)  The name says it all.  It works. If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, try this next.  Use it for at least a month,  before bed when you won&#x27;t be washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it takes longer depending on how bad it is.  Good luck, I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used Zeta Clear, because I don&#x27;t think it can be as effective as Absorbine,  judging by the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES NOT WORK!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this... Bought it last year and used it for 6 months twice a day and nothing.  I wish I had read reviews about this before I bought it.  I bought it through their website after seeing their youtube clips. :/</li>
            <li> beware fraud awaits.&lt;br /&gt;ordered after reading comparisons, learned it was a fake web review later. ordered a free trial, s&amp;h only. they tacked on $4 shipping insurance. phone rang right after the order placed. It was a local number, didn&#x27;t answer, after third call I answered. a rep; talked and declined his credit card offer, i discussed with him my trials of many products and if this were true cure i would order more. The 16 day free trial promised noticable results in that time. two weeks later i received an email of another order placed at 2:30am. I called the company, i did not place an order i told them,  they said they could not stop the order. FRAUD. received a cancellation email and two days later a shipping email. They used my credit card from the trial order without my knowledge or permission. My bank refuses to treat this as fraud and refund my money. i received a mysterious credit card but my son threw out the envelope so i can&#x27;t prove it was their doing. used the trial and zero results. the reviews i read were put up by zeta clear and touted the product as the best on the market. in fact it is rated poorly. my doctor told me it does not work. the company uses fraudulent tactics and my bank is no help. if you want to try it, beware of tactics, amazon may stand behind the purchase. but please notice on the back of the bottle it states it is not a cure.</li>
            <li> Did not work &amp;#34;at all&amp;#34;.  😤</li>
            <li> As advertised&lt;br /&gt; Arrived timely.</li>
            <li> I made two diligent attempts at using this product as directed.  Absolutely no effect on my toe nail fungus.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it has done everything that it claimed it would. If you have nail infections or fungus try Zeta Clear before getting a prescription. The infection is clearing up and the new nail bed is clear and smooth. I have not used i/2 of the bottle yet but I do intend to use it until the nail is all regrown without any fungus. It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d done my research because I found a bunch of sites that proclaimed that Zetaclear was the best nail fungus remedy available. Of course, when I actually received the product and go through the fine print, I realise how dodgy it is. I&#x27;ve only just found this Amazon site with everyone&#x27;s scam alert warnings - can&#x27;t believe I just paid $128 for 3 bottles of nothing! (And that&#x27;s not even counting the 3 bottles of homeopathic oral spray that I wouldn&#x27;t be putting in my mouth for quids.)&lt;br /&gt;So annoyed with myself for not picking up on this before I laid out the dosh. Just got sucked into the marketing hype and wanted to believe all the good &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned!</li>
            <li> I have been using ZetaClear for about 11 months now and it showed a very slow improvement.. So I stopped using it and decided to see a doctor about it, he recommended I try using Lamisil (or terbinafine) medication. I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 6 months now and I&#x27;ve seen very outstanding improvement on my toes!!! Its almost cleared up except my two big toes on my left and right foot. I totally recommend you seeing the doctor about it before trying anything else. I never seen the doctor about my toes and thought I could try and fix this problem myself, but nothing would work.. JUST SEE THE DOCTOR FIRST BEFORE TRYING ZETACLEAR!!! And practice and live with the word \\&quot;HYGEINE\\&quot; for the rest of your life (Its VERY IMPORTANT)!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product and immediately decided I wanted to return it for a refund.  I followed all instructions.  That was MONTHS ago and I have not heard a word about my refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information on the internet made it appear that there were two topical solutions to use. The information never showed that there was an additional product to ingest.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and really didnt expect anything but hope. I have tried everything I could find before and had no results. I have had a discolored big toe for years and it had continually gotten worse by chipping/flaking and practically disentegrating on my foot. While I became concerned that it was a symptom of something worse; I googled for products/solutions for the symptoms I experienced. I ordered one bottle and had remarkable results. It was pretty severe; so I ordered another bottle and voila! I have a toenail again. I have gotten in the habit of never wearing flip flops or being barefoot in public but this product really delivered for me. Although I am still in shock, I highly recommend it for anyone at their wits end. I looking forward to a summer vacation.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no foul oder.  To early to tell how well it works.  I&#x27;ll give it a few months and  i&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many negative reviews. I got a toenail fungus on my left big toe from a pedicure at a nail salon. I won&#x27;t do that again! I used this product and it got rid of my toenail fungus quite easily. It took a few months for the nail to completely grow out, and I applied it until the nail had grown out completely and all traces of the fungus were gone. I think that the problem is that all alternative remedies work for a minority of people. This one worked great for me and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend that anyone order this. It did not clear my husbands nails and, when I asked the company to honor their guarantee, I was first told that my husband must not have followed their instructions. When I insisted he did, the customer disservice rep told me that if their product didn&#x27;t clear the fungus my hubby must have some bizarre skin condition and he should go see a skin specialist. A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Never saw any result. Wish I had my money back. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> This product was not at all helpful to me.  after I received the product I found out that it only helps with the symptoms and dose not clear any fungal bacteria make sure it what you want</li>
            <li> Poor I emaild you wit a picture that 1 of the bottels arrived crack and you did not&lt;br /&gt;Reply back to me</li>
            <li> I want external use like paint your nails, on view products show 2 bottle? but I received just one bottle?</li>
            <li> The customer service was great, surely 5 star. The product is being used at the present time but not enough time to rate its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff and there has been no change. It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like that the instructions said you had to apply this 3 times a day.  What are you supposed to do when you are at work ... take off your shoes and socks and display your funky nails to all of your coworkers?!?!? I don&#x27;t hunk so!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 months exactly as directed. I actually originally purchased it directly from the manufacturer. I have seen absolutely no improvement in my rather mild case of nail fungus.  As a matter of fact, I think my case of nail fungus has worsened. Shortly after placing my one and only order of 3 bottles I began receiving frequent obnoxious sales calls from the Zeta Clear company attempting to sell me other useless products. Trust me, this company is a scam. Do not give them your money!</li>
            <li> I have also been working on getting rid of toe nail fungus . So far as what you use to treat it I think any of the products out there containing 10% or higher undecylenic acid will work. The oils such as tea tree oil and sunflower oil are in there to sooth the area because the undecylenic acid will irritate the skin around the nail. The real key is in prepping the nail before the solution is put on. Nails for the most part are water proof. You need to get to the fungus itself. It helps to physically remove as much of the nail surface as you can by gently filing the surface of the nail and getting to the fungus inside. Trim your nails often. Then the treatment can get to the fungus itself. Without doing that important step no topical treatment will work. Also it is important to make sure your feet are dry and aerated. Change your socks twice a day and wear well ventilated shoes or sandals. Fungus grows best in dark , warm and damp places. Keep all this in mind when you treat your nails and you will get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li> only received the oral spray, outside box was missing</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a month now, and don&#x27;t really notice much change in my fungus condition. Going to stay with it a bit longer and see if it really works. But so far, it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks &amp; have been getting the results that the website stated but to allay my self doubt that perhaps I was just imagining things I decided to try to find some negative reviews - I have found many on Amazon and read many of them and have to advise that I have had a COMPLETELY different experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have had severe toe nail fungus for 13years now on eight of my toes and have tried MANY prescription as well as natural remedies to combat &amp; cure it - the ONLY one that was working after all these years was tea-tree oil but it was a bit hit and miss, if not applied regularly (twice a day religiously) the fugus would take hold - one step forward, two steps backwards.  Out of desperation I went on the hunt again &amp; came across ZetaClear.  I purchased the pack that contains the paint and the spray and started seeing positive results within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is a homeopathic and having studied hoemopathy I know exactly what is in the spray and yes it is necessary and works.  The paint is straight forward with its list of ingredients - the tea tree and urea are the primary active ingredients to combat the fungus, the oils help to spread the active ingredients evenly &amp; also suffocate the fungus (it needs air &amp; a moist environment to spread) and the oil prevents this - the Vit E / grapeseed extract help to prevent the formulation going rancid.  I am not sponsored to endorse this product by any means but various negative reviews have made assertions without having a true understanding of what the various ingredients in the formulations do.&lt;br /&gt;So the results - I must state upfront that I have been using the product as per the recommendations - applying &amp; spraying 3 times per day religiously for coming into the fourth week (perhaps others have not been so diligent and that may be why it hasn&#x27;t worked for them).  Within a few days, the &#x27;yellow&#x27; discolouration of the nails started to dissipate.  By the 9th day the layers of brittleness have subsided &amp; the nails have started to regress back to their normal state of lying on the skin underneath.  By the third week I noticed something I have not seen in 13 years - the mother (nail bed) of at least 3 nails!  Not all the nails are healing at the same rate, it obviously depends on the amount of damage, but I am getting the results stated.  Of all the prescription &#x27;cures&#x27; I have tried they either haven&#x27;t done anything or have been very slow to see any progress (up to 6 weeks before seeing any change).  The worst affected nails are now no longer sore to the touch either.  It will be a long process as toe nails take so long to grow, but this is the first positive results I have ever had in finally being rid of this persistent fungus.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that if you plan to try it, do make sure you get the spray and the paint together.  As for cost, I read on some of the reviews that they thought this product was expensive - at $15 per box, this product is extremely CHEAP!  The prescription formulations have varied in price from $90-$120 per bottle of paint, all of them smaller bottles then the Zeta clear and not worked; now that is expensive!  I purchased a 6 month supply as my case is severe, but with the rate at which toes nails grow for even milder cases you may wish to purchase a 3 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will agree on with every review is the customer service is atrocious.  I had problems when initially placing my order &amp; tried to contact them through their various means &amp; got zero results.  The next thing I knew the product arrived, so whatever the issues with the order initially were somehow miraculously resolved.  Now that I see that is can be purchased through Amazon, if I needed to buy another supply I would definitely purchase through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This product works!</li>
            <li> Hi, so it is true. Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews. This product does not work and the company unethically deletes negative reviews off the internet. Test this out. Put into google search \\&quot; Zeta Clear\\&quot; and you only find positive reviews. That is right there suspicious. I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing. I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies. I just read some other peoples reviews that state that zeta clear does not take returns unless the bottle is unopened and there is a 10 dollar restocking fee per bottle. Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;. I also read other reviews that say laser works. I have not used that yet.&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried for nail fungus a few different products, and I am in no way affiliated with these companies, at the very bottom I am leaving my on personal experience with a cure that did work - filing down the nail and using a combo of tea tree oil, Gehwol Med foot spray, and castor oil acid - aka undecenoic acid. You must file down the nail (like right down so the nail bed is almost exposed and almost bleeding...yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit seed extract - minimally helped control itch, did nothing for nails&lt;br /&gt;coffe grinds - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;gehwol med foot spray - worked but takes forever and you have to file your nail down&lt;br /&gt;blue goo nail fungus - junk - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox ( doctor prescribed it to me) - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;Zeta clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus. booo.&lt;br /&gt;castor bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;br /&gt;Using bleach OR hydrogen peroxide on nail - use one or the other NOT BOTH TOGETHER!!!!  - some nurses swear by this dangerous remedy of EITHER bleach or EITHER hydrogen peroxide 10% ( put it with q-tip on their nail and this kills EVERYTHING), because it eats away the nail, exposing the nail bed, and eventually kills the fungus. but be carefull - dangerous, toxic, and can damage integrity of your skin temporarily ...err I tried it...yeah dumb I know...but desperate times lead to dumb and desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in conclusion. based on other reviewers : only laser works, or Gehwol, or castor bean oil aka undecenoic acid ...but only if you keep filing your nail down to the nail bed...careful because then you can get infections easily!!! Also, the oral prescribed crazy antibiotic dosage works based on other people&#x27;s reviews but careful, this is also a very dangerous remedy...lots of side effects.&lt;br /&gt;based on my review and my use: only product containing undecenoic acid and gehwol med foot spray, and filing the nail down obsessively to bottom of nail bed ( like 2 times a week!!) had any real impact on my nail fungus. Get a Vogue rechargeable nail filer so you can text with one hand while filing with the other ( just kidding about the texting!) Use Castor oil acid ( undecenoic acid) and tea tree in conjunction with gehwol med foot spray.  Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone. Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...no matter what I do so far :( I am going to post this under every zeta clear so people aren&#x27;t scammed and get proper info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click on this review if it was helpful!</li>
            <li> I have been using Zeta Clear for about two months, and I although they state 4-6 months to be fully fungus free, I am astonished at the results thus far.  Like one of your reviewers I am hesitate about homeopathic BUT NOT ORGANIC AND NATURAL cures. I do NOT take any drugs, not even an over the counter pain killer, because I refuse to support that hugely profit based copies of cures found in nature that add horrible side effects.  Homeopathic IS governed, and therefore generally weaker so that people feel that they must go to drugs.  I take natural remedies that are way more powerful (and that includes antibiotics) than any drug.  Having said that, for a homeopathic product, it&#x27;s darn good.  My nails look human again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the lady who said Zeta Clear take down negative press....ha ha if that were only possible, then the movie stars would be doing it, and a whole lot more.  If it&#x27;s up there, it&#x27;s up there....it can&#x27;t be taken down. Imagine the number of sources that review, so if you are only finding positive, gee, I guess it&#x27;s because the stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God provides in the leaves, the bark, and so many other places, all we need to heal and cure.  The most powerful medicine in the world was made by God, not drug companies.</li>
