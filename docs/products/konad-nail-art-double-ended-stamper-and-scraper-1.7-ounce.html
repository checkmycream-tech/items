            <li>Omg best stamper ..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>My wife has had the best results with her stamping plates using this stamper.</li>
            <li>5 star :D</li>
            <li>The perfect size to use when doing nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.!</li>
            <li>Scraper works great.</li>
            <li>This stamper has great pick-up, transfers polish well and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>this does not cost a lot of money but it works great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>by far the best brought my from greatest nail care</li>
            <li>nicely packaged, and works great.  </li>
            <li>It works great although i use a plastic card to move the nail polish because this one kind of scratch the plate.</li>
            <li>It cleans off easily and the scraper does a good job too.</li>
            <li>My nails have a very strong C-curve and I don&#x27;t have any issues at all with the designs being distorted or not transferring.</li>
            <li>It fits really nice in your hand and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, great stamper, and great quality.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work much better for some reason.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t appear to damage the image, but it did scrape the metal around the image up pretty good.</li>
            <li>You can also clean it off with dish soap or alcohol, you are just getting the nice shiny surface knocked-off so that it will stamp right.</li>
            <li>This works just fine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the stamper size; how it&#x27;s a perfect hand size though it may look small in person.</li>
            <li>I clean this off with acetone and haven&#x27;t had any issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stamper is easy to clean, ergonomic and pretty, but the stamper is the star.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it to buy this set for the stamper, though.</li>
            <li>This stamper is so far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I wanted the double stamper, and this is nice.</li>
            <li>It took her a bit of practice to get her nails right</li>
            <li>Had I purchased this stamper first</li>
            <li>The other thing I like about this is that the plastic is good enough quality that it does not dissolve when I clean the stamper&#x27;s body with acetone</li>
            <li>it when you first get it by lightly filing it with a fine grit file, and then wiping it down really well with acetone.</li>
            <li>However, the included scraper is not so good &amp; she uses an old credit card she cut in half to scrape her Konad plates because the metal scraper scratches the plates.</li>
            <li>The little finger grips are really nice too.</li>
            <li>The pad is large enough to hold longer designs yet still be comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the scraper, I tried a couple of times to use it and it really scraped up my plates.</li>
            <li>a real bargin</li>
            <li>I still prefer an old credit card over the tiny Konad scraper, but the double-sided stamper makes this worthwhile.</li>
            <li>It does scratch the plates a lot, which I don&#x27;t mind personally, but if you do, the old credit card trick is the way to go, but as I said before, metal scrapers get the most polish out of the plate.</li>
            <li>it is ok but it has to be filed down...</li>
            <li>Smaller then expected but they are so cute</li>
            <li>Love the smaller stamper for doing small images vs a whole nail design.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve just been using an old plastic card and there is no problem with that.</li>
            <li>just so if this one goes missing I can have an extra, you never know if products get discontinued :)</li>
            <li>The texture is very soft and the curvature of the stamp is flat enough that the entire image will transfer onto your nails.</li>

            <li> , I would NOT have wasted my time with all the other stinking stampers that I bought that gave me such grief.</li>

            <li> No complaints. Works as described. Love the smaller stamper for doing small images vs a whole nail design. Scraper works great.</li>
            <li> Omg best stamper ..I have try Salon express didn&#x27;t work out.. by far the best brought my from greatest nail care</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Just as described ☺</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected but they are so cute can&#x27;t wait to see how they work will def let you know how they work.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to stamper! Had I purchased this stamper first, I would NOT have wasted my time with all the other stinking stampers that I bought that gave me such grief. This stamper has great pick-up, transfers polish well and doesn&#x27;t smear. My nails have a very strong C-curve and I don&#x27;t have any issues at all with the designs being distorted or not transferring. I clean this off with acetone and haven&#x27;t had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;Prime it when you first get it by lightly filing it with a fine grit file, and then wiping it down really well with acetone. You can also clean it off with dish soap or alcohol, you are just getting the nice shiny surface knocked-off so that it will stamp right. I don&#x27;t use the scraper, I tried a couple of times to use it and it really scraped up my plates. It didn&#x27;t appear to damage the image, but it did scrape the metal around the image up pretty good. So, I use other scrapers. Totally worth it to buy this set for the stamper, though. The little finger grips are really nice too. It fits really nice in your hand and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the stamper size; how it&#x27;s a perfect hand size though it may look small in person.</li>
            <li> I have multiple stamps from MASH, Salon express, etc...This stamper is so far my favorite. The texture is very soft and the curvature of the stamp is flat enough that the entire image will transfer onto your nails. One of the other ones I have has such a curve to it that I can only get the center &amp;#34;stripe&amp;#34; of the image onto my nail. If I want the whole thing, I have to press down so hard it ruins my base layers. The scraper will leave scratches on the plate, especially if you scrape kinda hard (I do). But I&#x27;ve just been using an old plastic card and there is no problem with that. The other thing I like about this is that the plastic is good enough quality that it does not dissolve when I clean the stamper&#x27;s body with acetone (the salon express one kinda...melts...a little bit when I use acetone). Overall, great stamper, and great quality. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> The stamper ends are slightly squishier and softer than some of the hard cheaper ones I&#x27;ve used - I prefer this quality. I still prefer an old credit card over the tiny Konad scraper, but the double-sided stamper makes this worthwhile.</li>
            <li> nicely packaged, and works great.  I wanted the double stamper, and this is nice. One side is softer than the other, and smaller.. it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My wife has had the best results with her stamping plates using this stamper. It took her a bit of practice to get her nails right &amp; she prefers this stamper over the cheaper ones I previously purchased. However, the included scraper is not so good &amp; she uses an old credit card she cut in half to scrape her Konad plates because the metal scraper scratches the plates.</li>
            <li> This works just fine. a real bargin</li>
            <li> It works great although i use a plastic card to move the nail polish because this one kind of scratch the plate.</li>
            <li> I got a dual stamper it is ok but it has to be filed down... Here are photos from what I did tonight..</li>
            <li> Great stuff I&#x27;m going to buy this again just so if this one goes missing I can have an extra, you never know if products get discontinued :)</li>
            <li> Stamper is easy to clean, ergonomic and pretty, but the stamper is the star. Metal stampers create the sharpest, cleanest images of all. It does scratch the plates a lot, which I don&#x27;t mind personally, but if you do, the old credit card trick is the way to go, but as I said before, metal scrapers get the most polish out of the plate. 5 star :D</li>
            <li> The perfect size to use when doing nails. The pad is large enough to hold longer designs yet still be comfortable to use. It cleans off easily and the scraper does a good job too.</li>
            <li> this does not cost a lot of money but it works great.  some people said the scraper was awful but we have not found this to be the case at all.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with images transferring onto a different stamper I had and figured I would try a different stamper before giving up on the entire stamping idea all together. This one seems to work much better for some reason.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I started using it the day it came in and I&#x27;m loving it! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.!</li>
