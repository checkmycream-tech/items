            <li>Really effective.</li>
            <li>Nice to have 4 in a pack.</li>

            <li>Very well made and work perfectly!!!  </li>
            <li>I have the feeling if you have real sensitive skin, the scratchiness of the material may irritate, but I am very happy with mine</li>
            <li>These work SUPER great.</li>
            <li>The bright side is that means it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the gloves were also very easy.</li>
            <li>gloves are wonderful for getting that full body clean that most cloths can&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Good fit..</li>
            <li>but these are by far the best.  </li>

            <li>Very good product I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Color not so pretty but still a great product.</li>
            <li>These gloves make my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I will make sure to keep these on hand from now on.</li>
            <li>:) Will keep buying forever.</li>
            <li>I love love love these gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li>These gloves are better than what they had on the market.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that these came with four pair.</li>
            <li>Omg i am so in love with these gloves.</li>
            <li>Love this got it sooner</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re especially great for the back.</li>
            <li>Being able to feel every finger allows you to exfoliate in every nook and cranny on your body.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>If you rub a spot more than a couple of strokes</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try the gloves on my face and wasn&#x27;t sure what the result would be.  </li>
            <li>I love these gloves; I have made them a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>So I thought I would step up to a better quality glove.</li>
            <li>You will LOVE these gloves.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to get so many.  </li>
            <li>This does not bother me so it is not a complain, but more of an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; so glad it came with 4 pair...</li>
            <li>Not to mention the convenience. :-)  </li>
            <li>Love these gloves.  </li>
            <li>They are safe for the washing machine (so I&#x27;ve heard)</li>
            <li>I was glad to see that each pack had two gloves in it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Much much better than a hand cloth.</li>
            <li>- - Overall they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love these exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li>I really love these gloves because they make every shower a spa experience.</li>
            <li>I was so excited I gifted to pair to friends!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for years and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I love how well these gloves lather and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>These piqued my interest and I&#x27;m quite glad that I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these - durable, handy for washing up, comfortable.. not so exfoliating</li>
            <li>Love these gloves.</li>
            <li>Love these gloves.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to shower and clean up well.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel tingly and very clean after each use.</li>
            <li>this will keep you looking young and with a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>They allow for excellent build up of suds and maintain it for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>These make exfoliating easy and much more efficient than using a brush.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re in and out of shower in no time, so easy to use with your favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>Some had free shipping some charged more for shipping than what the gloves cost.</li>
            <li>I enjoy tuning these gloves, as they provide a refreshing tingle after use.</li>
            <li>but they fit okay.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, yet still have great exfoliating power.</li>
            <li>This product is good for all over your body, but I noticed these were the two places it really shined.</li>
            <li>Top notch quality and very worth the price.</li>
            <li>I finally started using these instead of a puff, WAAAY better and work great as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of using a glove because you can really clean and exfoliate well with it.</li>
            <li>keeps the body clean for sure.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy take it easy washing your balls with these things.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect - not flimsy or cheaply made, and not too rough.</li>
            <li>I always feel so smooth and clean after using them!</li>
            <li>I love the maneuverability of lathering with my full dexterity, combined with the exfoliating power of the loofa.</li>
            <li>Some of the fine wrinkles on my face are gone too.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>but these gloves fit me just fine.</li>
            <li>I have huge hands (not freakishly so)</li>
            <li>These gloves really work well, they remove all the sunscreen after swimming, and kind of help wake you up in the morning.</li>
            <li>They fit and do not slide off.</li>
            <li>these gloves are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I gave one pair to my sister in law and one to a friend for them to try.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they confirmed that it is 4 gloves.</li>
            <li>Up until now, I&#x27;d been buying cheap body gloves.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great gentle exfoliator, although I do notice that I go through bar soap much faster with these around.</li>
            <li>My whole body now is super smooth and I love it!</li>
            <li>Great for exfoliation, last a long time, machine washable, great price, etc., etc.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean, smooth, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>First off, wash cloths and bamboo scrubbers (which I DID love) begin to mold and smell no matter</li>
            <li>They perform great and fit my hand snuggly, unlike all the other gloves I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I use it with a rich, moisturizing coconut scented body was and it exfoliates nicely and leaves my skin soft afterward.</li>
            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>I have to say that my skin has never felt this smooth before &amp; it was already pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the way they really work on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Good basic exfoliating  gloves.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE these so much.</li>
            <li>Great gloves, plenty big, good and rough but won&#x27;t scratch your skin.</li>
            <li>I use the old pair to clean tubs and sinks - works great for that too!</li>
            <li>They certainly do the trick, gently but effectively</li>
            <li>I will keep this company as a favorite in order to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Many times better than regular drugstore types.</li>
            <li>My package came quickly.  </li>
            <li>The gloves are well made, and will last while,  plus you get 4 pairs even better!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin or itchiness, but I like to exfoliate regularly so my skin looks its best, and self-tanner won&#x27;t look patchy.  </li>
            <li>But, I can only imagine how wonderful these must feel to someone with dry and/or itchy skin!</li>
            <li>These gloves are great to exfoliate dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Like others said, these things get rid of a lot of dead skins cells and leave your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far :)</li>
            <li>100% worth the exfoliation, though.</li>
            <li>I cannot stop using this and it has helped my skin to look more radiant and soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a shower puff kind of gal but after hearing that these help prior to sunless tanning</li>
            <li>Well worth their cost. -</li>
            <li>right frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right basically.  </li>
            <li>Make exfoliating simple and painless and do a much better job than a wash cloth (little more abrasive / effective).  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more form fitting shower glove that&#x27;s slightly thinner.</li>
            <li>They are a nice dark green shade so a bit more manly than purple but also fit much better on his hands.</li>
            <li>although a good rinse in the shower is all that is typically required.</li>
            <li>My hands are pretty large but the material is stretchy enough that my wife can also use her own pair.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find a great pair of exfoliating gloves</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I finally did.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need four pair at once, as the last pair lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I am using these as the first process in a sunless tanning session</li>
            <li>Nice texture, not overly rough...</li>
            <li>Better yet, when they finally do wear out, save them them for household scrubbing chores.</li>
            <li>Makes cleaning in the shower a breeze, first pair is still holding up after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using exfoliating gloves for more than a decade and never looked back to wash cloths or bamboo scrubbers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy these again as I bought them because they&#x27;re more generously made than the ones I have now (which I&#x27;ve had for several years already).  </li>
            <li>It comes in a pack of 8 which is more than enough for the while family..</li>
            <li>Just got them; will write more later after they have been used for awhile.</li>
            <li>I used it them yesterday morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Since you are using your &#x27;hands&#x27; it is easy to apply what ever pressure you want to your own skin and to get to hard to reach places.      </li>
            <li>You get a great value for your money, and it should last you a long time!!.</li>
            <li>These are great and last a long time, and allow you to shower much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Seriously though, great value for four pairs of gloves.</li>
            <li>I know these clean my skin and help keep it clear.  </li>
            <li>conscious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these as an early Father&#x27;s Day present and my husband was thrilled.</li>
            <li>some of the reviews were too positive...</li>
            <li>and they come out fresh and new.</li>
            <li>I had to add a loop to be able to hang them  to dry.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman with relatively large hands, but not that large.</li>
            <li>Also compared to other stores I&#x27;ve checked, as usual, Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone but men in particular who want to be thorough in grooming but not have giggling wives!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for any one that works hard and works up a good sweat.  </li>
            <li>The gloves are amazing for the skin and getting rid of dead skin and exfoliating the face neck and body</li>
            <li>I found one cheap pair (local store) that worked very well</li>
            <li>They do the job very well</li>
            <li>Very well-made gloves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are comfortable and they make a difference in your skin if you use them on a regular basis (followed by moisturizing your skin)</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that they wore out in about 2 weeks they were lavender and white and barely fit onto his hands.  </li>
            <li>it REALLY lathers exfoliate.</li>
            <li>They exfoliate very well and are much easier than a loufa.</li>
            <li>I use one for the body and a separate one for the face (with much lighter pressure).</li>
            <li>They are very scratchy</li>
            <li>Oh I really do like these gloves.</li>
            <li>Very well made... Works very well</li>
            <li>These work really well for exfoliating my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to wash up with these too.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>I even use it to gently exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I use them on my whole body including my face and my skin</li>
            <li>is MUCH smoother.</li>
            <li>My clients really like this before I begin a massage</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend them!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do as much for ingrown hairs as I thought it would, but then again I was expecting a miracle</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Over all I was very please with the product.</li>
            <li>It wors very well to exfoliate skin</li>
            <li>I do really like these gloves.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re rather porous, in that it won&#x27;t hold on to soap very well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend buying these gloves!</li>
            <li>I never actually used any kind of loofah or gloves when I am taking a shower, but now I can&#x27;t get enough of these things.</li>
            <li>They not only exfoliate the body they also clean my tub very well.</li>
            <li>Plus, the 4-pack is extra economical!</li>
            <li>I use them daily and, as long as you&#x27;re gentle and don&#x27;t scrub yourself raw, they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>could have been rougher, if you&#x27;re looking for something really strong don&#x27;t buy these, but otherwise they&#x27;re great for less serious use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long preferred the use of my hands when bathing, but this has required the use of abrasive soaps (such as [[ASIN:B000BPB3E6 Gojo Orange]]) to be effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re all familiar with the slight rigamorole necessary to lather up a wash clothe, then keep it centered on your hand while you wash.</li>
            <li>I usually buy whatever I can find at Walmart, and that&#x27;s usually fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li>They are thick, hold their shape and texture, go through the washing machine just fine, and still are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>No more washcloths, no more loofahs, the best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li>I used these with some homemade sugarscrub and left my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t care very much for washcloths or poufs is that it&#x27;s difficult to get good contact for vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li>They are not too rough not too smooth.</li>
            <li>If you want a simple, easy, low time solution this is the one.</li>
            <li>A new pair lasts me about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Humorous for me but not very effective or cost</li>
            <li>The gloves rinse out and dry quickly when I leave it on the sink or the edge of the shower.  </li>
            <li>They last long, are easy to rinse and keep sanitized.  </li>
            <li>I have had them for awhile and they have held up to frequent uses!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Love the four pack, can give to other family members or store for later use</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes the glove type for exfoliating, so much easier than the sponges or scrunched net type of scrubber!</li>
            <li>The green is fine.</li>
            <li>Love to use these after a hard days work in the yard.</li>
            <li>They are rough enough that a couple of norlmal light strokes is all you need</li>
            <li>neither are they too soft.</li>
            <li>Soft on your skin, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Made my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li>skin feels really soft after showering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use them prior to waxing or shaving and it allows the hair to be removed much easier</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the prices were wildly inconsistent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I would have preferred the natural color.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something soft and luxurious-feeling, you&#x27;re going to be in for a shock: these things hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>Granted, I have sensitive skin, but they feel like steel wool.</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Really, they&#x27;re almost a revelation from the ones you get at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>At least, they haven&#x27;t fallen off my hands yet. :)</li>
            <li>these gloves exfoliate very well not too harsh not too soft just right</li>
            <li>In less than a week, all of the dry skin was gone, and my legs looked so much better.</li>
            <li>I like using the glove over a loofah which is easier for me when doing a quick scrub down.</li>
            <li>They are not as rough as some cheaper gloves I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but they do the exfoliating job nicely.</li>
            <li>and I find with this brand that although it&#x27;s fine for larger smooth surfaces like arms and legs, it&#x27;s a little difficult to clean around the folds of my ears and in between my toes.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel much cleaner, less time to wash, I use two, and they rinse out fast.</li>
            <li>At first I thought these things were a bit rough, but that was just because I never used anything</li>
            <li>at first try I thought these were a bit rough but then realized if I didn&#x27;t scrub at my body like I&#x27;m cleaning the shower &amp; eased up on my touch</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin even with daily use and I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These gloves did just that, and with a bit of use they become soft enough to wash your face.</li>
            <li>I feel way cleaner using these with a liquid body wash than I did before (bare hands and a bar of soap).</li>
            <li>I could only find these really soft ones.</li>
            <li>Absolutely takes the impurities out of the skin, removing pimples and other impurities.  </li>
            <li>they are very rough so that they really get the job</li>
            <li>Rough enough for me but not too much for her.</li>
            <li>The first time i used these i could not believe the amount of dead skin it took off.</li>
            <li>I was so tired of buying bath products that just fall apart or stretch out or dont completely rinse out clean...</li>
            <li>I spend like half as much time in the shower.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter has extremely dry skin</li>
            <li>I got no complaint, except I have noticed that these gloves seem to have lost color and turned pink-ish due to my body wash.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, a little too thick and bulky for me.</li>

            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> If you rub a spot more than a couple of strokes</li>

            <li> I love these gloves; I have made them a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> So I thought I would step up to a better quality glove.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE these gloves.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to get so many.  </li>
            <li> This does not bother me so it is not a complain, but more of an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; so glad it came with 4 pair...</li>
            <li> Not to mention the convenience. :-)  </li>
            <li> Love these gloves.  </li>
            <li> They are safe for the washing machine (so I&#x27;ve heard)</li>
            <li> I was glad to see that each pack had two gloves in it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Much much better than a hand cloth.</li>
            <li> - - Overall they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love these exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li> I really love these gloves because they make every shower a spa experience.</li>
            <li> I was so excited I gifted to pair to friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I love how well these gloves lather and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> These piqued my interest and I&#x27;m quite glad that I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these - durable, handy for washing up, comfortable.. not so exfoliating</li>
            <li> Love these gloves.</li>
            <li> Love these gloves.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to shower and clean up well.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel tingly and very clean after each use.</li>
            <li> this will keep you looking young and with a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> They allow for excellent build up of suds and maintain it for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> These make exfoliating easy and much more efficient than using a brush.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re in and out of shower in no time, so easy to use with your favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> Some had free shipping some charged more for shipping than what the gloves cost.</li>
            <li> I enjoy tuning these gloves, as they provide a refreshing tingle after use.</li>
            <li> but they fit okay.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, yet still have great exfoliating power.</li>
            <li> This product is good for all over your body, but I noticed these were the two places it really shined.</li>
            <li> Top notch quality and very worth the price.</li>
            <li> I finally started using these instead of a puff, WAAAY better and work great as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on and take off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of using a glove because you can really clean and exfoliate well with it.</li>
            <li> keeps the body clean for sure.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy take it easy washing your balls with these things.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect - not flimsy or cheaply made, and not too rough.</li>
            <li> I always feel so smooth and clean after using them!</li>
            <li> I love the maneuverability of lathering with my full dexterity, combined with the exfoliating power of the loofa.</li>
            <li> Some of the fine wrinkles on my face are gone too.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> but these gloves fit me just fine.</li>
            <li> I have huge hands (not freakishly so)</li>
            <li> These gloves really work well, they remove all the sunscreen after swimming, and kind of help wake you up in the morning.</li>
            <li> They fit and do not slide off.</li>
            <li> these gloves are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that I gave one pair to my sister in law and one to a friend for them to try.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they confirmed that it is 4 gloves.</li>
            <li> Up until now, I&#x27;d been buying cheap body gloves.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great gentle exfoliator, although I do notice that I go through bar soap much faster with these around.</li>
            <li> My whole body now is super smooth and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliation, last a long time, machine washable, great price, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean, smooth, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> First off, wash cloths and bamboo scrubbers (which I DID love) begin to mold and smell no matter</li>
            <li> They perform great and fit my hand snuggly, unlike all the other gloves I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use it with a rich, moisturizing coconut scented body was and it exfoliates nicely and leaves my skin soft afterward.</li>
            <li> Just right!</li>
            <li> I have to say that my skin has never felt this smooth before &amp; it was already pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love the way they really work on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Good basic exfoliating  gloves.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE these so much.</li>
            <li> Great gloves, plenty big, good and rough but won&#x27;t scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> I use the old pair to clean tubs and sinks - works great for that too!</li>
            <li> They certainly do the trick, gently but effectively</li>
            <li> I will keep this company as a favorite in order to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Many times better than regular drugstore types.</li>
            <li> My package came quickly.  </li>
            <li> The gloves are well made, and will last while,  plus you get 4 pairs even better!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin or itchiness, but I like to exfoliate regularly so my skin looks its best, and self-tanner won&#x27;t look patchy.  </li>
            <li> But, I can only imagine how wonderful these must feel to someone with dry and/or itchy skin!</li>
            <li> These gloves are great to exfoliate dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Like others said, these things get rid of a lot of dead skins cells and leave your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far :)</li>
            <li> 100% worth the exfoliation, though.</li>
            <li> I cannot stop using this and it has helped my skin to look more radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a shower puff kind of gal but after hearing that these help prior to sunless tanning</li>
            <li> Well worth their cost. -</li>
            <li> right frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just right basically.  </li>
            <li> Make exfoliating simple and painless and do a much better job than a wash cloth (little more abrasive / effective).  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more form fitting shower glove that&#x27;s slightly thinner.</li>
            <li> They are a nice dark green shade so a bit more manly than purple but also fit much better on his hands.</li>
            <li> although a good rinse in the shower is all that is typically required.</li>
            <li> My hands are pretty large but the material is stretchy enough that my wife can also use her own pair.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find a great pair of exfoliating gloves</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad that I finally did.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need four pair at once, as the last pair lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I am using these as the first process in a sunless tanning session</li>
            <li> Nice texture, not overly rough...</li>
            <li> Better yet, when they finally do wear out, save them them for household scrubbing chores.</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning in the shower a breeze, first pair is still holding up after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exfoliating gloves for more than a decade and never looked back to wash cloths or bamboo scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy these again as I bought them because they&#x27;re more generously made than the ones I have now (which I&#x27;ve had for several years already).  </li>
            <li> It comes in a pack of 8 which is more than enough for the while family..</li>
            <li> Just got them; will write more later after they have been used for awhile.</li>
            <li> I used it them yesterday morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Since you are using your &#x27;hands&#x27; it is easy to apply what ever pressure you want to your own skin and to get to hard to reach places.      </li>
            <li> You get a great value for your money, and it should last you a long time!!.</li>
            <li> These are great and last a long time, and allow you to shower much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though, great value for four pairs of gloves.</li>
            <li> I know these clean my skin and help keep it clear.  </li>
            <li> conscious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these as an early Father&#x27;s Day present and my husband was thrilled.</li>
            <li> some of the reviews were too positive...</li>
            <li> and they come out fresh and new.</li>
            <li> I had to add a loop to be able to hang them  to dry.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with relatively large hands, but not that large.</li>
            <li> Also compared to other stores I&#x27;ve checked, as usual, Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone but men in particular who want to be thorough in grooming but not have giggling wives!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for any one that works hard and works up a good sweat.  </li>
            <li> The gloves are amazing for the skin and getting rid of dead skin and exfoliating the face neck and body</li>
            <li> I found one cheap pair (local store) that worked very well</li>
            <li> They do the job very well</li>
            <li> Very well-made gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are comfortable and they make a difference in your skin if you use them on a regular basis (followed by moisturizing your skin)</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that they wore out in about 2 weeks they were lavender and white and barely fit onto his hands.  </li>
            <li> it REALLY lathers exfoliate.</li>
            <li> They exfoliate very well and are much easier than a loufa.</li>
            <li> I use one for the body and a separate one for the face (with much lighter pressure).</li>
            <li> They are very scratchy</li>
            <li> Oh I really do like these gloves.</li>
            <li> Very well made... Works very well</li>
            <li> These work really well for exfoliating my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to wash up with these too.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> I even use it to gently exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I use them on my whole body including my face and my skin</li>
            <li> is MUCH smoother.</li>
            <li> My clients really like this before I begin a massage</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend them!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do as much for ingrown hairs as I thought it would, but then again I was expecting a miracle</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Over all I was very please with the product.</li>
            <li> It wors very well to exfoliate skin</li>
            <li> I do really like these gloves.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rather porous, in that it won&#x27;t hold on to soap very well.</li>
            <li> highly recommend buying these gloves!</li>
            <li> I never actually used any kind of loofah or gloves when I am taking a shower, but now I can&#x27;t get enough of these things.</li>
            <li> They not only exfoliate the body they also clean my tub very well.</li>
            <li> Plus, the 4-pack is extra economical!</li>
            <li> I use them daily and, as long as you&#x27;re gentle and don&#x27;t scrub yourself raw, they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> could have been rougher, if you&#x27;re looking for something really strong don&#x27;t buy these, but otherwise they&#x27;re great for less serious use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long preferred the use of my hands when bathing, but this has required the use of abrasive soaps (such as [[ASIN:B000BPB3E6 Gojo Orange]]) to be effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re all familiar with the slight rigamorole necessary to lather up a wash clothe, then keep it centered on your hand while you wash.</li>
            <li> I usually buy whatever I can find at Walmart, and that&#x27;s usually fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li> They are thick, hold their shape and texture, go through the washing machine just fine, and still are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> No more washcloths, no more loofahs, the best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li> I used these with some homemade sugarscrub and left my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t care very much for washcloths or poufs is that it&#x27;s difficult to get good contact for vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li> They are not too rough not too smooth.</li>
            <li> If you want a simple, easy, low time solution this is the one.</li>
            <li> A new pair lasts me about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Humorous for me but not very effective or cost</li>
            <li> The gloves rinse out and dry quickly when I leave it on the sink or the edge of the shower.  </li>
            <li> They last long, are easy to rinse and keep sanitized.  </li>
            <li> I have had them for awhile and they have held up to frequent uses!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Love the four pack, can give to other family members or store for later use</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes the glove type for exfoliating, so much easier than the sponges or scrunched net type of scrubber!</li>
            <li> The green is fine.</li>
            <li> Love to use these after a hard days work in the yard.</li>
            <li> They are rough enough that a couple of norlmal light strokes is all you need</li>
            <li> neither are they too soft.</li>
            <li> Soft on your skin, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Made my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li> skin feels really soft after showering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use them prior to waxing or shaving and it allows the hair to be removed much easier</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the prices were wildly inconsistent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I would have preferred the natural color.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something soft and luxurious-feeling, you&#x27;re going to be in for a shock: these things hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have sensitive skin, but they feel like steel wool.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Really, they&#x27;re almost a revelation from the ones you get at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> At least, they haven&#x27;t fallen off my hands yet. :)</li>
            <li> these gloves exfoliate very well not too harsh not too soft just right</li>
            <li> In less than a week, all of the dry skin was gone, and my legs looked so much better.</li>
            <li> I like using the glove over a loofah which is easier for me when doing a quick scrub down.</li>
            <li> They are not as rough as some cheaper gloves I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but they do the exfoliating job nicely.</li>
            <li> and I find with this brand that although it&#x27;s fine for larger smooth surfaces like arms and legs, it&#x27;s a little difficult to clean around the folds of my ears and in between my toes.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel much cleaner, less time to wash, I use two, and they rinse out fast.</li>
            <li> At first I thought these things were a bit rough, but that was just because I never used anything</li>
            <li> at first try I thought these were a bit rough but then realized if I didn&#x27;t scrub at my body like I&#x27;m cleaning the shower &amp; eased up on my touch</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin even with daily use and I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These gloves did just that, and with a bit of use they become soft enough to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I feel way cleaner using these with a liquid body wash than I did before (bare hands and a bar of soap).</li>
            <li> I could only find these really soft ones.</li>
            <li> Absolutely takes the impurities out of the skin, removing pimples and other impurities.  </li>
            <li> they are very rough so that they really get the job</li>
            <li> Rough enough for me but not too much for her.</li>
            <li> The first time i used these i could not believe the amount of dead skin it took off.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying bath products that just fall apart or stretch out or dont completely rinse out clean...</li>
            <li> I spend like half as much time in the shower.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter has extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I got no complaint, except I have noticed that these gloves seem to have lost color and turned pink-ish due to my body wash.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, a little too thick and bulky for me.</li>
            <li> When I first started using them, my legs were a little dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> It seriously eliminates ALL of your dead skin cells and leaves your skin as soft and smooth as humanly possible.  </li>
            <li> It seriously eliminates ALL of your dead skin cells and leaves your skin as soft and smooth as humanly possible.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the first pair I opened was already torn a bit in the crease between the thumb and pointer (on both gloves.)</li>
            <li> This is completely normal, and the fact that it comes in 4 pairs (8 gloves) make them last for like a a year and a half!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t last as long or work as well.  </li>
            <li> Only wish it had a sewn on loop to hang them up on a hook to dry.</li>
            <li> The forest green color is nicely non-threatening for a man to use, too, though I think you may be showering wrong if a lot of people get to see the color of your washing device of choice.</li>
            <li> a  dark skin African American and in the process of skin bleaching my skin.</li>
            <li> IF you looking for a staple product that will take all the dead skins off and leave you with a clear skin, this is IT.It</li>
            <li> I never really exfoliated prior to ordering the Earth Therapeutics Glove.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of other exfoliating products but have never had one that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I also have a condition which produces an excess of dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> These are not at all like the a previous purchase under the same brand name...</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I realized that the actual luffa breaks down and falls apart in a short amount of time and its not easy to manage</li>
            <li> Not too soft not too hard.</li>
            <li> Im actually thinking about ditching using a washcloth and using this when i shower everyday.</li>
            <li> Material is rough, but won&#x27;t shred your skin.</li>
            <li> (the gloves) not scratchy and with minimal pressure on my skin they made it glow.</li>
            <li> Not like the ones at the local pharmacy that disiningrate after a few showers.</li>
            <li> But it was shipped after the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I got what was expected.  </li>
            <li> Keeps its structure when wet</li>
            <li> being said, they go on easier if you get them wet before trying to put them on.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long this pair will last or if the other pairs are also damaged.</li>
            <li> In other words, 8 gloves.</li>
            <li> Just before this purchase I had tried some other brands/styles that just didn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with other products from Earth Therapeutics and have never had any issues.</li>
            <li> While acne at 16 is somewhat expected, acne at 30 is just down</li>
            <li> They are also thick enough to seem high quality, but not so thick that the soap gets lost (you glove wearers know what I&#x27;m talking about!).</li>
            <li> I did a dry rub before using it in the shower and you can see the dead skin</li>
            <li> It does feel rough but lets face it, it is suppose to be rough in order to get that dead skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over a dry body brush to move lymph, remove dead skin and prepare the skin to absorb the massage cream or oil.  </li>
            <li> a little rough.</li>
            <li> I work so hard that I feel like I have a second layer of skin on me.  </li>
            <li> Even though its fun it could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> When putting them on they will hang-up on dry flaky skin and or small hang nails.</li>
            <li> I have a little than larger average hand size (know what I mean ladies, wink, wink, nudge, nudge)</li>
            <li> I use Black soap Honey Almond Butter.</li>
            <li> I use a lot less soap with these gloves too and can exfoliate all of my skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to get to aggressive with them as they can burn the skin if you rub too long or too hard.</li>
            <li> I chose these one because i wanted the dark colored green or black ones they are boasting in their picture.</li>
            <li> Put them on in the shower, add a little body wash, and rub away.  </li>
            <li> They are not worth anything!</li>
            <li> they are a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> you will get a little redness.</li>
            <li> Hard to take off when wet and hoping it holds together.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> That speaks volume because those gloves took all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the dead skin cells and make your skin appear brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of product for a few years now</li>
            <li> I bought a $2 pair of wash gloves from Target a few months ago</li>
            <li> I really disliked the idea of going to the post office to pick up some shower gloves.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed at the dirt and dead skin</li>
            <li> Work wonders takes all my dead skin off my body with one wash up</li>
            <li> and this helped to remove my dead skin without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> My poor Cleanlogic gloves finally wore out</li>
            <li> These are not huge gloves, but they&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> these are very thin; you can purchase the same quality on an auction site for less than $1 per pair.</li>
            <li> But when they arrive they sent me sea foam green, baby blue and pink wtf!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I never purchased them before</li>
            <li> Not sure how they found the balance.</li>
            <li> They are not too hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m by no means delicate but</li>
            <li> So I would rate this a 5 star for performance but a big disappointment in the quality (hopefully it was just the one pair that snuck through QC)</li>
            <li> so I will continue to use this product at at least once a week.</li>
            <li> SLOWLY</li>
            <li> ; What the heck does that mean??</li>
            <li> I have very small hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> But I was skeptical about this one because 1)</li>
            <li> almost cult-like so I was skeptical and 2)</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Dead skin is rather evil when it comes to me and if I don&#x27;t use these gloves at least once a week</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re uncomfortable like others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I hate the ones in the store.</li>
            <li> Beats those worthless ones at the dollar store.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice gloves... Feels good...</li>
            <li> These gloves make my skin feel so smooth! They are not too hard neither are they too soft. They do the job very well</li>
            <li> I ordered these gloves, so that I could use them to exfoliate before I got a spray tan. When I first started using them, my legs were a little dry and scaly. In less than a week, all of the dry skin was gone, and my legs looked so much better. I will make sure to keep these on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> These are the best exfoliating gloves I&#x27;ve ever used - been using them for over 8 years now.  They last long, are easy to rinse and keep sanitized.  I love the way they really work on my skin.  I used them every day in the shower and never leave home without them!</li>
            <li> Color not so pretty but still a great product.</li>
            <li> Very well-made gloves. Soft on your skin, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I use only 1 and it lasts for 1-3 months until is starts to break a part. This is completely normal, and the fact that it comes in 4 pairs (8 gloves) make them last for like a a year and a half!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Made my skin soooo soft. I&#x27;m obsessed. I use it everyday in the shower. :) Will keep buying forever.</li>
            <li> I love love love these gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels really soft after showering.&lt;br /&gt;I use them prior to waxing or shaving and it allows the hair to be removed much easier</li>
            <li> These are not at all like the a previous purchase under the same brand name... these are very thin; you can purchase the same quality on an auction site for less than $1 per pair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice buy. you will no longer need any body scrubs! I even use it on my face! It scrubs off the dead skin cells very well.   this will keep you looking young and with a beautiful skin. Guys and Girls, do your body a favor and buy one of these gloves.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I am not sure why I never purchased them before but I am hooked now.  I was searching for some body scrub or a loofah...and these came up.  I am glad I made the switch.  It&#x27;s a simple product, just a glove with a sort of coarse texture.  Put them on in the shower, add a little body wash, and rub away.  It seriously eliminates ALL of your dead skin cells and leaves your skin as soft and smooth as humanly possible.  I only use it once every week or two - that&#x27;s all it takes.    Also this is such a bargain on Amazon...four packs.  I&#x27;ve only opened one and I don&#x27;t see a need to open the others anytime soon!    Buy these now!!!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin even with daily use and I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great product. No stretch like ones you buy from target!</li>
            <li> I remember when Bath and Body Works came out with these gloves. For some reason they stopped making them and I was so hurt. These gloves are better than what they had on the market. That speaks volume because those gloves took all the dead skin off. I love the fact that these came with four pair. I hate the ones in the store. They are not worth anything! It is hard to find a great pair of exfoliating gloves but I am so glad that I finally did. These work great. I will keep this company as a favorite in order to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Great if you want to exfoliate in the shower. These make exfoliating easy and much more efficient than using a brush.</li>
            <li> I chose these one because i wanted the dark colored green or black ones they are boasting in their picture. im a guy.  But when they arrive they sent me sea foam green, baby blue and pink wtf! Anyway they are sturdy and they work well. No rips or unraveling after mk ths of regular use</li>
            <li> This is my second order of these gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable and they make a difference in your skin if you use them on a regular basis (followed by moisturizing your skin)</li>
            <li> Omg i am so in love with these gloves. Im a  dark skin African American and in the process of skin bleaching my skin. I only use Kojoc Acid skin bleaching soap which i purchased from this site. I also use bleaching creams on my skin. My skin has gotten lighter, smoother and brighter. I would recommend this even if you arent skin bleaching. It gets rid of the dead skin cells and make your skin appear brighter. Im actually thinking about ditching using a washcloth and using this when i shower everyday. So happy i got these!!</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating gloves. You get three pair, all packaged individually, so you can give some away if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use with an exfoliant, or without. Material is rough, but won&#x27;t shred your skin. Good quality and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to exfoliate your skin. Just slip these babies on and go to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Recently my husband has been trying to combat his acne. While acne at 16 is somewhat expected, acne at 30 is just down right frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;He had purchased a pair of exfoliating gloves from a local store. Besides the fact that they wore out in about 2 weeks they were lavender and white and barely fit onto his hands.  Humorous for me but not very effective or cost conscious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these as an early Father&#x27;s Day present and my husband was thrilled. He was a bit startled to find out one should actually WASH the gloves on occasion but with this being a 4 pack he is still not without a pair in the shower. They are a nice dark green shade so a bit more manly than purple but also fit much better on his hands. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone but men in particular who want to be thorough in grooming but not have giggling wives!</li>
            <li> Gloves appear to be good quality.  I didn&#x27;t need four pair at once, as the last pair lasted for many years.  The color is nice for men or women, appear to be good quality.  I&#x27;ll see how they hold up and report back in the future.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and I am using these as the first process in a sunless tanning session and they work and feel great!!</li>
            <li> They are not too rough not too smooth. Many times better than regular drugstore types. Perfect for exfoliation when combined with a good quality scrub.</li>
            <li> I did not receive gloves in the color shown in the image.</li>
            <li> These are not huge gloves, but they&#x27;ll do. I&#x27;m a woman with relatively large hands, but not that large. They are not as rough as some cheaper gloves I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but they do the exfoliating job nicely. You do need to rinse them thoroughly between uses.</li>
            <li> Love this got it sooner then I thought! it REALLY lathers exfoliate. I did a dry rub before using it in the shower and you can see the dead skin</li>
            <li> Great gloves and good price</li>
            <li> girlfriend was please. that is all.</li>
            <li> These are awesome exfoliating gloves! I have had them for awhile and they have held up to frequent uses! Nice texture, not overly rough... I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes the glove type for exfoliating, so much easier than the sponges or scrunched net type of scrubber!</li>
            <li> These gloves really work well, they remove all the sunscreen after swimming, and kind of help wake you up in the morning. These fit perfectly. I have a little than larger average hand size (know what I mean ladies, wink, wink, nudge, nudge) Seriously though, great value for four pairs of gloves. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are especially great for your feet and in between your toes. Also, they&#x27;re especially great for the back. This product is good for all over your body, but I noticed these were the two places it really shined. Being able to feel every finger allows you to exfoliate in every nook and cranny on your body. You get three pairs in a package, as well. Good quality, good value. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife actually found these ones on Amazon, and ordered them for me.  It seriously eliminates ALL of your dead skin cells and leaves your skin as soft and smooth as humanly possible. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating gloves I&#x27;ve used. The dollar-store ones don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shower gloves for years. These are the best I have used yet. they are a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to and I like that.</li>
            <li> I finally started using these instead of a puff, WAAAY better and work great as an exfoliant.  Def. re-fill order!</li>
            <li> No more washcloths, no more loofahs, the best of both worlds.  These are great and last a long time, and allow you to shower much quicker.  Put em on, soap them up and go.  Exfoliates while it cleans.  Better yet, when they finally do wear out, save them them for household scrubbing chores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re all familiar with the slight rigamorole necessary to lather up a wash clothe, then keep it centered on your hand while you wash. This eliminates that hassel. Put them on, scrub away, take off. Pow.</li>
            <li> I love these. They exfoliate very well and are much easier than a loufa. I use one for the body and a separate one for the face (with much lighter pressure).</li>
            <li> This gives you the perfect body scrub. You&#x27;re in and out of shower in no time, so easy to use with your favorite body wash. I would pair it with exfoliating back scrubber though.</li>
            <li> MY FAV!!! Washcloths are obsolete in my home. I will never use anything else but these. Find a good exfoliating soap and it makes your skin all the more cleaner. I use Black soap Honey Almond Butter.</li>
            <li> Great gloves. My wife and I both use them. Rough enough for me but not too much for her. Just right basically.  I throw them in the laundry just as I would a wash cloth and they come out fresh and new. I would not recommend a clothes dryer. If you rub a spot more than a couple of strokes you will get a little redness. That&#x27;s why I like these. They are rough enough that a couple of norlmal light strokes is all you need but, you can scrub deep too for that localized redness and deep/thorough exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I realized that the actual luffa breaks down and falls apart in a short amount of time and its not easy to manage and I could never get my back thoroughly. I even tried a luffa mitt and it fell apart. I was looking for some type of glove if possible, didn&#x27;t know if it even existed. Found these and they are great, plus you get 4 pairs. I use a lot less soap with these gloves too and can exfoliate all of my skin. They are very scratchy so you feel they are doing a good job.</li>
            <li> The first time i used these i could not believe the amount of dead skin it took off. I used these with some homemade sugarscrub and left my skin smooth and soft.  It does feel rough but lets face it, it is suppose to be rough in order to get that dead skin.</li>
            <li> Bought for me and for my daughter and sister...</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have sensitive skin. I thought I&#x27;d try the gloves on my face and wasn&#x27;t sure what the result would be.  They&#x27;re  (the gloves) not scratchy and with minimal pressure on my skin they made it glow.</li>
            <li> I have thought several brands of these gloves. These are by far the best I have found. They are thick, hold their shape and texture, go through the washing machine just fine, and still are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Oh I really do like these gloves. I use it with a rich, moisturizing coconut scented body was and it exfoliates nicely and leaves my skin soft afterward. I like using the glove over a loofah which is easier for me when doing a quick scrub down. I like the rejuvenating feeling it gives me (probably would be great with some mint body wash in the mornings to wake up).  :-)  The gloves rinse out and dry quickly when I leave it on the sink or the edge of the shower.  Because there was 4 to the pack I am putting two of the pairs in my mom&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s Christmas stocking (and added benefit since I&#x27;ll still have a spare pair).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, a little too thick and bulky for me. I&#x27;ve used this type of product for a few years now and I find with this brand that although it&#x27;s fine for larger smooth surfaces like arms and legs, it&#x27;s a little difficult to clean around the folds of my ears and in between my toes. I prefer a more form fitting shower glove that&#x27;s slightly thinner. They&#x27;re also a bit scratchier than I like.</li>
            <li> Very well made... Works very well</li>
            <li> These work really well for exfoliating my arms and legs.  They fit and do not slide off.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great to exfoliate dead skin cells.  Since you are using your &#x27;hands&#x27; it is easy to apply what ever pressure you want to your own skin and to get to hard to reach places.      A new pair lasts me about 6 months.  I use the old pair to clean tubs and sinks - works great for that too!</li>
            <li> Really effective. My skin feels smoother already after 3 uses. It&#x27;s much easier to wash up with these too. I spend like half as much time in the shower.</li>
            <li> Good basic exfoliating  gloves. Good fit.. Easy to put on and take off in the shower. Nice to have 4 in a pack.</li>
            <li> These are great for exfoliating! No complaints so far :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly working outside so it&#x27;s nice to shower and clean up well. These gloves did just that, and with a bit of use they become soft enough to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Great for the shower, perfect for exfoliation with your favorite body wash, great price for the durability of the this product.</li>
            <li> these gloves are fantastic. they are very rough so that they really get the job done./ I liked them so much that I gave one pair to my sister in law and one to a friend for them to try.</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning in the shower a breeze, first pair is still holding up after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li> I love these gloves; I have made them a staple in my beauty routine. They make me feel refreshed, and my entire skin tingles after using them. The price was superb. I have recommended them to all my family and friends, and now I recommend them to you. Get these gloves you won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought a $2 pair of wash gloves from Target a few months ago but I didn&#x27;t really like it so I stopped using it. So I thought I would step up to a better quality glove. I love the idea of using a glove because you can really clean and exfoliate well with it. But I was skeptical about this one because 1) some of the reviews were too positive...almost cult-like so I was skeptical and 2) the prices were wildly inconsistent. For example, I found one glove for $12 and I found one pair for $13. Some had free shipping some charged more for shipping than what the gloves cost. What&#x27;s up? This manufacturer needs to get its act together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I found this offer which says &amp;#34;1 pair (pack of 4).&amp;#34; What the heck does that mean?? I contacted the seller and they confirmed that it is 4 gloves. Wrong. When I got the shipment, it was actually 4 PAIR of gloves. In other words, 8 gloves. SCORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, with all that confusion out of the way...I have to say that these gloves are AWESOME! Shop around to get a good deal because, as I said, prices are all over the place. You will LOVE these gloves. It exfoliates and scrubs so well. I feel way cleaner using these with a liquid body wash than I did before (bare hands and a bar of soap). Give me a break. I&#x27;m a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would have preferred the natural color. But whatever. The green is fine. What matters is that these do a GREAT job cleaning. I even use it to gently exfoliate my face. It&#x27;s like what I imagine it&#x27;s like getting a facial. I don&#x27;t know. I never got a facial.</li>
            <li> They work fantastically. I&#x27;ve only used them twice and my perpetual bacne is already waaaay reduced. But if you&#x27;re looking for something soft and luxurious-feeling, you&#x27;re going to be in for a shock: these things hurt like hell. Granted, I have sensitive skin, but they feel like steel wool. 100% worth the exfoliation, though.</li>
            <li> keeps the body clean for sure.  I have one for the shower and another for my face when I domt shave.</li>
            <li> Very good product I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The gloves work great.  I didn&#x27;t expect to get so many.  My skin and a youthful texture after using the gloves.</li>
            <li> Very good product, family members, enjoy them :-)</li>
            <li> I never actually used any kind of loofah or gloves when I am taking a shower, but now I can&#x27;t get enough of these things. At first I thought these things were a bit rough, but that was just because I never used anything but my naked hands to wash my body. Like others said, these things get rid of a lot of dead skins cells and leave your skin feeling great. I got no complaint, except I have noticed that these gloves seem to have lost color and turned pink-ish due to my body wash. This does not bother me so it is not a complain, but more of an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I got to say is give these gloves a try. I did and I am very happy about it.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying bath products that just fall apart or stretch out or dont completely rinse out clean...so I decided to give these a shot.  I have to say that my skin has never felt this smooth before &amp; it was already pretty smooth.  I had to get used to actually using my hands to wash myself instead of holding a loofah or sponge, but that wasnt a big deal.  I have the feeling if you have real sensitive skin, the scratchiness of the material may irritate, but I am very happy with mine &amp; so glad it came with 4 pair...I am set for a while!</li>
            <li> Very nice. They can give you a good scrubbing and leave skin softer.</li>
            <li> These things are GREAT! I use them every day in the shower.  My skin feels so much smoother.  The exfoliating effect has even lightened the age spots and moles on my arms.  Some of the fine wrinkles on my face are gone too. They are somewhat &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s part of the treatment.</li>
            <li> These are the nicest bath gloves I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself, but when my sister-in-law came to visit I gave her the gloves for her family whom she said loves them because they also get a massage while washing! Not to mention the convenience. :-)  I&#x27;ve been using exfoliating gloves for more than a decade and never looked back to wash cloths or bamboo scrubbers.  First off, wash cloths and bamboo scrubbers (which I DID love) begin to mold and smell no matter how well one rinses, squeezes and/or leaves out to air;  especially when I moved to an apartment whose bathroom was teeny-tiny and almost airless.  I&#x27;m going to buy these again as I bought them because they&#x27;re more generously made than the ones I have now (which I&#x27;ve had for several years already).  So, yeah, gonna buy again.</li>
            <li> It was great to get a good number of this wonderful gloves for a sweet price.&lt;br /&gt;These gloves are wonderful for getting that full body clean that most cloths can&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These  are wonderful.  I had to add a loop to be able to hang them  to dry.  Aside from that detail they are perfect.  I use them on my whole body including my face and my skin is MUCH smoother.</li>
            <li> Love these gloves.  Make exfoliating simple and painless and do a much better job than a wash cloth (little more abrasive / effective).  They are safe for the washing machine (so I&#x27;ve heard) although a good rinse in the shower is all that is typically required.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliation. Love the four pack, can give to other family members or store for later use</li>
            <li> I had not used exfoliating gloves before I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I did get four PAIRS - total eight gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again if these wear out.</li>
            <li> These gloves are awesome! They have a sturdy &amp;#34;get the job done&amp;#34; sort of feel to them. I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with exfoliating gloves and let me tell you that these are marvelous! I cannot stop using this and it has helped my skin to look more radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> very effective. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great to use on my massage clients.  I prefer this over a dry body brush to move lymph, remove dead skin and prepare the skin to absorb the massage cream or oil.  My clients really like this before I begin a massage</li>
            <li> Very happy with these gloves. You don&#x27;t want to get to aggressive with them as they can burn the skin if you rub too long or too hard. Love to use these after a hard days work in the yard. They are especially relaxing on the feet. Very happy with purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see that each pack had two gloves in it. They are very good quality. I enjoy tuning these gloves, as they provide a refreshing tingle after use. Skin feels clean, smooth, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> OMG thank you for this! These were just what I needed. Dead skin is rather evil when it comes to me and if I don&#x27;t use these gloves at least once a week I look like an ashy monster! These are great for my face as well.</li>
            <li> a little rough. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. Very durable. Not like the ones at the local pharmacy that disiningrate after a few showers. These are built to last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a shower puff kind of gal but after hearing that these help prior to sunless tanning I thought I&#x27;d give then a go &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m by no means delicate but at first try I thought these were a bit rough but then realized if I didn&#x27;t scrub at my body like I&#x27;m cleaning the shower &amp; eased up on my touch they were perfect.  I do think they make a difference in my skin &amp; I use them almost daily.  Also compared to other stores I&#x27;ve checked, as usual, Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> These gloves are an excellent way to exfoliate. I use them with moisturizing body wash before applying FakeBake Flawless self-tanner. Because they are gloves, you have excellent control over the intensity of exfoliating. My 9 year old daughter has extremely dry skin and she uses her own pair of these when she bathes.</li>
            <li> The gloves are amazing for the skin and getting rid of dead skin and exfoliating the face neck and body</li>
            <li> These are great exfoliation gloves.  I work so hard that I feel like I have a second layer of skin on me.  I know these clean my skin and help keep it clear.  The gloves are well made, and will last while,  plus you get 4 pairs even better!  I recommend this product for any one that works hard and works up a good sweat.  Perfect gloves.gloves</li>
            <li> These work SUPER great. Wish I had discovered them years ago. Your skin will feel much cleaner, less time to wash, I use two, and they rinse out fast. Saves shower time, &#x3D; $$$. Much much better than a hand cloth. Well worth their cost. - - The downside. When putting them on they will hang-up on dry flaky skin and or small hang nails. Remember to remove jewelry with chains BEFORE putting on gloves, or they WILL cling like flypaper. - - Overall they are wonderful. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After reading an XO Jane article about getting a smoother bum and these were mentioned I bought them and haven&#x27;t looked back. My whole body now is super smooth and I love it!</li>
            <li> I just LOVE these so much.</li>
            <li> Feels SO good!  I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin or itchiness, but I like to exfoliate regularly so my skin looks its best, and self-tanner won&#x27;t look patchy.  But, I can only imagine how wonderful these must feel to someone with dry and/or itchy skin! I highly reccomend them!</li>
            <li> IF you looking for a staple product that will take all the dead skins off and leave you with a clear skin, this is IT.It is a must Have. You get a great value for your money, and it should last you a long time!!. I gave my mom and sis a pair and they are in love with it!!</li>
            <li> I love these exfoliating gloves. They not only exfoliate the body they also clean my tub very well. I ordered extra gloves to have them for both jobs. They work great.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a mitt rather than the clove.  Hard to take off when wet and hoping it holds together.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great! I always feel so smooth and clean after using them! Didn&#x27;t do as much for ingrown hairs as I thought it would, but then again I was expecting a miracle haha. I even recommend getting this four pack, since it&#x27;s best to change them out every 3 or so months.</li>
            <li> Absolutely takes the impurities out of the skin, removing pimples and other impurities.  If you want a simple, easy, low time solution this is the one.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  But it was shipped after the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Just before this purchase I had tried some other brands/styles that just didn&#x27;t cut it.  They didn&#x27;t last as long or work as well.  I think these are very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> these gloves exfoliate very well not too harsh not too soft just right</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. Excellent deal for 4 pairs of them.  Shipped fast. Must have item.</li>
            <li> My package came quickly.  I got what was expected.  I&#x27;m happy. :)</li>
            <li> Great gloves, plenty big, good and rough but won&#x27;t scratch your skin. Beats those worthless ones at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating gloves is where it is at and these ones work good. Top notch quality and very worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Keeps its structure when wet so you get a good scrub and does not slide off your hand</li>
            <li> I use these in my shower and they do a grear job of exfoliating.  Just  throw in the wash with your towels</li>
            <li> Over all I was very please with the product. However, I don&#x27;t know why the shipper made me go to the Post Office to get to sign for the package. I really disliked the idea of going to the post office to pick up some shower gloves.</li>
            <li> AMAZING GLOVES. If you&#x27;re a guy take it easy washing your balls with these things. Even though its fun it could be dangerous. SLOWLY and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Not too soft not too hard. Just right! It comes in a pack of 8 which is more than enough for the while family..</li>
            <li> I really love these gloves because they make every shower a spa experience. You will be amazed at the dirt and dead skin this stuff gets off your body when you use it. I am a believer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these gloves! I was so excited I gifted to pair to friends! These are an awesome alternative to loofas, which almost seem wimpy with how clean I feel after using these! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Yep, I&#x27;m a guy.  I also have a condition which produces an excess of dry, flaky skin.  I&#x27;ve used various scrub gloves for several years now but these are by far the best.  They&#x27;re not the cheapest, but the strength and thickness are beyond anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Really, they&#x27;re almost a revelation from the ones you get at the local drug store.  I use them daily and, as long as you&#x27;re gentle and don&#x27;t scrub yourself raw, they are wonderful.  My hands are pretty large but the material is stretchy enough that my wife can also use her own pair.  The forest green color is nicely non-threatening for a man to use, too, though I think you may be showering wrong if a lot of people get to see the color of your washing device of choice.</li>
            <li> These gloves work well to exfoliate your skin. They arrived on time. I&#x27;ve used them for years and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Work wonders takes all my dead skin off my body with one wash up</li>
            <li> These are the best exfoliating gloves I have ever had.  I love them, they are perfect and I love to have one for each hand so I do not have to be changing from hand to hand.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better product to use in the bath and shower, for exfoliating or just to clean up, its great!</li>
            <li> I love how well these gloves lather and exfoliate. They work beautifully. My only complaint is that the first pair I opened was already torn a bit in the crease between the thumb and pointer (on both gloves.) Not sure how long this pair will last or if the other pairs are also damaged. So I would rate this a 5 star for performance but a big disappointment in the quality (hopefully it was just the one pair that snuck through QC)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!!! As you read the product info, you always wonder if products like this are what they describe them as.  This one is.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of other exfoliating products but have never had one that actually worked. Your skin will feel tingly and very clean after each use. We have used one pair for about 3 weeks now and they show no signs of needing replaced. I bought these in conjusction with an epilator to stop in grown hairs and they WORK!!!</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.  I have used this glove for several months and it has kept its shape and resiliency.  It wors very well to exfoliate skin and it doesn&#x27;t become mildewy like a face cloth.</li>
            <li> I do really like these gloves. I have very small hands so they could be a bit smaller but they fit okay. At least, they haven&#x27;t fallen off my hands yet. :)</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product. I have very dry skin and this helped to remove my dead skin without being too harsh. Cleaning the gloves were also very easy.</li>
            <li> could have been rougher, if you&#x27;re looking for something really strong don&#x27;t buy these, but otherwise they&#x27;re great for less serious use</li>
            <li> My poor Cleanlogic gloves finally wore out so I decided to try something different.  These exfoliating gloves aren&#x27;t as scratchy as Cleanlogic, but they get the job done.  If you&#x27;re looking for a hammam scrub-down, go with Cleanlogic.  If you want a more mild exfoliation, you&#x27;ll probably be happy with these.  I have huge hands (not freakishly so) but these gloves fit me just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long preferred the use of my hands when bathing, but this has required the use of abrasive soaps (such as [[ASIN:B000BPB3E6 Gojo Orange]]) to be effective. The reason I didn&#x27;t care very much for washcloths or poufs is that it&#x27;s difficult to get good contact for vigorous scrubbing. These piqued my interest and I&#x27;m quite glad that I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, they go on easier if you get them wet before trying to put them on. They&#x27;re rather porous, in that it won&#x27;t hold on to soap very well. The bright side is that means it washes out easily. I see myself buying these regularly.</li>
            <li> Very well made and work perfectly!!!  Only wish it had a sewn on loop to hang them up on a hook to dry.</li>
            <li> Ever since a friend suggested using loofa gloves 6 years ago, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since. I love the maneuverability of lathering with my full dexterity, combined with the exfoliating power of the loofa. I usually buy whatever I can find at Walmart, and that&#x27;s usually fine, nothing special. My wife actually found these ones on Amazon, and ordered them for me. I absolutely love them! They are so soft, yet still have great exfoliating power. Not sure how they found the balance. They are also thick enough to seem high quality, but not so thick that the soap gets lost (you glove wearers know what I&#x27;m talking about!). I don&#x27;t need to use extra soap to compensate for using gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying these gloves! Plus, the 4-pack is extra economical! (note: 4-pack means 4 gloves, not 4 pairs)</li>
            <li> I never really exfoliated prior to ordering the Earth Therapeutics Glove. I like the way it feels and the ease of use. I only use one and with the package of 4, each individually wrapped, you have extras to put in friends birthday gift bags! This purchase was a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; for me!</li>
            <li> They certainly do the trick, gently but effectively</li>
            <li> Love these - durable, handy for washing up, comfortable.. not so exfoliating so they&#x27;re uncomfortable like others I&#x27;ve tried.  I like that they come with multiple pairs to use as gifts!</li>
            <li> Love these gloves. Up until now, I&#x27;d been buying cheap body gloves. I found one cheap pair (local store) that worked very well so I wasn&#x27;t bothered. However, when it was time to replace them, I couldn&#x27;t find the same ones again. I could only find these really soft ones. I&#x27;ve had experience with other products from Earth Therapeutics and have never had any issues. I&#x27;ve always been happy. These gloves are no exception. They perform great and fit my hand snuggly, unlike all the other gloves I&#x27;ve used. They allow for excellent build up of suds and maintain it for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Just got them; will write more later after they have been used for awhile.</li>
            <li> I kept two for myself and gave two as gifts, and they&#x27;re a hit with everyone! They&#x27;re perfect - not flimsy or cheaply made, and not too rough. They&#x27;re a great gentle exfoliator, although I do notice that I go through bar soap much faster with these around.</li>
            <li> Give me a great cleaning. Skin feels great</li>
            <li> I used it them yesterday morning for the first time.  My skin does feel smoother today so I will continue to use this product at at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating gloves. Feels great, and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet.</li>
            <li> Love these gloves.  Great for exfoliation, last a long time, machine washable, great price, etc., etc.</li>
