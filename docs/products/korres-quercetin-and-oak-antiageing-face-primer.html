    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best face primer brand I have ever used .</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a primer that wasn&#x27;t silicone based, and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>It feels like a lotion, smells great, obsorbs in the skin without feeling greasy, does not clog pores, and is made of planty organic materials.</li>
            <li>I really liked the hydration part of this product!</li>
            <li>IT also has anti aging elements which is good for your sink at any age</li>
            <li>I have a TON of compliments about how good I look.</li>
            <li>This is a good primer.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice not oily.</li>
            <li>And I think KORRES products are really the best.</li>
            <li>It smells SO good, like oranges, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very light primer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like i have clogged pores before I&#x27;ve even applied my foundation.</li>
            <li>If you want better primer and some coverage and sun protection</li>
            <li>I never thought I would love a makeup product.</li>
            <li>ok but would not buy again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s moisturizing and preps the face; it seems tinted slightly white but that disappears immediately; the perfect canvas for your foundation.  </li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>Seems more like a moisturizer, I do not think it is a face primer.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered the travel size</li>
            <li>This product might be better for people with drier skin types.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Stila One Step Correct Brightening Serum, which feels better and gives my skin a brighter look.</li>
            <li>I love the pomegranate one as well</li>
            <li>I just love the smell and the feel.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>feel like my skin looks better without makeup too since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  </li>
            <li>Did I mentioned that it keeps my makeup looking picture perfect all day long?</li>
            <li>It does, however, make the face very soft and it seems great for the skin besides, so I like it and wear it almost every day,  </li>
            <li>I am 54 and have been using Laura Mercier and it was fine, just wanted something a bit more affordable....</li>
            <li>51 year old skin is looking great after just two weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to heavy, it goes perfectly on top of your sunscreen lotion and allows your skin to look flawless.</li>
            <li>It does not fill in fine lines as advertised.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve also used Bare Escentuals Prime Time, which I liked better than the Korres, but the Stila is my favorite.)</li>
            <li>I use this primer underneath my makeup and magically my makeup looks fresh throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It creates a smooth surface and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>The primer goes on easily- smooth and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>So far this is by far the best primer for anti-aging.</li>
            <li>The cream goes right over the top of the wrinkles instead of filling them.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and leaves a smooth, matte finish.  </li>
            <li>but Korres is doing it right!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and my makeup went on smoothly and perfectly.</li>
            <li>The consistency is fine like baby powder and very sleek.</li>
            <li>Amazed at how fast the product really does smooth out lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very excited to make a $30+ investment in a relatively unknown product, so I was excited to find this 1/3 size primer for 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li>I will for sure be getting the bigger one.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d exactly call it a wrinkle</li>
            <li>My foundation and concealer never need touch ups during the day, the product has a very refreshing (Very light, if almost non-existent) smell, and you really only need a little dot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different face primers, from cheap (Covergirl) to more expensive (Clinique), and Korres Antiageing is the best!  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day unless I&#x27;m in the really hot sun and get really sweaty-</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t find this product worked that well as a primer, though I think it makes my eyes seem brighter and more lively.</li>
            <li>I especially like the way it minimizes pores and keeps the foundation from settling into my fine lines.</li>
            <li>It works really well with liquid or powder foundation.</li>
            <li>This primer definitely allows my make-up to apply smoothly and seems to fill in the lines as they claim.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this......</li>
            <li>This primer is non-greasy, non comedogenic and completely matte when absorbed.</li>
            <li>I think they concentrated on the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; part too much.</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t really hide wrinkles, but it&#x27;s not supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am expecting too much?</li>
            <li>This is only a sample, not the full size.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and it helps keep my makeup in place pretty well, even when my work conditions are far from conducive for longevity and wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>I guess it does its job, goes on smoothly and holds makeup on, but the finish isn&#x27;t as dry as I would like.</li>
            <li>I normally apply makeup at 7:00am and wash my face at 10:00pm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only paid for the small size to try it, and didn&#x27;t shell out for the full size.</li>
            <li>A little bit makes my entire face super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I tried a small sample of this primer several months ago (it came with an order from Sephora) and thought it seemed really nice.  </li>
            <li>I am really really loving this product; yes, this is a smaller size, but when changing or trying something new, I like to spend as little as possible to see if I like it or not.  </li>
            <li>Plus side is the natural ingredients and no parabens.</li>
            <li>However, I have sensitive eyes and the scent makes my eyes water and water and water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try using this primer for a few more days on my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I really like this primer, though I&#x27;m not really sure if it does that much.  </li>
            <li>Korres is kind of expensive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I will definitely be buying this again when it runs out which will likely be soon since this is such a small tube.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people over 40 with minimal makeup use.</li>
            <li> I like this, but, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Once the little botttle is donr</li>
            <li> Even if there&#x27;s no oil in it, it feels faintly oily and makes me a little sweaty above my lip.</li>
            <li> Cuz i do have this one small line under one of my eyes</li>
            <li> I moisturize, usually in the evening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell with those little samples!  </li>
            <li> As usual, I received it two days after ordering (thank you amazon prime!) and have been using it for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am insane when it comes to organic and non chemical beauty products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin.  I work 8 hours a day and go to school at night.  I normally apply makeup at 7:00am and wash my face at 10:00pm.  I use this primer underneath my makeup and magically my makeup looks fresh throughout the day.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Plus side is the natural ingredients and no parabens. Smells nice not oily. If you want better primer and some coverage and sun protection I recommend Boscia primer. Korres is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks smoother and tighter when used before applying foundation.  I have tried a number of primers. So far this is by far the best primer for anti-aging.</li>
            <li> Amazed at how fast the product really does smooth out lines under my eyes. However, I have sensitive eyes and the scent makes my eyes water and water and water.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would love a makeup product. I am insane when it comes to organic and non chemical beauty products. When I found this primer I was interested in trying it since it is hard to keep my makeup in place. It feels like a lotion, smells great, obsorbs in the skin without feeling greasy, does not clog pores, and is made of planty organic materials. SOCRE BONUS!. Did I mentioned that it keeps my makeup looking picture perfect all day long? IT also has anti aging elements which is good for your sink at any age ( I just turned 30) Since I have started using this I have a TON of compliments about how good I look. Whew, this product helped my avert the 30 year crisis. Once the little botttle is donr I will for sure be getting the bigger one.</li>
            <li> ok but would not buy again</li>
            <li> It works really well with liquid or powder foundation. It creates a smooth surface and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> The best face primer brand I have ever used . The consistency is fine like baby powder and very sleek.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s not to heavy, it goes perfectly on top of your sunscreen lotion and allows your skin to look flawless. Your makeup stays on longer without smudging. I truly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This primer performs!  I&#x27;m in my early 50s so have some lines around my eyes.  This primer definitely allows my make-up to apply smoothly and seems to fill in the lines as they claim.  I will definitely be buying this again when it runs out which will likely be soon since this is such a small tube.</li>
            <li> I am really really loving this product; yes, this is a smaller size, but when changing or trying something new, I like to spend as little as possible to see if I like it or not.  I really do like this......it&#x27;s moisturizing and preps the face; it seems tinted slightly white but that disappears immediately; the perfect canvas for your foundation.  I&#x27;m very happy.  I am 54 and have been using Laura Mercier and it was fine, just wanted something a bit more affordable....love this.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this primer.  It does not fill in fine lines as advertised.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Seems more like a moisturizer, I do not think it is a face primer. Glad I ordered the travel size</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t find this product worked that well as a primer, though I think it makes my eyes seem brighter and more lively. It&#x27;s also rather greasy which caused me to break out. (I have oily/combination skin.) This product might be better for people with drier skin types.  The smell of this product is wonderful. Citrus-y goodness. I&#x27;m going to try using this primer for a few more days on my entire face.  If it keeps breaking me out, I&#x27;m going to stop using it on my entire face, though I&#x27;ll probably continue use around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only paid for the small size to try it, and didn&#x27;t shell out for the full size. I guess it does its job, goes on smoothly and holds makeup on, but the finish isn&#x27;t as dry as I would like. Even if there&#x27;s no oil in it, it feels faintly oily and makes me a little sweaty above my lip. I&#x27;ll stick with Stila One Step Correct Brightening Serum, which feels better and gives my skin a brighter look. (I&#x27;ve also used Bare Escentuals Prime Time, which I liked better than the Korres, but the Stila is my favorite.)</li>
            <li> I like this product cuz i feel like my makeup stays on longer but I just don&#x27;t get how its antiaging? Cuz i do have this one small line under one of my eyes and it says it fills wrinkles and I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d exactly call it a wrinkle but I see no difference when I apply it there, But i do still like it cuz it makes my makeup last longer than when i don&#x27;t apply it.</li>
            <li> I like this, but, it&#x27;s not worth the price. This is only a sample, not the full size. I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I work two jobs, and cannot go without primer for 18 hour work days. This primer is non-greasy, non comedogenic and completely matte when absorbed. My foundation and concealer never need touch ups during the day, the product has a very refreshing (Very light, if almost non-existent) smell, and you really only need a little dot. I love the pomegranate one as well but Korres is doing it right!</li>
            <li> I really like this primer, though I&#x27;m not really sure if it does that much.  I just love the smell and the feel.  It does make my face feel smooth.  And I think KORRES products are really the best.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a primer that wasn&#x27;t silicone based, and this was perfect. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and my makeup went on smoothly and perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tried a small sample of this primer several months ago (it came with an order from Sephora) and thought it seemed really nice.  It&#x27;s hard to tell with those little samples!  I wasn&#x27;t very excited to make a $30+ investment in a relatively unknown product, so I was excited to find this 1/3 size primer for 1/3 the price.  As usual, I received it two days after ordering (thank you amazon prime!) and have been using it for two weeks.  All I can say is...YES!!!  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 51 year old skin is looking great after just two weeks.  The primer goes on easily- smooth and not at all greasy.  It dries quickly, and leaves a smooth, matte finish.  I use Bare Minerals foundation, and I feel like I&#x27;m using less with this primer.  It lasts all day unless I&#x27;m in the really hot sun and get really sweaty- on those days I have needed to touch up my nose only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my skin looks better without makeup too since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I wash my face twice a day- in the morning with Caress soap and a buff puff in the shower, and before bed with a disposable makeup remover cloth.  I moisturize, usually in the evening.  Nothing fancy!  Now that I&#x27;ve noticed such a difference from just a primer, I&#x27;m considering trying another product in the line.</li>
            <li> I really liked the hydration part of this product! It smells SO good, like oranges, and it went on smoothly. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t prime as well as a \\&quot;primer\\&quot; should. I think they concentrated on the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; part too much. I would recommend this for people over 40 with minimal makeup use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different face primers, from cheap (Covergirl) to more expensive (Clinique), and Korres Antiageing is the best!  A little bit makes my entire face super smooth.  I especially like the way it minimizes pores and keeps the foundation from settling into my fine lines. My face doesn&#x27;t get greasy on Korres the way the Loreal primer reacted to my skin.  I will purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> This is a good primer.  I use it in the morning and it helps keep my makeup in place pretty well, even when my work conditions are far from conducive for longevity and wearing makeup.  I am 51 and yes, my face is beginning to show age.  No, it doesn&#x27;t really hide wrinkles, but it&#x27;s not supposed to.  It does, however, make the face very soft and it seems great for the skin besides, so I like it and wear it almost every day,  I would recommend this for any woman in their thirties and even forties, and yes, perhaps even beyond because it does work well with the skin and helps keep makeup in place.</li>
            <li> Very light primer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like i have clogged pores before I&#x27;ve even applied my foundation.</li>
            <li> The cream goes right over the top of the wrinkles instead of filling them. Maybe I am expecting too much?</li>
