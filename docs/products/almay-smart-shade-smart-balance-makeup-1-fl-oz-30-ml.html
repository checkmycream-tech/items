            <li>The matching powder on top of this foundation looks beautiful and keeps my skin nice and matte most of the day</li>
            <li>Which is so amazing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled.</li>
            <li>good seller, on time and pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every liquid foundation on the market, and this was the first kind that didn&#x27;t make me look like an oompa-loompa!!</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for those with sensitive skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No bad reactions!!</li>
            <li>top of having all the allergies and whatnot</li>
            <li>This makes the pricing more than comparable.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this make up to begin with</li>
            <li>Not only did it get here in perfect condition</li>
            <li>I was still able to use it by adding some moisturizer to it.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something lighter and with more oil control for the summer</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s not cakey like most powders tend to</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination, light skin and this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product was okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much since it spreads on so nicely.</li>
            <li>This foundation really does adjust to your skin tone, which is great for me since I have very fair skin and have a hard time matching foundations to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and when I found it for thia cheap, I got super excited!</li>
            <li>product is hypoallergenic, fragrance free, and noncomedogenic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light weight but gives you an airbrushed finished look.</li>
            <li>It provides light coverage, gives a blended look, and does not feel like I have makeup on.</li>
            <li>this works really well and doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint like a lot of liquid foundations, blends very nicely and adjusts to your skin tone very well</li>
            <li>This gives a nice even coverage and doesn&#x27;t make your skin look old.</li>
            <li>and I have honestly resorted to making my own by mixing moisturizer with a little liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>For me, this make up works very well, providing a light coverage that matches well with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Translation into English: They use products that don&#x27;t cause allergic reactions, most of their products (unless otherwise specified) are fragrance free</li>
            <li>Is has very nice coverage, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, in fact it feels like nothing is even there.</li>
            <li>It does EXACTLY what it advertises and that&#x27;s rare with make-up in my opinion.</li>
            <li>We thought we had a product that finally matched my daughters very light skin tone (100).  </li>
            <li>She applied it the following day and by the end of the day her face was covered in a huge rash!</li>
            <li>This works better than the covergirl simply ageless.</li>
            <li>You do not have to be exact as it does blend in with your coloring just by picking the closest shade.</li>
            <li>I started using this many years ago and have been able to find it locally, until recently.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fair and unfortunately uneven skin.</li>
            <li>this is a really good shade for my pale skin, but it seems to disappear if I dont cake on the powder over it.</li>
            <li>Almay has a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Normally 3-5 hours, if I&#x27;m lucky, after having washed my face there is so much oil</li>
            <li>, the light has a subtle color that is nice.</li>
            <li>, I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover imperfections very well</li>
            <li>It really does change to your skin tone.</li>
            <li>i looked great, from 2 feet or worse yet 1 foot away</li>
            <li>It is mediocre at best, and if you&#x27;re not careful the pigment capsules can leave streaks on your face.</li>
            <li>Sheer and not heavy, So easy, to apply and run to work or out to dinner</li>
            <li>She will go back to using her tried and true Clinique products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revlon One Step foundation, which I LOVE, but found it to be way too heavy for the summer</li>
            <li>of these are now my two new go-to foundation/powders in my make up routine.</li>
            <li>, I used both for the first time last week</li>
            <li>It looks natural on the skin.</li>
            <li>, it cam two days early.</li>
            <li>I saw this at the local store and decided to research the brand, I&#x27;m on my first bottle, second use</li>
            <li>Plus I live in Florida, and with the humidity levels, make-up on my face was the last thing I wanted.</li>
            <li>I would get cystic acne as early as the very next day.</li>
            <li>I am not super pale, but I thought to be safe</li>
            <li>It really covers my different parts of my face like, redness, oily and dry areas and changes for your skin color!</li>
            <li>I am trying out their other products and think that I will appreciate them just as much.</li>
            <li>and I think the only reason it works on such a broad range of skin tones is because it is so sheer.</li>

            <li> and I think the only reason it works on such a broad range of skin tones is because it is so sheer.</li>
            <li> tough, durable and economical to use that I give.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, drying, or oiliness.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time so don&#x27;t be fooled by it being just one ounce.</li>
            <li> The one tube has last longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> This product starts out as a white cream that has little capsules of skin colored pigment in it that burst open as you rub it on your face.</li>
            <li> and it was too dark and left orange blotches.</li>
            <li> On another note, I always shake this before applying and it only takes a small amount to start out with, like the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product and disappointed when I squeezed out some to find it orange.</li>
            <li> you could see every little pit and bump on my face, you could tell that i was wearing something.  </li>
            <li> It is very thin, but a little goes a long way and keeps me lasting through the day.</li>
            <li> I have always had a difficult time with matching foundations simply because I have a problem with redness.</li>
            <li> so I do have to use the covergirl with a small brush to cover some blemishes.</li>
            <li> The SPF 15 is too small to Summer.</li>
            <li> i used a small amt of this product and from about 3 feet away</li>
            <li> So sad I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused.</li>
            <li> I still applied it in a thin layer to my skin</li>
            <li> This morning we awoke with her face still a little puffy, but VERY broken out!!  </li>
            <li> It makes my face look like I got a bad spray tan.</li>
            <li> Hope this post will save you the disappointment!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will return this product for a refund.  </li>
            <li> which is the worst thing I have problems with, and noncomedogenic means that it won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The coverage is terrible.</li>
            <li> it was terrible.  </li>
            <li> its terrible, i threw it away.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I never knew there was a brand of makeup that was perfect for those of us whom are allergic to just about anything. I saw this at the local store and decided to research the brand, I&#x27;m on my first bottle, second use and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled. No bad reactions!! Which is so amazing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is hypoallergenic, fragrance free, and noncomedogenic. Translation into English: They use products that don&#x27;t cause allergic reactions, most of their products (unless otherwise specified) are fragrance free which is the worst thing I have problems with, and noncomedogenic means that it won&#x27;t clog your pores. This product is perfect for those with sensitive skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of having all the allergies and whatnot, I have very oily skin. I wore this yesterday, for about 8-10hrs and none of the oil I&#x27;m used to seeing showed up. Normally 3-5 hours, if I&#x27;m lucky, after having washed my face there is so much oil I could wipe it off with a tissue and see through parts of the tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> In all my 31 years of life I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything. For this product, I had to. I&#x27;ve never worn foundation because it always felt like I had a pound of gunk on my face no matter what product I used. Plus I live in Florida, and with the humidity levels, make-up on my face was the last thing I wanted. This product changed everything. It does EXACTLY what it advertises and that&#x27;s rare with make-up in my opinion. It&#x27;s extremely light weight but gives you an airbrushed finished look. If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-cakey type of coverage this won&#x27;t deliver. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is deciding whether or not to give it a try.    FYI: I use the medium shade...</li>
            <li> this is a really good shade for my pale skin, but it seems to disappear if I dont cake on the powder over it. I wear shea butter on my face and its summer, so I get that it wont last. for the price its up there close to best ive ever used. My skin looks flawless and youthful with this make-up. good seller, on time and pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I have always had a difficult time with matching foundations simply because I have a problem with redness. When I purchased this, I feared that it would not do its job as intended because of my redness, but in fact, it blew my mind.    It is very thin, but a little goes a long way and keeps me lasting through the day. I do not need excess powders, layers or anything. Simply this and go. It matches flawlessly and does everything it says it would.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have acne until using this product.  I would get cystic acne as early as the very next day.</li>
            <li> This works better than the covergirl simply ageless. It moisturizes and actually make my skin look younger, the light has a subtle color that is nice. It doesn&#x27;t cover imperfections very well so I do have to use the covergirl with a small brush to cover some blemishes. This gives a nice even coverage and doesn&#x27;t make your skin look old. I don&#x27;t know how well this will work in the summer because stuff just melts or sweats off me in the summer but for the winter this is great.</li>
            <li> I am  so glad that I found this on line! My regular store no longer carries this. What a find!</li>
            <li> I experimented with this product. It really does change to your skin tone. I put some on my husbands hand, put some on my hand. It changed color and the colors were actually different. It looks natural on the skin. I don&#x27;t need to use very much since it spreads on so nicely. The one tube has last longer than other brands. This makes the pricing more than comparable. Almay has a new loyal customer. I am trying out their other products and think that I will appreciate them just as much. The one thing that I think could be improved is the coverage but then it may change the texture.</li>
            <li> We thought we had a product that finally matched my daughters very light skin tone (100).  She put it on and we were very impressed with the product. She applied it the following day and by the end of the day her face was covered in a huge rash! She immediately washed off her face and took an allergy pill, we also applied Benadryl cream to her face to counteract the reaction.  This morning we awoke with her face still a little puffy, but VERY broken out!!  All from one use.  This was the only thing that changed in her regimen!!  Very disappointed and will return this product for a refund.  She will go back to using her tried and true Clinique products.</li>
            <li> this works really well and doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint like a lot of liquid foundations, blends very nicely and adjusts to your skin tone very well</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really covers my different parts of my face like, redness, oily and dry areas and changes for your skin color!</li>
            <li> I love this make up to begin with and when I found it for thia cheap, I got super excited! Not only did it get here in perfect condition, it cam two days early. Estimated delivery date was April 11th-16th and I got it this morning on the 9th. Very happy with the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair and unfortunately uneven skin. I&#x27;ve tried just about every liquid foundation on the market, and this was the first kind that didn&#x27;t make me look like an oompa-loompa!! The light shade adjusted to my skin tone perfectly. The bottle lasts a long time, and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, drying, or oiliness. So happy I found this foundation!</li>
            <li> Very good product. tough, durable and economical to use that I give. 100 percent recommended for the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!! I am not super pale, but I thought to be safe I would get the lightest they offered (100). It makes my face look like I got a bad spray tan. I&#x27;m so confused. Nothing skin matching about this makeup. The coverage is terrible. So sad I wasted the money. Into the trash it goes. Hope this post will save you the disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product and disappointed when I squeezed out some to find it orange. I still applied it in a thin layer to my skin and it was too dark and left orange blotches. I was still able to use it by adding some moisturizer to it. However, I am still looking for a tinted moisturizer that I like and I have honestly resorted to making my own by mixing moisturizer with a little liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon One Step foundation, which I LOVE, but found it to be way too heavy for the summer so I was looking for something lighter and with more oil control for the summer so I grabbed this and the matching powder on a whim at Wal Mart one day, I used both for the first time last week and I must say I&#x27;m very impressed. This foundation really does adjust to your skin tone, which is great for me since I have very fair skin and have a hard time matching foundations to my skin tone. Is has very nice coverage, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, in fact it feels like nothing is even there. It also has great staying power for a drug store foundation. The matching powder on top of this foundation looks beautiful and keeps my skin nice and matte most of the day AND it&#x27;s not cakey like most powders tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;Both of these are now my two new go-to foundation/powders in my make up routine.</li>
            <li> This product starts out as a white cream that has little capsules of skin colored pigment in it that burst open as you rub it on your face. It doesn&#x27;t cover that well and I think the only reason it works on such a broad range of skin tones is because it is so sheer. It is mediocre at best, and if you&#x27;re not careful the pigment capsules can leave streaks on your face.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years. It provides light coverage, gives a blended look, and does not feel like I have makeup on. I think there are two or three shades to select. You do not have to be exact as it does blend in with your coloring just by picking the closest shade. It lasts for a long time so don&#x27;t be fooled by it being just one ounce. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described. This is the only foundation I wear. I have sensitive, combination, light skin and this is perfect for me. Love how it matches my skin and blends perfectly. Love almay!</li>
            <li> I started using this many years ago and have been able to find it locally, until recently.  Now, Amazon is the only place I can find this make-up.  For me, this make up works very well, providing a light coverage that matches well with my skin.  Extra bonus with the sunscreen included!  On another note, I always shake this before applying and it only takes a small amount to start out with, like the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> Sheer and not heavy, So easy, to apply and run to work or out to dinner</li>
            <li> I used 3 bottles for 3 years, it is very good in Winter. The SPF 15 is too small to Summer.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product was okay. However, it did not match my skin tone, and had an orange cast.</li>
            <li> i used a small amt of this product and from about 3 feet away i looked great, from 2 feet or worse yet 1 foot away it was terrible.  you could see every little pit and bump on my face, you could tell that i was wearing something.  its terrible, i threw it away.</li>
