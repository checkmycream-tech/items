            <li>Feels great on the skin and makes definitely makes a difference in the complexion.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>As a PA in the medical field, I know good skin care is important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good facial serum.</li>
            <li>but I use a facial lotion after that smells good.</li>
            <li>With this product I feel good about what I&#x27;m putting on my skin and allowing my skin&#x27;s ability to bounce back.  </li>
            <li>It is early to say :reduces fine lines - need more time to see that.</li>
            <li>It works super.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying this product now for several days and already starting to see some great results.  </li>
            <li>This product feels hydrating on my face and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother already, my face is brighter and complexion looking better pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It especially goes on fast and smoothly which I liked.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I recommend people try this product to see if it&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
            <li>thanks Swiss spa!</li>
            <li>There are so many products that claim to work to reduce wrinkles, smoothing the overall appearance of aging.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>More later.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, seems to be softening my skin, hiding wrinkles, and scars are less obvious.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the girls I work with at the salon have noticed the difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast service.</li>
            <li>I really noticed immediately how it hydrates my skin, firms and tones.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised because the price was so cheap compared to my old syrum, so I didn&#x27;t expect to notice a difference this soon.</li>
            <li>My experience is that even though I have tried so many of the \\&quot;other brands\\&quot; none of them came close to delivering what was promised ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C Serums in the past, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>but wow can already see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes finally a product that delivers on their claim.</li>
            <li>I ordered this serum to pamper my face because I live in a city and get too much sun and environmental pollution.</li>
            <li>The main thing I have noticed is an improvement in hydration.  </li>
            <li>Even though my skin is sensitive I was willing to give this brand new product a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other vitamin c syrums over the years (for more than twice the price), but this one takes the cake and really has given fast results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and can hardly wait to see even more visible results very soon!    </li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s got natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing my results after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for a serum, but it was a little drying of my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that the company uses quality ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li>Guess my 71 year old skin was too far gone..  Saw no results.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and any blemishes I have clear up with a day or so of using this product.</li>
            <li>I am starting to get older and want to prevent from looking older as much as possible via natural methods.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for only 4 days so far, and the wrinkles around my eyes are gone!!</li>
            <li>I like the list of ingredients, especially the natural components.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh and firm.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Guess my 71 year old skin was too far gone..  Saw no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m very impressed with what I&#x27;m seeing.  I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C Serums in the past, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I&#x27;m seeing results faster with this product than any of the others.....my dark spots and discolorations are fading and my skin has a smoother, tighter appearance. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing my results after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week and love the results. Makes your skin feel smooth and hydrated. Also works great on the back of your hands. I definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product feels hydrating on my face and is absorbed quickly.  It&#x27;s clear that the company uses quality ingredients in this product.  But after a month or so, I haven&#x27;t noticed the results I was expecting to soften fine lines and wrinkles.  However, I would award 5 stars for service orientation of this company as it is amazing!  Representatives respond personally almost immediately to questions and concerns and they truly stand behind their products.  I would order products again from them any time!</li>
            <li> I am starting to get older and want to prevent from looking older as much as possible via natural methods. I have done a lot of research on what type of products can help, and vitamin c is one of them. This vitamin c serum has an added bonus of hyaluronic acid, which definitely boosts the anti-aging effects. My skin seems more radiant after using this product</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this stuff!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for only 4 days so far, and the wrinkles around my eyes are gone!! My skin feels so fresh and firm. I&#x27;ve used several other vitamin c syrums over the years (for more than twice the price), but this one takes the cake and really has given fast results. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised because the price was so cheap compared to my old syrum, so I didn&#x27;t expect to notice a difference this soon. Also--i only have to use about half of what I used with my other vitamin c syrum. I can wait to see what happens after a month!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different products through the years and was somewhat skeptical when a friend recommended this product  and sent the link. Thought what the heck try it. Only received it a few days ago but wow can already see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes finally a product that delivers on their claim. Well worth the cost. Shipping was fast and the girls I work with at the salon have noticed the difference in my skin thanks Swiss spa! Can&#x27;t wait for my next order! Which will be soon since my other half has been using it too&#x27;</li>
            <li> There are so many products that claim to work to reduce wrinkles, smoothing the overall appearance of aging. Many of these products work well or they wouldn&#x27;t still be offered.

            <li> My wife is so happy. It works super. Thanks for the fast service.</li>
            <li> I am using this Serum about a week.It is early to say :reduces fine lines - need more time to see that.It does seem to absorb well. I really noticed immediately how it hydrates my skin, firms and tones. Makes my skin smooth and even luminous.I am very pleased with this product. My only complaint is the serum squirts out rather strong, maybe due to a bad pump.</li>
            <li> The second day after using the serum I was receiving compliments about how radiant I looked! I thought, wait a couple of days and see what happens. My skin continues to glow. I decided I needed to get a bottle for my friend. I can hardly wait! I know it will be beneficial for her too. I like the natural ingredients. It goes on smoothly, I don&#x27;t notice it at all except for the glow. I would definitely recommend this,.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, seems to be softening my skin, hiding wrinkles, and scars are less obvious.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Exactly as advertised. Have been using for only 3 days and can notice an improvement! Thank you !</li>
            <li> The serum works to refresh your skin and help diminish wrinkles and blemishes.  It&#x27;s fine for a serum, but it was a little drying of my sensitive skin and I had to use more face cream to balance that out.  But it&#x27;s a good serum and can help make the skin look toned and fresh. I recommend people try this product to see if it&#x27;s right for you.  It especially goes on fast and smoothly which I liked.  It&#x27;s also light and not heavy.  And you feel it working.  My skin heated up some with each application.  But that only told me it was working.  It&#x27;s a good facial serum.</li>
            <li> Love this. Bought the bottle to give my sister but after trying a bit, decided to keep it for myself. Feels great on the skin and makes definitely makes a difference in the complexion. If you are looking for something pure and healthy that feels great and gives your skin a nice glow, look now further.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better. I told my dermatologist that I was using this and she was all for it. The smell of it is not pleasant but I use a facial lotion after that smells good.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t personally use, I gave it as a gift</li>
            <li> I just started to use this serum, it promises good results. More later.</li>
            <li> As a PA in the medical field, I know good skin care is important. I ordered this serum to pamper my face because I live in a city and get too much sun and environmental pollution. I really like that it&#x27;s got natural and organic ingredients. My skin feels smoother already, my face is brighter and complexion looking better pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This did not work on my dark spots. I saw very little change, if any.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again!!</li>
            <li> Of all the product that I have tried this is the one I love the most. My skin feels soft and any blemishes I have clear up with a day or so of using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product,  the saler was great in presenting the product</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product now for several days and already starting to see some great results.  The main thing I have noticed is an improvement in hydration.  My skin also feels like it&#x27;s being pulled together and hydrated.  I like the list of ingredients, especially the natural components.  With this product I feel good about what I&#x27;m putting on my skin and allowing my skin&#x27;s ability to bounce back.  This is definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  It was recommended to me by a friend.  It makes your skin very soft.  Good price and great service.  I highly recommend it.</li>
