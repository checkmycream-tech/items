            <li>This is the best thing Ever.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, kinda like a freah mint sent.</li>
            <li>I tried it and loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>Washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>very strong menthol smell</li>
            <li>This has got to be by far one of the best hair gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>so why pay more for it?</li>
            <li>Also, we like the smell of the original better.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no white residue, it holds my edges for about 3 days, and it&#x27;s a great price..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and it is a light lavender color.  </li>
            <li>Not as sticky as the original</li>
            <li>love the formula because it really does hold your hair down great.</li>
            <li>Works better with permed hair instead of natural hair.</li>
            <li>if you someone who doesn&#x27;t like the feel of goo, i would say not to try this line because it indeed has a gooey &amp;#34;SNOT&amp;#34; like consistency that may shock you at first.</li>
            <li>All in all great product especially if your always active and sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>And also you can find this product at Walmart much cheaper</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll probably stick to the original yellow bottle.</li>
            <li>#34;Gorilla Snot&amp;#34; in his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, after a snow day, he was excited to gel his hair just to go back to school.</li>
            <li>I have type 4 african american hair and some of the gels around don&#x27;t do a good job keeping or &amp;#34;laying&amp;#34; my edges for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of this gel on top of any of those will give you the sleek look you&#x27;ve been battling to get.</li>
            <li>Also when I put it on it gives my head a nice cool chilly feeling that I like.</li>
            <li>I got this from Walmart for 3 dollars and it does the trick it keeps your edges in place for a long time you just have to keep smoothing it down then wrap it up for like 20 mins or over night to get better results</li>
            <li>The sport version seemed a little stickier than the regular gel and did no hold up to sweating/moisture any better than the regular version of the gel</li>

            <li> It has the same hold as the Gorila Punk gel, but the only difference is it can last threw heavy sweat.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well but not great for my boys&#x27;s curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, 100% natural black girl (4Cish) hair</li>
            <li> and it holds it back into a slick ponytail.  </li>

            <li> Okay.  Can get cheaper at stores,  Also, we like the smell of the original better.</li>
            <li> Does to hold and sticks to everything.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It lays edges down for days and it doesn&#x27;t flake. And it doesn&#x27;t make hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should have gotten the regular one&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t hold that that well.</li>
            <li> love the formula because it really does hold your hair down great. If you are like me and have a tendency to perspire a lot, you&#x27;ll like the hold. Even when my head starts to sweat i noticed that it was still laid. I love the hold but hate the smell. It reminds me of the crest toothpaste i use..oh, and it&#x27;s blue like the toothpaste too..i&#x27;ll probably stick to the original yellow bottle. if you someone who doesn&#x27;t like the feel of goo, i would say not to try this line because it indeed has a gooey &amp;#34;SNOT&amp;#34; like consistency that may shock you at first.</li>

            <li> This has got to be by far one of the best hair gels I&#x27;ve used. It has the same hold as the Gorila Punk gel, but the only difference is it can last threw heavy sweat. I notice after the gym my hair style is still intact and I have a mohawk. Also when I put it on it gives my head a nice cool chilly feeling that I like. Smells good, kinda like a freah mint sent. All in all great product especially if your always active and sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Way too sticky. It felt like cement glue for hair. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I heard about this hair gel from youtube I tried it and loved it ever since. There&#x27;s no white residue, it holds my edges for about 3 days, and it&#x27;s a great price.. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about the purple tube is that it smells like toothpaste.. And also you can find this product at Walmart much cheaper</li>
            <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my grandson for Christmas. He loves it and uses it almost daily. Works great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold it just makes my hair wave up &amp; when it Drys my hair feels hard an nasty I will never used again also I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any of my friends</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not as sticky as the original but still you can shape your hair and it smells great.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Works better with permed hair instead of natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing Ever.  It&#x27;s a 10 hold.  It smells lovely.  It doesn&#x27;t flake and it is a light lavender color.  I&#x27;m hooked. I have thick, 100% natural black girl (4Cish) hair and it holds it back into a slick ponytail.  I use it in combination with ORS olive oil edge control.  Last until you wash it out. Washes out very easily.</li>
            <li> Our friend&#x27;s son loves that he&#x27;s putting &amp;#34;Gorilla Snot&amp;#34; in his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, after a snow day, he was excited to gel his hair just to go back to school.</li>
            <li> very strong menthol smell</li>
            <li> The sport version seemed a little stickier than the regular gel and did no hold up to sweating/moisture any better than the regular version of the gel so why pay more for it?</li>
            <li> I have type 4 african american hair and some of the gels around don&#x27;t do a good job keeping or &amp;#34;laying&amp;#34; my edges for the entire day.  A little bit of this gel on top of any of those will give you the sleek look you&#x27;ve been battling to get.</li>
