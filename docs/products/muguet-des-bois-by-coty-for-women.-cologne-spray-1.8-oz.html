            <li>this is my mother in laws favorite, and the price is fantastic, thank you</li>
            <li>Many scents are available as both colognes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have loved Coty&#x27;s cologne for years and this looks and smells like it is really authentically Coty&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It still has a nice fresh smell just like the lily of the valley</li>
            <li>so I save that for really special occasions!</li>
            <li>then you need to apply more which then makes you have to buy more quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good value for the money, especially if you love the scent of lily of the valley!</li>
            <li>V nice scent - although it seems to evaporate  terribly fast and no one seems to be able to find a trace of it..</li>
            <li>It almost gave me bit of headache because it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, soft, light &amp; fresh, spring-time fragrance that has been around for many years because it is so timeless.  </li>
            <li>I loved it when I was a child, and when I was in high school and college.  </li>
            <li>I have loved this perfume since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>Loved this cologne when I was in high school in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like the flowers I grew up loving.</li>
            <li>Of cause, the pricy &amp;#34;Diorissimo&amp;#34; is better, but this one is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s crisp and a very refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I like it for a quick spray if I am going out and want to feel and smell refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having so many things can&#x27;t be easily procured in the stores!</li>
            <li>This cologne smells just the way I remember it, very light and fresh.......</li>
            <li>It  wasn&#x27;t  quite what I expected  scent wise but was ok!</li>
            <li>Wish more pople would wear fresh light scents like this.</li>
            <li>Muguet is a fabulous scent of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten just how fresh and lovely it is.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>Years ago this fragrance was readily available in stores, then it was not found again.  </li>
            <li>and if you wore it before, it is still the same scent which is great.</li>
            <li>&quot; if you are looking for a light old-fashioned scent.</li>
            <li>Love this fresh lily of the valley fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is simply cheaply fragranced alcohol.</li>
            <li>Light summer scent.</li>
            <li>It used to be widely available.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what compelled me to see if it still existed, but when I saw it available here, I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>So happy that Muguet des Bois is back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the fragrance I remember, reminds me of lily of the valley flowers; light smell and o.k.</li>
            <li>She is gone now, and smelling this scent has brought back some great memories.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh it smells.  </li>
            <li>The bottle certainly is a great value, and there&#x27;s enough to put a bit in a travel spritzer in your purse to freshen it up during the day.  </li>
            <li>This is a light fragrance having the smell of Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap after all.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making this available.</li>
            <li>97 year old mom loved it</li>
            <li>I loved this cologne as a young woman, and wanted to buy it again for my summertime fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling and is very pretty!</li>
            <li>A very light, fresh and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>grand kids grew up remembering gramas unique fresh lilly of the valley scent&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my all time favorite light clean fresh cologne.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this perfume and I was happy to find it as her first bottle was an old bottle my mother had.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend liked this one over the perfume called Lucky that I purchased at the same time, it has a nice floral scent.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast and I was pleased with it when I got it.  </li>
            <li>I even try to grow lily of the valley in my garden, without much success!</li>
            <li>So light and sweet.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells exactly like the lovely Lily Of The Valley.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth a buy!</li>
            <li>Success!  </li>
            <li>Having never worn the original formulation, I was hesitant to try this out.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance - exactly like Lily of the Valley flowers.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find that it was still available and just as I had hoped, when I smelled it the memories came rushing back.</li>
            <li>This is an unusually clean, floral scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for a young woman, or a woman who prefers a simple, clean floral scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a clean and feminine smell.</li>
            <li>An old favorite!  </li>
            <li>Wow -- love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Glorious, sweet, clean and feminine.</li>
            <li>My mother used to let me wear it on special occasions when I was a kid, so to me it smells like Christmas and</li>
            <li>It was such a clean smell, i loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same great fragrance I started wearing in the 1970s.</li>
            <li>A great first perfume for a teen or pre-teen girl, too.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a great combination, and I am curious to see how that performs.  </li>
            <li>us Gal&#x27;s that wore this Sweet Lily of the Valley Cologne..</li>
            <li>Perfect for the office, not in the least overpowering.</li>
            <li>This one has the true scent of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li>An overall good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more drawn to earthy, real florals and musk.</li>
            <li>So far this Muguets Des Bois by Coty is really really nice.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to others who may like the light fresh scent of Spring and of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, natural lily of the valley fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is not the same Muguet Des Bois I loved as a teenager.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same lovely Lily of the Valley scent I remember - very evocative (for me) and brings good memories.</li>
            <li>So nice to find this old &amp;#34;stand</li>
            <li>A favorite since high school - just as I remember it!</li>
            <li>Only reason it gets a 4 is because I lost a good portion of it to greedy bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that we can get it readily from Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a sweet, floral aroma.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet loveliness.</li>
            <li>Just too sweet</li>
            <li>it much better, than others sell oil under name &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;, which has nothing to do with real scent of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a true Lily of the Valley scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance so much, I am ordering another as a gift.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>And the price is so good for such a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for, I find it here at Amazon, and after a quick search, found lots of listings for Lily of the Valley.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; \\&quot;spring-y\\&quot;; not heavy, but the fragrance lasts for most of the day without reapplying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they still make it, as it is a forever classic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>The service was quick and I saved money.  </li>
            <li>This one has been said to be the most realistic Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume, the only one that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache! :)</li>
            <li>IT came quickly and without problems.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly with no problem.</li>
            <li>purchased for an elderly friend who used this cologne many years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it locally - she is happy to be smelling the lilies of the valley again - sweet and reminiscent.</li>
            <li>As with Proust&#x27;s madeleines, you can have a satisfying remembrance of things past, and maybe some fragrant dreams of a lightly scented and delightful future.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the scent is long-lasting and very pretty.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable the scent is delicious soft and not overpowering I would definitely order this product again thank you</li>
            <li>It is a light but pretty sent.</li>
            <li>This really smells like the true scent of the lily of the valley flower!</li>
            <li>A new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I was expecting, I now own a bottle of funky, old smelling liquid - nothing pretty about it.  </li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s such a light, cool fragrance, that I think is appropriate for any age......</li>
            <li>LIGHT, PLEASANT, YOUNG LADIES WILL ESPECIALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>This year I have been looking for a crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s captured very well in this light, summery cologne.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the fragrance when I was a young woman, and it seems, she likes it too.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, no mistaking what it is-I definitely picture the LOTV flower when smelling this.  </li>
            <li>but I think it will smell better directly on clothes, towels, or as a room</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for posting this Old Time Favorite for</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and &amp;#34;true to the flower&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A timeless scent of lily-of-the-valley; a lovely old fashion fragrance reminenscent of a victorian era.  </li>
            <li>Still love it, and its cheap enough to keep in your purse and spritz throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I was pleased, however, I do not know if the bottle is old or the scent has changed but</li>
            <li>This cologne is most like my grandmother&#x27;s when I was young....</li>
            <li>I was splendidly surprised to see  this perfume again and to b e able to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>We often talk about the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; and the happy times we had -- especially the flowers we grew in our gardens.</li>
            <li>Rather nice scent and does have a deep tone of lily of the valley.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have it back.  </li>
            <li>To me they say fresh, spring, and perfection.  </li>
            <li>If you loved this fragrance as much as I did and do, buy the Muguets Des Bois, and take a trip back in time and memory.  </li>
            <li>This is amazingly true to the real scent of Lilly of the Valley!  </li>
            <li>The Lily smells fake...not fresh.</li>
            <li>it smells like fresh Lilly of the Valley blooms.</li>
            <li>Arrived far ahead of estimated delivery date which was very nice as it was ordered standard shipping.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty, and it was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>The scent is pure, clean and spring time in a bottle.</li>
            <li>This version of Coty&#x27;s,  Muguet Des Bois, is very close to the original, &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I also loved other bygone scents from Coty like Tigress and Woodhue.</li>
            <li>The perfume is so light, you really don&#x27;t need to worry about overusing it very much.</li>
            <li>The price was right and arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>I checked around and she was right</li>
            <li>(Mom&#x27;s are always right), although all the clerks fondly remembered it and got a far-away look in their eyes when I asked if they had any in stock.     </li>
            <li>all right...</li>
            <li>I do have to say that when I called to return it, it was handled at once and came off my credit card right away.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fade right away either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It brings back Sweet Memories so many years ago for me......</li>
            <li>This one was pure, sweet and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s not a very strong scent, not overpowering, though I do love to spritz the stuff on.</li>
            <li>One of the reviews proposes it (Muguet Des Bois) smells like bug spray, and I pick up on that occassionally, but love the light, sweet, fresh, slightly pungent scent.</li>
            <li>Still waiting to see if it will wear off too fast, but even so, I am very excited about my new perfume.</li>
            <li>My older sister got Muguet Des Bois for her thirteenth birthday ,so I was excited to send it to her also.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li>Brings back memories of my teenage years, what a great cologne.</li>
            <li>It has a very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; scent with a mild citrus undertone.</li>
            <li>I had a good bottle of that scent from Crabtree and Evelyn, but they&#x27;ve changed their formula and it&#x27;s not true lily of the valley anymore.  </li>
            <li>(I suffer from migraines, and have an extremely low tolerance for strong and sweet aromas.)</li>
            <li>Very light, simple and floral...perfect for every day and any age.</li>
            <li>I wore this years ago and remember it smelling very much like Lily of the Valley</li>
            <li>Not high end, but kinda nice after the alcohol dissipates.</li>
            <li>It will always be my favorite especially in the Spring of the year.</li>
            <li>and I know I&#x27;ll love using  it later on when temperatures soar here,</li>
            <li>I just could not BELIEVE it was the same Muguet Cologne that I use to wear many years ago....</li>
            <li>And sure enough it was....</li>
            <li>I  love it especially in the Spring;</li>
            <li>While the fragrance is lovely, especially for summer, it&#x27;s staying power is not.  </li>
            <li>This is literally the first fragrance I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but it has no lasting power.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the same as it was many years ago, but I feel that it must have been &amp;#34;updated,&amp;#34; because it wasn&#x27;t as I remembered it.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly as I remember so man years ago.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle for vanity.</li>
            <li>I think life is maybe too short to wear a scent I don&#x27;t care for when there are many others.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The formula is quite obviously different and not for the better.  </li>
            <li>Lily of the Valley is my favorite flower, we had a big patch of them in the yard of my childhood home.</li>
            <li>As a teenager, it was one of the first fragrances I used.</li>
            <li>I used it a bunch my first year of college because I wanted to find a signature scent to wear.</li>
            <li>Nothing can really match the fresh flower</li>
            <li>but sure enough here</li>
            <li>Plan on purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that you can find something still unchanged or reformulated these days, so the old saying is true, &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>This was my first fragrance growing up.</li>
            <li>This is an old but fabulous fragrence that my wife has used for years.  </li>
            <li>A pretty scent</li>
            <li>Sure enough they do.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that Amazon has made this and other old fragrances available again.  </li>
            <li>Not overwhelming in the least, and very light and beautiful !</li>
            <li>The fragrance seems to last all day, and is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I find a light spray of this just right, and I can simply reapply it when I need to.  </li>
            <li>In this case, I will love this and buy it for as long as Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>My aunt used this fragrance when I was about five years old in the late fifties, and the beautiful scent stayed with me.</li>
            <li>i wore this scent on our wedding day and we have a large bed of the plants in our flower garden.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend Amazon for purchasing items and \\&quot;Muguent Des Bois\\</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading about it in Vogue Magazine - a certain buyer in Bergdorf wears it</li>
            <li>This is a cheap imitation, not even close to the original, not to mention the &#x27;switch&#x27; in product quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and really doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, but it&#x27;s still&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price!</li>
            <li>It is clean, fresh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It is light but lasting</li>
            <li>I doubted anything could smell like real LotV until I smelled this.</li>
            <li>and I still smell it, it hasn&#x27;t changed much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again...</li>
            <li>Very fond of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last all day....</li>
            <li>She says it really smells like &amp;#34;Lilly Of The Valley&amp;#34</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t see it very often in a store now, so I ordered it</li>
            <li>Very youthful but not cheap-smelling.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light enough to reapply as needed.</li>
            <li>On me, though, it is very plastic smelling.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because it fades fast and because the bottle came bubble wrapped without a box.  </li>
            <li>An old scent, but still light and young.  </li>
            <li>and I do not want to see it discontinued like so many of the &amp;#34;good old products&amp;#34; of our younger years.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly the same... sweet memories.</li>
            <li>I have liked this scent since the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34; when designer fragrances weren&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li>Although the scent doesn&#x27;t last really long, it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>This was just right for a 12 yr old girl.  </li>
            <li>(Jessica McClintock being my other favorite.)  </li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find Coty, so I was delighted to be able to order via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice lily of the valley floral scent but it does not last long, however for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is fairly long-lasting and subtle, too.</li>
            <li>Even if just for special occasions  ... please bring it back!</li>
            <li>Wow, this really does smell like lily of the valley!  </li>
            <li>My Mom first bought this for me when I was a young girl in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>this is the exact spray I used when I was a young girl.  </li>
            <li>way at the beginning, but gets better as it dries down.  </li>
            <li>I loved this scent as a teenager in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It was well packaged and in a lovely glass bottle, different than the one I remember as a teen.  </li>
            <li>Some would say the scent wears off too soon, however 9 times out of 10 it&#x27;s not a matter of wearing off quickly, but the individual&#x27;s nose having adjusted to the scent.</li>
            <li>This Coty perfume is a classic.  </li>
            <li>So glad I tried this before ordering more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t appear used, but my Coty L&#x27;aimant, which is the same exact type of bottle, came in a nice little box.</li>
            <li>Put it on and relive your high school romance.</li>
            <li>On my wrists, it smells a little more &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;ish than the bottle itself.  </li>
            <li>An original from long ago!  </li>
            <li>I loved this cologne as a teenager in the late &#x27;60&#x27;s - it is such a pure lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Like the real flower, this cologne is classy yet understated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to some scents, and this one is not bad, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last a long time but that&#x27;s OK by me.</li>
            <li>The odor lingers for more than a few hours and is redreshing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>It does not last long, but I am pleased with the couple of hours it does.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, but I was only able to use less than half of the bottle and it would not longer spray.</li>
            <li>reminds me of those dainty little flowers on the shady side of my childhood home!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, very true-to-flower-smell perfume, no other notes in it.</li>
            <li>Brings back memories and smells exactly like lily of the valley.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly how I remembered it from way back in the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and pretty and should be in every woman&#x27;s perfume wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>been looking for this for several years since I first had it in Paris.</li>
            <li>Lilies of the Valley , as small as they are , have a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not leave reviews, but felt motivated to do so with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong in a &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A gentle, sweet scent for those who don&#x27;t want to be over-powered with heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>It was easy to place the order and it arrived in a few days --</li>
            <li>I really like the fresh smell but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>so I enjoyed this perfume, only one warning to prospective buyers that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>However, I found this to be simply lily of the valley - nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>the product came quickly and was packaged very carefully.  </li>
            <li>But,Boy was I surprised when I was just looking at something on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it frequently this spring.  </li>
            <li>I had when I was young, and this smells just like it.  </li>
            <li>Used it as a young girl</li>
            <li>In the early &#x27;80&#x27;s, Avon came out with a Lily of the Valley perfume.</li>
            <li>Soft floral fragrance that can be worn day or night.  </li>
            <li>I do not like to wear a lot of fragrance, because I have an extremely sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that this fragrance lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>I could not find this in stores and was pleasantly surprised to find it through this seller.  </li>
            <li>Some people feel that it has a sort of bug-spray quality to it; I can see that, but if you spray it over clothing rather than directly on skin, that quality is lessened.</li>
            <li>This scent is one I used often as a teenager and young wife.</li>
            <li>This is the only true Lily of the Valley scent I have every found, and I have tried several different oils and perfumes!  </li>
            <li>This came packaged in enough bubble wrap and protection to probably keep a small child safe if sent through the post office.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, however, still a pretty scent.</li>
            <li>Scent choice is certainly a matter of personal taste, but---Either I mis-remembered this scent from my teen years, or else it has changed.</li>
            <li>It smell OK as long as wet but not for very long.</li>
            <li>, these other scents just became  something that was less &amp;#34;lilies of the valley&amp;#34; and more like the smell of nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>There is barely a discernible fragrance at all!  </li>
            <li>It does not last long, but it really brings out the memories of my mother&#x27;s garden.  </li>
            <li>I find it very primitive and not very earthy.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m lying on my back in the grass near the lily of the valley.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I ordered this Muguet product.  </li>
            <li>It reminded me my young life, when I used that cologne or perfume with the same scent all the time.</li>
            <li>I bought it with fond memories of a light Lily of the Valley scent but it is overpowering even with one small spray...disappointing!</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because there might be a flower note  missing, but right off</li>
            <li>I have worn Curve for years because it has tones of Lily of the Valley, but recently decided to try another fragrance with this flower&#x27;s \\&quot;notes.\\&quot; My only complaint about it is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long, but that is part of the characteristics of a fragrance that is not super sweet or strong.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, a very delicate perfume.  </li>
            <li>For the money this item is OK; but it is very weak, and needed to be re-applied often.</li>
            <li>I call Mom a couple of times a week because we live 1,000 miles from each other.</li>

            <li> Like many unemployed white-collar professionals, I have a lot more time on my hands these days.</li>
            <li> I reminded her she also used to love lily of the valley perfume . . .</li>
            <li> Oh so lovely to smell.</li>
            <li> She passed away more than 10 years ago</li>

            <li> I recalled my mother using this cologne when I was a child, and I remembered the lovely scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a lovely touch of freshness and spring.</li>
            <li> I think I associated this scent with a favorite aunt.</li>

            <li> Always love the smell.</li>
            <li> but it was the most foul smelling perfume I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> The light fragrance is just right and brings me manmy happy memories.</li>
            <li> I keep my bottle in the fridge for a cool, refreshing spritz in the heat of summer!</li>
            <li> The scent is as delightful now as long ago.  </li>
            <li> Love this perfume, smells just like lily of the valley and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It was great to discover I could still purchase this old favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice light, clean scent; not quite what I remembered from my college days, but could just be my changed sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love the price, love how quickly it arrived, and I love how genuine it smells.</li>
            <li> and I wish it were more readily available in stores.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cheap thrills.</li>
            <li> I find the scent to be light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommendation it for anyone who is looking for that scent since it&#x27;s true to its description!!very happy!</li>
            <li> Lily-of-the valley is my favorite flower and Muguet Des Bois has always been the most true to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Lilies of the valley have long been my favorite flower, and nothing is more delightful to me than burying my face in a freshly picked bouquet of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it was available for me to purchase now.</li>
            <li> I still love it and enjoy wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased that it was available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> this is my mother in laws favorite, and the price is fantastic, thank you</li>
            <li> Many scents are available as both colognes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have loved Coty&#x27;s cologne for years and this looks and smells like it is really authentically Coty&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It still has a nice fresh smell just like the lily of the valley</li>
            <li> so I save that for really special occasions!</li>
            <li> then you need to apply more which then makes you have to buy more quick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good value for the money, especially if you love the scent of lily of the valley!</li>
            <li> V nice scent - although it seems to evaporate  terribly fast and no one seems to be able to find a trace of it..</li>
            <li> It almost gave me bit of headache because it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft, light &amp; fresh, spring-time fragrance that has been around for many years because it is so timeless.  </li>
            <li> I loved it when I was a child, and when I was in high school and college.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> Loved this cologne when I was in high school in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like the flowers I grew up loving.</li>
            <li> Of cause, the pricy &amp;#34;Diorissimo&amp;#34; is better, but this one is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s crisp and a very refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I like it for a quick spray if I am going out and want to feel and smell refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for having so many things can&#x27;t be easily procured in the stores!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells just the way I remember it, very light and fresh.......</li>
            <li> It  wasn&#x27;t  quite what I expected  scent wise but was ok!</li>
            <li> Wish more pople would wear fresh light scents like this.</li>
            <li> Muguet is a fabulous scent of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten just how fresh and lovely it is.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> Years ago this fragrance was readily available in stores, then it was not found again.  </li>
            <li> and if you wore it before, it is still the same scent which is great.</li>
            <li> &quot; if you are looking for a light old-fashioned scent.</li>
            <li> Love this fresh lily of the valley fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is simply cheaply fragranced alcohol.</li>
            <li> Light summer scent.</li>
            <li> It used to be widely available.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what compelled me to see if it still existed, but when I saw it available here, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> So happy that Muguet des Bois is back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fragrance I remember, reminds me of lily of the valley flowers; light smell and o.k.</li>
            <li> She is gone now, and smelling this scent has brought back some great memories.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh it smells.  </li>
            <li> The bottle certainly is a great value, and there&#x27;s enough to put a bit in a travel spritzer in your purse to freshen it up during the day.  </li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance having the smell of Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap after all.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for making this available.</li>
            <li> 97 year old mom loved it</li>
            <li> I loved this cologne as a young woman, and wanted to buy it again for my summertime fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling and is very pretty!</li>
            <li> A very light, fresh and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> grand kids grew up remembering gramas unique fresh lilly of the valley scent&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my all time favorite light clean fresh cologne.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume and I was happy to find it as her first bottle was an old bottle my mother had.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend liked this one over the perfume called Lucky that I purchased at the same time, it has a nice floral scent.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast and I was pleased with it when I got it.  </li>
            <li> I even try to grow lily of the valley in my garden, without much success!</li>
            <li> So light and sweet.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells exactly like the lovely Lily Of The Valley.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still worth a buy!</li>
            <li> Success!  </li>
            <li> Having never worn the original formulation, I was hesitant to try this out.  </li>
            <li> Love this fragrance - exactly like Lily of the Valley flowers.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that it was still available and just as I had hoped, when I smelled it the memories came rushing back.</li>
            <li> This is an unusually clean, floral scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for a young woman, or a woman who prefers a simple, clean floral scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean and feminine smell.</li>
            <li> An old favorite!  </li>
            <li> Wow -- love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Glorious, sweet, clean and feminine.</li>
            <li> My mother used to let me wear it on special occasions when I was a kid, so to me it smells like Christmas and</li>
            <li> It was such a clean smell, i loved it.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the same great fragrance I started wearing in the 1970s.</li>
            <li> A great first perfume for a teen or pre-teen girl, too.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a great combination, and I am curious to see how that performs.  </li>
            <li> us Gal&#x27;s that wore this Sweet Lily of the Valley Cologne..</li>
            <li> Perfect for the office, not in the least overpowering.</li>
            <li> This one has the true scent of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li> An overall good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more drawn to earthy, real florals and musk.</li>
            <li> So far this Muguets Des Bois by Coty is really really nice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to others who may like the light fresh scent of Spring and of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, natural lily of the valley fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Muguet Des Bois I loved as a teenager.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same lovely Lily of the Valley scent I remember - very evocative (for me) and brings good memories.</li>
            <li> So nice to find this old &amp;#34;stand</li>
            <li> A favorite since high school - just as I remember it!</li>
            <li> Only reason it gets a 4 is because I lost a good portion of it to greedy bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that we can get it readily from Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a sweet, floral aroma.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet loveliness.</li>
            <li> Just too sweet</li>
            <li> it much better, than others sell oil under name &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;, which has nothing to do with real scent of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a true Lily of the Valley scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance so much, I am ordering another as a gift.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> And the price is so good for such a sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for, I find it here at Amazon, and after a quick search, found lots of listings for Lily of the Valley.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light &amp; \\&quot;spring-y\\&quot;; not heavy, but the fragrance lasts for most of the day without reapplying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they still make it, as it is a forever classic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Love this classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> The service was quick and I saved money.  </li>
            <li> This one has been said to be the most realistic Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, the only one that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache! :)</li>
            <li> IT came quickly and without problems.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with no problem.</li>
            <li> purchased for an elderly friend who used this cologne many years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it locally - she is happy to be smelling the lilies of the valley again - sweet and reminiscent.</li>
            <li> As with Proust&#x27;s madeleines, you can have a satisfying remembrance of things past, and maybe some fragrant dreams of a lightly scented and delightful future.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the scent is long-lasting and very pretty.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable the scent is delicious soft and not overpowering I would definitely order this product again thank you</li>
            <li> It is a light but pretty sent.</li>
            <li> This really smells like the true scent of the lily of the valley flower!</li>
            <li> A new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I was expecting, I now own a bottle of funky, old smelling liquid - nothing pretty about it.  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s such a light, cool fragrance, that I think is appropriate for any age......</li>
            <li> LIGHT, PLEASANT, YOUNG LADIES WILL ESPECIALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> This year I have been looking for a crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s captured very well in this light, summery cologne.  </li>
            <li> I used to love the fragrance when I was a young woman, and it seems, she likes it too.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, no mistaking what it is-I definitely picture the LOTV flower when smelling this.  </li>
            <li> but I think it will smell better directly on clothes, towels, or as a room</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for posting this Old Time Favorite for</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh and &amp;#34;true to the flower&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A timeless scent of lily-of-the-valley; a lovely old fashion fragrance reminenscent of a victorian era.  </li>
            <li> Still love it, and its cheap enough to keep in your purse and spritz throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was pleased, however, I do not know if the bottle is old or the scent has changed but</li>
            <li> This cologne is most like my grandmother&#x27;s when I was young....</li>
            <li> I was splendidly surprised to see  this perfume again and to b e able to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> We often talk about the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; and the happy times we had -- especially the flowers we grew in our gardens.</li>
            <li> Rather nice scent and does have a deep tone of lily of the valley.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have it back.  </li>
            <li> To me they say fresh, spring, and perfection.  </li>
            <li> If you loved this fragrance as much as I did and do, buy the Muguets Des Bois, and take a trip back in time and memory.  </li>
            <li> This is amazingly true to the real scent of Lilly of the Valley!  </li>
            <li> The Lily smells fake...not fresh.</li>
            <li> it smells like fresh Lilly of the Valley blooms.</li>
            <li> Arrived far ahead of estimated delivery date which was very nice as it was ordered standard shipping.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty, and it was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The scent is pure, clean and spring time in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This version of Coty&#x27;s,  Muguet Des Bois, is very close to the original, &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I also loved other bygone scents from Coty like Tigress and Woodhue.</li>
            <li> The perfume is so light, you really don&#x27;t need to worry about overusing it very much.</li>
            <li> The price was right and arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li> I checked around and she was right</li>
            <li> (Mom&#x27;s are always right), although all the clerks fondly remembered it and got a far-away look in their eyes when I asked if they had any in stock.     </li>
            <li> all right...</li>
            <li> I do have to say that when I called to return it, it was handled at once and came off my credit card right away.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t fade right away either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It brings back Sweet Memories so many years ago for me......</li>
            <li> This one was pure, sweet and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it&#x27;s not a very strong scent, not overpowering, though I do love to spritz the stuff on.</li>
            <li> One of the reviews proposes it (Muguet Des Bois) smells like bug spray, and I pick up on that occassionally, but love the light, sweet, fresh, slightly pungent scent.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if it will wear off too fast, but even so, I am very excited about my new perfume.</li>
            <li> My older sister got Muguet Des Bois for her thirteenth birthday ,so I was excited to send it to her also.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of my teenage years, what a great cologne.</li>
            <li> It has a very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; scent with a mild citrus undertone.</li>
            <li> I had a good bottle of that scent from Crabtree and Evelyn, but they&#x27;ve changed their formula and it&#x27;s not true lily of the valley anymore.  </li>
            <li> (I suffer from migraines, and have an extremely low tolerance for strong and sweet aromas.)</li>
            <li> Very light, simple and floral...perfect for every day and any age.</li>
            <li> I wore this years ago and remember it smelling very much like Lily of the Valley</li>
            <li> Not high end, but kinda nice after the alcohol dissipates.</li>
            <li> It will always be my favorite especially in the Spring of the year.</li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;ll love using  it later on when temperatures soar here,</li>
            <li> I just could not BELIEVE it was the same Muguet Cologne that I use to wear many years ago....</li>
            <li> And sure enough it was....</li>
            <li> I  love it especially in the Spring;</li>
            <li> While the fragrance is lovely, especially for summer, it&#x27;s staying power is not.  </li>
            <li> This is literally the first fragrance I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it has no lasting power.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the same as it was many years ago, but I feel that it must have been &amp;#34;updated,&amp;#34; because it wasn&#x27;t as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly as I remember so man years ago.</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle for vanity.</li>
            <li> I think life is maybe too short to wear a scent I don&#x27;t care for when there are many others.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> The formula is quite obviously different and not for the better.  </li>
            <li> Lily of the Valley is my favorite flower, we had a big patch of them in the yard of my childhood home.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, it was one of the first fragrances I used.</li>
            <li> I used it a bunch my first year of college because I wanted to find a signature scent to wear.</li>
            <li> Nothing can really match the fresh flower</li>
            <li> but sure enough here</li>
            <li> Plan on purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that you can find something still unchanged or reformulated these days, so the old saying is true, &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> This was my first fragrance growing up.</li>
            <li> This is an old but fabulous fragrence that my wife has used for years.  </li>
            <li> A pretty scent</li>
            <li> Sure enough they do.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that Amazon has made this and other old fragrances available again.  </li>
            <li> Not overwhelming in the least, and very light and beautiful !</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems to last all day, and is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I find a light spray of this just right, and I can simply reapply it when I need to.  </li>
            <li> In this case, I will love this and buy it for as long as Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li> My aunt used this fragrance when I was about five years old in the late fifties, and the beautiful scent stayed with me.</li>
            <li> i wore this scent on our wedding day and we have a large bed of the plants in our flower garden.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend Amazon for purchasing items and \\&quot;Muguent Des Bois\\</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about it in Vogue Magazine - a certain buyer in Bergdorf wears it</li>
            <li> This is a cheap imitation, not even close to the original, not to mention the &#x27;switch&#x27; in product quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and really doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, but it&#x27;s still&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price!</li>
            <li> It is clean, fresh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is light but lasting</li>
            <li> I doubted anything could smell like real LotV until I smelled this.</li>
            <li> and I still smell it, it hasn&#x27;t changed much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again...</li>
            <li> Very fond of this cologne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last all day....</li>
            <li> She says it really smells like &amp;#34;Lilly Of The Valley&amp;#34</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see it very often in a store now, so I ordered it</li>
            <li> Very youthful but not cheap-smelling.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light enough to reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> On me, though, it is very plastic smelling.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it fades fast and because the bottle came bubble wrapped without a box.  </li>
            <li> An old scent, but still light and young.  </li>
            <li> and I do not want to see it discontinued like so many of the &amp;#34;good old products&amp;#34; of our younger years.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly the same... sweet memories.</li>
            <li> I have liked this scent since the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34; when designer fragrances weren&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li> Although the scent doesn&#x27;t last really long, it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This was just right for a 12 yr old girl.  </li>
            <li> (Jessica McClintock being my other favorite.)  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find Coty, so I was delighted to be able to order via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice lily of the valley floral scent but it does not last long, however for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is fairly long-lasting and subtle, too.</li>
            <li> Even if just for special occasions  ... please bring it back!</li>
            <li> Wow, this really does smell like lily of the valley!  </li>
            <li> My Mom first bought this for me when I was a young girl in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> this is the exact spray I used when I was a young girl.  </li>
            <li> way at the beginning, but gets better as it dries down.  </li>
            <li> I loved this scent as a teenager in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and in a lovely glass bottle, different than the one I remember as a teen.  </li>
            <li> Some would say the scent wears off too soon, however 9 times out of 10 it&#x27;s not a matter of wearing off quickly, but the individual&#x27;s nose having adjusted to the scent.</li>
            <li> This Coty perfume is a classic.  </li>
            <li> So glad I tried this before ordering more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t appear used, but my Coty L&#x27;aimant, which is the same exact type of bottle, came in a nice little box.</li>
            <li> Put it on and relive your high school romance.</li>
            <li> On my wrists, it smells a little more &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;ish than the bottle itself.  </li>
            <li> An original from long ago!  </li>
            <li> I loved this cologne as a teenager in the late &#x27;60&#x27;s - it is such a pure lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Like the real flower, this cologne is classy yet understated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to some scents, and this one is not bad, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last a long time but that&#x27;s OK by me.</li>
            <li> The odor lingers for more than a few hours and is redreshing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> It does not last long, but I am pleased with the couple of hours it does.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but I was only able to use less than half of the bottle and it would not longer spray.</li>
            <li> reminds me of those dainty little flowers on the shady side of my childhood home!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, very true-to-flower-smell perfume, no other notes in it.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories and smells exactly like lily of the valley.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly how I remembered it from way back in the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and pretty and should be in every woman&#x27;s perfume wardrobe.  </li>
            <li> been looking for this for several years since I first had it in Paris.</li>
            <li> Lilies of the Valley , as small as they are , have a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews, but felt motivated to do so with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong in a &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A gentle, sweet scent for those who don&#x27;t want to be over-powered with heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> It was easy to place the order and it arrived in a few days --</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh smell but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> so I enjoyed this perfume, only one warning to prospective buyers that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> However, I found this to be simply lily of the valley - nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li> It smells clean and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> the product came quickly and was packaged very carefully.  </li>
            <li> But,Boy was I surprised when I was just looking at something on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it frequently this spring.  </li>
            <li> I had when I was young, and this smells just like it.  </li>
            <li> Used it as a young girl</li>
            <li> In the early &#x27;80&#x27;s, Avon came out with a Lily of the Valley perfume.</li>
            <li> Soft floral fragrance that can be worn day or night.  </li>
            <li> I do not like to wear a lot of fragrance, because I have an extremely sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that this fragrance lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> I could not find this in stores and was pleasantly surprised to find it through this seller.  </li>
            <li> Some people feel that it has a sort of bug-spray quality to it; I can see that, but if you spray it over clothing rather than directly on skin, that quality is lessened.</li>
            <li> This scent is one I used often as a teenager and young wife.</li>
            <li> This is the only true Lily of the Valley scent I have every found, and I have tried several different oils and perfumes!  </li>
            <li> This came packaged in enough bubble wrap and protection to probably keep a small child safe if sent through the post office.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, however, still a pretty scent.</li>
            <li> Scent choice is certainly a matter of personal taste, but---Either I mis-remembered this scent from my teen years, or else it has changed.</li>
            <li> It smell OK as long as wet but not for very long.</li>
            <li> , these other scents just became  something that was less &amp;#34;lilies of the valley&amp;#34; and more like the smell of nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> There is barely a discernible fragrance at all!  </li>
            <li> It does not last long, but it really brings out the memories of my mother&#x27;s garden.  </li>
            <li> I find it very primitive and not very earthy.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;m lying on my back in the grass near the lily of the valley.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I ordered this Muguet product.  </li>
            <li> It reminded me my young life, when I used that cologne or perfume with the same scent all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought it with fond memories of a light Lily of the Valley scent but it is overpowering even with one small spray...disappointing!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because there might be a flower note  missing, but right off</li>
            <li> I have worn Curve for years because it has tones of Lily of the Valley, but recently decided to try another fragrance with this flower&#x27;s \\&quot;notes.\\&quot; My only complaint about it is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long, but that is part of the characteristics of a fragrance that is not super sweet or strong.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong, a very delicate perfume.  </li>
            <li> For the money this item is OK; but it is very weak, and needed to be re-applied often.</li>
            <li> I call Mom a couple of times a week because we live 1,000 miles from each other.</li>
            <li> Perfume doesn&#x27;t last tremendously long, but I suppose you could always try an essential oil if you wanted it to last for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Diorissimo (vintage) is my absolute favorite, but it&#x27;s both expensive and hard to find</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I will wear it much,</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, however, so spritz every once in a while to surround myself with Kentucky spring here in semi-desert Escondido, CA.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This toilet water is a winner</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about impossible to find this old fashioned pure lilly of the valley smell at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this for a long time .  </li>
            <li> I looked for it for a long time and when I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> My wife suggested I check online -- and Amazon.com came through in big way with a wide variety from which to choose.</li>
            <li> strange...</li>
            <li> For a long time I thought that Coty&#x27;s just discontinued this</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind as long as it&#x27;s done well.</li>
            <li> Cannot stand those fragrances that linger when the person wearing them is long gone.</li>
            <li> One minor quibble -</li>
            <li> I had seen an ad in a magazine for it and tried it out at the local drugstore first before I bought it as I was skeptical that the scent would even come close to the fragrance of the actual lillies of the valley we had growing around my childhood home.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on very long ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the scent stays with you very long</li>
            <li> The smell does not stay very long, though.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had some popular, expensive perfumes that were no better!</li>
            <li> The only bad things, it evaporated very soon, it should stay much longer, than it</li>
            <li> Only down side - lasts for about 30-40min&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I found out this was because the cap had not been secured all the way and was clamped down on the spray mechanism the entire time, dumping out perfume to about a quarter of an inch below the label.</li>
            <li> Some are too cloying; others are just not rich enough.</li>
            <li> I received the perfume sooner than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Would have been simpler to have just set fire to the money spent.</li>
            <li> it was....takes me back to the 60&#x27;s &amp; 70&#x27;s when I used it everyday.......</li>
            <li> This is one of only a few scents that I can stand to be around.  </li>
            <li> so now I am out the money I spent on this and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, both in wearing a spritz or two, and leaving a fragrant impression.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, therefore careful application must be observed, or the cologne will enter a room before the wearer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing any other notes.  </li>
            <li> I was shopping for other perfumes when I decided to search amazon&#x27;s selections and there it was.</li>
            <li> in a Weird way...can exactly identify the scent...</li>
            <li> and I tried other colognes with the &amp;#34;lilies of the valley&amp;#34; scent but after a while</li>
            <li> After trying other brands, I lucked upon this here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day for me and can be faintly detected the following day; so my experience is different from another reviewer who felt it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;last\\&quot; very long.</li>
            <li> Has an under tones of a slight woodsy scent too.</li>
            <li> she said it was nowhere to be found at the typical retail stores.</li>
            <li> Not true Lillie&#x27;s of Valley aroma</li>
            <li> I am not a trendy person, and when I like things, I tend to like them for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When you read the descriptions, they will point out that it is a cologne, which is never as expensive as a perfume, nor does the scent last as long.</li>
            <li> I think my bottle was old-fragrance is very weak and does not last very long.</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl, I used to sell personalized Christmas cards door-to-door to earn money to buy this cologne for my mother.</li>
            <li> A little over powering</li>
            <li> but it fades a little faster than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cap was on cockeyed and the label was missing from the elastic around the bottle neck.  </li>
            <li> I do a few spritzes on my neck and wrists in the morning</li>
            <li> the blue paper label wrapped around my bottle is poorly applied.  </li>
            <li> This is a seriously watered down version of a glorious scent.</li>
            <li> It is sloppily glued on and loose.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a sentimental reason - it was my mom&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> so it also has a sentimental value.</li>
            <li> There is none of the usual identifying information on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Delicate and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Frankly it is hard to find a fragrance I like.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this, but its been around forever.</li>
            <li> It is a hard to find product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find anymore.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to locate.</li>
            <li> all the way...sweet, innocent...but a little tigress underneath!!</li>
            <li> I started buying Coty&#x27;s Muguet des Bois in the late 60s when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Delicate smell.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is what I had expected however, something is wrong with the spraying device and the cap causes leakage</li>
            <li> This perfume definitely smells like lily of the valley; but it&#x27;s also a tad too sweet-smelling, which gives it a slightly artificial (man-made) scent.  </li>
            <li> So when I finally got it, it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This bottle of cologne has NO scent whatsoever once the alcohol evaporates  What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> But at 1/10 the price of other lily of the valley perfumes, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I can still get a subtle whiff of it in the evenings.  </li>
            <li> fragrance has the softest scent of lily of the valley, but (at least on me!)</li>
            <li> out a present for my Mother.  :(</li>
            <li> Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Too bad I waited so long before I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s not made any longer and is so hard to get.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find</li>
            <li> Had a difficult time finding in the stores.  </li>
            <li> and I found if difficult to obtain.   </li>
            <li> a touch of spring that is difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew why it was so difficult to find this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is not an expensive perfume but if you like the smell of Lily of the Valley I believe you will like this product.</li>
            <li> With all this cold weather, made me think of Spring and Muguet(Lily of the Valley)........</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it went bad or</li>
            <li> and it smelled awful (to me).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> Seriously awful.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband and daughters said it smelled awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her upcoming birthday. It&#x27;s what she asked for and she remembered using it and loving the scent of it when we were just teenagers. Hopefully she&#x27;ll love it again when I give it to her.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for me because we both love Lily of the Valley. i wore this scent on our wedding day and we have a large bed of the plants in our flower garden. The Coty brand is the same one I wore 29 years ago. It will always be my favorite especially in the Spring of the year. Makes me think of sitting on the porch in a white summer dress sipping a mint julep!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the fragrance it used to be. This product smells more like bug spray than like perfume.  And, ad says \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;, but it actually is cologne spray.  This is a cheap imitation, not even close to the original, not to mention the &#x27;switch&#x27; in product quality.  I wish Amazon had a \\&quot;NO stars\\&quot; rating.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember from my youth when I wore this scent all the time.  It is light but lasting and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Frankly it is hard to find a fragrance I like. Some are too cloying; others are just not rich enough. Muguet is a fabulous scent of lilies of the valley. It is clean, fresh and lasts a long time. This came packaged in enough bubble wrap and protection to probably keep a small child safe if sent through the post office. Beyond that, this is the same scent I knew growing up and I wish it were more readily available in stores.</li>
            <li> Coty, by far, has the best Muguet Des Bois fragrance.  It is very difficult to find Coty, so I was delighted to be able to order via Amazon.  The price was excellent.  This cologne has been a life-long preference for me.  I even try to grow lily of the valley in my garden, without much success!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cheap thrills. I doubted anything could smell like real LotV until I smelled this. Glorious, sweet, clean and feminine. A new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, gentle scent.</li>
            <li> V nice scent - although it seems to evaporate  terribly fast and no one seems to be able to find a trace of it.. If you don&#x27;t mind reapplying it all day, this could be for you.</li>
            <li> Gift for one of my granddaughters. I used to love the fragrance when I was a young woman, and it seems, she likes it too.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this, but it lasts about 2hrs then you need to apply more which then makes you have to buy more quick. I loved the price till I found out about its staying power.</li>
            <li> I loved this scent as a teenager in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s. I had forgotten just how fresh and lovely it is. Very light, simple and floral...perfect for every day and any age. The seller is spot-on with fast shipping and excellent communication.</li>
            <li> Wow, this really does smell like lily of the valley!  Especially when you smell the spray nozzle.  On my wrists, it smells a little more &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;ish than the bottle itself.  I&#x27;ve had it on for about an hour and I still smell it, it hasn&#x27;t changed much.  Just one spray.  It smells nice, no mistaking what it is-I definitely picture the LOTV flower when smelling this.  I&#x27;m not noticing any other notes.  It&#x27;s a little strong in a &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; way at the beginning, but gets better as it dries down.  It almost gave me bit of headache because it&#x27;s strong.  I&#x27;m sensitive to some scents, and this one is not bad, especially for the price.  I&#x27;ve had others that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I will wear it much, but I think it will smell better directly on clothes, towels, or as a room spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odd thing-I received it without a product box, wrapped in bubble wrap.  It didn&#x27;t appear used, but my Coty L&#x27;aimant, which is the same exact type of bottle, came in a nice little box.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is timeless in its appeal, i have loved this for years but could not find it. Fresh, light beautiful fragrance suitable for anyone .</li>
            <li> Brings back memories and smells exactly like lily of the valley.  Perfume doesn&#x27;t last tremendously long, but I suppose you could always try an essential oil if you wanted it to last for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason that this has been in production for decades. Even master french perfumers acknowledge this as THE standard for Lily of the Valley scents.</li>
            <li> It  wasn&#x27;t  quite what I expected  scent wise but was ok!</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume as a teenager but then forgot all about it. I was shopping for other perfumes when I decided to search amazon&#x27;s selections and there it was. My older sister got Muguet Des Bois for her thirteenth birthday ,so I was excited to send it to her also. It is as beautiful a smell today as it was 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> With the arrival of Easter season, grocery stores in my area of No. Florida begin selling flowers of the season, among them tulips &amp; daffodils ......The fragrance of the daffodils reminded me of Lily of the Vally&#x27;s and the cologne I wore when I was a teen.  It seems that no matter what it is I&#x27;m looking for, I find it here at Amazon, and after a quick search, found lots of listings for Lily of the Valley.    This cologne hasn&#x27;t changed at all and is as I remembered it.     I&#x27;m enjoying it now and I know I&#x27;ll love using  it later on when temperatures soar here, since it&#x27;s such a light, cool fragrance, that I think is appropriate for any age......from \\&quot;tween\\&quot; to great grandma..........I just love it.</li>
            <li> I have loved this since I was a teenager but could not find it in the stores.  This is the only true Lily of the Valley scent I have every found, and I have tried several different oils and perfumes!  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed! I will buy again and again!!!</li>
            <li> Wow...Finally, I have found someone selling Muguet Des Bois by Coty Cologne Spray...I wore this Cologne 40 years ago and just LOVE IT...&lt;br /&gt;My husband had given me Muguet for my birthday one year, and I always received so many Compliments on how good it smelled on me..I could never find this Cologne anywhere for years,and I just thought Coty had stopped making Muguet...But,Boy was I surprised when I was just looking at something on Amazon.Com. I entered in Muguet Des Bois in the Search and \\&quot;BINGO\\&quot; there it was...I just could not BELIEVE it was the same Muguet Cologne that I use to wear many years ago....And sure enough it was....Thank you Amazon for posting this Old Time Favorite for us Gal&#x27;s that wore this Sweet Lily of the Valley Cologne..I placed my order and within 2 days I had my Muguet...Thanks again...&lt;br /&gt;It brings back Sweet Memories so many years ago for me......</li>
            <li> Lilly of the Valley is my all-time favorite scent. I can&#x27;t believe I found it and for such a great price! It smells wonderful, and now everyone in my office wants it.</li>
            <li> beautiful fragrance...Lily of the Valley.  Delicate and not overwhelming.  Clean and fresh.  Does not aggravate my allergies or asthma. Lovely...</li>
            <li> Smells just like Lily of the Valley. Lasts fairly well. For the money it is an excellent product. Came immediately :)</li>
            <li> This did not smell the way I remember . my grandmother used to wear it and I remember a fresher, cleaner smell. But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> smells like bug repellant to me.  I have no idea how this has so many good reviews.  will be sending back.</li>
            <li> We received the above product, on Christmas Eve, before they even said that it would arrive.  We were very happy with the shipper&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> This is just as I remember!  I had forgotten about it &amp; ordered this bottle.  I have been wearing it frequently this spring.  It&#x27;s light &amp; \\&quot;spring-y\\&quot;; not heavy, but the fragrance lasts for most of the day without reapplying.  It&#x27;s very refreshing; wonderful!</li>
            <li> Smells like lilies.  It reminds me of my childhood and a perfume my beloved Grandmother had...</li>
            <li> Smells soooo wonderful! Just like the flower. Can&#x27;t beat the price, plus free shipping. Love it!</li>
            <li> My Grandmother always wore this and I cannot buy it in the drugstore any more.  I  love it especially in the Spring;</li>
            <li> It was great to discover I could still purchase this old favorite. Some fragrances never lose their appeal and lily of the valley is one of them.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. So light and sweet. Just like Lilly of the Valley.</li>
            <li> Love this spray. My Mother wore Lilly of the Valley. It&#x27;s difficult to find</li>
            <li> Muguet Des Bois By Coty For Women. Cologne...my boyfriend liked this one over the perfume called Lucky that I purchased at the same time, it has a nice floral scent.  I still like Romance and the Beautiful for floral scents, but I still have much more to try since I don&#x27;t buy too many.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this for a long time .  It is the same as in my youth and am a happy camper!</li>
            <li> Same fragrance I remembered!</li>
            <li> This was just right for a 12 yr old girl.  An old scent, but still light and young.  It seemed to me to take a while to get here, but was packed well</li>
            <li> This is everything I hoped it would be. Smells exactly like the flowers I grew up loving. Still waiting to see if it will wear off too fast, but even so, I am very excited about my new perfume. Not overwhelming in the least, and very light and beautiful !</li>
            <li> I wore this in HS and college (I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s now!!!). Can&#x27;t find it in brick and mortar stores anymore...sigh.&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance has the softest scent of lily of the valley, but (at least on me!) it has great staying power. Just a wonderful feminine floral scent. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s a wonderful fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance as remembered...but their chemistry or mine has changed.  While the fragrance is lovely, especially for summer, it&#x27;s staying power is not.  For that reason I would not buy it again..but everybody is different...</li>
            <li> Want to go back in time? This will do it in the most wonderful way! I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> The perfume is wonderful.  The bottle was way prettier in the 60s and 70s. Coty needs to make an edition that does not have a spray, just open and spash on. The perfume is so light, you really don&#x27;t need to worry about overusing it very much.</li>
            <li> This version of Coty&#x27;s,  Muguet Des Bois, is very close to the original, &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley&amp;#34;  scent.  I&#x27;m glad they still make it, as it is a forever classic fragrance.  I gave it 4 stars because there might be a flower note  missing, but right off, you know it&#x27;s the lily of the valley scent.  This would be great to wear during the spring or summer months.</li>
            <li> Lily of the Valley.... smells like it. Only down side - lasts for about 30-40min&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered it!  Arrived on promised time and great price</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance as a teen.  I loved it&#x27;s fresh and &amp;#34;true to the flower&amp;#34; scent.  It was eventually taken off the market and though I searched periodically couldn&#x27;t find it.  I was thrilled to find this fragrance again and received it promptly from the seller.  It was well packaged and in a lovely glass bottle, different than the one I remember as a teen.  The best part is the wonderful fragrance!  I am going to order another one before it disappears again!</li>
            <li> Love this classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent.  Reminds me of some sort of insecticide.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very fond of this cologne.  Had a difficult time finding in the stores.  Happy to have been able to purchase on the computer.  Will gladly purchase again.  Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Introduced to Muguet des Bois by Coty years ago, and have loved it ever since. Like the real flower, this cologne is classy yet understated. Some would say the scent wears off too soon, however 9 times out of 10 it&#x27;s not a matter of wearing off quickly, but the individual&#x27;s nose having adjusted to the scent. A little goes a long way, both in wearing a spritz or two, and leaving a fragrant impression.</li>
            <li> great price, great service and fun name for the shop: &#x27;stardust&#x27;!</li>
            <li> One of my all-time favorite scents, reminds me of spring when I was a child!</li>
            <li> I started buying Coty&#x27;s Muguet des Bois in the late 60s when I was a teenager. I had seen an ad in a magazine for it and tried it out at the local drugstore first before I bought it as I was skeptical that the scent would even come close to the fragrance of the actual lillies of the valley we had growing around my childhood home.  But it smelled just like the flowers in our garden and I&#x27;ve been buying this fragrance ever since.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it here.  It&#x27;s the perfect scent for when you want something light, sweet and clean smelling.  It will remind you of springtime.  Perfect for the office, not in the least overpowering.</li>
            <li> This was my grandmother&#x27;s favorite scent and now it is my daughter&#x27;s. This one has the true scent of lilies of the valley. Lovely!</li>
            <li> An original from long ago!  Lovely fragrance and great price!!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells exactly like the lovely Lily Of The Valley.  I love the scent, and it stays with you instead of fading away.</li>
            <li> I feel 16 again!! Love it, love the price, love how quickly it arrived, and I love how genuine it smells. It doesn&#x27;t last a long time but that&#x27;s OK by me.</li>
            <li> Yeah,  it was a gift for a gf</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this in stores.  And Lilly of the Valley will not grow in Texas and I love their fragrance. The service was quick and I saved money.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Its OK. Widh it was, Imprevu by Coty!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, smells just like lily of the valley and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> This was a delightful surprise.  Had never encountered it before so I just took a chance in buying it.  It&#x27;s great.  Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE FRAGERANCES THAT REMIND ME OF MY MOM&#x27;S GARDEN. LIGHT, PLEASANT, YOUNG LADIES WILL ESPECIALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I was remembering this perfume my mother used to wear and searched for it.  Of course it was on Amazon.  It is just the same as the product sold in the 70s.  It does fade, but I love the fragrance when I spray it on after a shower.</li>
            <li> It was everything I remember it being! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was a memeory gift for my daughter.  She was so pleased.  The price was right and arrived as promised.  Great service!</li>
            <li> A timeless scent of lily-of-the-valley; a lovely old fashion fragrance reminenscent of a victorian era.  It reminds me of my Grandmother!</li>
            <li> For the money this item is OK; but it is very weak, and needed to be re-applied often.</li>
            <li> This is exactly how I remembered it from way back in the day. It&#x27;s a lovely refreshing Lily of the Valley the scent that will get you compliments. I don&#x27;t think it has great staying power, but what can you expect for the price? It&#x27;s still worth a buy!</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of lilly of the valley so went on a search for a perfume with this scent. The search brought me to this all time favorite. From the reviews I have read it has been around for quite some time(reason I bought it)and has been loved by people for many years. The scent is pure, clean and spring time in a bottle. The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long. Still love it, and its cheap enough to keep in your purse and spritz throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I wore this years ago and remember it smelling very much like Lily of the Valley and I loved it.  I looked for it for a long time and when I found it on Amazon I was pleased, however, I do not know if the bottle is old or the scent has changed but this is much more musk-like than I remember. I hope to find some that smells like I remember.</li>
            <li> Ah, it&#x27;s just as I remembered it........reminds me of those dainty little flowers on the shady side of my childhood home!  So happy to find it here!  A gentle, sweet scent for those who don&#x27;t want to be over-powered with heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance fresh, light Great value too</li>
            <li> Great price, prompt delivery and very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am not a perfume person. This is literally the first fragrance I have ever purchased. I love lilies of the valley and this was one of the highest rated products with amazon prime. It is incredible. I find the scent to be light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> My fave scent for spring and summer. I&#x27;ve had this brand before and mostly happy with it, except it tends to fade a bit fast. I also use Lily of the Valley body powder to give some &amp;#34;ooomph&amp;#34; to the lasting power. An overall good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This cologne is most like my grandmother&#x27;s when I was young....way back in the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked it and cannot find it in the stores....except those that are off scent or are soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last all day....but it is not overpowering, a lovely scent, and it is nice to smell it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will re-order more in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was reminiscing about the lilly of the valley perfume I had when I was young, and this smells just like it.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and smells wonderful.  I just wish the aroma would last longer (it&#x27;s dulled by mid-day).  It smells so good!  And did I mention I love the smell?!?!</li>
            <li> Exquisite scent, although since it is a cologne, the fragrance is not long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it has no lasting power.  I can&#x27;t detect it after only an hour or so.</li>
            <li> This toilet water is a winner and I will order it again. The odor lingers for more than a few hours and is redreshing</li>
            <li> This is not the fragrance I remembered from my childhood.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom, and she loves it! Has a light, pleasant scent that I liked as well.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent....same crappy Coty bottle.</li>
            <li> ....delicious......sweet fragrance....&lt;br /&gt;originally purchased for my sister as a retro birthday gift years ago off of ebay....&lt;br /&gt;now? it is the 2nd bottle i have purchased for myself here on amazon....&lt;br /&gt;love it!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the same as it was many years ago, but I feel that it must have been &amp;#34;updated,&amp;#34; because it wasn&#x27;t as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> It smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorites for over 40 years!</li>
            <li> Beautiful.just like I remembered it to be in the 60&#x27;s. It arrived on time,in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Just the way I remembered this cologne!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a sentimental reason - it was my mom&#x27;s scent and I wanted to wear during Mother&#x27;s Day. I have to say, the scent is long-lasting and very pretty. Not overwhelming at all. It reminds me of my mother, so it&#x27;s just perfect. I&#x27;ll wear all summer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lily of the valley floral scent but it does not last long, however for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. She says it really smells like &amp;#34;Lilly Of The Valley&amp;#34; Her husband already bought her a bottle too but she told me she is ok with having two of them.</li>
            <li> Perfect and brings back a lot of fond memories of my mom and grandmother. I bought this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was splendidly surprised to see  this perfume again and to b e able to purchase it.  I bought several bottles.  Years ago this fragrance was readily available in stores, then it was not found again.  This fragrance is great to wear in summer as it is light and fresh.  I even spray it in the bedroom just to have the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a scent I love and if you wore it before, it is still the same scent which is great.</li>
            <li> I received the perfume sooner than I had expected. It smells exactly as I remember so man years ago. If you love Lily of the Valley this is the perfume for you. I am so glad that I purchased 2 of them!!</li>
            <li> I love the perfume, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable the scent is delicious soft and not overpowering I would definitely order this product again thank you</li>
            <li> Hard to find this, but its been around forever. Was thrilled when I found it here!!  And the price was great too.</li>
            <li> Quite rancid, not at all like Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim....but I just love to wear it.  It&#x27;s very light and really doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, but it&#x27;s still&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price!</li>
            <li> It us an ok scent, but does not even reming Lilly of the Valley. I do not understand why should Amazon misrepresent the product?  French know what Lilly of the valley smells like - they invented Diorissimo and they have the flower! We do too! This scent has nothing to do with the flower.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in the 1960&#x27;s. I absolutely love this Lily of the valley scent. Has an under tones of a slight woodsy scent too.</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Lily of the Valley\\&quot; for my Mom, who&#x27;s 92 and in a nursing home.  She had asked for the Lily of the Valley scent earlier and I found if difficult to obtain.   I went to Amazon and when I typed \\&quot;Lily of the Valley\\&quot; in the search engine, up came \\&quot;Muguet Des Bois,\\&quot; which is \\&quot;Lily of the Valley\\&quot; in French.  I am so glad that I found this scent and it has made my Mom&#x27;s days much more happier.  I would certainly recommend Amazon for purchasing items and \\&quot;Muguent Des Bois\\&quot; if you are looking for a light old-fashioned scent.</li>
            <li> Like many unemployed white-collar professionals, I have a lot more time on my hands these days. I call Mom a couple of times a week because we live 1,000 miles from each other. We often talk about the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; and the happy times we had -- especially the flowers we grew in our gardens. One of her favorites -- because of the short-lived, intoxicating fragrance -- was lily of the valley. I reminded her she also used to love lily of the valley perfume . . . she said it was nowhere to be found at the typical retail stores. I checked around and she was right (Mom&#x27;s are always right), although all the clerks fondly remembered it and got a far-away look in their eyes when I asked if they had any in stock.     My wife suggested I check online -- and Amazon.com came through in big way with a wide variety from which to choose. I selected Muquet Des Bois by Coty for Women, Colgne Spray as a surprise birthday gift for Mom. It was easy to place the order and it arrived in a few days -- my mom was thrilled -- she even wore it when she went to bed and claims it was the best night&#x27;s sleep she&#x27;s experienced in years.</li>
            <li> 97 year old mom loved it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Oh so lovely to smell. Pretty bottle for vanity.</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl, I used to sell personalized Christmas cards door-to-door to earn money to buy this cologne for my mother. She was always delighted by it, and I thought it smelled like heaven. She passed away more than 10 years ago and I wanted a reminder of those happy times. I was delighted to find that it was still available and just as I had hoped, when I smelled it the memories came rushing back.</li>
            <li> My favorite for my wife of 39 years !  Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love this fresh lily of the valley fragrance.  The price is unbeatable.  Of cause, the pricy &amp;#34;Diorissimo&amp;#34; is better, but this one is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Rather nice scent and does have a deep tone of lily of the valley. Very fresh smelling and is very pretty! I would order this again!</li>
            <li> a touch of spring that is difficult to find in the stores. Used it as a young girl and I do not want to see it discontinued like so many of the &amp;#34;good old products&amp;#34; of our younger years.</li>
            <li> It does not appeal to me and I understand it&#x27;s an oldschool fragrance. I find it very primitive and not very earthy. I&#x27;m more drawn to earthy, real florals and musk. This is simply cheaply fragranced alcohol.</li>
            <li> I used to use this perfume all the time as a teen (back in the 60s, hah.) You don&#x27;t see it very often in a store now, so I ordered it and I&#x27;m so pleased that it still smells as good as I remember!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found muguet here on amazon&lt;br /&gt;My mother used to love this fragrance! I would buy it for her every year for mothers day in the 80s and 90s and then it became unavaliable.&lt;br /&gt;the grand kids grew up remembering gramas unique fresh lilly of the valley scent&lt;br /&gt;well my mom has since passed on but the fragrance she once wore lives on, I bought a bottle for myself and every time I wear it I think of her .</li>
            <li> My boyfriend in HS used to buy this for me. Light summer scent. Put it on and relive your high school romance.</li>
            <li> My mom has always loved this perfume.  I used to get it for her all the time and then it wasn&#x27;t made anymore for a while.  It is nice to have it back.  It is a light but pretty sent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> One of the things said of this scent...it had popularity when WW2 broke out....and many service men had memories of this scent since their girlfriends wore it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it memorable all right...in a Weird way...can exactly identify the scent...strange...I think of gun barrels....rivets...and planes coming off the assembly line...Industrial scents??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I know ha.</li>
            <li> Not true Lillie&#x27;s of Valley aroma</li>
            <li> Scent choice is certainly a matter of personal taste, but---Either I mis-remembered this scent from my teen years, or else it has changed. Still debating whether to toss it (likely). I think life is maybe too short to wear a scent I don&#x27;t care for when there are many others.</li>
            <li> I have loved Muguet des Bois as a summer fragrance for almost 40 years. It used to be widely available. Then only Crabtree &amp; Evelyn stocked it. When they discontinued it, I was bereft. But I found it on Amazon, who of course, has EVERYTHING. This is exactly the same great fragrance I started wearing in the 1970s. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying hard-to-find items!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my elderly mother who was looking for quite some time for a lily of the valley fragrance.  This one was pure, sweet and inexpensive.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on very long ...</li>
            <li> Not high end, but kinda nice after the alcohol dissipates. I&#x27;ve always loved lily of the valley.</li>
            <li> I have loved Coty&#x27;s cologne for years and this looks and smells like it is really authentically Coty&#x27;s. For a long time I thought that Coty&#x27;s just discontinued this and I tried other colognes with the &amp;#34;lilies of the valley&amp;#34; scent but after a while, these other scents just became  something that was less &amp;#34;lilies of the valley&amp;#34; and more like the smell of nail polish remover.  So far this Muguets Des Bois by Coty is really really nice. I would recommend this to others who may like the light fresh scent of Spring and of lilies of the valley.</li>
            <li> purchased for an elderly friend who used this cologne many years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it locally - she is happy to be smelling the lilies of the valley again - sweet and reminiscent.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Lilly&#x27;s of the Valley.</li>
            <li> It is just how I remember it from years ago. A bit biting.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  It has a nice, natural lily of the valley fragrance.</li>
            <li> Arrived far ahead of estimated delivery date which was very nice as it was ordered standard shipping. My daughter loves this perfume and I was happy to find it as her first bottle was an old bottle my mother had. I didn&#x27;t believe that they made it anymore. This is the second year I&#x27;ve ordered from this company and have received excellent service each time. Will order from them again :)</li>
            <li> This is an unusually clean, floral scent. Very youthful but not cheap-smelling. I only wish it lasted longer. I get maybe an hour out of it before it needs re-applying. But I&#x27;ve had some popular, expensive perfumes that were no better!</li>
            <li> My wife has worn this for many years.  This bottle of cologne has NO scent whatsoever once the alcohol evaporates  What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I love this. I love the smell of lily of the valley. It smells clean and it last a long time. The bottle is beautiful. It is a hard to find product. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I love it.</li>
            <li> just as described. thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent scent! This really smells like the true scent of the lily of the valley flower!</li>
            <li> This is part of my memories, and I was thrilled to find it.  I love Lily of the Valley scent -- that&#x27;s Muguet Des Bois in French.  I had a good bottle of that scent from Crabtree and Evelyn, but they&#x27;ve changed their formula and it&#x27;s not true lily of the valley anymore.  This is!  I doubt this is available anywhere in my city, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find it from Amazon.  Very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Muguet Des Bois I loved as a teenager.  The formula is quite obviously different and not for the better.  Instead of the lovely lily of the valley fragrance I was expecting, I now own a bottle of funky, old smelling liquid - nothing pretty about it.  This item cannot be returned, so buyer be ware.  Also, the cap was on cockeyed and the label was missing from the elastic around the bottle neck.  Doesn&#x27;t even deserve the one star I had to give it in order to leave this feedback.  Would have been simpler to have just set fire to the money spent.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes of all time.  It was my favorite in the 70&#x27;s - it is one of my favorites now.  (Jessica McClintock being my other favorite.)  There is nothing as light and wonderful as Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the cologne.  The fragrance is just as I remember it (I haven&#x27;t used it in many years.)  The bottle is pretty, and it was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Great Deal!  I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Got it for my mom and she loves it!! Definitely recommendation it for anyone who is looking for that scent since it&#x27;s true to its description!!very happy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same lovely Lily of the Valley scent I remember - very evocative (for me) and brings good memories. Lily of the Valley is my favorite flower, we had a big patch of them in the yard of my childhood home. Some &#x27;perfumistas&#x27; don&#x27;t like the scent because its synthetic but I don&#x27;t mind as long as it&#x27;s done well. Diorissimo (vintage) is my absolute favorite, but it&#x27;s both expensive and hard to find so I save that for really special occasions! Muguet Des Bois is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragrance  for the summer.  My mother  wore it and I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  It&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s crisp and a very refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than Crabtree-Evelyn brand. Light fragrance. Goes well with Taylor of London Lily of the Valley talcum powder. Does not bother my patients&#x27; allergies</li>
            <li> My mom loves the lilly of the valley and it&#x27;s about impossible to find this old fashioned pure lilly of the valley smell at a reasonable price. Probably not something you want to wear unless you are 80 though. Otherwise, very true-to-flower-smell perfume, no other notes in it.</li>
            <li> In the early &#x27;80&#x27;s, Avon came out with a Lily of the Valley perfume. It came with a Harlequin romance novel. I really liked that perfume. This year I have been looking for a crisp, clean scent. I remembered that perfume and researched them. This one has been said to be the most realistic Lily of the Valley. It didn&#x27;t disappoint! I love this scent! I think it&#x27;s nicer than the one I remember from Avon.</li>
            <li> My aunt used this fragrance when I was about five years old in the late fifties, and the beautiful scent stayed with me. As a teenager, it was one of the first fragrances I used. I don&#x27;t know what compelled me to see if it still existed, but when I saw it available here, I ordered it. It smells exactly the same... sweet memories.</li>
            <li> I am almost out. I used it a bunch my first year of college because I wanted to find a signature scent to wear. We used to have lilies of the valley out front at my childhood home so it also has a sentimental value. On top of that, it&#x27;s not a very strong scent, not overpowering, though I do love to spritz the stuff on. Smells fantastic. I&#x27;ll probably be buying again.</li>
            <li> An old favorite!  I wear it every day!</li>
            <li> So nice to find this old &amp;#34;stand-by&amp;#34; -- my Mom wore it and Emeraude, and it reminds me of her every time! Fragrance is fairly long-lasting and subtle, too.</li>
            <li> A favorite since high school - just as I remember it!</li>
            <li> Not the brand I was thinking of from my youth… does not smell like lilly of the valley!</li>
            <li> This smells like a jasmin garden - very pleasant</li>
            <li> For some reason, my mom loves this stuff. Whatever.</li>
            <li> This Coty perfume is a classic.  It&#x27;s simple and pretty and should be in every woman&#x27;s perfume wardrobe.  A great first perfume for a teen or pre-teen girl, too.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect scent for those who like Lily of the Valley. I don&#x27;t think the scent stays with you very long but it&#x27;s light enough to reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> Lily-of-the valley is my favorite flower and Muguet Des Bois has always been the most true to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> There is barely a discernible fragrance at all!  Not at all the scent I remember by Coty from years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but I was only able to use less than half of the bottle and it would not longer spray. There is no way to get the bottle apart to fix the sprayer either</li>
            <li> My all time favorite colognes.  Soft floral fragrance that can be worn day or night.  So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this fragrance again.  I loved it when I was a child, and when I was in high school and college.  Lilies of the valley have long been my favorite flower, and nothing is more delightful to me than burying my face in a freshly picked bouquet of them.  To me they say fresh, spring, and perfection.  I wish I knew why it was so difficult to find this fragrance.  It disappeared from store shelves years ago, and it took me until December to try Amazon.  Success!  When I opened the box I was hit with with a delightful whiff of fragrance, and the box and packaging smelled enticingly of lily of the valley.  The box is now the only fragrant thing I have ever put in the recycling bin.  I do not like to wear a lot of fragrance, because I have an extremely sensitive nose.  I find a light spray of this just right, and I can simply reapply it when I need to.  I am thrilled that Amazon has made this and other old fragrances available again.  I am not a trendy person, and when I like things, I tend to like them for a long time.  In this case, I will love this and buy it for as long as Amazon carries it.  I am also going to order the Yardley lily of the valley soap.  It sounds like a great combination, and I am curious to see how that performs.  If you loved this fragrance as much as I did and do, buy the Muguets Des Bois, and take a trip back in time and memory.  You will be glad you did.  As with Proust&#x27;s madeleines, you can have a satisfying remembrance of things past, and maybe some fragrant dreams of a lightly scented and delightful future.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box this came in up, the entire thing smelled like Muguet des Bois. I found out this was because the cap had not been secured all the way and was clamped down on the spray mechanism the entire time, dumping out perfume to about a quarter of an inch below the label. It was all stuck in the bubble wrap that was around the bottle and so it didn&#x27;t leak everywhere, but it was pooled around the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells exactly as I remember (like lily of the valley), and is perfect. Only reason it gets a 4 is because I lost a good portion of it to greedy bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Delicate smell.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very traditional fragrance and it does smell like lilies of the valley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for a young woman, or a woman who prefers a simple, clean floral scent.</li>
            <li> mmsmells nice thank you</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It is hard to find anymore. I am so glad that we can get it readily from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon and both times the product came quickly and was packaged very carefully.  I was surprised that this fragrance lasted all day.  I do a few spritzes on my neck and wrists in the morning and I can still get a subtle whiff of it in the evenings.  It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and it&#x27;s a sweet, floral aroma.  I will purchase another bottle of this when I deplete the one I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Muguet Des Bois since I was 12, and I love it.  I just wish I could find the perfume instead of the cologne since I have to re-spray every 2 hours.</li>
            <li> smells like lemons.  I was expecting more of a flower smell.</li>
            <li> I wore this sent 45 years ago. What a pleasure to find it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and got a bottle without a spray thing on top so was useless. I was sent another bottle that works and I feel like I&#x27;m lying on my back in the grass near the lily of the valley. I would pinch them off and breath in, intoxicated by it&#x27;s sweet loveliness. Nothing can really match the fresh flower but I wear it even when I&#x27;m home alone. It doesn&#x27;t last long, however, so spritz every once in a while to surround myself with Kentucky spring here in semi-desert Escondido, CA.</li>
            <li> LOVE the old-school, Lily of the Valley fragrance!! I looked for this for many years in stores, and soooo glad that I can buy it online now. My favorite perfume, the only one that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache! :)</li>
            <li> Takes me back to my teen years. But still a wonderful light fresh floral that is perfect for every day. So happy that Muguet des Bois is back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fragrance I remember, reminds me of lily of the valley flowers; light smell and o.k. or teens too.</li>
            <li> I spray it on once or twice a day.  The only problem is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I have liked this scent since the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34; when designer fragrances weren&#x27;t such a big deal. I also loved other bygone scents from Coty like Tigress and Woodhue. I recently bought the Muget as a birthday present for my sister, who has been looking around for it unsuccessfully in stores.</li>
            <li> Very happy with scent. Product was packaged sufficiently and arrived on time. Will purchase again when this bottle runs out (which may be soon, based on daily use!)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  My Mom first bought this for me when I was a young girl in the 1970&#x27;s.  It has a light, floral, &#x27;lily of the valley&#x27; smell and is perfect for someone who does not want an over powering scent.  My Mom wore this too.  She is gone now, and smelling this scent has brought back some great memories.  I could not find this in stores and was pleasantly surprised to find it through this seller.  Shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li> I wear this every spring. Love it</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of my teenage years, what a great cologne. Great price so nice for Summer, I love wearing it and my husband even made a comment about how good it is</li>
            <li> With all this cold weather, made me think of Spring and Muguet(Lily of the Valley)........Never thought I&#x27;d find it but sure enough here it was....takes me back to the 60&#x27;s &amp; 70&#x27;s when I used it everyday.......ordered yesterday and received today...AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne.  Too bad it&#x27;s not made any longer and is so hard to get.  Wish they would bring it back.</li>
            <li> I did not order this, I ordered Emeraude and this was sent instead.  When it arrived the bottle must have cracked because I got the perfume all over my hand and it smelled awful (to me).  I do have to say that when I called to return it, it was handled at once and came off my credit card right away.</li>
            <li> this is the exact spray I used when I was a young girl.  I loved it then and I still love it now. I&#x27;m so glad it was available for me to purchase now. IT came quickly and without problems. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  So glad I tried this before ordering more expensive versions.  Betty Draper all the way...sweet, innocent...but a little tigress underneath!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, however, still a pretty scent. The smell does not stay very long, though. I have been keeping this in my car as an emergency backup perfume just in case. Definitely not the same perfume I remember using as a teenager.</li>
            <li> If you love the way the flower &amp;#34;Lilies of the Valley&amp;#34; smells, this perfume is for you.  Smells just like the flower; not too overpowering, either!</li>
            <li> I think my bottle was old-fragrance is very weak and does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it, but my coworker loves it and so does his wife, so it went to a good home. It has a very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; scent with a mild citrus undertone. On me, though, it is very plastic smelling. Never know how a perfume will smell until you wear it!</li>
            <li> I looked every where for this item not for me .The girl that wanted it tried every where just  like I did.Her Mom used to use it all the time It was called i think Lilly of the valley.She was do happy that i got it for her .You might think I gave her a million dollars.I hope in the future I will get it again..Thank You  Have  a great day  Dorothy</li>
            <li> Muguet Des Bois By Coty For Women. Cologne Spray 1.8 Oz&lt;br /&gt;Coty&lt;br /&gt;like it&lt;br /&gt;it &#x27;s a gift&lt;br /&gt;she likes it a lot&lt;br /&gt;price good too&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> The fragrance is what I had expected however, something is wrong with the spraying device and the cap causes leakage</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh smell but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with no problem. A lily of the valley fragrance that is timeless and refreshing.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used to wear this and I keep a bottle to help me remember her. I wear it sometimes as well and it&#x27;s a really beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance purchase was a mistake.  I thought I was buying Emeraude, which is also from Coty.  The bottles look alike, or so my memory tells me.  A friend and I were talking about fragrances that lingered in our minds from the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s so I placed the order.  Apparently, I ordered this Muguet product.  It&#x27;s awful.  Seriously awful.  And perfume purchases aren&#x27;t returnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let that be a lesson.  Don&#x27;t buy cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Wow -- love this perfume! It&#x27;s the best lily of the valley that I own. And the price is so good for such a sweet scent. I only wish it lasted longer. Plus, I wish Coty would bring back the powder with puff (what a sumptuous experience). I have two bottles left, I could sell them for twice what I paid -- but, NO WAY! I love this perfume. Oh, please bring it back, Coty! Even if just for special occasions  ... please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I love Lily of the Valley. This is a seriously watered down version of a glorious scent. But at 1/10 the price of other lily of the valley perfumes, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Cody products, I love all the line of cosmetics.  I wish the odor would last longer, maybe I&#x27;ll upgrade later.</li>
            <li> Lily of the Valleys are my favorite flower scent, and my mom told me I should try this perfume. It is very light,not heavy or musky at all. I wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> Loved it when I was a teenager, love it now</li>
            <li> Great price.  Wonderful fragrance.  My ethnic Lao wife loves the fragrance which makes me happy in so many ways.</li>
            <li> Item as described, Quick shipment - lily of the valley is a wonderful scent. One of my favorites. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I will re order in larger bottle  thank you&lt;br /&gt;Had been looking for this for several years since I first had it in Paris. Glad I found and like yours</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite spring fragrances.  Too bad I waited so long before I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the lily of the valley scent in this cologne - although I wished it lasted longer! It&#x27;s wonderful. Thank you for your product and for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This perfume definitely smells like lily of the valley; but it&#x27;s also a tad too sweet-smelling, which gives it a slightly artificial (man-made) scent.  A little goes a long way, therefore careful application must be observed, or the cologne will enter a room before the wearer!  It also seems to have staying power, and will last throughout the day, but might need to be reapplied if going out for the evening after work.  All in all it&#x27;s a good value for the money, especially if you love the scent of lily of the valley!</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since I was in high school.  It still has a nice fresh smell just like the lily of the valley and it doesn&#x27;t fade right away either.  Glad it&#x27;s still being sold.</li>
            <li> I have worn Curve for years because it has tones of Lily of the Valley, but recently decided to try another fragrance with this flower&#x27;s \\&quot;notes.\\&quot; My only complaint about it is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long, but that is part of the characteristics of a fragrance that is not super sweet or strong. (I suffer from migraines, and have an extremely low tolerance for strong and sweet aromas.) Cannot stand those fragrances that linger when the person wearing them is long gone. This is not one of them. One of the reviews proposes it (Muguet Des Bois) smells like bug spray, and I pick up on that occassionally, but love the light, sweet, fresh, slightly pungent scent. Plan on purchasing more of this in the future. Happy fragrancing. Its intoxicating. Wish more pople would wear fresh light scents like this.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft, light &amp; fresh, spring-time fragrance that has been around for many years because it is so timeless.  I always keep a bottle on hand.  It is perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Nice light, clean scent; not quite what I remembered from my college days, but could just be my changed sense of smell.  This is one of only a few scents that I can stand to be around.  Some people feel that it has a sort of bug-spray quality to it; I can see that, but if you spray it over clothing rather than directly on skin, that quality is lessened.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just like in 1967</li>
            <li> Smells so good.  A little over powering but it fades a little faster than I&#x27;d like.  I gave it four stars because it fades fast and because the bottle came bubble wrapped without a box.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.  I&#x27;m used to perfume coming in a box</li>
            <li> This scent is one I used often as a teenager and young wife. The light fragrance is just right and brings me manmy happy memories.</li>
            <li> Having never worn the original formulation, I was hesitant to try this out.  However, I found this to be simply lily of the valley - nothing more, nothing less.  It does not last long, but it really brings out the memories of my mother&#x27;s garden.  It is very light and easy to wear, perfect for spring.</li>
            <li> I remember my mom wearing this and I loved the way it smelled. After trying other brands, I lucked upon this here at Amazon. It smells like you have a bunch of lilys of the valley next to you. It&#x27;s wonderful! I&#x27;m planning on ordering more before I can&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt, container is lovely, cologne is just as nice as I remembered it from years ago when my mother wore it!  Thanks for having so many things can&#x27;t be easily procured in the stores!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about it in Vogue Magazine - a certain buyer in Bergdorf wears it and it&#x27;s her signature fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Just not for me. Will never buy another fragrance until I can try it.  Now using it as an air freshner.  Just too sweet and it has an &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is amazingly true to the real scent of Lilly of the Valley!  I spritz it all over the house!</li>
            <li> It is the same perfume that I wore when I was a teen.  I still love it and enjoy wearing it.  The delivery was very fast and I was pleased with it when I got it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance - exactly like Lily of the Valley flowers.</li>
            <li> Brings back fondest memories of my Gramma</li>
            <li> Loved this cologne when I was in high school in the 70&#x27;s. Did not know that it was still sold.  Very happy to find it -just as pretty and light as I remember it! I will definitely be buying it again!!</li>
            <li> Smells just like the Lily of the Valley flowers that grow outside my home.  The reviews on this product are what sold me.  My mother remembers this perfume from the 50&#x27;s and says it still smells the same.  It&#x27;s rare that you can find something still unchanged or reformulated these days, so the old saying is true, &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;  I love how fresh it smells.  It would be great if it lasted longer, but sometimes that&#x27;s a good thing.  The bottle certainly is a great value, and there&#x27;s enough to put a bit in a travel spritzer in your purse to freshen it up during the day.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> A BEAUTIFUL SCENT...ALL I USE NOW...INEXPENSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL...WHAT MORE COULD I WANT IN A SCENT?</li>
            <li> It smells over powering, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for years and years. It&#x27;s my all time favorite light clean fresh cologne.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells just the way I remember it, very light and fresh....... like lilies of the valley! Never overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance having the smell of Lily of the Valley.  I like it for a quick spray if I am going out and want to feel and smell refreshing.  I wish the fragrance would last longer.</li>
            <li> This Cologne spray, has real smell of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;, the scent is very good. It reminded me my young life, when I used that cologne or perfume with the same scent all the time. The only bad things, it evaporated very soon, it should stay much longer, than it is.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s originaly made in France, and the product was exellent. This Company &amp;#34;COTY&amp;#34; is French too, but the cologne made in USA now??.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, that the cologne made now in USA, makes the big difference.&lt;br /&gt;But it much better, than others sell oil under name &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;, which has nothing to do with real scent of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I recalled my mother using this cologne when I was a child, and I remembered the lovely scent. It&#x27;s still a lovely touch of freshness and spring.</li>
            <li> I loved this cologne as a young woman, and wanted to buy it again for my summertime fragrance.  I was so pleased that it was available through Amazon.  The scent is as delightful now as long ago.  One minor quibble - the blue paper label wrapped around my bottle is poorly applied.  It is sloppily glued on and loose.  There is none of the usual identifying information on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I think I associated this scent with a favorite aunt. So when I finally got it, it was a disappointment. The Lily smells fake...not fresh.</li>
            <li> This was my first fragrance growing up. I bought it with fond memories of a light Lily of the Valley scent but it is overpowering even with one small spray...disappointing!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. My mother used to let me wear it on special occasions when I was a kid, so to me it smells like Christmas and birthdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean and feminine smell. I&#x27;m glad they still make it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This is an old but fabulous fragrence that my wife has used for years.  Pleasant smell of springtime and wonderful memories.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Lily of the Valley!  Brings me back to childhood days when I picked the flowers in my backyard.</li>
            <li> I also love this product !!</li>
            <li> This is a true Lily of the Valley scent.  It does not last long, but I am pleased with the couple of hours it does. Everyone comments on the lovely scent!  Thank you to all the reviewers - your recommendation helped with my purchase.  I love the fragrance so much, I am ordering another as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is not an expensive perfume but if you like the smell of Lily of the Valley I believe you will like this product.</li>
            <li> A very light, fresh and clean fragrance. Although the scent doesn&#x27;t last really long, it&#x27;s very refreshing. A bit of Nostalgia!</li>
            <li> A pretty scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Lilies of the Valley , as small as they are , have a lovely scent.  it&#x27;s captured very well in this light, summery cologne.  It is not too strong, a very delicate perfume.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I remember this perfume from my childhood; good memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is still soothing and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes me happy to wear!</li>
            <li> I loved this cologne as a teenager in the late &#x27;60&#x27;s - it is such a pure lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Excellent for a light summer scent.  I keep my bottle in the fridge for a cool, refreshing spritz in the heat of summer!</li>
            <li> Best fragrance ever. My husband says I smell delicious</li>
            <li> This perfume is beautiful...it smells like fresh Lilly of the Valley blooms. The fragrance seems to last all day, and is light and fresh. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love lily of the valley scent so I enjoyed this perfume, only one warning to prospective buyers that it doesn&#x27;t last long, it&#x27;s cheap after all.</li>
            <li> Hubby and I recently planted Lily Of the Valley bulbs and I happened to remember Muguet Des Bois by Coty from years ago when I wore that scent exclusively. I thought if anyone might have it, Amazon would. Sure enough they do. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it again after 50 years without it. It lasts all day for me and can be faintly detected the following day; so my experience is different from another reviewer who felt it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;last\\&quot; very long. Thank you Amazon for making this available.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite fragrance of mine for years..I love it!</li>
            <li> Always love the smell.</li>
            <li> this is my mother in laws favorite, and the price is fantastic, thank you</li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews, but felt motivated to do so with this one. If I could have given it no stars I would have. I remembered this perfume from when I was younger, my mom used to buy it all the time. It was such a clean smell, i loved it.  The one I received smelled nothing like the version I remember. I don&#x27;t know if it went bad or what but it was the most foul smelling perfume I have ever smelled. Even my husband and daughters said it smelled awful. I can&#x27;t even return it because Amazon does not allow returns of items that have flammable material (ie. alchohol) in it...so now I am out the money I spent on this and out a present for my Mother.  :(</li>
            <li> This deserved 3.5 star. It smell OK as long as wet but not for very long. But for this price what you expect?</li>
            <li> Many scents are available as both colognes and perfumes. The terms are not interchangeable, yet the ads for this product use both terms. The headings refer to this product as a perfume. When you read the descriptions, they will point out that it is a cologne, which is never as expensive as a perfume, nor does the scent last as long. Intentiionally deceptive.</li>
            <li> Loved it as a child and still love it.  Can be hard to locate.</li>
