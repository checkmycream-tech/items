            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff too.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Happy Henna - ing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled with this henna and it has an awesome smell too..</li>
            <li>Great quality product.  </li>
            <li>This henna is great quality.</li>
            <li>color and texture are great.</li>
            <li>With that being said this henna has a great stain power and is very easy to work with!</li>
            <li>It is always best to mix your own paste, but I would recommend these if you are a newbie and just experimenting, do not know how to mix henna, or roll your own cones.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t syringe but the henna shows up bright orange not brown.</li>
            <li>henna paste is smooth and the perfect firmness.</li>
            <li>I should buy two sets of these and get six because the price is so good.</li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>This as a really good buy.</li>
            <li>and it was still in good condition when I opened the package.</li>

            <li>It is a good deal.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>If you have a nice tan the brown will not be good for you.</li>
            <li>I have done so many designs!</li>
            <li>but i have purchased better henna cones!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try henna for the first time and these were great!</li>
            <li>(I have unnaturally warm hands).  </li>
            <li>but the henna works nicely...</li>
            <li>The cones are very nice to use, with tiny tips for perfect detailing.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent product and the cones are super easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best henna i ever used.the price is good and its free shippng which makes it more great.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, and great quality.</li>

            <li>I wished it came with more than just one, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for sure, I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li>I have used many cone hennas and made some of my own, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This appears to be pretty good henna that leaves a good stain...</li>
            <li>this is a great product and the final color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It stains a bright orange and then darkens into a rich mahogany color after 24-48 hours.  </li>
            <li>i love it stains well easy to use nice color</li>
            <li>I love this color too.</li>
            <li>While the shipping was slower than I&#x27;d have liked, I was pleased that it was free..</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, and my second time purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several types of henna pastes and this product is of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>This was an excellent product, and I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>I love henna and I&#x27;ve never owned it myself, so</li>
            <li>My friends love making me henna all over them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>My customers seemed to be pleased with the quality as well.</li>
            <li>i left it on for over 8 hours but its still very good!</li>
            <li>And i got many compliments.</li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>darker.i soo love it..</li>
            <li>I love this--</li>
            <li>Also love not having to mix it myself.</li>
            <li>I love the way the henna flows from them.</li>
            <li>I had also checked the reviews before ordering, most of them stated 3 cones.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I chose to purchase from Herbal Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>but I was in a rush :)</li>
            <li>but that has better color</li>
            <li>In my opinion, you&#x27;re getting so much more than you pay for with this product.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>pretty good henna</li>
            <li>The henna came out smooth and easy and was pre made, all you have to do is unplug it!</li>
            <li>I am a beginner and this henna seemed fresh and of excellent quality as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>Came conveniently wrapped, really easy to use, and it lasted for about 3 weeks on the top of my foot.</li>
            <li>The tip of the cone is fine, so you are able to make intricate designs.  </li>
            <li>I think this company might be better for parties or cheap weddings and baby shower kinds of things.</li>
            <li>I was able to do smooth and intricate  lines.</li>
            <li>The brown works very well on fair skin.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again - much easier than making my own!!</li>
            <li>The color is nice and rich and i had no bad side effects from it.</li>
            <li>I have never done henna before but using this product made it so easy to do.</li>
            <li>No complaints, and the shipping was VERY quick speed.</li>
            <li>there was some clumping but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be easily wiped away.</li>
            <li>It fades after like 2 days and the color isnt that strong</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best henna product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The paste came out smoothly and was easy to control in the cone.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, smooth consistency.  </li>
            <li>The henna was free of unnatural chemicals, which is extremely important.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the product is great.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean up and doesn&#x27;t leave any residual color where you touch up</li>
            <li>Make sure you squeeze out 1/4 inch worth of henna from the cone before you start; the stuff at the tip gets oxidized/clogged in travel.</li>
            <li>After about an hour I took it off and it was considerably light</li>
            <li>It only lasts about a week or two on the skin, so not as great as professional henna, but for a home product it&#x27;s pretty good :)</li>
            <li>I was able to get 10 very large designs out of it.</li>
            <li>and i enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>but this product is amazing, can super fast too.</li>
            <li>Its so rich and the needle</li>
            <li>i was really excited</li>
            <li>It works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>And another good thing is that I had more than enough paste left over to do so.e more designs :3</li>
            <li>(I just used a bobby pin or the tip of the cone to clean up any mistakes).  </li>
            <li>so you can clean the tip between details/lines.  </li>
            <li>Fun product, super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one yesterday and im excited about it.it ships and gets delivered quick which is a plus..</li>
            <li>They seem to work fine, but I dont think it&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li>With minimal pressure, the henna flows from the tube evenly, giving great control, but with no drips or overflows.  </li>
            <li>I put this mehendi and left for 2 hours, came out as bright color.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t get better pre-packaged henna for this price.</li>
            <li>I got good color after only leaving henna on for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>The color came out BEAUTIFUL and dark.</li>
            <li>so you can go very intricate, which I like, but more pressure can produce thicker lines.</li>
            <li>and they definitely were not as good as this product).  </li>
            <li>I loved these, I actually ordered it twice!</li>
            <li>I stored the remainder in my fridge and the quality was just as good the second time around.</li>
            <li>Nice dark henna (turns orange at first then darkens within 12 hours) with nice application tip (for detailed lines).</li>
            <li>Which is actually a really great problem to have, compared to the other way around.</li>
            <li>My friend and I gave each other tattoos yesterday and the color turned out greAt.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The cones are perfect size for my smaller hands  and seem to last forever!  </li>
            <li>It got the color so quickly..</li>
            <li>If your henna seems to fade quickly, think about where you&#x27;re applying it.  </li>
            <li>I am not at the professional level, but I would have to say this is one of the best products I have tried from Amazon (I have tried other name brands from Amazon</li>
            <li>At first, it comes out really really light</li>
            <li>but after a few hours it darkens to a beautiful shade.</li>
            <li>Leave it on for 30 minutes and at first when you take it off it&#x27;s a bright orange, but after a little while it turns into this deep beautiful color.</li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at using henna myself so we will see how it goes!</li>
            <li>I did a pretty good size tattoo on me and my sister and that barely put a dent in the first cone.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still a pretty color!</li>
            <li>The ingredients in the cone came out smooth and soft, easy to use and create designs.</li>
            <li>I originally created my own henna paste, but that didn&#x27;t leave a design that stayed long</li>
            <li>but I still got lots of designs out of that one cone(very fresh).  </li>
            <li>I was able to complete about 10 medium</li>
            <li>DO NOT get the Beachcombers stuff, this is more authentic, creates deeper color, and is overall much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I just wanted it for fun</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many different henna from different sellers here on amazon, but this particular henna is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It cam right on time</li>
            <li>The paste was well-mixed and produced precise lines with a steady flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SUPER surprised and excited.</li>
            <li>At first the henna doesn&#x27;t pigment your skin right away and leaves it rather orange</li>
            <li>Easy to use, so simple and clean</li>
            <li>I decided I am artistic and could do this myself, so I did lots of research and saw the reviews for this and decided, what the heck, the price is reasonable and its temporary.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>This was really nice henna, the tip wasnt too fine or thick, i could get really cool patterns.</li>
            <li>The cone was quite full (I&#x27;ve gotten cones that were pretty small before) and the paste was a good consistency.  </li>
            <li>I actually came back to this page trying to purchase more!!</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but it is so much nicer and more authentic to use these vs. henna mix in a plastic tube with a metal tip.    </li>
            <li>the color came out a dark red brown, and i find that because henna reacts best to heat, to use a hair dryer set on hot to warm the henna after it has dried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with the first tube</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>yet i am still on the first cone.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to do Mehndi tattoos.  </li>
            <li>The color is already fairly deep, and I am told it will darken even more.  </li>
            <li>At first, I couldn&#x27;t get the paste out of the tip</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>The first time was a holiday weekend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I ordered, the package arrived exactly as described; 3 pre-filled expertly wrapped cones.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Henna</li>
            <li>and i will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Fabulous color developed, but it dries quickly so go fast!  </li>
            <li>my art&#x27;s not all that hot</li>
            <li>I still have about one more design left in the cone.</li>
            <li>First of all the picture showed 3 cones.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time purchasing henna paste online</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Henna</li>
            <li>the small tip is really good for designs, you have to use your nail to squeeze the tube tip first to get it going though.</li>
            <li>It leaves a beautiful dark stain dye that lasts for several days!</li>
            <li>I really do love this product and highly recommend it to any potential buyers.    </li>
            <li>Also the henna is very potent with the stain, I only left my design on for about an hour and its been three days and</li>
            <li>The amount of essential was a bit strong smelling, but probably helped it stain.</li>
            <li>They lasted for 7 fairly large   designs.</li>
            <li>Dries good, and is very long lasting!</li>
            <li>It turns a beautiful deep dark red and lasted a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>cone is closed with a pin at the tip, making it easy to use and reseal.&lt;br /&gt;The stain is dark and long-lasting, and the fine tip makes it easy to draw.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The henna is very easy to apply and gives a dark color.  </li>
            <li>The cones kept very well in the fridge</li>
            <li>The designs were lighter on the shoulder/back and much darker on the hands, arms, feet and ankles.</li>
            <li>The cones are ready to use the moment you receive them in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Stains very well.</li>
            <li>They sweat too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and i can do very intricate designs as well as thicker designs.  </li>
            <li>The henna is the correct consistency and stains very well.</li>
            <li>but I really should not have to do that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li>I felt that I have paid toooooo much for one cone..........</li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;re supposed to leave it on for much longer</li>
            <li>The price is great though because I live in LA, and when going down venice beach a tiny henna tattoo is like what, 10 bucks?</li>
            <li>The tips are pretty fine so detailed work isn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li>The tip is not very thin, but that&#x27;s not a problem!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, and if done right the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>this is my very first attempt at henna tattoos, I had my first tattoo done at a local mall kiosk</li>
            <li>I might actually consider re ordering because I liked how long this lasts.</li>
            <li>overall the stain was nice and the lines could be made as fine or thick as i wanted.</li>
            <li>The henna stains really really darkly and stays on way longer than most hennas I have used.</li>
            <li>I usually buy either Rajasthani or Jamila henna powder and mix my own paste.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to last a full two weeks</li>
            <li>I guess give it a try.ion (which can&#x27;t be seen by the buyer on the main product page), but now I have hives and asthma and a hand covered in an orange colored crayola marker hue.</li>
            <li>just starting out, this is a low budget way to learn...have ordered more...</li>
            <li>I will be back to order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li>The pin that held everything together was a nice touch, and only a small bit had dried up at the tip (be sure to squeeze out a good bit before using on the skin, to rid yourself of the dried bits).  </li>
            <li>The stain was very quick, and within an hour or so was a bright, vibrant orange, which troubled me because I wanted a brown or chestnut red stain, not orange.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vibrant and it actually stays in for a long time like about a week or more.</li>
            <li>but overall, I&#x27;m not unhappy with the product.)</li>
            <li>I have to assume that is because this henna is fresh rather than made from a powder mix or anything similar.</li>
            <li>Alright, this is a normal price for a normal tube of henna.</li>
            <li>I was initially attracted to the reasonable price and positive reviews</li>
            <li>When the paste is left on the skin for the proper amount of time, the final design comes out dark and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>&quot; long, with the wider end being about 1.25\\&quot; wide- very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>At first use the henna made me break out in a rash but after multiple uses my body got used to it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve personally done mehndi</li>
            <li>I just finished my first cone last</li>
            <li>I ordered this to use on myself for the first time, I&#x27;m totally a beginner</li>
            <li>The stain is very dark and the cone is easy to use.</li>
            <li>; those detailed small lines are SO much easier to create.</li>
            <li>It left a very rich, dark brown stain that indicated freshness.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a rich dark stain.</li>
            <li>after applying it gets a little bit light but after about an hour</li>
            <li>- I received four cones instead of three that came in a clear container to store them in.</li>
            <li>Wrapping it in a paper towel fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will often wake up and unwrap my henna, and continue to wear the paste for several hours before it really starts to flake.</li>
            <li>it lasts a pretty long time</li>
            <li>This completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I am a professional henna artist in Philadelphia, PA.</li>
            <li>These are a blast for young girls at slumber parties.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The cone is closed with a pin, which is a useful tool during henna designing when the paste starts to build up.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a new tattoo by week one, but the tattoo was barely faded.</li>
            <li>The flow of the lines was as precise and steady as before; however, the stain was a slightly less intense brown, still reasonably dark.</li>
            <li>The paste is usually dry within fifteen minutes, more or less depending on thickness.</li>
            <li>Great buy and ill buy again if I want to do henna again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a tube or a tube and a half on ten or more designs.</li>
            <li>The henna if left on long enough stains nice and dark.</li>
            <li>I just pulled the pin out and pushed a squiggle of old crusty dry stuff out and then was ready to draw.</li>
            <li>This time, I also tried a trick I was told - to daub the lines with lemon juice after they had dried - don&#x27;t know if that made a substantial difference (as this was the first time I&#x27;d used this particular \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of henna paste)</li>
            <li>They last a fairly long time as well (just note, the longer you keep them, the less they are able to stain).</li>
            <li>It stains quickly and was very dark.</li>
            <li>but the next day the actual design was a much, much darker rusty color..</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and used the henna cones within a few days of getting them.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t pop and once the initial air was out, the paste continued to flow freely with very little gunking up at the tip.</li>
            <li>With proper care, the design remained clear for over a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I received 7 cones instead of 3 in my second order.</li>
            <li>They were wrapped just as professionally, but had the extra protection of being shipped in a plastic food storage container.</li>
            <li>The package came early and 3 of these will last awhile!</li>
            <li>the color is still pretty dark.</li>
            <li>We barely used a portion of the product</li>
            <li>The product shown on the view is different its actuually a normal cone which is sold locally</li>
            <li>and they were a little battered in the box, but they came right on time.</li>
            <li>this henna is easy enough to use however it comes from the tube too thick to apply intricate designs.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly, so I recommend working quickly, and leaving it on the skin (even though it&#x27;s dried) for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me a long time so far.</li>
            <li>I could always get some empty cones and transfer the henna to a new cone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I got the right product</li>
            <li>I did practice the designs on paper and did both girls&#x27; hands, and not even half of the first tube is gone, so this product goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> Happy Henna - ing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> but I am thrilled with this henna and it has an awesome smell too..</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  </li>
            <li> This henna is great quality.</li>
            <li> color and texture are great.</li>
            <li> With that being said this henna has a great stain power and is very easy to work with!</li>
            <li> It is always best to mix your own paste, but I would recommend these if you are a newbie and just experimenting, do not know how to mix henna, or roll your own cones.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t syringe but the henna shows up bright orange not brown.</li>
            <li> henna paste is smooth and the perfect firmness.</li>
            <li> I should buy two sets of these and get six because the price is so good.</li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> This as a really good buy.</li>
            <li> and it was still in good condition when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> the concept is good, the product is disapointing.</li>
            <li> Def a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would say this is a good product.</li>
            <li> and i loved it</li>
            <li> It is a good deal.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> If you have a nice tan the brown will not be good for you.</li>
            <li> I have done so many designs!</li>
            <li> but i have purchased better henna cones!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try henna for the first time and these were great!</li>
            <li> (I have unnaturally warm hands).  </li>
            <li> but the henna works nicely...</li>
            <li> The cones are very nice to use, with tiny tips for perfect detailing.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and the cones are super easy to navigate.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best henna i ever used.the price is good and its free shippng which makes it more great.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, and great quality.</li>
            <li> The henna is good quality, smooth, and came out nicely.</li>

            <li> Would LOVE to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I wished it came with more than just one, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for sure, I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I have used many cone hennas and made some of my own, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This appears to be pretty good henna that leaves a good stain...</li>
            <li> this is a great product and the final color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> It stains a bright orange and then darkens into a rich mahogany color after 24-48 hours.  </li>
            <li> i love it stains well easy to use nice color</li>
            <li> I love this color too.</li>
            <li> While the shipping was slower than I&#x27;d have liked, I was pleased that it was free..</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and my second time purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of henna pastes and this product is of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> This was an excellent product, and I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love henna and I&#x27;ve never owned it myself, so</li>
            <li> My friends love making me henna all over them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> My customers seemed to be pleased with the quality as well.</li>
            <li> i left it on for over 8 hours but its still very good!</li>
            <li> And i got many compliments.</li>
            <li> Will buy more</li>
            <li> darker.i soo love it..</li>
            <li> I love this--</li>
            <li> Also love not having to mix it myself.</li>
            <li> I love the way the henna flows from them.</li>
            <li> I had also checked the reviews before ordering, most of them stated 3 cones.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I chose to purchase from Herbal Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> but I was in a rush :)</li>
            <li> but that has better color</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you&#x27;re getting so much more than you pay for with this product.</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> pretty good henna</li>
            <li> The henna came out smooth and easy and was pre made, all you have to do is unplug it!</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and this henna seemed fresh and of excellent quality as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> Came conveniently wrapped, really easy to use, and it lasted for about 3 weeks on the top of my foot.</li>
            <li> The tip of the cone is fine, so you are able to make intricate designs.  </li>
            <li> I think this company might be better for parties or cheap weddings and baby shower kinds of things.</li>
            <li> I was able to do smooth and intricate  lines.</li>
            <li> The brown works very well on fair skin.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again - much easier than making my own!!</li>
            <li> The color is nice and rich and i had no bad side effects from it.</li>
            <li> I have never done henna before but using this product made it so easy to do.</li>
            <li> No complaints, and the shipping was VERY quick speed.</li>
            <li> there was some clumping but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be easily wiped away.</li>
            <li> It fades after like 2 days and the color isnt that strong</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best henna product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The paste came out smoothly and was easy to control in the cone.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smooth consistency.  </li>
            <li> The henna was free of unnatural chemicals, which is extremely important.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the product is great.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean up and doesn&#x27;t leave any residual color where you touch up</li>
            <li> Make sure you squeeze out 1/4 inch worth of henna from the cone before you start; the stuff at the tip gets oxidized/clogged in travel.</li>
            <li> After about an hour I took it off and it was considerably light</li>
            <li> It only lasts about a week or two on the skin, so not as great as professional henna, but for a home product it&#x27;s pretty good :)</li>
            <li> I was able to get 10 very large designs out of it.</li>
            <li> and i enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> but this product is amazing, can super fast too.</li>
            <li> Its so rich and the needle</li>
            <li> i was really excited</li>
            <li> It works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> And another good thing is that I had more than enough paste left over to do so.e more designs :3</li>
            <li> (I just used a bobby pin or the tip of the cone to clean up any mistakes).  </li>
            <li> so you can clean the tip between details/lines.  </li>
            <li> Fun product, super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered another one yesterday and im excited about it.it ships and gets delivered quick which is a plus..</li>
            <li> They seem to work fine, but I dont think it&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li> With minimal pressure, the henna flows from the tube evenly, giving great control, but with no drips or overflows.  </li>
            <li> I put this mehendi and left for 2 hours, came out as bright color.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t get better pre-packaged henna for this price.</li>
            <li> I got good color after only leaving henna on for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> The color came out BEAUTIFUL and dark.</li>
            <li> so you can go very intricate, which I like, but more pressure can produce thicker lines.</li>
            <li> and they definitely were not as good as this product).  </li>
            <li> I loved these, I actually ordered it twice!</li>
            <li> I stored the remainder in my fridge and the quality was just as good the second time around.</li>
            <li> Nice dark henna (turns orange at first then darkens within 12 hours) with nice application tip (for detailed lines).</li>
            <li> Which is actually a really great problem to have, compared to the other way around.</li>
            <li> My friend and I gave each other tattoos yesterday and the color turned out greAt.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The cones are perfect size for my smaller hands  and seem to last forever!  </li>
            <li> It got the color so quickly..</li>
            <li> If your henna seems to fade quickly, think about where you&#x27;re applying it.  </li>
            <li> I am not at the professional level, but I would have to say this is one of the best products I have tried from Amazon (I have tried other name brands from Amazon</li>
            <li> At first, it comes out really really light</li>
            <li> but after a few hours it darkens to a beautiful shade.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for 30 minutes and at first when you take it off it&#x27;s a bright orange, but after a little while it turns into this deep beautiful color.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at using henna myself so we will see how it goes!</li>
            <li> I did a pretty good size tattoo on me and my sister and that barely put a dent in the first cone.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still a pretty color!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the cone came out smooth and soft, easy to use and create designs.</li>
            <li> I originally created my own henna paste, but that didn&#x27;t leave a design that stayed long</li>
            <li> but I still got lots of designs out of that one cone(very fresh).  </li>
            <li> I was able to complete about 10 medium</li>
            <li> DO NOT get the Beachcombers stuff, this is more authentic, creates deeper color, and is overall much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just wanted it for fun</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many different henna from different sellers here on amazon, but this particular henna is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It cam right on time</li>
            <li> The paste was well-mixed and produced precise lines with a steady flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SUPER surprised and excited.</li>
            <li> At first the henna doesn&#x27;t pigment your skin right away and leaves it rather orange</li>
            <li> Easy to use, so simple and clean</li>
            <li> I decided I am artistic and could do this myself, so I did lots of research and saw the reviews for this and decided, what the heck, the price is reasonable and its temporary.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> This was really nice henna, the tip wasnt too fine or thick, i could get really cool patterns.</li>
            <li> The cone was quite full (I&#x27;ve gotten cones that were pretty small before) and the paste was a good consistency.  </li>
            <li> I actually came back to this page trying to purchase more!!</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but it is so much nicer and more authentic to use these vs. henna mix in a plastic tube with a metal tip.    </li>
            <li> the color came out a dark red brown, and i find that because henna reacts best to heat, to use a hair dryer set on hot to warm the henna after it has dried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with the first tube</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> yet i am still on the first cone.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to do Mehndi tattoos.  </li>
            <li> The color is already fairly deep, and I am told it will darken even more.  </li>
            <li> At first, I couldn&#x27;t get the paste out of the tip</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> The first time was a holiday weekend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I ordered, the package arrived exactly as described; 3 pre-filled expertly wrapped cones.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Henna</li>
            <li> and i will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Fabulous color developed, but it dries quickly so go fast!  </li>
            <li> my art&#x27;s not all that hot</li>
            <li> I still have about one more design left in the cone.</li>
            <li> First of all the picture showed 3 cones.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing henna paste online</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Henna</li>
            <li> the small tip is really good for designs, you have to use your nail to squeeze the tube tip first to get it going though.</li>
            <li> It leaves a beautiful dark stain dye that lasts for several days!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product and highly recommend it to any potential buyers.    </li>
            <li> Also the henna is very potent with the stain, I only left my design on for about an hour and its been three days and</li>
            <li> The amount of essential was a bit strong smelling, but probably helped it stain.</li>
            <li> They lasted for 7 fairly large   designs.</li>
            <li> Dries good, and is very long lasting!</li>
            <li> It turns a beautiful deep dark red and lasted a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li> cone is closed with a pin at the tip, making it easy to use and reseal.&lt;br /&gt;The stain is dark and long-lasting, and the fine tip makes it easy to draw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The henna is very easy to apply and gives a dark color.  </li>
            <li> The cones kept very well in the fridge</li>
            <li> The designs were lighter on the shoulder/back and much darker on the hands, arms, feet and ankles.</li>
            <li> The cones are ready to use the moment you receive them in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Stains very well.</li>
            <li> They sweat too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and i can do very intricate designs as well as thicker designs.  </li>
            <li> The henna is the correct consistency and stains very well.</li>
            <li> but I really should not have to do that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li> I felt that I have paid toooooo much for one cone..........</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re supposed to leave it on for much longer</li>
            <li> The price is great though because I live in LA, and when going down venice beach a tiny henna tattoo is like what, 10 bucks?</li>
            <li> The tips are pretty fine so detailed work isn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> The tip is not very thin, but that&#x27;s not a problem!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, and if done right the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> this is my very first attempt at henna tattoos, I had my first tattoo done at a local mall kiosk</li>
            <li> I might actually consider re ordering because I liked how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> overall the stain was nice and the lines could be made as fine or thick as i wanted.</li>
            <li> The henna stains really really darkly and stays on way longer than most hennas I have used.</li>
            <li> I usually buy either Rajasthani or Jamila henna powder and mix my own paste.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to last a full two weeks</li>
            <li> I guess give it a try.ion (which can&#x27;t be seen by the buyer on the main product page), but now I have hives and asthma and a hand covered in an orange colored crayola marker hue.</li>
            <li> just starting out, this is a low budget way to learn...have ordered more...</li>
            <li> I will be back to order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> The pin that held everything together was a nice touch, and only a small bit had dried up at the tip (be sure to squeeze out a good bit before using on the skin, to rid yourself of the dried bits).  </li>
            <li> The stain was very quick, and within an hour or so was a bright, vibrant orange, which troubled me because I wanted a brown or chestnut red stain, not orange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so vibrant and it actually stays in for a long time like about a week or more.</li>
            <li> but overall, I&#x27;m not unhappy with the product.)</li>
            <li> I have to assume that is because this henna is fresh rather than made from a powder mix or anything similar.</li>
            <li> Alright, this is a normal price for a normal tube of henna.</li>
            <li> I was initially attracted to the reasonable price and positive reviews</li>
            <li> When the paste is left on the skin for the proper amount of time, the final design comes out dark and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> &quot; long, with the wider end being about 1.25\\&quot; wide- very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> At first use the henna made me break out in a rash but after multiple uses my body got used to it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve personally done mehndi</li>
            <li> I just finished my first cone last</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use on myself for the first time, I&#x27;m totally a beginner</li>
            <li> The stain is very dark and the cone is easy to use.</li>
            <li> ; those detailed small lines are SO much easier to create.</li>
            <li> It left a very rich, dark brown stain that indicated freshness.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a rich dark stain.</li>
            <li> after applying it gets a little bit light but after about an hour</li>
            <li> - I received four cones instead of three that came in a clear container to store them in.</li>
            <li> Wrapping it in a paper towel fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will often wake up and unwrap my henna, and continue to wear the paste for several hours before it really starts to flake.</li>
            <li> it lasts a pretty long time</li>
            <li> This completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am a professional henna artist in Philadelphia, PA.</li>
            <li> These are a blast for young girls at slumber parties.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The cone is closed with a pin, which is a useful tool during henna designing when the paste starts to build up.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a new tattoo by week one, but the tattoo was barely faded.</li>
            <li> The flow of the lines was as precise and steady as before; however, the stain was a slightly less intense brown, still reasonably dark.</li>
            <li> The paste is usually dry within fifteen minutes, more or less depending on thickness.</li>
            <li> Great buy and ill buy again if I want to do henna again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a tube or a tube and a half on ten or more designs.</li>
            <li> The henna if left on long enough stains nice and dark.</li>
            <li> I just pulled the pin out and pushed a squiggle of old crusty dry stuff out and then was ready to draw.</li>
            <li> This time, I also tried a trick I was told - to daub the lines with lemon juice after they had dried - don&#x27;t know if that made a substantial difference (as this was the first time I&#x27;d used this particular \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of henna paste)</li>
            <li> They last a fairly long time as well (just note, the longer you keep them, the less they are able to stain).</li>
            <li> It stains quickly and was very dark.</li>
            <li> but the next day the actual design was a much, much darker rusty color..</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and used the henna cones within a few days of getting them.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t pop and once the initial air was out, the paste continued to flow freely with very little gunking up at the tip.</li>
            <li> With proper care, the design remained clear for over a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I received 7 cones instead of 3 in my second order.</li>
            <li> They were wrapped just as professionally, but had the extra protection of being shipped in a plastic food storage container.</li>
            <li> The package came early and 3 of these will last awhile!</li>
            <li> the color is still pretty dark.</li>
            <li> We barely used a portion of the product</li>
            <li> The product shown on the view is different its actuually a normal cone which is sold locally</li>
            <li> and they were a little battered in the box, but they came right on time.</li>
            <li> this henna is easy enough to use however it comes from the tube too thick to apply intricate designs.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly, so I recommend working quickly, and leaving it on the skin (even though it&#x27;s dried) for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me a long time so far.</li>
            <li> I could always get some empty cones and transfer the henna to a new cone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I got the right product</li>
            <li> I did practice the designs on paper and did both girls&#x27; hands, and not even half of the first tube is gone, so this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When the cones arrived they were placed loosely in a small cardboard box, without insulation to protect them from the heat or any sort of wrapping, and they were bent almost in half to fit in the box.</li>
            <li> Personally for me, it stays on for a long time, and it&#x27;s a normal dark that is exspected when you think henna.</li>
            <li> About 2 large and 5 medium and 4 small designs</li>
            <li> I leave it on overnight, peel it off in the morning, and go as long as possible without getting it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe i didnt keep it on long enough?</li>
            <li> , it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> but if you just let it dry its yellow, if you squeeze orange/lemon juice on it when it dries (to reactivate it;i did this 3 times)</li>
            <li> I decided to keep the paste on overnight, so i wrapped my hand with toilet paper (after I applied a sugar/lemon solution to it)  </li>
            <li> My only quibble is the cones seemed smaller than other brands I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> Once its completely dry, I cover it with lots of toilet paper, then with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> Note: I am not a professional henna artist.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional henna tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even leave the paste on for a long time.</li>
            <li> used the 2 cones to make 3 large designs, 1 medium design and 7 small designs, and there was still a little bit left over.</li>
            <li> Also, the box was small so the cone was slightly bent to fit, which may have led to the bubble of air being a little harder to get out of the cone.</li>
            <li> Not enough to even stain my skin, just enough to make them a little stick.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars is because it has lasted so long!</li>
            <li> Just got it the other day and have used it multiple times.</li>
            <li> I received this in a very short amount of time, only a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> but I know that the lines are dark and solid.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I will leave it on longer to see if the dark brown will get even deeper tone to it.</li>
            <li> The second day after removal, the stain becomes a dark orange/light brown.</li>
            <li> There is a very heavy flower smell as well as eucalyptus that made me think my sensitive skin might have had a reaction overnight</li>
            <li> I typically order the 3-pack simply because I use this stuff</li>
            <li> but... only lasted about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I did both of my feet, my palm, my sister-in-law&#x27;s half back and one foot.</li>
            <li> the cones were, so I was hoping they would be a little bigger-</li>
            <li> but it didnt get very dark and didnt last longer than a week.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, packaged neatly and securely.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> (this is why I washed it off before going to bed), but there was absolutely no reaction.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, I expected to receive 3 cones</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to last a few days</li>
            <li> In the past, I have ordered from other websites, but they are generally too pricey.</li>
            <li> I was able to do a fairly complicated design, even with my shaky hands, without drawing it out ahead of time.</li>
            <li> The only problem i had is that you need to reapply the henna a few times to get a really dark stain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this henna thinking I would only receive one cone, and I ended up getting four cones in a neat little plastic box!</li>
            <li> I left this on for two hours and am 4 days in with very little fading.</li>
            <li> I would never work with henna any other way after this one.</li>
            <li> Though they do tend to leak a bit from the other end, just wear gloves or wrap in a napkin.</li>
            <li> They come with pins in them like the other reviewer</li>
            <li> and I also did henna for two other people.</li>
            <li> The girls have it on for about 2 weeks, as long as they have really pale skin too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was due to how long it took to ship or what</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I really like the size of the cone but unfortunately after working so hard on making the design</li>
            <li> IDK, but any how I scraped it off and removed the rest of it with some oilive oil, and OMG it is already dark and it hasn&#x27;t even &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; for 24 hours yet..  </li>
            <li> the evening, I lay down my designs, using the needle which comes in the end of the cone to scrape up any of my mistakes.</li>
            <li> and I was worried I would pop the cone trying to massage the paste down to the tip.</li>
            <li> but i wish it was black</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because after applying the paste, three hours later it barely left a stain.</li>
            <li> The tip was also bent and slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> You NEVER want to use henna that stains black (the chemical used in black henna</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously bought henna from Indian grocery stores and none of it ever compared to the quality henna of Herbal Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I chose these cones after reading reviews of many other types, all of which warned of poor staining, bad shipping quality, etc.</li>

            <li> I am pale.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that when using the cones, the foil is thin and weak, and doesn&#x27;t offer much support; therefore, when a cone is about halfway used, there&#x27;s no good way to hold and squeeze securely other than rolling the fat end down and securing it with tape.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t get better pre-packaged henna for this price. This is my third time ordering, and I have yet to be dissatisfied. I typically order the 3-pack simply because I use this stuff so often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna paste is smooth and the perfect firmness. It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, and if done right the color is amazing. Here&#x27;s how I apply henna:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening, I lay down my designs, using the needle which comes in the end of the cone to scrape up any of my mistakes. The paste is usually dry within fifteen minutes, more or less depending on thickness. Once its completely dry, I cover it with lots of toilet paper, then with plastic wrap. I leave it on overnight, peel it off in the morning, and go as long as possible without getting it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints (though not enough to even knock one star from my review, I&#x27;ll list them anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;One of henna cones leaked a bite once. Not enough to even stain my skin, just enough to make them a little stick. Wrapping it in a paper towel fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubes are a little long which make it a little awkward to squeese sometimes, but that&#x27;s no more than a small irk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste can be a little hard to peel off. Which is actually a really great problem to have, compared to the other way around. I will often wake up and unwrap my henna, and continue to wear the paste for several hours before it really starts to flake.</li>
            <li> This was really nice henna, the tip wasnt too fine or thick, i could get really cool patterns. The only problem i had is that you need to reapply the henna a few times to get a really dark stain.</li>
            <li> When reading the reviews I thought, oh, you get 3 tubes! I should buy two sets of these and get six because the price is so good. But I was a little sad when I opened my package and only got two? I guess if you order it, you should count on only getting one. The price is great though because I live in LA, and when going down venice beach a tiny henna tattoo is like what, 10 bucks? but one of these tubes, which is 3 bucks, can give you tons. I bought two and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with the first tube and I&#x27;ve been giving my friends and I countless henna tattoos. It&#x27;s great stuff too. Leave it on for 30 minutes and at first when you take it off it&#x27;s a bright orange, but after a little while it turns into this deep beautiful color. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and used the henna cones within a few days of getting them. I got good color after only leaving henna on for 2 hours. My only quibble is the cones seemed smaller than other brands I&#x27;ve bought but I still got lots of designs out of that one cone(very fresh).  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Works well. I have ordered from here before a few years ago and decided to order again. Great quality. I would recommend to others that like doing henna art.</li>
            <li> This is great! The package arrived quickly. The cones are about 5.5\\&quot; long, with the wider end being about 1.25\\&quot; wide- very easy to handle. The henna is good quality, smooth, and came out nicely. The color came out BEAUTIFUL and dark. If/when this product comes back, I will order again! Thanks! (The reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars, is because I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere how big/small the cones were, so I was hoping they would be a little bigger-but overall, I&#x27;m not unhappy with the product.)</li>
            <li> the small tip is really good for designs, you have to use your nail to squeeze the tube tip first to get it going though. it lasts a pretty long time but if you just let it dry its yellow, if you squeeze orange/lemon juice on it when it dries (to reactivate it;i did this 3 times) then it comes out a very dark orange. good buy but i wish it was black</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best henna product I&#x27;ve ever used.  The lines I drew two days ago are still getting darker.  It dries quickly, so I recommend working quickly, and leaving it on the skin (even though it&#x27;s dried) for at least 2 hours. This time, I also tried a trick I was told - to daub the lines with lemon juice after they had dried - don&#x27;t know if that made a substantial difference (as this was the first time I&#x27;d used this particular \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of henna paste) but I know that the lines are dark and solid.  I actually came back to this page trying to purchase more!! But they look as though they&#x27;re unavailable.  Would LOVE to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I have done so many designs! About 2 large and 5 medium and 4 small designs and I still have almost 1/2 maybe 1/4 left! I love this color too. Its so rich and the needle it comes with is perfect. The tip is not very thin, but that&#x27;s not a problem! Its thin, but it could be thinner! Great buy and ill buy again if I want to do henna again!</li>
            <li> This as a really good buy. It cam right on time and it was still in good condition when I opened the package. I have never done henna before but using this product made it so easy to do. My friend and I gave each other tattoos yesterday and the color turned out greAt. And another good thing is that I had more than enough paste left over to do so.e more designs :3</li>
            <li> Note: I am not a professional henna artist. I am only a hobbyist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these henna cones because I was fed up with the low quality of \\&quot;instant\\&quot; mixes, which always stained poorly and unevenly. While the shipping was slower than I&#x27;d have liked, I was pleased that it was free.. I chose these cones after reading reviews of many other types, all of which warned of poor staining, bad shipping quality, etc. When the cones arrived they were placed loosely in a small cardboard box, without insulation to protect them from the heat or any sort of wrapping, and they were bent almost in half to fit in the box. However, I straightened them out and placed them in the refrigerator to wait for a \\&quot;henna day\\&quot; the next week. The cones kept very well in the fridge and I used them a week after they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2 cones to make 3 large designs, 1 medium design and 7 small designs, and there was still a little bit left over. My one complaint is that when using the cones, the foil is thin and weak, and doesn&#x27;t offer much support; therefore, when a cone is about halfway used, there&#x27;s no good way to hold and squeeze securely other than rolling the fat end down and securing it with tape. The stain was very quick, and within an hour or so was a bright, vibrant orange, which troubled me because I wanted a brown or chestnut red stain, not orange. However, the next day the stain had turned deep, even brown (without a hint of red), and not orange at all, which had never happened with any henna I&#x27;d used before. I have to assume that is because this henna is fresh rather than made from a powder mix or anything similar. The designs were lighter on the shoulder/back and much darker on the hands, arms, feet and ankles. With proper care, the design remained clear for over a week.</li>
            <li> I thought by the product description that the customer would be getting 3 cones instead of 1. At first use the henna made me break out in a rash but after multiple uses my body got used to it. The 3 stars is because it has lasted so long! Just put a pin in it and close it inside a container and it lasts a long time. It fades after like 2 days and the color isnt that strong but whatever. 2 stars off because of their stupid confusing product description. I might actually consider re ordering because I liked how long this lasts. I guess give it a try.ion (which can&#x27;t be seen by the buyer on the main product page), but now I have hives and asthma and a hand covered in an orange colored crayola marker hue. Hopefully, the color will darken? At this point I just want my money back so I can go buy Benadryl....&lt;br /&gt;If you want a DIY henna I think just purchasing the powder, oil, and tube is the smartest thing. I think this company might be better for parties or cheap weddings and baby shower kinds of things. Not for amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and my second time purchasing it. I was looking for a henna that would stain well and I decided to purchase this. This completely exceeded my expectations. The henna stains really really darkly and stays on way longer than most hennas I have used. I have used many cone hennas and made some of my own, but this is by far the best. The opening for the henna is small so you can go very intricate, which I like, but more pressure can produce thicker lines. I received this in a very short amount of time, only a few days after ordering. I can definitely say that I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> this henna is easy enough to use however it comes from the tube too thick to apply intricate designs.  the color does not darken or last longer then 3-4 days.  the concept is good, the product is disapointing.</li>
            <li> this stuff rocks. it works, the cones last forever. i am running out of space to draw on myself with henna yet i am still on the first cone. the color came out a dark red brown, and i find that because henna reacts best to heat, to use a hair dryer set on hot to warm the henna after it has dried. just a tip. but this product is amazing, can super fast too. i will be ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, packaged neatly and securely.&lt;br /&gt;Each cone is closed with a pin at the tip, making it easy to use and reseal.&lt;br /&gt;The stain is dark and long-lasting, and the fine tip makes it easy to draw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, perfect!</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of henna pastes and this product is of excellent quality.  You will receive three pre-made henna cones.  The cones are made of mylar paper (as shown in the picture) with paste already inside.  The cones are ready to use the moment you receive them in the mail.  The cone is closed with a pin, which is a useful tool during henna designing when the paste starts to build up.  I have made henna designs on my hand and foot and the designs came out beautiful.  The tip of the cone is fine, so you are able to make intricate designs.  When the paste is left on the skin for the proper amount of time, the final design comes out dark and beautiful.  I really do love this product and highly recommend it to any potential buyers.    I am an intermediate henna artist.  I am not at the professional level, but I would have to say this is one of the best products I have tried from Amazon (I have tried other name brands from Amazon and they definitely were not as good as this product).  Happy Henna - ing</li>
            <li> I loved these, I actually ordered it twice! The henna came out smooth and easy and was pre made, all you have to do is unplug it! I was able to do smooth and intricate  lines. 3 tubes lasted me a longgggg time, numerous hand designs. The henna if left on long enough stains nice and dark. Def a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to do Mehndi tattoos.  I used these ready-made henna tubes last night on my daughters, and we had a blast.  The cones are very nice to use, with tiny tips for perfect detailing.  With minimal pressure, the henna flows from the tube evenly, giving great control, but with no drips or overflows.  After the henna set up, we covered the hands with plastic wrap and left it on overnight.  This morning, after scraping the henna away, the patterns are beautifully  tattooed.  The color is already fairly deep, and I am told it will darken even more.  I did practice the designs on paper and did both girls&#x27; hands, and not even half of the first tube is gone, so this product goes a long way.  This was an excellent product, and I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I originally created my own henna paste, but that didn&#x27;t leave a design that stayed long (my fault). I decided to go the route of using a pre-made paste since this one has no chemicals in it. At first, I couldn&#x27;t get the paste out of the tip and I was worried I would pop the cone trying to massage the paste down to the tip. However, it didn&#x27;t pop and once the initial air was out, the paste continued to flow freely with very little gunking up at the tip. I left this on for two hours and am 4 days in with very little fading. I can only imagine the longevity if I left this on overnight. There is a very heavy flower smell as well as eucalyptus that made me think my sensitive skin might have had a reaction overnight (this is why I washed it off before going to bed), but there was absolutely no reaction. Next time, I will leave it on longer to see if the dark brown will get even deeper tone to it. Several reviews mentioned receipt of 3 cones, but there is only one (as listed in the description). My only qualm is that there was nothing in the box except the cone so you have to go back to Amazon to read the instructions (refrigerate to extend life) and to view the product ingredients. Also, the box was small so the cone was slightly bent to fit, which may have led to the bubble of air being a little harder to get out of the cone.</li>
            <li> Fun product, super easy to use. I love henna and I&#x27;ve never owned it myself, so I decided to buy it and try it. My friends love making me henna all over them. The tips are pretty fine so detailed work isn&#x27;t too hard. It&#x27;s lasted me a long time so far. I&#x27;ve only used a tube or a tube and a half on ten or more designs. It only lasts about a week or two on the skin, so not as great as professional henna, but for a home product it&#x27;s pretty good :)</li>
            <li> I dislike how the color is a reddish brown. Also I have to apply it multiple times to achieve the darkness. It stayed on my skin for almost a month. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I got the right product and Im hoping to figure this out - I received four cones instead of three that came in a clear container to store them in. The cones are a shiny purple mylar material with Hindi (?) writing on them. They say \\&quot;Neha Enterprises\\&quot; in small print on them. They seem to work fine, but I dont think it&#x27;s the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Also, how should I store them? Should I close the tip somehow? (There was no pin in them). Do they need to be refrigerated?**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just got it the other day and have used it multiple times. It is an excellent product and the cones are super easy to navigate. I would never work with henna any other way after this one.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, I expected to receive 3 cones but I only received 2. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars. My cones did not come with pins either.    The henna is very easy to apply and gives a dark color.  I also applied a sugar/lemon juice seal.  The picture shown below is next day after application. The second day after removal, the stain becomes a dark orange/light brown. In the picture, the henna looks a bit runny but I think that&#x27;s because I warmed it as I was holding it (I have unnaturally warm hands).  [...]    This is the first time I&#x27;ve personally done mehndi and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Stains very well. I messed up and left it on for about 3 min. before wiping it off and it still stained. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and are good quality.   They lasted for 7 fairly large   designs. I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for because this was a TINY tube of Henna that looks sketchy and has me wondering whether or not I want to put this on my skin... Think about it before you buy it</li>
            <li> I am a professional henna artist in Philadelphia, PA. I usually buy either Rajasthani or Jamila henna powder and mix my own paste. There have been few occasions that I found myself in a pinch and needed to order pre-made paste. In the past, I have ordered from other websites, but they are generally too pricey. I decided to search Amazon and discovered this product. I was initially attracted to the reasonable price and positive reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these cones on two separate occasions. The first time was a holiday weekend. Both orders were processed and shipped faster than I had anticipated, and I received them with plenty of time to prepare for upcoming events. Each cone lasted me several applications. I was able to complete about 10 medium designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered, the package arrived exactly as described; 3 pre-filled expertly wrapped cones. Before my event, I sampled it on my roommate and myself. The henna was free of unnatural chemicals, which is extremely important. It left a very rich, dark brown stain that indicated freshness. The designs lasted for about 2 weeks. My customers seemed to be pleased with the quality as well. The paste was well-mixed and produced precise lines with a steady flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I received 7 cones instead of 3 in my second order. They were wrapped just as professionally, but had the extra protection of being shipped in a plastic food storage container. I sampled the henna on myself. The flow of the lines was as precise and steady as before; however, the stain was a slightly less intense brown, still reasonably dark. The design endured about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say this is a good product. It is always best to mix your own paste, but I would recommend these if you are a newbie and just experimenting, do not know how to mix henna, or roll your own cones.</li>
            <li> I put this mehendi and left for 2 hours, came out as bright color. Would recommend to buy this one.</li>
            <li> i love it stains well easy to use nice color but... only lasted about a week and a half maybe i didnt keep it on long enough? i left it on for over 8 hours but its still very good!</li>
            <li> Alright, this is a normal price for a normal tube of henna. If you go to an Indian store, it is about the same price for one tube. Secondly, the product is great. Personally for me, it stays on for a long time, and it&#x27;s a normal dark that is exspected when you think henna. I am pale. I have given people tattoos, and for men, it wears off a lot quicker. They sweat too much in my opinion. The girls have it on for about 2 weeks, as long as they have really pale skin too. Either way, two weeks is a lot longer than one might think. I wanted a new tattoo by week one, but the tattoo was barely faded. It was bitter-sweet for me to wait. The product does what it promises. And I&#x27;ve used the product multiple times since then. I think I&#x27;ve had it for about a month, and it&#x27;s still doing what it did from the start.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Henna and i enjoyed it very much. I read on several sites with different tips and they also helped a lot- they will be listed below. I still have some of this Henna left and I have used it often, it last a very long time. The color is nice and rich and i had no bad side effects from it. of course you should always test a small area first as some people are allergic to Henna.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting 3 when i got them there was 4! i was really excited ( i&#x27;m not sure if it was an accident or what)! this was the first henna i&#x27;ve ordered and used ( i usually use sharpie) and i can do very intricate designs as well as thicker designs.  The cones are perfect size for my smaller hands  and seem to last forever!  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I brought one from devon street and it dint have any color at all. This was one was awesome. It got the color so quickly..It was eid . And i got many compliments. Thank you! Loved it! Will buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many different henna from different sellers here on amazon, but this particular henna is by far the best. The henna is the correct consistency and stains very well. Though they do tend to leak a bit from the other end, just wear gloves or wrap in a napkin. They last a fairly long time as well (just note, the longer you keep them, the less they are able to stain).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best henna i ever used.the price is good and its free shippng which makes it more great.This is the second time buying and i will be back for more.I ordered another one yesterday and im excited about it.it ships and gets delivered quick which is a plus..after applying it gets a little bit light but after about an hour or so it gets darker.i soo love it..recommended to all</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I really like the size of the cone but unfortunately after working so hard on making the design it only stained orange I thought maybe it will get darker but it didn&#x27;t. Also after reading the reviews some stated that they got 3 but I only got one. But I might just order it again and use another henna paste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Dries good, and is very long lasting! Not a bad smell, and great quality. No complaints, and the shipping was VERY quick speed. Nothing bad to say what so ever.</li>
            <li> I wished it came with more than just one, but I love it! It&#x27;s so vibrant and it actually stays in for a long time like about a week or more. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because after applying the paste, three hours later it barely left a stain. I called Orlando and the guy said if I still had not stain by the next day to call him back. This henna was getting darker for 3 days and I ended up with a rich dark stain. I was disappointed in the shipping because 3 out of 5 of the cones were bent at the tips.However, I will order this product again. I could always get some empty cones and transfer the henna to a new cone but I really should not have to do that.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and this henna seemed fresh and of excellent quality as far as I could tell. The paste came out smoothly and was easy to control in the cone. I was able to do a fairly complicated design, even with my shaky hands, without drawing it out ahead of time. These are a blast for young girls at slumber parties.</li>
            <li> Fabulous color developed, but it dries quickly so go fast!  Easy to clean up and doesn&#x27;t leave any residual color where you touch up (I just used a bobby pin or the tip of the cone to clean up any mistakes).  Easy to use, so simple and clean; those detailed small lines are SO much easier to create. Takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but it is so much nicer and more authentic to use these vs. henna mix in a plastic tube with a metal tip.    Make sure you squeeze out 1/4 inch worth of henna from the cone before you start; the stuff at the tip gets oxidized/clogged in travel. And have a tissue/hand/whatever at hand so you can clean the tip between details/lines.  I&#x27;ve used these cones on my hands and feet, and I would recommend them to anyone!    They come with pins in them like the other reviewer said; 2 of mine were missing pins, and they were a little battered in the box, but they came right on time. I can&#x27;t really complain about anything. Get these- DO NOT get the Beachcombers stuff, this is more authentic, creates deeper color, and is overall much cheaper. I love this--will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This product came almost overnight.... SUPER surprised and excited. This is my first attempt at using henna myself so we will see how it goes!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smooth consistency.  It turns a beautiful deep dark red and lasted a full two weeks.  Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice dark henna (turns orange at first then darkens within 12 hours) with nice application tip (for detailed lines). The package came early and 3 of these will last awhile! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> my art&#x27;s not all that hot but the henna works nicely...just starting out, this is a low budget way to learn...have ordered more...</li>
            <li> Packaged well, arrived on time, and if applied correctly will stain well. The brown works very well on fair skin. If you have a nice tan the brown will not be good for you.</li>
            <li> At first the henna doesn&#x27;t pigment your skin right away and leaves it rather orange but the next day the actual design was a much, much darker rusty color.. pretty good henna but if you&#x27;re using it for an event I advise you to do it a day or two in advance</li>
            <li> This appears to be pretty good henna that leaves a good stain...however it was shipped very poorly.  The tip was coming out of the box that it was shipped in because it was too small.  The tip was also bent and slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional henna tattoo artist. I just wanted it for fun and I was so impressed. It works great and lasts a long time! I did a pretty good size tattoo on me and my sister and that barely put a dent in the first cone. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> i ordered this to practice henna and it was a lot smoother and easier to handle than the henna kits from stores. there was some clumping but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be easily wiped away. overall the stain was nice and the lines could be made as fine or thick as i wanted. i&#x27;ll definitely be buying again~</li>
            <li> I did both of my feet, my palm, my sister-in-law&#x27;s half back and one foot. I still have about one more design left in the cone. Totally worth the price. Also love not having to mix it myself. I just pulled the pin out and pushed a squiggle of old crusty dry stuff out and then was ready to draw. Shipping only took 4 days!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to last a few days this works well. If you are looking for something to last a full two weeks this is not for you. The smell isn&#x27;t syringe but the henna shows up bright orange not brown.</li>
            <li> this is my very first attempt at henna tattoos, I had my first tattoo done at a local mall kiosk and i loved it but it didnt get very dark and didnt last longer than a week.  I decided I am artistic and could do this myself, so I did lots of research and saw the reviews for this and decided, what the heck, the price is reasonable and its temporary.&lt;br /&gt;Last night i did a small tattoo on my palm...I decided to keep the paste on overnight, so i wrapped my hand with toilet paper (after I applied a sugar/lemon solution to it)  When I woke up this morning I noticed that the henna did not crack and fall off like it did with the mall tattoo, maybe because of the sugar soltion I made? IDK, but any how I scraped it off and removed the rest of it with some oilive oil, and OMG it is already dark and it hasn&#x27;t even &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; for 24 hours yet..  My technique needs some work, lol but I am thrilled with this henna and it has an awesome smell too.. I will be back to order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  The cone was quite full (I&#x27;ve gotten cones that were pretty small before) and the paste was a good consistency.  The pin that held everything together was a nice touch, and only a small bit had dried up at the tip (be sure to squeeze out a good bit before using on the skin, to rid yourself of the dried bits).  I will order again from this company.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and the final color is beautiful. I recommend  this product. It is a good deal.</li>
            <li> the size of this cone was very small! Also the color is sightly orange when it dries and you wash it off! i ordered this just to practice! dont but it unless you want actually put it on and go somewhere! The color does get darker after a day but i have purchased better henna cones!</li>
            <li> Came conveniently wrapped, really easy to use, and it lasted for about 3 weeks on the top of my foot.</li>
            <li> The cones allow you to be write like you are using a pen. I love the way the henna flows from them.</li>
            <li> First of all the picture showed 3 cones.  I had also checked the reviews before ordering, most of them stated 3 cones.  So I was expecting 3 cones,  but when I opened the box it was just one cone.  I felt that I have paid toooooo much for one cone..........</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with this henna paste. It stains quickly and was very dark. The amount of essential was a bit strong smelling, but probably helped it stain. The cone was larger than I thought. The only thing that would have been helpful to know beforehand was that there was a pin in the tip. I cut it with scissors thinking I was just cutting the cone open. Will absolutely buy again - much easier than making my own!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this henna thinking I would only receive one cone, and I ended up getting four cones in a neat little plastic box! This henna is great quality. It stains a bright orange and then darkens into a rich mahogany color after 24-48 hours.  You NEVER want to use henna that stains black (the chemical used in black henna can be extremely dangerous). I&#x27;ve been doing henna for about 4 years now, and I would order this again. If your henna seems to fade quickly, think about where you&#x27;re applying it.  Areas with thick skin (palms/bottoms of feet) will stay longer than the backs of your hands which have thin skin. This is also the reason for the color differences in different areas (the thicker the skin the deeper the henna stains). I just finished my first cone last night-- I was able to get 10 very large designs out of it.</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing henna paste online and I am so glad I chose to purchase from Herbal Beauty Supply. I&#x27;ve previously bought henna from Indian grocery stores and none of it ever compared to the quality henna of Herbal Beauty Supply. It leaves a beautiful dark stain dye that lasts for several days! I stored the remainder in my fridge and the quality was just as good the second time around. The only iffy thing about it is the price. It&#x27;s a bit expensive for henna paste</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use on myself for the first time, I&#x27;m totally a beginner and I was very pleased with the outcome. The ingredients in the cone came out smooth and soft, easy to use and create designs. Also the henna is very potent with the stain, I only left my design on for about an hour and its been three days and the color is still pretty dark. I know you&#x27;re supposed to leave it on for much longer but I was in a rush :) I recommend this product for sure, I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I received my Henna Cone and have used it a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;The color and texture are great. This is my first time using Henna so I have nothing to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;But I like it and will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Though the deluvery was before time but der is no color in the henna. The product shown on the view is different its actuually a normal cone which is sold locally i  newyork but that has better color</li>
            <li> Loved the henna paste! Was expecting to get 3 cones but only received 2. With that being said this henna has a great stain power and is very easy to work with! I will be buying this again soon!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you&#x27;re getting so much more than you pay for with this product. I didn&#x27;t even leave the paste on for a long time. After about an hour I took it off and it was considerably light but as the day went on the stain grew to a burnt orange, almost brown, color. I didn&#x27;t seal it with lemon &amp; sugar or anything. Great value! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try henna for the first time and these were great! I bought from Herbal beauty supply and the product came within three days. The stain is very dark and the cone is easy to use. I used it on my hands and my legs and I also did henna for two other people. We barely used a portion of the product so I am storing it in the freezer for future use. Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> It took FOREVER to ship, so I was slightly disappointed until I actually had the product. I&#x27;m not sure if it was due to how long it took to ship or what but I got sent 2 tubes even though I paid for one. The Henna dries in about an hour or two, if you use thin strands. At first, it comes out really really light but after a few hours it darkens to a beautiful shade. I&#x27;ve had a design on my ankle for over a week now and it&#x27;s still a pretty color!</li>
