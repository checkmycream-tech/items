            <li>so I thought this could be a wonderful</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, the bottle is easier to manage and it is a great value.</li>
            <li>the product thought, and the price was so good!</li>
            <li>It works as a great eye makeup remover as well.</li>
            <li>Great smell though.</li>
            <li>My great grandmother swore by it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>She had great skin</li>
            <li>My skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer which also has sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend making sure you get the type of Olay product that works best for your need.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally good skin, but this product helps protect it with its great moisturizing ingredients and the SPF against sun&#x27;s damaging UV.  </li>
            <li>Best of all the shipping was quick and product was in tack!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, reliable product.</li>
            <li>This is a good lightweight formula to use before makeup every day.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy at all which is amazing considering it has spf.</li>
            <li>Except for the fact that my skin feels nicely hydrated, I don&#x27;t even know that it&#x27;s there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer but is very shiny, as many products with SPF are.  </li>
            <li>Love that it protects even more!</li>
            <li>I was about out of my Original Formula Oil of Olay (which I love and have used for over 35 years) when I was out doing my shopping and decided it was a good time to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I had to wait quite a while for it to soak in and the foundation still didn&#x27;t apply very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This worked better...</li>
            <li>yes better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face lotion.  </li>
            <li>have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>this is my cream for years, i love it</li>
            <li>This stuff really works great</li>
            <li>Always a great product and such a good size too.</li>
            <li>Okay, except I just this with sunscreen in error.  </li>
            <li>for many years and am so glad that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>Just ok for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is ok for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant scent to it and disappears on the skin fast.</li>
            <li>good product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It goes on so lightly</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s been a great facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years now and am completely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Ended up getting the Olay Complete Sensitive instead (which works great!)</li>
            <li>I have used the Olay products for many years and like them very much.  </li>
            <li>If you have to be outside for an amount of time, and it&#x27;s sunny a good sunscreen is important for skin health.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Olay Complete.</li>
            <li>People say that I still look 10 years younger, could be the Olay moisturizer or maybe good genes, but who cares, I am still using the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scented, which I don&#x27;t like, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>(Olay absorbs so quickly that this is not a issue)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is most important in keeping skin looking young and</li>
            <li>She has fair skin and it is a great way to get a little sunblock with her daily routine of washing &amp; moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>This does have a bit more of a scent then the sensitive, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Even though I work inside, this product gives me the protection I need, plus keeps my skin fresh and moist.  </li>
            <li>Just right for my skin.</li>
            <li>The items arrived all right, but they had been thrown in a bag for shipping and the corners of the boxes were all bashed  </li>
            <li>However, the scent does dissipate quickly, or else maybe my nose becomes immune to the scent, but I really don&#x27;t notice it after it</li>
            <li>product is much thicker than the original formula and is much closer to the consistancy of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite facial moisturizer for about 6 years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wait for my moisturizer to absorb first</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not greasy and feels light not heavy.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 20 years when my friend introduced it to me for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay for the past 15 years (albeit most of that time a different product) and it has kept my skin in pretty fair shape as I&#x27;ve begun to age.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer daily for several years and feel like it is good protection from the sun without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I might as well use an SPF 30 sunscreen and get more protection since it don&#x27;t really think this is all that terrific.</li>
            <li>Large.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed..  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great value when compared to the more expensive creams and should work just as well since the overall goal of any face cream is to moisturize moisturize moisturize!!</li>
            <li>and it was way too much.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care for the sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and go from pale to burned with not much in between</li>
            <li>My sister uses the most expensive moisturizers in the market, Olay has done the same or better job for my skin inexpensively!!  </li>
            <li>I live in the Pacific NW, so we don&#x27;t get a lot of hot sunny days, but I feel like I am helping my skin by having the SPF 15 on even when I am sitting in traffic or walking during a overcast day.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is a larger bottle than is available to me locally and with daily use the two pack will probably last me a good year, so</li>
            <li>I have been using the classic variety for years..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent for an all day moisturizer</li>
            <li>I started using it in high school since my mom has always used it and loves it as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin soft, plus it has some protection from the sun..  </li>
            <li>Next time I will definitely not rely on the write-up but will zoom in on the actual product to make sure it matches the write-up.</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, I used the same amount I apply when using the orignal formula</li>
            <li>Everyone who uses Olay complete moisturizer gets rashes and skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Oil of Olay Complete \\&quot;Normal\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin..  </li>
            <li>The write up on this read &amp;#34;2 of Olay Complete</li>
            <li>I have used Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer (I&#x27;m an old lady)</li>
            <li>I do like this facial moisturizer - it&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion....spf and not too thick</li>
            <li>The above title is what I call it and for us older women to find a moisturizer that works and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>All Day Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Sensitive, 6.0 fl oz  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised to find out that it is “Normal” and not “Sensitive.”  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t wear this on bare skin without wearing something else to mitigate the shininess.  </li>
            <li>I use this interchangeably with the sensitive and other Olay complete, I buy which ever is the cheapest.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is apparent only on application.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The fragrance is apparent only on application.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and apply it over my normal facial routine.  </li>
            <li> Over the next couple of days, I cut back on the amount I used and that seemed to help --- with this product, a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try Neutrogena..  and am very open to seeing recommendations for other brands..</li>
            <li> Each morning I use this moisturizer followed by loose face powder.  </li>
            <li> We live in Arizona and my wife is a fanatic about skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I could do without is the slight sunscreen smell it has.</li>
            <li> Not so with other lotions containing sunscreens, which often start to flake or cake when they dry.  </li>
            <li> I will be turning 40 soon and many people are shocked when I reveal my age.  </li>
            <li> It’s too much trouble to send it back</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t effect each other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a problem, as it is an SPF 15 lotion, but it&#x27;s just slightly off-putting.</li>
            <li> If nothing else it is a lot less expensive than other products with similar ingredients, especially prescription lotions!</li>
            <li> Caused a slight burning sensation when applied to cheeks.</li>
            <li> Does have a fragrance that is slightly stronger than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I apply it a little heavier when I am out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Helps prevent wrinkles if used everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after shaving.</li>
            <li> It stings very slightly if you get it in your eye, but the Oil of Olay with no spf doesn&#x27;t sting at all if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> This product is not safe..  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, someone sensitive to scents may not want to use this.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least fifteen years.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a base for my makeup foundation</li>
            <li> I quit using makeup base years ago.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this moisturizer daily for several years and feel like it is good protection from the sun without being greasy. I don&#x27;t know if this lotion has anything to do with it, but people do say I don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite facial moisturizer for about 6 years. I started using it in high school since my mom has always used it and loves it as well. It goes on so lightly, you don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy at all which is amazing considering it has spf. It doesn&#x27;t make you break out either since it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It works as a great eye makeup remover as well. It stings very slightly if you get it in your eye, but the Oil of Olay with no spf doesn&#x27;t sting at all if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this after using a much more expensive brand for years. This worked better...yes better. It smells wonderful, the bottle is easier to manage and it is a great value.</li>
            <li> Read the internet.  Everyone who uses Olay complete moisturizer gets rashes and skin irritations.  Procter and Gamble just changed the formula.  Millions of consumers will have to throw the stuff out - P&amp;G will keep the profits.  I will never again buy and Olay or Procter and Gamble products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay Daily Moisturizer for 20 yrs. Yes, it&#x27;s been a great facial moisturizer. No, it doesn&#x27;t affect aging. It&#x27;s a good, reliable product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested that I use this product. He said he had recommended it to literally thousands of patients over a period of years. I have been using it for several years now and am completely happy with the results. If nothing else it is a lot less expensive than other products with similar ingredients, especially prescription lotions!</li>
            <li> I use this interchangeably with the sensitive and other Olay complete, I buy which ever is the cheapest. This does have a bit more of a scent then the sensitive, but it fades quickly. I like the product (this is my 4th bottle) because I can put it on and then put on my makeup and they don&#x27;t effect each other. I don&#x27;t have to wait for my moisturizer to absorb first (Olay absorbs so quickly that this is not a issue)&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of having some SPF every day- every season. I live in the Pacific NW, so we don&#x27;t get a lot of hot sunny days, but I feel like I am helping my skin by having the SPF 15 on even when I am sitting in traffic or walking during a overcast day.&lt;br /&gt;When I travel I use a SPF 30, and it can leave me looking ghostly.</li>
            <li> I purchased Oil of Olay Complete \\&quot;Normal\\&quot;.. I am very dissapointed..  My face broke out into a rash..  I do not have sensitive skin..  I have been using the classic variety for years..  It was a staple..  I do not mind the smell..  I do mind my face breaking out..   This product is not safe..  I will try Neutrogena..  and am very open to seeing recommendations for other brands..</li>
            <li> Love this lotion....spf and not too thick</li>
            <li> Caused a slight burning sensation when applied to cheeks. Ended up getting the Olay Complete Sensitive instead (which works great!)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but nothing compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains an SPF 15 sunscreen, to help protect my skin from the harmful rays of the sun.  That is most important in keeping skin looking young and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light on the skin.  Not so with other lotions containing sunscreens, which often start to flake or cake when they dry.  Except for the fact that my skin feels nicely hydrated, I don&#x27;t even know that it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is noticeable when opening the bottle.  Although it&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, someone sensitive to scents may not want to use this.  However, the scent does dissipate quickly, or else maybe my nose becomes immune to the scent, but I really don&#x27;t notice it after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for many years.  Occasionally, I will try another product, but I always come back.  I will be turning 40 soon and many people are shocked when I reveal my age.  Maybe it&#x27;s the Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer but is very shiny, as many products with SPF are.  You can&#x27;t wear this on bare skin without wearing something else to mitigate the shininess.  Great smell though.</li>
            <li> this is my cream for years, i love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least fifteen years.  We live in Arizona and my wife is a fanatic about skin cancer.  Even though I work inside, this product gives me the protection I need, plus keeps my skin fresh and moist.  I have received compliments from women who sell Avon  and Mary Kay.  About a month ago, I discovered that this is a woman&#x27;s product.  After I came to terms with my masculinity, I decided &amp;#34;What the Hell!&amp;#34; and bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works great</li>
            <li> Always a great product and such a good size too. Large. This should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> The write up on this read &amp;#34;2 of Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Sensitive, 6.0 fl oz  Sold by: Amazon.com LLC.&amp;#34;  Therefore, I ordered 2 sets without zooming in on the bottle so I was surprised to find out that it is “Normal” and not “Sensitive.”  It’s too much trouble to send it back so I will try it and hope I can use it without itching; if not, I will give it away.  Next time I will definitely not rely on the write-up but will zoom in on the actual product to make sure it matches the write-up.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I love it! My daugher loves it to. I like the feel of it it&#x27;s not greasy and feels light not heavy.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent wrinkles if used everyday. If you have to be outside for an amount of time, and it&#x27;s sunny a good sunscreen is important for skin health. You can get a discount if you buy this product as a subscription.</li>
            <li> Okay, except I just this with sunscreen in error.  I have an allergic reaction to it when I get it close to my eyes.  It makes my eyes water and burn and puff up.  So I am using it on my neck and chest and legs, where it won&#x27;t touch the eye area.  I have used the Olay products for many years and like them very much.  I just used another Olay product around my eyes.  Next time I order, I&#x27;ll be careful and not buy this type of moisturizer and just use the sensitive skin Olay moisturizer.  I do recommend making sure you get the type of Olay product that works best for your need.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer (I&#x27;m an old lady) for many years and am so glad that Amazon carries it.  It really makes my skin soft, plus it has some protection from the sun..  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after shaving. Not oily. It does however come off when I hike out doors.I have never found any product that does not sweat off!</li>
            <li> This is a good lightweight formula to use before makeup every day.  I&#x27;ve used Olay for the past 15 years (albeit most of that time a different product) and it has kept my skin in pretty fair shape as I&#x27;ve begun to age.  This is a larger bottle than is available to me locally and with daily use the two pack will probably last me a good year, so it&#x27;s a great value when compared to the more expensive creams and should work just as well since the overall goal of any face cream is to moisturize moisturize moisturize!!</li>
            <li> I do like this facial moisturizer - it&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts throughout the day. The only thing I could do without is the slight sunscreen smell it has. It&#x27;s not really a problem, as it is an SPF 15 lotion, but it&#x27;s just slightly off-putting. Overall, I like the product and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Olay Complete. My great grandmother swore by it.  I watched her put it on daily, morning and night.  She always appeared much younger than she was.  I have introduced my daughter to it.  She has fair skin and it is a great way to get a little sunblock with her daily routine of washing &amp; moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Just right for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 25 years.  It keeps up with the times in adding sunscreen. Love it!</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery. thank you</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it everyday and apply it over my normal facial routine.  It is not heavy or oily.  I apply it a little heavier when I am out in the sun.  Best of all the shipping was quick and product was in tack!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> I was about out of my Original Formula Oil of Olay (which I love and have used for over 35 years) when I was out doing my shopping and decided it was a good time to give this a try.  I have very fair skin and go from pale to burned with not much in between so I thought this could be a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is much thicker than the original formula and is much closer to the consistancy of sunscreen.  It also has the smell of sunscreen.  When I used it the first time, I used the same amount I apply when using the orignal formula and it was way too much.  I use this as a base for my makeup foundation and I had to wait quite a while for it to soak in and the foundation still didn&#x27;t apply very smoothly.  Over the next couple of days, I cut back on the amount I used and that seemed to help --- with this product, a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Just ok for me.  My skin feels oily versus moisturized and I really don&#x27;t care for the sunscreen smell.  I might as well use an SPF 30 sunscreen and get more protection since it don&#x27;t really think this is all that terrific.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years when my friend introduced it to me for the first time.  She had great skin and I asked her what product she was using.  My skin looks great.  I have a naturally good skin, but this product helps protect it with its great moisturizing ingredients and the SPF against sun&#x27;s damaging UV.  My sister uses the most expensive moisturizers in the market, Olay has done the same or better job for my skin inexpensively!!  I will never switch to anything else.  Why should I?</li>
            <li> Dont leave home without it</li>
            <li> Not oily, no stinging on my face.  Does have a fragrance that is slightly stronger than I would like.  The fragrance is apparent only on application.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The above title is what I call it and for us older women to find a moisturizer that works and is not greasy.  It has SPF15 which protects you from the sun.  I have been using it for 20 years!  People say that I still look 10 years younger, could be the Olay moisturizer or maybe good genes, but who cares, I am still using the product.</li>
            <li> The items arrived all right, but they had been thrown in a bag for shipping and the corners of the boxes were all bashed  in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product thought, and the price was so good!</li>
            <li> Been using Oil of Olay since I was 15! Love that it protects even more!</li>
            <li> Been using OOL since I was 14 thank goodness. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it on the hands, face, arms and neck. Has a pleasant scent to it and disappears on the skin fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer which also has sunscreen.  I quit using makeup base years ago.  Each morning I use this moisturizer followed by loose face powder.  That&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> This product is ok for it&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s decent for an all day moisturizer but you get what you pay for. This was recommended by a friend and I would recommend this product based on affordability.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scented, which I don&#x27;t like, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> I have been using for 25 years</li>
