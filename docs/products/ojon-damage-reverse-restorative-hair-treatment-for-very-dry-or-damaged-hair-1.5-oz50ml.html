            <li>but it&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried to understand this and be fair, but the truth is just the truth.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and it smelled like hazelnut and sandlewood.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It smells good IF u get the kind that says \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li>My hair was double-processed by a stylist who did her own thing without telling me - won&#x27;t be returning to her.  </li>
            <li>Products are supposed to be made to please customers, and if you have a good product, people will buy more.  </li>
            <li>There are so many oils that are good for your hair, I would not be using this again.</li>
            <li>Both glides onto the hair nicely.</li>
            <li>just feels like it went through a nice conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>was what i order and my hair is so much nicer and perfect lately love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased a sampler pack for $5 directly from Ojon and am very impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for a family member who used it before and wanted more.</li>
            <li>But, now I think that it was helping more than I thought, because now that my hair is in better condition, I have used the treatment again and felt some improvement.  </li>
            <li>but this worked SO much better.</li>
            <li>Hope I was somewhat informative :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This is personally the best hair mask I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Olive oil works way better for me</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I love ojon products and I always make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>bought this, and its such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I remember the good old stuff and that stuff was amazing.</li>
            <li>so hopefully it doesn&#x27;t need to be used very often to keep your hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>MOISTURIZED, FLEXIBLE, EASY TO STYLE, AND NO BREAKAGE.</li>
            <li>I would suggest purchasing the sampler pack directly from Ojon as they give you a great selection plus extra samples - great deal for $5.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair</li>
            <li>Love this product, quick ship</li>
            <li>This jar ingredient  is light color, no appreciable scent.  </li>
            <li>I only need a dime-size and it works great.</li>
            <li>yeah, while they might smooth it in the short-term and protect it, DON&#x27;T overdo the heat protectors.</li>
            <li>Just fabulous.</li>
            <li>I went from light honey brown, to jet black.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I also use their shampoos&amp; conditioners&amp; they have improved the condition of my hair in so many positive ways!</li>
            <li>This product is NOT like the original Ojon Restorative Hair product that I is almost gone.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have some quality as the Original....</li>
            <li>I prefer the original</li>
            <li>This product was much better when I first purchased it 4-5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Okay, first off I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought the Plus Restorative Hair Treatment to compare to the Original.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to the Original Version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great treatment for dry hair.</li>
            <li>and it does nothing special for my hair.</li>
            <li>This does nothing special for me.</li>
            <li>I put my hair in braids then slept with it on overnight in hopes of getting the full effects.</li>
            <li>my hair feels much much healthier, and looks better too.</li>
            <li>The new formula has a very light, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>The original products worked so well, smelled so good that we cannot be fooled by this imitation.  </li>
            <li>Smelled better, melted in hands better, worked on dry scalp!</li>
            <li>However, after about a week, I noticed my hair shedding more around my edges, until I could completely see my scalp.</li>
            <li>but it works so well that I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t good for fine, oily hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff right away</li>
            <li>But honestly I don&#x27;t think the minimal effects were worth the price.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice, I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>It has a light creamy oil texture..really soft..</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, it was almost 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>First time trying this was a sample package Sephora sent with my order.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Softer, less breakage, easier 2 manage &amp; most important healthier than its ever been-</li>
            <li>I had such a reaction to it the strong cinnamon odor I started to tear up, no way this was going on my head.</li>
            <li>The New Plus Version has a very faint perfume scent where as the Original has a rich, smokey, burnt caramel scent which I enjoy the most!  </li>
            <li>I use this very sparingly, leaving it on while I sleep, and then wash my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I would think that it is not for everyone, but for me it really helps.</li>
            <li>ITS VERY PRICEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did seem to keep my hair from breaking, but didn&#x27;t do much for the brittleness.  </li>
            <li>My hair was drier than ever in my whole life.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t help but use the whole thing to ensure saturation.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it after my Henna Treatment which can be very drying to the hair.</li>
            <li>hair was bouncy shiny, pressed very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the Original Version is much thicker and needs to be emulsified before applying to the hair, where as, it isn&#x27;t necessary to do so with the Newer Version.  </li>
            <li>And I, like many others , will find other products.  </li>
            <li>its still better than alot of other products, i have curly hair</li>
            <li>I buy the huge jar when QVC has it and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I love that it hydrates so well without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>This product came to me highly recommended because I had never heard of it.</li>
            <li>CAN\\&quot;t LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li>This is the new scent of Ojon.</li>
            <li>I applied the whole jar to dry hair the first time I got it.</li>
            <li>Well it started out OK, but somewhere along the line you sold out both on having a good product, and pleasing your customers  Too bad, because the next phase is losing your customers and your prosperity.  </li>
            <li>u can just do midlength to the ends to make it last longer, as most damage is down at the ends.</li>
            <li>its a better version of the other stuff..just has a better smell, because I guess the other kind smelled like ashes :(</li>
            <li>So I read this would really help oily hair, but after following the directions and coating / leaving it in my hair</li>
            <li>I had to shampoo like 3 times and the last time was with a really drying shampoo like head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>So far I have onl;y used it twice but was well pleasws with the results.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m feeling hopeful as the results so far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I had very damaged hair from bleaching and straightening my hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>completely see a difference if I dont use it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the new scent in a small size to see if I liked it before I spent a lot of money in it and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>consistency is different, its yellow and melts better, the old version use to curdle in little bits .</li>
            <li>The smell is not nearly as strong as the original.  </li>
            <li>The new stuff is not the same at all, and calling it &amp;#34;ojon&amp;#34; cashes in on the name but sells junk.  </li>
            <li>I definitely noticed an improvement in my hair with less frizzing so will be purchasing full products.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair (no chemicals), so I did not expect to see my hair shedding from this product.</li>
            <li>Of course, Ojon leaves your hair feeling like silk and I am African American and my hair is natural and I use it as a conditioner and then press my hair with it.</li>
            <li>while ago I went light honey brown from dark dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>still makes my hair shiny and not dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to someone who is willing to spend all their money on a little tub of reverse oil that does not work.</li>

            <li> while ago I went light honey brown from dark dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> still makes my hair shiny and not dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who is willing to spend all their money on a little tub of reverse oil that does not work.</li>
            <li> It made my Tightly Coily hair extremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have fragile, frizzy, african american hair that&#x27;s been subject to a lot of heat damage over the years.</li>
            <li> You must use at least once a week if you want to really improve damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Then, so long Ojon, you had no respect for your customers, and now we have none for you.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not going to go a long way</li>
            <li> By the way, I have hair down to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> but if u have damaged DRY hair, u are in for a treat.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve been using this every other day, i like to leave it on a little longer - sometimes overnight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not particularly curly or dry.</li>
            <li> Those of us who bought Ojon products when they first came out, know without a doubt that the &amp;#34;new formulations&amp;#34; are just another rip-off.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Morrocainoil brand that I put on my hair after washing and conditioning while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> IT WAS NOT THE SIZE EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> but I straighten it a lot and have been using way too much silicone protector for it which made it so much worse.</li>
            <li> A  little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> not exactly chocolate....</li>
            <li> I got 5 sample packets which equaled the same as a small jar of this that sells on here for $30..</li>
            <li> Even the bigger 3.1 oz container is small..</li>
            <li> If you have dry unruly hair, then this is the product that is missing from your life!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the luscious dark cream w/ the heavenly scent....</li>
            <li> Sadly the changed to the composition to a much inferior product.</li>
            <li> so was concerned that the oil would weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Did not weigh it down for me.  </li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t the only show in town, and someone will capitalize on your failure.  </li>
            <li> and it took a half oz.</li>
            <li> but then again, if it keeps your hair from breaking so that you can get it a little longer before you have to cut it</li>
            <li> MY HAIR WAS DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR, THIS PRODUCT MEND MY BROKEN, EXTREME DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got dead hair, this will fix it.  </li>
            <li> I use Kerastase but like to give my hair a break every few weeks as it gets used to a product.  </li>
            <li> Living here in Colorado the winters are harsh on the skin and hair</li>
            <li> this stuff helps my hair survive the harsh weather.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, I was very disappointed and still have practically a full jar after using this product for only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I think when your hair is past a certain point, NOTHING but cutting it is going to get rid of the damage.  </li>
            <li> No more breakage.</li>
            <li> and the 1.5 oz is VERYYYY small.</li>
            <li> hard to describe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was so hard to get out</li>
            <li> Well for my hair at least.</li>
            <li> I am an Ojon fanatic.</li>
            <li> It could be the texture of my hair which is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> Almost like vasoline but not as thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and nothing would fix my brittle breaking hair except this.</li>
            <li> and I can seriously see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way less expensive.</li>
            <li> It sucks that its so expensive AND small.</li>
            <li> My hair is of course still broken where it was broken</li>
            <li> I should have be wary.</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> makes me angry.  </li>
            <li> I found the smell so distasteful</li>
            <li> but is quite disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t feel bad for you though, because being sold out</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair looked awful and I was afraid it would start breaking.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product, quick ship</li>
            <li> I use this very sparingly, leaving it on while I sleep, and then wash my hair in the morning.  It&#x27;s a great treatment for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT like the original Ojon Restorative Hair product that I is almost gone.  I was expecting the luscious dark cream w/ the heavenly scent....not exactly chocolate....hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;  This jar ingredient  is light color, no appreciable scent.  It seems to have some quality as the Original....but is quite disappointing.  Cannot return per instructions on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;  Did not come from the OJON company.&lt;br /&gt;  I should have be wary.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair life. I use it ritually ever week. Sometimes, I put it in and leave it on for hours while I go about my day. I just braid it. I have course wavy frizzy hair, Spanish background, think big hair. This lets me not wash my hair for days. It has changed the quality of my hair. LOVE. I would think that it is not for everyone, but for me it really helps.</li>
            <li> Had tried this before. Ordered this for a family member who used it before and wanted more. She was very pleased.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got dead hair, this will fix it.  The smell is not nearly as strong as the original.  I prefer the original but that&#x27;s just me.  You must use at least once a week if you want to really improve damaged hair.</li>
            <li> THE OJON DAMAGE REVERSE RESTORATIVE HAIR TREATMENT PLUS WITH ANTIOXIDANTS IS THE BEST TREAT YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HAIR FOR THE WEEK. I USED IT OVER NIGHT. MY HAIR FELT LIKE WHEN IT WAS VIRGIN HAIR. MOISTURIZED, FLEXIBLE, EASY TO STYLE, AND NO BREAKAGE. ITS VERY PRICEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITS WORTH IT!!!! MY HAIR WAS DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR, THIS PRODUCT MEND MY BROKEN, EXTREME DRY HAIR. I CAN\\&quot;t LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> I use it once every two weeks. It does wonders for fried, or pool damaged hair. I also put it on my hair when I laid out in the sun, under a cap, then rinsed it out later. My hair was re born!</li>
            <li> I tried it twice, I followed the directions exactly and it does nothing special for my hair. It could be the texture of my hair which is thick and wavy. My hair is not particularly curly or dry. This does nothing special for me. I prefer the Morrocainoil brand that I put on my hair after washing and conditioning while it&#x27;s still wet. I only need a dime-size and it works great. WIll not re-purchase the Ojon item.</li>
            <li> My hair was double-processed by a stylist who did her own thing without telling me - won&#x27;t be returning to her.  My hair looked awful and I was afraid it would start breaking.  I ordered this stuff right away and I was not impressed.  It did seem to keep my hair from breaking, but didn&#x27;t do much for the brittleness.  I used it along with coconut oil and that seemed to help.  But, now I think that it was helping more than I thought, because now that my hair is in better condition, I have used the treatment again and felt some improvement.  I think when your hair is past a certain point, NOTHING but cutting it is going to get rid of the damage.  So, in that sense, maybe the &amp;#34;damage reverse&amp;#34; thing is a bit misleading - but then again, if it keeps your hair from breaking so that you can get it a little longer before you have to cut it, that&#x27;s a plus.  I would consider buying it again.</li>
            <li> This product was much better when I first purchased it 4-5 years ago. Smelled better, melted in hands better, worked on dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Those of us who bought Ojon products when they first came out, know without a doubt that the &amp;#34;new formulations&amp;#34; are just another rip-off.  The original products worked so well, smelled so good that we cannot be fooled by this imitation.  The new stuff is not the same at all, and calling it &amp;#34;ojon&amp;#34; cashes in on the name but sells junk.  I have tried to understand this and be fair, but the truth is just the truth.  Products are supposed to be made to please customers, and if you have a good product, people will buy more.  Isn&#x27;t that how is should work?  Well it started out OK, but somewhere along the line you sold out both on having a good product, and pleasing your customers  Too bad, because the next phase is losing your customers and your prosperity.  I won&#x27;t feel bad for you though, because being sold out makes me angry.  And I, like many others , will find other products.  You aren&#x27;t the only show in town, and someone will capitalize on your failure.  Trying to fool your customers just doesn&#x27;t work.  WE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE, get it? Unwilling to change back?  Then, so long Ojon, you had no respect for your customers, and now we have none for you.</li>
            <li> I use Kerastase but like to give my hair a break every few weeks as it gets used to a product.  I purchased a sampler pack for $5 directly from Ojon and am very impressed with the product.  I have fine thinning hair so was concerned that the oil would weigh my hair down.  Did not weigh it down for me.  I would suggest purchasing the sampler pack directly from Ojon as they give you a great selection plus extra samples - great deal for $5.  I definitely noticed an improvement in my hair with less frizzing so will be purchasing full products.</li>
            <li> IT WAS NOT THE SIZE EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> This product came to me highly recommended because I had never heard of it. I used it for my thinning hair along the edges. However, after about a week, I noticed my hair shedding more around my edges, until I could completely see my scalp. I am African American with natural hair (no chemicals), so I did not expect to see my hair shedding from this product. Suffice it to say, I was very disappointed and still have practically a full jar after using this product for only two weeks.</li>
            <li> So I read this would really help oily hair, but after following the directions and coating / leaving it in my hair it was so hard to get out I had to shampoo like 3 times and the last time was with a really drying shampoo like head and shoulders. Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t good for fine, oily hair. I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li> great conditioner I leave it on overnight and it works for two days.</li>
            <li> I can never get enough of this  restorative product. A  little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Take time [ 20 + minutes ] for maximum results.</li>
            <li> Well i gave it the rating I did was because I did not see an improvement on my hair. Specifically my split ends. I would recommend this product to someone who is willing to spend all their money on a little tub of reverse oil that does not work. Well for my hair at least. Maybe, a different type of hair and body chemical.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon. I bought it on EBay and I got SAMPLES. I think if you&#x27;re going to try this, you should do the same. I got 5 sample packets which equaled the same as a small jar of this that sells on here for $30..but I got it for $9.99. It DOES work. You won&#x27;t wash your hair and be like \\&quot;omg my life has changed forever\\&quot; lol but if u have damaged DRY hair, u are in for a treat. My hair was breaking off at like MID-length and making me want to cry bc I have naturally gorgeous hair but I straighten it a lot and have been using way too much silicone protector for it which made it so much worse. I think silicones coat the hair and keep moisture out of your hair so yeah, while they might smooth it in the short-term and protect it, DON&#x27;T overdo the heat protectors. They&#x27;re the DEVIL. I promise. My hair was drier than ever in my whole life. I&#x27;m caucasian BTW, and don&#x27;t do anything like color or perm my hair..I just use a lot of heat. Anyway, keep this stuff on overnight and sleep with it in.. It&#x27;s an OIL so don&#x27;t be thinking you can put it in and go in public or anything. You&#x27;ll look gross. Lol I use Vatika coconut oil before bed alot but this worked SO much better. My hair is of course still broken where it was broken but I can run my fingers through it and feel how moisturized it is now, compared to before I used it, and it makes me so happy bc I know I stopped alot of further damage from happening. This could save your hair. It sucks that its so expensive AND small. Even the bigger 3.1 oz container is small..that&#x27;s not going to go a long way so hopefully it doesn&#x27;t need to be used very often to keep your hair in good condition. By the way, I have hair down to the middle of my back and it took a half oz. to get my hair all covered. (Roots to tip) BUT you don&#x27;t have to use it on your entire head..u can just do midlength to the ends to make it last longer, as most damage is down at the ends. I like the feel of this stuff, too. It has a light creamy oil texture..really soft..and it&#x27;s not drippy. Almost like vasoline but not as thick. It smells good IF u get the kind that says \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; ...its a better version of the other stuff..just has a better smell, because I guess the other kind smelled like ashes :( The new formula has a very light, fresh smell. Hope I was somewhat informative :)</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, it was almost 7 years ago. I bought in Sephora a beauty store and it smelled heavenly. I remember watching a commercial on it oh how it came from the hazelnut plant and Amazonian Indians had used Ojon for thier hair for generations. I loved the smell and it smelled like hazelnut and sandlewood. Just fabulous. What I got in the mail was a liquid oil that smelled like cinnamon. Not the Ojon I remember, I found the smell so distasteful I sent it back immediately. There are so many oils that are good for your hair, I would not be using this again. Sadly the changed to the composition to a much inferior product. I remember the good old stuff and that stuff was amazing. I had such a reaction to it the strong cinnamon odor I started to tear up, no way this was going on my head.</li>
            <li> So far I have onl;y used it twice but was well pleasws with the results.  Will do the third treatmernt tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once as it just arrived and I can seriously see and feel a difference. My hair still needs some work but I&#x27;m feeling hopeful as the results so far exceeded my expectations. Its a bit pricey in my opinion for the amount received but it works so well that I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I had very damaged hair from bleaching and straightening my hair on a daily basis. I have thick curly hair and nothing would fix my brittle breaking hair except this. My mom introduced me to this when they had the orignal sent, which I love!l but it&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is personally the best hair mask I have ever used!  It leaves my curly hair shiny and bouncy.  I love that it hydrates so well without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, frizzy, african american hair that&#x27;s been subject to a lot of heat damage over the years. I bought this hoping it would add moisture to my hair and prevent breakage. I applied the whole jar to dry hair the first time I got it. I have a lot of hair so I couldn&#x27;t help but use the whole thing to ensure saturation. I put my hair in braids then slept with it on overnight in hopes of getting the full effects. I think I could see some difference in texture. My hair wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt softer to the touch. But honestly I don&#x27;t think the minimal effects were worth the price. I don&#x27;t like the way this smells, it isn&#x27;t pleasant at all. Olive oil works way better for me and it&#x27;s way less expensive. I won&#x27;t buy this ever again.</li>
            <li> was what i order and my hair is so much nicer and perfect lately love it. thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is the new scent of Ojon. I am an Ojon fanatic. I buy the huge jar when QVC has it and it lasts a long time. I wanted to try the new scent in a small size to see if I liked it before I spent a lot of money in it and didn&#x27;t like it. LOVE IT.  It smells wonderful and have gotten compliments on how my hair smells.  Of course, Ojon leaves your hair feeling like silk and I am African American and my hair is natural and I use it as a conditioner and then press my hair with it. Wonderful product and will never be without it.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve been using this every other day, i like to leave it on a little longer - sometimes overnight.  my hair feels much much healthier, and looks better too.</li>
            <li> If you have dry unruly hair, then this is the product that is missing from your life!&lt;br /&gt;I completely see a difference if I dont use it.</li>
            <li> consistency is different, its yellow and melts better, the old version use to curdle in little bits . it also doesnt smell as nutty. still makes my hair shiny and not dry. its still better than alot of other products, i have curly hair</li>
            <li> I bought the Plus Restorative Hair Treatment to compare to the Original.  The New Plus Version has a very faint perfume scent where as the Original has a rich, smokey, burnt caramel scent which I enjoy the most!  Both glides onto the hair nicely. But the Original Version is much thicker and needs to be emulsified before applying to the hair, where as, it isn&#x27;t necessary to do so with the Newer Version.  I&#x27;ve used it after my Henna Treatment which can be very drying to the hair. It made my Tightly Coily hair extremely soft and manageable.  I will stick to the Original Version.</li>
            <li> 1 of the best hair care products in the country! I also use their shampoos&amp; conditioners&amp; they have improved the condition of my hair in so many positive ways! Softer, less breakage, easier 2 manage &amp; most important healthier than its ever been- All of their products are great!! You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great treatment for restoring the hair that was thinning around the edges, framing my face. I saw results after the first treatment. No more breakage.</li>
            <li> this product is great .love it . cant wait to order another one for my self and my daughter. great.</li>
            <li> I love ojon products and I always make sure I don&#x27;t run out. Living here in Colorado the winters are harsh on the skin and hair this stuff helps my hair survive the harsh weather. The smell might be a turn off to some but I like it, and it does rinse out so after you wash your hair just feels like it went through a nice conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> First time trying this was a sample package Sephora sent with my order.&lt;br /&gt;A while ago I went light honey brown from dark dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;And my hair died a little.&lt;br /&gt;Used this.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was bouncy shiny, pressed very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I went from light honey brown, to jet black.&lt;br /&gt;And bought this, and its such a wonderful product. EVERYTHING COMES OUT PERFECT BUY IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the 1.5 oz is VERYYYY small. had no idea.</li>
