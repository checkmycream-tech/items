    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this.</li>
            <li>A good value!!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT for coloring roots</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly on blondes and it had great coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a bit of practice, and a good brush, no one was the wiser!  </li>
            <li>It works great on the synthetic hair and you can always just wash it out of the wig when you don&#x27;t need the darker color on it any longer.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, but the product leaves an impression of having greasy hair</li>
            <li>Love it this product works great fast and easy to use I am very happy with this product I would order it again!</li>
            <li>The color also comes off of clothes and skin very easily.</li>
            <li>Great solution for 3/4 wigs and extensions when the color doesn&#x27;t match your hair exactly.</li>
            <li>but this has more in it</li>
            <li>I had to use a glosser on top of it and cover my hair over night to keep it from getting on my pillow case.</li>
            <li>I found that it was just as good as &amp;#34;Grey Away&#x27;, but much cheaper!  </li>
            <li>Better to go to good salon and ask them for a temp product, they have a much gentler &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; or brush on powder.</li>
            <li>Covers gray and easy to use without committing to color.</li>
            <li>The color is fine, but don&#x27;t touch your hair after spraying.  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;skunk line&amp;#34; grows in rather quickly and this spray helps me to extend my trip to the salon over a week more than I would normally have to go.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals, tried 3 versions of this type of product and threw them all out...causes breakage in the hair, end up with more dry and unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>This spray is great for covering roots or uneven color.</li>
            <li>The color is great and the price is reasonable compared to some other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a quick touch up for a night out, but not for regular use between coloring.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and u don&#x27;t have to use so much.</li>
            <li>I use this on my wigs to help blend the color into my real hair.  </li>
            <li>Was worth a try only because of the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t absolutely love it because it doesn&#x27;t match my dark brown color completely</li>
            <li>I have naturally light hair and like to dye it dark; which can create some horrendous roots.</li>
            <li>I used this to cover my wildly colored streaks for a professional meeting with people who know me well.</li>
            <li>not actually very dark at all.</li>
            <li>It does cover grey hair very well.</li>
            <li>This spray covered the gray in my hair very well but it leaves a very dry look and feel to the hair.</li>

            <li> I had previously been purchasing &#x27;Grey Away&#x27;, but it was a bit pricey!  </li>
            <li> This is a life saver for those of us who are gray and had naturally dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaves your hair feeling a little stiff, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It rubbed off on EVERYTHING and made a mess of my costume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It had a slight chemical odor but nothing serious.</li>
            <li> Works well and isn&#x27;t too dark or fake looking.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> HATED IT!</li>

            <li> not actually very dark at all. erg.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this. I bought a deferent one but this has more in it and u don&#x27;t have to use so much. You&#x27;ll definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This was the messiest product I have ever used! It rubbed off on EVERYTHING and made a mess of my costume. It took 3 shampoos to get out of my hair and left my sink coated with this stuff! AWFUL! HATED IT!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Covers gray and easy to use without committing to color.</li>
            <li> I always use this product . Works well and isn&#x27;t too dark or fake looking. It will transfer on to clothes or hands if u touch your hair after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li> This color does not really &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and gets on everything when touched, even hours after applying.  The color is fine, but don&#x27;t touch your hair after spraying.  The spray nozzle also drips occasionally which is a pain if it drips on the sink/clothes.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does cover grey hair very well. I only rated it with 3 stars because it is not waterproof. The color is great and the price is reasonable compared to some other products.</li>
            <li> This product left stains on my pillow. My current, more expensive brand does NOT.  Was worth a try only because of the price.</li>
            <li> I use this on my wigs to help blend the color into my real hair.  It works great on the synthetic hair and you can always just wash it out of the wig when you don&#x27;t need the darker color on it any longer.  Great solution for 3/4 wigs and extensions when the color doesn&#x27;t match your hair exactly.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I don&#x27;t absolutely love it because it doesn&#x27;t match my dark brown color completely but it helps during those times I could use a touch-up!</li>
            <li> Love it this product works great fast and easy to use I am very happy with this product I would order it again!</li>
            <li> Good coverage, but the product leaves an impression of having greasy hair</li>

            <li> I had previously been purchasing &#x27;Grey Away&#x27;, but it was a bit pricey!  Decided to try this product as the price was very low.  I found that it was just as good as &amp;#34;Grey Away&#x27;, but much cheaper!  Also, the size of the can is about twice the size of the &amp;#34;Grey Away&amp;#34; product!  A good value!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I&#x27;m not crazy about this product. If you don&#x27;t wash your hair before going to bed, you&#x27;ll find it on your pillow case in the morning. It also comes off on your hands if you run your hands through your hair or if anyone else does. It&#x27;s okay for a quick touch up for a night out, but not for regular use between coloring.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT for coloring roots</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It worked perfectly on blondes and it had great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;It had a slight chemical odor but nothing serious. I would  defiantly buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally light hair and like to dye it dark; which can create some horrendous roots. This spray is great for covering roots or uneven color. Unfortunately it leaves your hair feeling a little stiff, but it is well worth it. The color also comes off of clothes and skin very easily.</li>
