            <li>Excellent product, I use it for body massages and it leaves my body hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an oil type mist that gives you a perfect glow when used on top of make-up or just mist over your natural beauty.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nice and light.</li>
            <li>This product was advertised as smelling like the sea, but it smells more like a petroleum product to me.  </li>
            <li>So glad I could find this (of course) on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the Feeling of the oilspray on my Skin after having a shower.</li>
            <li>Smells like summer, works magically with no danger of staining clothes and no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products of the H20+ Sea Salt line.  </li>
            <li>I have compared with other products and have found that this is the best!</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, light and fresh and not too strong.</li>
            <li>As it first goes on, seemed like it would be oily but is absorbed into skin and smells nice.</li>
            <li>this specific one is so good  </li>
            <li>I love this so much that I sent a bottle of it to a dear friend in Italy.  </li>

            <li>Nice product, although a little more pricier than drugstore versions</li>
            <li>Summer time should be fun for an all over body glow and beach hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it lasted a little longer on skin but good product.</li>
            <li>Tried for the first time a week ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and hard to apply on the skin which makes it the best so far.</li>
            <li>I love the H20 spa hydrating body gloss because of the sweet fresh clean scent and because it moisturized areas of my body I am unable to reach.</li>
            <li>Give you that high sheen</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I put this all over my body every day and my skin is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the softness of my skin and that&#x27;s saying a lot since we seem to have no humidity here whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of pure Argan oil in the bottle.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Most H20 products are really good. this specific one is so good  I&#x27;ve been applying it every day over my arms and legs. My skin is extremely dry and this hydrates it with just a little coat which easilly spreads over my skin with a subtle aroma. It&#x27;s not thick and hard to apply on the skin which makes it the best so far.</li>
            <li> Amazing body mosterizor spray.  Great for after shower. Dries instantly. Leaves skin soft and hydrated. Great seller.</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell and it just does not do anything to yor skin. My skin is dryer than before I use this prioduct. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I put this all over my body every day and my skin is soft and silky. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great scent but not overpowering.  Was hesitant because of the price (I&#x27;m a bargain shopper/penny pincher) but use it in conjunction with a daily St Ives lotion.  A couple pumps of lotion with a couple squirts of this spray and I&#x27;m set.  I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the softness of my skin and that&#x27;s saying a lot since we seem to have no humidity here whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was my 1st time to use it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I ordered 2 and my daughter &amp;#34;snuck&amp;#34; one of them! Now we&#x27;re both fans! I will continue to order and use this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Nice and light. Smells nice. Not greasy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I love the H20 spa hydrating body gloss because of the sweet fresh clean scent and because it moisturized areas of my body I am unable to reach.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised as smelling like the sea, but it smells more like a petroleum product to me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, and I feel like my itchy and dry back are not getting any relief from this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product, although a little more pricier than drugstore versions it has a very nice smell to it, light, airy not flowery. Did not stain my clothes. Wish it lasted a little longer on skin but good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had heard it was a red carpet must have because it will not stain your clothes. It&#x27;s an oil type mist that gives you a perfect glow when used on top of make-up or just mist over your natural beauty. I even mist it into my hair when pulling it all up. It gives it a nice shine. I would have to say, you only need a little. Don&#x27;t over do-it or you will wind up oily. Also, I learned to cover my eyes to avoid getting the mist on my lashes. It does not play well with mascara. I will definitely be keeping this product on hand. Summer time should be fun for an all over body glow and beach hair. It smells nice too!! Amazing. A must have!</li>
            <li> Does not hydrate the body at all. As soon as you spray it on, within a couple of minutes, your skin in dry and ashy looking.</li>
            <li> So glad I could find this (of course) on Amazon. Bought in Disney World Resort last year and could not find here. I love this. It has a very light clean fragrance and feel great when putting on to moisturize legs and arms. It is a light oil!! Thank you Amozon for being able to have the products in one store that we need!!</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE A SUMMER TAN, AND ARE GOING OUT FOR AN EVENT, THIS IS THE PERFECT SPRAY TO PUT ON.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. Not greasy at all. It is a great replacement for lotion when you&#x27;re out. It smells wonderful and hydrates your skin really well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the Feeling of the oilspray on my Skin after having a shower.</li>
            <li> This spray is okay, but I found cheaper ones on Ebay that are just as good.</li>
            <li> I adore this product! Smells like summer, works magically with no danger of staining clothes and no greasy feel. Absorbs instantly. Will always keep this product in my daily regime. Beautiful glow too!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it should... Give you that high sheen😏</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and texture of this spray--so handy!</li>
            <li> Very good product! I love all H2O products! Smells good, not too strong!&lt;br /&gt;Love dry oil, it is moisturizing and not oily.</li>
            <li> Love This Stuff!! Gave it for gifts also!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Fast and easy to use and not greasy.  As it first goes on, seemed like it would be oily but is absorbed into skin and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without a greasy feel, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use it for body massages and it leaves my body hydrated and soft.  I have compared with other products and have found that this is the best!</li>
            <li> Tried for the first time a week ago. I use every day after getting out of the shower. Spray all over and rub in to moist skin. Feels great! Noticeably softer and hydrated skin. Smell is nice, light and fresh and not too strong. Non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. Everyone should try.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products of the H20+ Sea Salt line.  I especially love this in the summertime when temps are 100+.  I add a few drops of pure Argan oil in the bottle. I love this so much that I sent a bottle of it to a dear friend in Italy.  She, too, loves it.  I&#x27;ll be sending her more!!</li>
            <li> Love this! Not too greasy, goes on nice and light and smells great.</li>
