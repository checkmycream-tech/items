            <li>It gives her great motivation to brush her teeth and keep them clean.</li>
            <li>There is a web site that you can make custom front panels, but will just make my own with the princess foil stickers :)</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job cleaning and the brush is just the perfect size for a little mouth.</li>
            <li>She was happy to have her first battery operated brush.</li>

            <li>And it is healthy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it and make sure the batteries can be changed.</li>
            <li>Just had another dental checkup and no cavities! :)</li>
            <li>It cleans her teeth :)</li>
            <li>the most part I am pleased.</li>
            <li>it seems that most of these childrens toothbrushes on Amazon are junky.</li>
            <li>My daughter love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, wish I had started out by buying the soniccare kids, which I ended up doing anyway.</li>
            <li>and you have to make certain they have good brushing habits.</li>
            <li>very happy with it, a bit wide.</li>
            <li>Our granddaughter loved her new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Price is competitive with stores and it is an easy add-on to an order.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the perfect incentive for your little one to brush his/her teeth.</li>
            <li>The item description says the recommended age is 3 and up, but I think it would be more suitable for older children.</li>
            <li>Cute and colorful for my niece who has cavities and infections.</li>
            <li>The brush had a really gentle agitator and didn&#x27;t seem very effective much when I turned it on.</li>
            <li>and was very good comparing to other sites</li>
            <li>its something she waits to do for bed time and gets excited</li>
            <li>Today is day 3 and she is letting me brush 2 times a day for the first time without a fight because she loves her princess brush :)</li>
            <li>Kid friendly size.....they like the characters.</li>
            <li>She was so excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right size for her hands and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>to her, because it&#x27;s princess makes it special.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is so cute that my daugter likes it very well</li>
            <li>Wanted to get my 5 year old daughter a spinning brush to make it easier for her to brush her own teeth.  </li>
            <li>Very cute anyway and most importantly, our little princess loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got one for my 4 year old and my 22month old and they work great.</li>
            <li>On the positive, this makes brushing teeth much more enjoyable for our 4 year old</li>
            <li>My daughter was excited because she loves the princesses right now.</li>
            <li>my daughter like it very much!</li>
            <li>Great tooth brush to get your little one use to an electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my little niece (4years old)</li>
            <li>Has our five year old into brushing more.</li>
            <li>better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>brushing teeth a fun activity .</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s fun to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>my 4 year old just love it.</li>
            <li>so she can join in the fun.  </li>
            <li>this Oral B is nothing exciting.  </li>
            <li>It was just from her overnight bag but just for fun, I ordered her this as a gift.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had any great experiences with them after buying all different kinds (some on Amazon, some at my local store).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this brush seems fun to my 4yo daughter, and any agitation with the bristles is probably going to be better than manual brushing with a standard brush.</li>
            <li>our granddaughter likes this toothbrush so very much.  </li>
            <li>my baby girl like it very much</li>
            <li>item exactly as d—Éscribed, arrived it time.</li>
            <li>Only the top section spins.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys the vibration; I think it gives her a bit of teething relief!</li>
            <li>I think I prefer standard toothbrushes because I feel like I&#x27;m doing a better job cleaning my kids&#x27; teeth</li>
            <li>She was weary at first but got used to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ariel is featured on the yellow ring that surrounds the top of the handle.</li>
            <li>it not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>Espesially if you have a stubborn baby that wants to do it all her self!</li>
            <li>I promised to buy her a tooth brush and this one is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>, she celan her teeth and enjoy each time, she can use it by herself without adult supervisied</li>
            <li>her teeth will be getting brushed better</li>
            <li>Great little electric toothbrush starter for my three year old!</li>
            <li>With my son&#x27;s love, he used ordinary toothbrush front tooth brush is not very clean, but the use of the Oral B said he is very nice, very convenient, but also brush teeth clean, my friend asked me to help them buy.</li>
            <li>and she now spends a much longer time doing so and her teeth look better, overall.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really does a better job, then a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good handle large multi-point ~ ~ small</li>
            <li>My daughter found it quite bulky and she couldn&#x27;t reach her back molars easily with the brush.</li>
            <li>Head is a bit large for her mouth though.</li>
            <li>She quickly picked up on turning it off to spit and to turn it right back on to continue brushing.</li>
            <li>Works fine for both 5-yr old and 8-yr old girls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a gentle brush agitator, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really doing much when I turn it on and touch it to my fingertip.  </li>
            <li>We bought it for our 8 year daughter as she really loves the princess characters of Disney.</li>
            <li>and she loves it so much that i never have to tell her to go brush her teeth,</li>
            <li>We bought these to make sure the kids would use them before we spent money on the Braun tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all moms!</li>
            <li>I do wish that Sonicare made a kids toothbrush with a princess plate, so we would just need to replace the brush heads, as this seems wasteful to throw whole unit away.</li>
            <li>my baby like it so much .</li>
            <li>The package came vrey fast in 4 days altough im a soldier</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will have to through the whole thing out after 3-4 months and the plastic and electrical components will sit in toxic landfill - can&#x27;t believe Oral B are trying to squeeze profit out like this.  </li>
            <li>Very nicly manufacture.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>It will clean your teeth, but expect the noise and bulk for smaller kiddos.</li>
            <li>This will entice her to brush better and cut down on the sugars.</li>
            <li>So much so we needed to replace a fully functioning set of 2 for our kids since they needed a new head.</li>
            <li>My 2 and 4 year old use this toothbrush and their teeth are kept white and clean since the bristles brush all their teeth well and dont miss a spot.</li>
            <li>But maybe that&#x27;s good enough for small teeth.</li>
            <li>But it does vibrate reliably, and maybe that&#x27;s good enough for small teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Picked up the new kids sonicare for my daughter with the new graphics and colors.  </li>
            <li>and i live in europe</li>
            <li>I wanted to use the additional $14 from the certificate on a new item but they would not let me do that.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loves her new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had an extra brush head, unused, and put a pink ring around the top to mark it as hers...</li>
            <li>She would like very much, because there is a pattern of above Cinderella!</li>
            <li>WoW!</li>
            <li>Wish the head was smaller for my daughters first toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter used to fight me to brush her teeth, but since getting this toothbrush it&#x27;s been a breeze!</li>
            <li>feel, look, and build, overall, seem much higher quality than what this cost us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a wide-grip handle, so it is easy for little hands to hold.</li>
            <li>The on and off buttons are also easy to activate for little fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter isn&#x27;t a huge fan of brushing her teeth and only brushes for a few seconds unless you are staring right at her.</li>
            <li>i order the new princess why i receive old style not showed on the picture??????</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t reach her back molars unless she makes a huge effort to open up as far as possible.  </li>
            <li>and I think the extra action really helps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i gave this tooth brush as a birthday gift for my 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I was having it out nightly with my 2 year old daughter when it came to brushing her teeth, but now she looks forward to brushing.</li>
            <li>My two year old loves it.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of getting one for my two-year old and she&#x27;s freaked out by it.  </li>
            <li>I use this with all natural toothpaste and it works well for us.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter to use when she is staying with us.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 4 year old who despises brushing.</li>
            <li>I feel like having an electric toothbrush for a 1 year old</li>
            <li>At least this way I feel like it is cleaning some of the germs off for her:)</li>
            <li>The only downside of this brush is that you can&#x27;t just replace the head, you have to replace the whole thing which I&#x27;ve already had to do because she had strep throat.</li>
            <li>have switched my whole family to Phillips starting with these http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HX6311-07-Rechargeable-Toothbrush/dp/B00G5L867C/ref&#x3D;dp_ob_title_hpc</li>
            <li>and I have an adult battery toothbrush</li>
            <li>I have been fighting with my 20 month old to brush her teeth and decided to try this brush.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just too much plastic to hold the mechanical pieces inside the head, and while I&#x27;m trying to brush the upper molars,</li>
            <li>the underside of the brush hits against the bottom molars, preventing me from really getting back there and brushing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we had a much better report from the dentist a few months later.</li>
            <li>It has power to clean, but gentle enough for her small and young mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li>Her teeth are clean and mommy is less stressed out!</li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves this toothbrush so much that I have to limit how long she brushes her teeth!  </li>
            <li>surprised to find Ariel was front and center and other princesses smaller at the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She took it home to make it her new regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft enough where it doesn&#x27;t bother her sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>She is four years old and this tooth brush has actually inspired her to brush her teeth &amp;#34;all by [her]self&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My daughter like,but I felt too big for my 5 years old kid.</li>
            <li>My kids are 4 and 5 years old and of course you have to double check their teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pity as my 6 year old really like the princess toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts at least three months, bristles are soft  and the design is pretty for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you can&#x27;t change the head on it so once the brush is worn down you have to throw the whole thing out.</li>
            <li>Bought for 3 year old and she would bite the head and crush it and batteries dont last very long.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, the bristles are soft, and it is not very loud so it is not intimidating.</li>

            <li> I think it does a great job cleaning and the brush is just the perfect size for a little mouth.</li>
            <li> She was happy to have her first battery operated brush.</li>

            <li> at this price is ok.</li>
            <li> And it is healthy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it and make sure the batteries can be changed.</li>
            <li> Just had another dental checkup and no cavities! :)</li>
            <li> It cleans her teeth :)</li>
            <li> the most part I am pleased.</li>
            <li> it seems that most of these childrens toothbrushes on Amazon are junky.</li>
            <li> My daughter love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, wish I had started out by buying the soniccare kids, which I ended up doing anyway.</li>
            <li> and you have to make certain they have good brushing habits.</li>
            <li> very happy with it, a bit wide.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loved her new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Price is competitive with stores and it is an easy add-on to an order.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the perfect incentive for your little one to brush his/her teeth.</li>
            <li> The item description says the recommended age is 3 and up, but I think it would be more suitable for older children.</li>
            <li> Cute and colorful for my niece who has cavities and infections.</li>
            <li> The brush had a really gentle agitator and didn&#x27;t seem very effective much when I turned it on.</li>
            <li> and was very good comparing to other sites</li>
            <li> its something she waits to do for bed time and gets excited</li>
            <li> Today is day 3 and she is letting me brush 2 times a day for the first time without a fight because she loves her princess brush :)</li>
            <li> Kid friendly size.....they like the characters.</li>
            <li> She was so excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right size for her hands and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> to her, because it&#x27;s princess makes it special.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is so cute that my daugter likes it very well</li>
            <li> Wanted to get my 5 year old daughter a spinning brush to make it easier for her to brush her own teeth.  </li>
            <li> Very cute anyway and most importantly, our little princess loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got one for my 4 year old and my 22month old and they work great.</li>
            <li> On the positive, this makes brushing teeth much more enjoyable for our 4 year old</li>
            <li> My daughter was excited because she loves the princesses right now.</li>
            <li> my daughter like it very much!</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush to get your little one use to an electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little niece (4years old)</li>
            <li> Has our five year old into brushing more.</li>
            <li> better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> brushing teeth a fun activity .</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s fun to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> my 4 year old just love it.</li>
            <li> so she can join in the fun.  </li>
            <li> this Oral B is nothing exciting.  </li>
            <li> It was just from her overnight bag but just for fun, I ordered her this as a gift.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any great experiences with them after buying all different kinds (some on Amazon, some at my local store).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this brush seems fun to my 4yo daughter, and any agitation with the bristles is probably going to be better than manual brushing with a standard brush.</li>
            <li> our granddaughter likes this toothbrush so very much.  </li>
            <li> my baby girl like it very much</li>
            <li> item exactly as d—Éscribed, arrived it time.</li>
            <li> Only the top section spins.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys the vibration; I think it gives her a bit of teething relief!</li>
            <li> I think I prefer standard toothbrushes because I feel like I&#x27;m doing a better job cleaning my kids&#x27; teeth</li>
            <li> She was weary at first but got used to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ariel is featured on the yellow ring that surrounds the top of the handle.</li>
            <li> it not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Espesially if you have a stubborn baby that wants to do it all her self!</li>
            <li> I promised to buy her a tooth brush and this one is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> , she celan her teeth and enjoy each time, she can use it by herself without adult supervisied</li>
            <li> her teeth will be getting brushed better</li>
            <li> Great little electric toothbrush starter for my three year old!</li>
            <li> With my son&#x27;s love, he used ordinary toothbrush front tooth brush is not very clean, but the use of the Oral B said he is very nice, very convenient, but also brush teeth clean, my friend asked me to help them buy.</li>
            <li> and she now spends a much longer time doing so and her teeth look better, overall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really does a better job, then a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good handle large multi-point ~ ~ small</li>
            <li> My daughter found it quite bulky and she couldn&#x27;t reach her back molars easily with the brush.</li>
            <li> Head is a bit large for her mouth though.</li>
            <li> She quickly picked up on turning it off to spit and to turn it right back on to continue brushing.</li>
            <li> Works fine for both 5-yr old and 8-yr old girls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a gentle brush agitator, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really doing much when I turn it on and touch it to my fingertip.  </li>
            <li> We bought it for our 8 year daughter as she really loves the princess characters of Disney.</li>
            <li> and she loves it so much that i never have to tell her to go brush her teeth,</li>
            <li> We bought these to make sure the kids would use them before we spent money on the Braun tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all moms!</li>
            <li> I do wish that Sonicare made a kids toothbrush with a princess plate, so we would just need to replace the brush heads, as this seems wasteful to throw whole unit away.</li>
            <li> my baby like it so much .</li>
            <li> The package came vrey fast in 4 days altough im a soldier</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will have to through the whole thing out after 3-4 months and the plastic and electrical components will sit in toxic landfill - can&#x27;t believe Oral B are trying to squeeze profit out like this.  </li>
            <li> Very nicly manufacture.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> It will clean your teeth, but expect the noise and bulk for smaller kiddos.</li>
            <li> This will entice her to brush better and cut down on the sugars.</li>
            <li> So much so we needed to replace a fully functioning set of 2 for our kids since they needed a new head.</li>
            <li> My 2 and 4 year old use this toothbrush and their teeth are kept white and clean since the bristles brush all their teeth well and dont miss a spot.</li>
            <li> But maybe that&#x27;s good enough for small teeth.</li>
            <li> But it does vibrate reliably, and maybe that&#x27;s good enough for small teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Picked up the new kids sonicare for my daughter with the new graphics and colors.  </li>
            <li> and i live in europe</li>
            <li> I wanted to use the additional $14 from the certificate on a new item but they would not let me do that.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves her new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had an extra brush head, unused, and put a pink ring around the top to mark it as hers...</li>
            <li> She would like very much, because there is a pattern of above Cinderella!</li>
            <li> WoW!</li>
            <li> Wish the head was smaller for my daughters first toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter used to fight me to brush her teeth, but since getting this toothbrush it&#x27;s been a breeze!</li>
            <li> feel, look, and build, overall, seem much higher quality than what this cost us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a wide-grip handle, so it is easy for little hands to hold.</li>
            <li> The on and off buttons are also easy to activate for little fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter isn&#x27;t a huge fan of brushing her teeth and only brushes for a few seconds unless you are staring right at her.</li>
            <li> i order the new princess why i receive old style not showed on the picture??????</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t reach her back molars unless she makes a huge effort to open up as far as possible.  </li>
            <li> and I think the extra action really helps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i gave this tooth brush as a birthday gift for my 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I was having it out nightly with my 2 year old daughter when it came to brushing her teeth, but now she looks forward to brushing.</li>
            <li> My two year old loves it.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting one for my two-year old and she&#x27;s freaked out by it.  </li>
            <li> I use this with all natural toothpaste and it works well for us.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter to use when she is staying with us.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 4 year old who despises brushing.</li>
            <li> I feel like having an electric toothbrush for a 1 year old</li>
            <li> At least this way I feel like it is cleaning some of the germs off for her:)</li>
            <li> The only downside of this brush is that you can&#x27;t just replace the head, you have to replace the whole thing which I&#x27;ve already had to do because she had strep throat.</li>
            <li> have switched my whole family to Phillips starting with these http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HX6311-07-Rechargeable-Toothbrush/dp/B00G5L867C/ref&#x3D;dp_ob_title_hpc</li>
            <li> and I have an adult battery toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have been fighting with my 20 month old to brush her teeth and decided to try this brush.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just too much plastic to hold the mechanical pieces inside the head, and while I&#x27;m trying to brush the upper molars,</li>
            <li> the underside of the brush hits against the bottom molars, preventing me from really getting back there and brushing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we had a much better report from the dentist a few months later.</li>
            <li> It has power to clean, but gentle enough for her small and young mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li> Her teeth are clean and mommy is less stressed out!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves this toothbrush so much that I have to limit how long she brushes her teeth!  </li>
            <li> surprised to find Ariel was front and center and other princesses smaller at the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She took it home to make it her new regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft enough where it doesn&#x27;t bother her sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> She is four years old and this tooth brush has actually inspired her to brush her teeth &amp;#34;all by [her]self&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughter like,but I felt too big for my 5 years old kid.</li>
            <li> My kids are 4 and 5 years old and of course you have to double check their teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a pity as my 6 year old really like the princess toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts at least three months, bristles are soft  and the design is pretty for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you can&#x27;t change the head on it so once the brush is worn down you have to throw the whole thing out.</li>
            <li> Bought for 3 year old and she would bite the head and crush it and batteries dont last very long.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, the bristles are soft, and it is not very loud so it is not intimidating.</li>
            <li> The brush is just mechanically loud and the head of the brush is too thick to reach the back molars without really stretching out the cheeks</li>
            <li> When I do brush her teeth for her, she is much less resistant to this than a normal brush</li>
            <li> did take a much longer time to get than I usually experience with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Battery did not last long.  </li>
            <li> Curious to see how long the brush itself will last.</li>
            <li> but now she wants her teeth brush not sure where these were 17 years ago when my son was born!</li>
            <li> I mean what all can you really say about a child&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and the fact is that was not written on its description on site so its sort of single use.... too bad because is a nice one for kids.</li>
            <li> and she had forgotten to put her other toothbrush back into her bag</li>
            <li> However, the brush head is a little large for a small child.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind throwing out ten bucks every month or so, then you might want to stick with a regular toothbrush or invest in one that is made for adults (but buy the small replaceable brush heads for kids, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, it would get 5 stars if it was a little smaller on the head for my toddler.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little to big for my daughter, per the dentist.</li>
            <li> now she will brush her teeth without a fuss and this is hard to get a 3 year old to brush her teeth after bath time</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I did purchase two of them for both of my daughters and one had a harder spin than the other.</li>
            <li> This does not make noise like other Disney tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that this has performed well for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I received a product other than what was pictured.</li>
            <li> I feel that I did not get the full use of the certificate and am unhappy with the outcome and</li>
            <li> I bought two electric toothbrushes, one being this Oral B Disney toothbrush, and the other a Colgate Spongebob toothbrush  </li>
            <li> For a mom who has been quite frustrated with attempting to brush her 1-year old&#x27;s teeth, this clever spinbrush has been a blessing!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery is not replaceable, so when it dies we will have to buy another toothbrush, which seems wasteful.</li>
            <li> This seems to be drip-stop, to keep toothpaste from running down the handle on to little fingers.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a little over a month and have already changed the batteries twice.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little bulky to handle, but not a problem.</li>
            <li> My little one loves it.  </li>
            <li> i purchased 3 items for my daughter, she loves it and she enjoys to brush teeth everyday</li>
            <li> The really bad part is that brush head is not replaceable so you need to replace the entire toothbrush instead of only the brush heads.</li>
            <li> My little girl loves it, thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m just being lazy.</li>
            <li> Nothing to hard though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to complain at six bucks, maybe if it cost what mine did (although for the earth&#x27;s sake, we&#x27;ll hope so!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it stinks that the battery is not replaceable but hopefully that changes in future models.</li>
            <li> not able to reach the tough spot</li>
            <li> Button very hard to push.</li>
            <li> How tough can that be?  </li>
            <li> This is also much less painful for me to use when doing her night brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate, but</li>
            <li> , poor thing!</li>
            <li> Scared her lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, needless to say, the vroom on this puppy is quite a bit gentler and does not scare her at all.</li>
            <li> but i was very disappointed that the brush is not replaceable at all.</li>

            <li> item exactly as d—Éscribed, arrived it time.</li>

            <li> I cannot review this as this will be a gift later this year.&lt;br /&gt;It did take a much longer time to get than I usually experience with Amazon.</li>

            <li> Granddaughter loves it!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is so cute that my daugter likes it very well</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush to get your little one use to an electric tooth brush. We bought these to make sure the kids would use them before we spent money on the Braun tooth brush. Only the top section spins.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my toddler it makes brushing a breeze,, we had problems before but now she wants her teeth brush not sure where these were 17 years ago when my son was born! Highly recommend for all moms!</li>
            <li> WoW! I wish I would have bought this sooner! I was having it out nightly with my 2 year old daughter when it came to brushing her teeth, but now she looks forward to brushing. She can&#x27;t wait to brush her teeth with &amp;#34;her princesses&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works fine for both 5-yr old and 8-yr old girls. Price is competitive with stores and it is an easy add-on to an order.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush. My daughter isn&#x27;t a huge fan of brushing her teeth and only brushes for a few seconds unless you are staring right at her. With this I know that she is brushing her teeth and enjoys the fact there are princesses on it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you can&#x27;t change the head on it so once the brush is worn down you have to throw the whole thing out. I think it does a great job cleaning and the brush is just the perfect size for a little mouth.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Has our five year old into brushing more.</li>
            <li> Wanted to get my 5 year old daughter a spinning brush to make it easier for her to brush her own teeth.  I feel she is brushing better now that she uses it.  She loved the princesses.</li>
            <li> My daugthers love it!!!! The best way to assure your kids get their teeth clean... Even if they do not know how to brush teeth...</li>
            <li> Cute and my daughter loves it.  Obviously the batteries are something you have to change out but it&#x27;s good.  good quality.</li>
            <li> My two year old loves it.  It gives her great motivation to brush her teeth and keep them clean. love it.</li>
            <li> Wish the head was smaller for my daughters first toothbrush. She loves the buttons and color tho</li>
            <li> my daughter like it very much! good work!</li>
            <li> Cute and colorful for my niece who has cavities and infections. This will entice her to brush better and cut down on the sugars. She was happy to have her first battery operated brush.</li>
            <li> i order the new princess why i receive old style not showed on the picture??????</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a little over a month and have already changed the batteries twice. Luckily it only takes one battery, so not so big a deal. On the positive, this makes brushing teeth much more enjoyable for our 4 year old and she now spends a much longer time doing so and her teeth look better, overall. I imagine when time comes we will be replacing this toothbrush with another of the same. I do wish that Sonicare made a kids toothbrush with a princess plate, so we would just need to replace the brush heads, as this seems wasteful to throw whole unit away.</li>
            <li> These work great.  I made the mistake of getting one for my two-year old and she&#x27;s freaked out by it.  I thought she&#x27;d like it for the teeth coming it, but the vibrations make her nervous.  My son loves his though!!</li>
            <li> She brushes her teeth by herself! She quickly picked up on turning it off to spit and to turn it right back on to continue brushing. Curious to see how long the brush itself will last.</li>
            <li> Battery did not last long.  Button very hard to push.</li>
            <li> Great, my kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;the better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes brushing teeth a fun activity .</li>
            <li> Since then, like brushing daughter</li>
            <li> bought 2 of these for the kids...going on a month of use now, and works the same as day 1.</li>
            <li> I like it, it would get 5 stars if it was a little smaller on the head for my toddler. However, it is a very good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great very cute works perfect and does the job</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves using this and brushes her own teeth.</li>
            <li> For a mom who has been quite frustrated with attempting to brush her 1-year old&#x27;s teeth, this clever spinbrush has been a blessing! She really enjoys the vibration; I think it gives her a bit of teething relief! Now in the mornings and evenings she pulls my hand to the bathroom sink to brush her teeth. I use this with all natural toothpaste and it works well for us. Her teeth are clean and mommy is less stressed out!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I work for Philips Sonicare.  With that said, my daughter wanted this because of the princesses.  Using this brush does an ok job.  I have seen the actually test on this brush vs our kids sonicare.  Picked up the new kids sonicare for my daughter with the new graphics and colors.  There is a web site that you can make custom front panels, but will just make my own with the princess foil stickers :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The brush is just mechanically loud and the head of the brush is too thick to reach the back molars without really stretching out the cheeks and my daughter hates that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It will clean your teeth, but expect the noise and bulk for smaller kiddos.</li>
            <li> My princess loves this.  She is four years old and this tooth brush has actually inspired her to brush her teeth &amp;#34;all by [her]self&amp;#34;. It can stand up on the counter by itself which is nice. The battery lasts a long time, the bristles are soft, and it is not very loud so it is not intimidating. When I do brush her teeth for her, she is much less resistant to this than a normal brush and so I can brush her teeth longer/better.  I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> very happy with it, a bit wide.</li>
            <li> my baby like it so much .</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Note its louder than most electric toothbrushes we have owned.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts at least three months, bristles are soft  and the design is pretty for my daughter.  The handle is a little bulky to handle, but not a problem.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this. I don&#x27;t expect it will last longer than 6 months (I purchased another Disney toothbrush that stopped working shortly after 6 months). Nonetheless, this is cute, and just what the toddler ordered!</li>
            <li> Good quality, worth buying</li>
            <li> my daughter love the product</li>
            <li> I think I prefer standard toothbrushes because I feel like I&#x27;m doing a better job cleaning my kids&#x27; teeth but they love to brush themselves with the electric brushes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m just being lazy. I don&#x27;t know if it really does a better job, then a regular toothbrush. But I&#x27;m just a freakin kid, what do I know.</li>
            <li> Grand daughters think I&#x27;m the bomb for bring them a tooth brush like mine, but Princess style!.... ! :)</li>
            <li> This does not make noise like other Disney tooth brushes. Besides that fact it is a good tooth brush</li>
            <li> Beautiful to look at with good size and quality.  Yes I would recommend to anyone. Perfect for kids between 6-12 years.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it .</li>
            <li> our granddaughter likes this toothbrush so very much.  to her, because it&#x27;s princess makes it special.  For us, the Oral-B brand is confidence.  It has power to clean, but gentle enough for her small and young mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the fact that this toothbrush works with the Disney app on the iPad! Makes her want to brush her teeth more often. Only downside is that sometimes I&#x27;ll catch her watching the countdown timer instead of actually brushing. Bristles are soft enough where it doesn&#x27;t bother her sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Huge hit with my 2-year-old granddaughter!  Makes her want to brush his teeth whenever she can!</li>
            <li> Bought for 3 year old and she would bite the head and crush it and batteries dont last very long.</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush for my granddaughter and she likes using it. It gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter to use when she is staying with us. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tooth fairy&amp;#34; brought this to my daughter. She loves it and I do think it gets her teeth cleaner than a standard toothbrush. My only complaint is that the battery is not replaceable, so when it dies we will have to buy another toothbrush, which seems wasteful.</li>
            <li> Cannot allow my child to use this toothbrush, I have no idea where it has been or what has already been done with it before it was sent to me.</li>
            <li> My little one loves it.  I think I might need to get her another one for grandma&#x27;s house too.  Both grandmas!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this tooth brush. It is so cute. :)</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this toothbrush and makes her want to brush her teeth which was always a challenge. Head is a bit large for her mouth though.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 4 year old who despises brushing. She was weary at first but got used to it and we had a much better report from the dentist a few months later. This is also much less painful for me to use when doing her night brushing.</li>
            <li> so convenient, my daughter very love it</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my kindergarten-aged daughter. She loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a wide-grip handle, so it is easy for little hands to hold. The on and off buttons are also easy to activate for little fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ariel is featured on the yellow ring that surrounds the top of the handle. This seems to be drip-stop, to keep toothpaste from running down the handle on to little fingers. Great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Duracell battery is included, which I was very happy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this purchase, and would but it again. This is a great item for preschool and kindergarten ages.</li>
            <li> My 2 and 4 year old use this toothbrush and their teeth are kept white and clean since the bristles brush all their teeth well and dont miss a spot. The kids love using it as well so brushing teeth is no longer a fight with the kids.</li>
            <li> at this price is ok. it not expensive at all. my daugther didnt started to brush her teeth yet but i wanted to buy her this one because its really nice. The package came vrey fast in 4 days altough im a soldier ovearseas and i live in europe but i was very disappointed that the brush is not replaceable at all. and the fact is that was not written on its description on site so its sort of single use.... too bad because is a nice one for kids.</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old daughter loves this Oral-B Pro-Health Stages DISNEY PRINCESS POWER KIDS&#x27; Toothbrush! I bought this with the matching picture on the toothpaste with princesses on it. Love it!</li>
            <li> With my son&#x27;s love, he used ordinary toothbrush front tooth brush is not very clean, but the use of the Oral B said he is very nice, very convenient, but also brush teeth clean, my friend asked me to help them buy.</li>
            <li> Its good suit for the 3+ kids my baby girl like it very much</li>
            <li> Love these! I got one for my 4 year old and my 22month old and they work great. I feel like having an electric toothbrush for a 1 year old is a must because they aren&#x27;t actually doing the proper brushing motion. At least this way I feel like it is cleaning some of the germs off for her:) Espesially if you have a stubborn baby that wants to do it all her self!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little to big for my daughter, per the dentist. she is 4. i didn&#x27;t look for an age range on it though! she really liked it though. we switched to a sonic care, but only after the dentist saying it was o big for her mouth and she had no scraping at her appointment and no cavities at age 4 with never seeing a dentist before. so i gave a 5 star because it was a good toothbrush and she loved using it.</li>
            <li> very good my daughter liked it . and was very good comparing to other sites&lt;br /&gt;recommended for both girls and boys</li>
            <li> Child absolutely loved this gift.  Said it was her &amp;#34; best Xmas present.&amp;#34;  It certainly encourages kids to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter used to fight me to brush her teeth, but since getting this toothbrush it&#x27;s been a breeze! She loves doing it herself now. The only downside of this brush is that you can&#x27;t just replace the head, you have to replace the whole thing which I&#x27;ve already had to do because she had strep throat. However, at the price, it&#x27;s no big deal to me to replace it.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because the heads aren&#x27;t replaceable.  How tough can that be?  Other than that this has performed well for over a year.  So much so we needed to replace a fully functioning set of 2 for our kids since they needed a new head.</li>
            <li> My toddler loves the princesses pictures on it, but the size of this toothbrush is too big for a toddler to handle. The item description says the recommended age is 3 and up, but I think it would be more suitable for older children.</li>
            <li> My little girl loves it, thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little niece (4years old) and she likes it a lot now it&#x27;s fun to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> too big for three-years-old child to put into mouth</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t replace the heads on this model - therefore I DO NOT RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;You will have to through the whole thing out after 3-4 months and the plastic and electrical components will sit in toxic landfill - can&#x27;t believe Oral B are trying to squeeze profit out like this.  They should be fined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched my whole family to Phillips starting with these http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HX6311-07-Rechargeable-Toothbrush/dp/B00G5L867C/ref&#x3D;dp_ob_title_hpc</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re using this toothbrush to help desensitize my daughter to dental cleanings and it has been working like a charm!</li>
            <li> Very nicly manufacture. easy to use. my 4 year old just love it. made tooth brushing aomthing to wait for.</li>
            <li> I received a product other than what was pictured. It was sent a second time but was still not what I wanted. I returned the second one and was issued a $25 promotional certificate. I used the certificate on my next order of two items but had to return one of the items. Only $11 of the certificate was applied to my order of the two items. I wanted to use the additional $14 from the certificate on a new item but they would not let me do that. I feel that I did not get the full use of the certificate and am unhappy with the outcome and the way it was handled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanley Snipes</li>
            <li> It is possible to tell not the noisy. The daughter with pleasure brushes teeth in the morning and in the evening independently. And it is healthy.</li>
            <li> She loves to use this and I have an adult battery toothbrush so she can join in the fun.  She is 2 years and 4 months and will clean all of her full mouth of teeth happily.  Get a good children&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Granddaughters love them!</li>
            <li> the brush head is too tall for my girlsback teeth. not able to reach the tough spot</li>
            <li> I have been fighting with my 20 month old to brush her teeth and decided to try this brush. Today is day 3 and she is letting me brush 2 times a day for the first time without a fight because she loves her princess brush :)</li>
            <li> Battery died after 2 weeks.  Junk!  Don&#x27;t buy it and make sure the batteries can be changed.</li>
            <li> Great little electric toothbrush starter for my three year old!</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s the perfect incentive for your little one to brush his/her teeth.</li>
            <li> now she will brush her teeth without a fuss and this is hard to get a 3 year old to brush her teeth after bath time</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves this toothbrush so much that I have to limit how long she brushes her teeth!  Just had another dental checkup and no cavities! :)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter love this tooth brush! I promised to buy her a tooth brush and this one is exactly what she wanted. She is 5.</li>
            <li> My daughter like,but I felt too big for my 5 years old kid.</li>
            <li> My kid loved this, used one time at a sleepover. That&#x27;s the only time it worked.  Changed the battery...nothing. Save your money, buy something quality that u can change the head on.</li>
            <li> Kid friendly size.....they like the characters. Whatever it takes to assist them in brushing their teeth. Battery has lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> I mean what all can you really say about a child&#x27;s toothbrush. My daughter was excited because she loves the princesses right now. It does what it should at her age. It cleans her teeth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I did purchase two of them for both of my daughters and one had a harder spin than the other. Nothing to hard though. My kids are 4 and 5 years old and of course you have to double check their teeth and you have to make certain they have good brushing habits. The toothbrush can only do so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part I am pleased. It is a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I received a lemon.  The toothbrush does not work and when I opened up the battery cover .. i found that the battery has melted and fused to the battery cover. It&#x27;s such a pity as my 6 year old really like the princess toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought two electric toothbrushes, one being this Oral B Disney toothbrush, and the other a Colgate Spongebob toothbrush  (Please see my video review on the Colgate toothbrush, you&#x27;ll probably want to stay away from them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this Oral B is nothing exciting.  It&#x27;s got a gentle brush agitator, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really doing much when I turn it on and touch it to my fingertip.  But it does vibrate reliably, and maybe that&#x27;s good enough for small teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush is that it is bulky in my child&#x27;s mouth.  I can&#x27;t reach her back molars unless she makes a huge effort to open up as far as possible.  There&#x27;s just too much plastic to hold the mechanical pieces inside the head, and while I&#x27;m trying to brush the upper molars, the underside of the brush hits against the bottom molars, preventing me from really getting back there and brushing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate, but it seems that most of these childrens toothbrushes on Amazon are junky. I&#x27;ve not had any great experiences with them after buying all different kinds (some on Amazon, some at my local store).  As long as you don&#x27;t mind throwing out ten bucks every month or so, then you might want to stick with a regular toothbrush or invest in one that is made for adults (but buy the small replaceable brush heads for kids, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this brush seems fun to my 4yo daughter, and any agitation with the bristles is probably going to be better than manual brushing with a standard brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter love it, she celan her teeth and enjoy each time, she can use it by herself without adult supervisied</li>
            <li> very good , kids love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good seller.</li>
            <li> i purchased 3 items for my daughter, she loves it and she enjoys to brush teeth everyday</li>
            <li> Good handle large multi-point ~ ~ small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, wish I had started out by buying the soniccare kids, which I ended up doing anyway.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loved her new toothbrush! She recently forgot her toothbrush up at my mom&#x27;s place and I didn&#x27;t find it until a while later. It was just from her overnight bag but just for fun, I ordered her this as a gift. She always comments on how neat she thinks my toothbrush is (oral-B)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before it arrived, we had her over one night and she had forgotten to put her other toothbrush back into her bag so I let her use mine. I had an extra brush head, unused, and put a pink ring around the top to mark it as hers... She was so excited. Well I turned it on and within a second she was about bawling, poor thing! Scared her lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, needless to say, the vroom on this puppy is quite a bit gentler and does not scare her at all. *Maybe the princesses help, just a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was surprised to find Ariel was front and center and other princesses smaller at the top. Very cute anyway and most importantly, our little princess loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She took it home to make it her new regular toothbrush. Happy her teeth will be getting brushed better (she brushed a bit longer and I think the extra action really helps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel, look, and build, overall, seem much higher quality than what this cost us. I feel it is a good value and am hoping it lasts a good while. I will update this review when it does finally quit on us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it stinks that the battery is not replaceable but hopefully that changes in future models. It&#x27;s hard to complain at six bucks, maybe if it cost what mine did (although for the earth&#x27;s sake, we&#x27;ll hope so!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing! Smile.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Item arrived as described and expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves her new toothbrush.  It&#x27;s the right size for her hands and easy to operate.  The price was great, too.</li>
