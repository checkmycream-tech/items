            <li>Smells good, good texture.</li>
            <li>Great product, smells nice and leaves my hair looking good all day.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My best friend just got married.</li>
            <li>She considers it as good a product for its use as is available.</li>
            <li>The price is fair and delivery is alway quick.</li>
            <li>This company has many versions (5/8, 7/7 etc) so rather than chasing ever beauty supply house, I just order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I just love it</li>
            <li>love the texture my hair gets when I use this wax.</li>
            <li>Use a better material so this doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>This helps keep the curls under control and makes my hair look better than when I do not use it.</li>
            <li>This one (7/7) is more pliable in the jar, easy to apply, and softer but holds the style.</li>
            <li>My barber (she&#x27;s awesome) had me use this instead of my cheap blue hair gel.</li>
            <li>I originally received this product in error two shipments ago.</li>
            <li>Has a great on on my hair, good enough to handle holding it up throughout my entire 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li>It holds better, and you needn&#x27;t use as much.</li>
            <li>The other 5/8 feels more wax based and leaves a more rigid feel to your hair.</li>
            <li>If you want to treat your hair right and get a cute style without a lot of extra junk in it, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I first saw this at my barber.</li>
            <li>I like this one better than some of the &amp;#34;short sexy hair&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to buy more since I just finished one.</li>
            <li>I love this wax for several reasons..</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff for a few weeks now, and I have to say that it works much better than I originally thought it would.</li>
            <li>This product holds my natural wave, smells amazing, helps calm frizz and adds a little shine.</li>
            <li>Not too much shine and holds all day without feeling like I have a bunch of product in my hair.</li>
            <li>This version (7 hold 7 shine) is much softer.</li>
            <li>Order that for my husband who is very picky with his hair products.</li>
            <li>If your hair is feeling greasy or waxy, you are using TOO MUCH of this product.</li>
            <li>Because it would have cost more to process a refund and reship the other product, we settled on my keeping this one.</li>
            <li>I used a little on my fingers and her curls smoothed right out and looked fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It does a little more fragrance than the 5/8</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that isn&#x27;t too gross (I generally don&#x27;t like scented products).</li>
            <li>My first container lasted as long as 2 1/2 to 3 of the large containers of gel.</li>
            <li>Second, you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a natural look that I shape with my fingers.</li>
            <li>She had her hair fixed and curled before the wedding but by the time pictures came around, she was getting a bit of frizz.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>They are pretty short as I had to glue two together for our back door as well an inside door.</li>
            <li>First, it maintains a very dry look and feel.</li>
            <li>I have short dry hair and most other solutions get oily and miss their hold during the day.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it does exactly what it advertises as doing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has short hair, wants a tousled, just out of bed, didn&#x27;t try too hard look.</li>

            <li> The price is totally reasonable, and I believe this container is going to last quite a while, given that I only use a small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> The product is slightly waxy but completely malleable.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER- once my hair starts getting really long it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>

            <li> These leave black scuff marks on all harder types of floors.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair cut into a short pixie.</li>
            <li> Plus with how little it takes to use, one can lasts me roughly 4 months!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too waxy for my like.  </li>
            <li> Little dab.</li>
            <li> The curls can get a little frizzy after a bit.</li>
            <li> It defines and separates, gives a little volume, and isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> It significantly loses hold if your hair gets wet.</li>
            <li> After my hair has dried, I rub a small amount on my fingers and style my hair.</li>
            <li> My only problem with the product is that it does fail when it comes into contact with water.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m not allergic to is hard!</li>
            <li> Does well with my thick hair!</li>
            <li> Spread thin.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick, wavy hair and bad allergies to scents, so finding hair products that work well</li>

            <li> too greasy for my hair</li>
            <li> Love it! Not too much shine and holds all day without feeling like I have a bunch of product in my hair. Plus with how little it takes to use, one can lasts me roughly 4 months!</li>
            <li> I first saw this at my barber. It gives my hair a natural look that I shape with my fingers. It is a very current look without the spiky nonsense.</li>
            <li> I originally received this product in error two shipments ago. I had used their product with &amp;#34;5 hold 8 shine&amp;#34;. Because it would have cost more to process a refund and reship the other product, we settled on my keeping this one. Best &amp;#34;mistake&amp;#34; ever. This version (7 hold 7 shine) is much softer. The other 5/8 feels more wax based and leaves a more rigid feel to your hair. This one (7/7) is more pliable in the jar, easy to apply, and softer but holds the style. It does a little more fragrance than the 5/8 but it is very subtle and fresh. It wouldn&#x27;t offend or bother anyone who either prefers non-fragrant products or doesn&#x27;t want a product that could clash with their other beauty products. This company has many versions (5/8, 7/7 etc) so rather than chasing ever beauty supply house, I just order it on Amazon. The price is fair and delivery is alway quick.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than some of the &amp;#34;short sexy hair&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve used in the past. It holds better, and you needn&#x27;t use as much. It&#x27;s heavier than the ones in the yellow jars. Same basic fragrance. I think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricy pr/oz, but you get what you pay for. I have short dry hair and most other solutions get oily and miss their hold during the day.</li>
            <li> My barber (she&#x27;s awesome) had me use this instead of my cheap blue hair gel. First, it maintains a very dry look and feel. Second, you don&#x27;t need very much. My first container lasted as long as 2 1/2 to 3 of the large containers of gel. Third, no issues on travel. HOWEVER- once my hair starts getting really long it doesn&#x27;t work as well. But when it is shorter it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Does well with my thick hair!</li>

            <li> Order that for my husband who is very picky with his hair products. He is super happy! Great product according to him.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair cut into a short pixie. I&#x27;m always on the look out for a good product that will give great texture to my hair. This product is the perfect weight for my hair. After my hair has dried, I rub a small amount on my fingers and style my hair. The product is slightly waxy but completely malleable.

            <li> This was a product bought by my wife. She considers it as good a product for its use as is available. She has used this product for some time.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells nice and leaves my hair looking good all day.  Definitely going to buy more since I just finished one.</li>
            <li> my salon quit selling this product and I love it!! so happy I found here - great price</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I just love it, this is the best price I have found online, they ship fast and the quality is just really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture my hair gets when I use this wax. 100% recommended</li>
            <li> 1. These leave black scuff marks on all harder types of floors. Use a better material so this doesn&#x27;t happen.  2. They are pretty short as I had to glue two together for our back door as well an inside door.</li>
            <li> Good product for curly hair.  This helps keep the curls under control and makes my hair look better than when I do not use it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells good, good texture. Waxy.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase on my journey to find a replacement for the discontinued Garnier styling wax.  It&#x27;s a little too waxy for my like.  When I put my fingers in my hair, I feel like I have to wash my hands.  But it holds the style well.</li>
            <li> Best wax ever!  Goes on great and holds!!</li>
            <li> Dear Boyfriend,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop stealing this!!!</li>
            <li> Little dab. Spread thin. Run and shake hands through hair. Shuffle with towel. Done</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a few weeks now, and I have to say that it works much better than I originally thought it would. Has a great on on my hair, good enough to handle holding it up throughout my entire 8 hour work day. This stuff keeps my hair locked in place from the moment I put it in until I go to bed at night--impressive when compared to other products that eventually lose their hold before the end of the day. My only problem with the product is that it does fail when it comes into contact with water. It significantly loses hold if your hair gets wet. Other than that, it does exactly what it advertises as doing.</li>
            <li> I love this wax for several reasons.. 1. It has great hold and gives lots of texture. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of hairspray to get my style the way I want it. 2. It adds lots of shine. If you want to treat your hair right and get a cute style without a lot of extra junk in it, this is the one. 3. If you are doing a curl style, it smooths them out. The curls can get a little frizzy after a bit. Just barely get a little on your fingers and run it overs the curls to shape and enhance them. My best friend just got married. She had her hair fixed and curled before the wedding but by the time pictures came around, she was getting a bit of frizz. I used a little on my fingers and her curls smoothed right out and looked fabulous.  **If your hair is feeling greasy or waxy, you are using TOO MUCH of this product. ** I have naturally oily hair and it does not make my hair look oily because I use it sparingly.</li>
