            <li>excellent product, thank you, and my grade is 10.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great color - just not as described.</li>
            <li>The color is great and will go with any skin tone and hair colors.  </li>
            <li>Its a great color to go to the beach and have that kimk bronze look lip.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m trying to find more of this discontinued shade!!</li>
            <li>Is very nice</li>
            <li>Loreal makes some good cosmetics</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t look good anyway.  </li>
            <li>yet it has a beautiful effect..will buy more of this.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it!  </li>
            <li>this lipstick appears to be a shade of light bright purple.</li>
            <li>I gave this lipstick a perfect score because it is just the right shade of pink and looks very good on me.</li>
            <li>The Queens Kiss is a great color, a pink berry color with beautiful iridescent sheen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and opaque and yes, does have the signature \\&quot;lipstick\\&quot; smell that L&#x27;oreal lipsticks are famous for.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal makeup is always a favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the shade and the color..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep it anyway, because I&#x27;m sure I can make use of this color as well.</li>
            <li>So now it&#x27;s my mom&#x27;s favorite lipstick</li>
            <li>I love this colors</li>
            <li>easily break or turn to goo after a couple uses.)  </li>
            <li>Luckily my vendor sent me a replacement tube, no questions asked!</li>
            <li>A lovely red pink hue and looks good with fair skin.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous berry red.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is as red as it comes,its an amazing color</li>
            <li>The color is well worth it though so pretty.</li>
            <li>The color looked really pretty online.  </li>
            <li>Like most of these Project Runway Limited Edition lipsticks they can be easily worn both sheer &amp; layered to opaque.  </li>
            <li>much for that idea.</li>
            <li>I showed her on the back of my hand just how beautiful, subtle &amp; versatile this shade can be.  </li>
            <li>The taste was okay, not the best, not the worst.</li>
            <li>more than I usually do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with dark hair and dark eyes and this is a very wearable red for day or night.</li>
            <li>far from.</li>
            <li>But in person it is sort of a tawny pink (a pink with some more neutral shadings in it).  </li>
            <li>Will be giving to a friend since I am too fair and color is wrong for me.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I expected, the one shown in the picture.</li>

            <li> To me, it looked like a deep fuchsia pink, at least on my screens.  </li>
            <li> &amp; she saw it in the tube, she said it was too dark for her -</li>
            <li> thinking maybe I could tone it down and make it pinker with a gloss.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the lipstick texture as the as it gives a blurred look on wearing.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s little bit dry then expected.</li>
            <li> excellent product, thank you, and my grade is 10.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous berry red. I&#x27;m fair skinned with dark hair and dark eyes and this is a very wearable red for day or night. It&#x27;s creamy and opaque and yes, does have the signature \\&quot;lipstick\\&quot; smell that L&#x27;oreal lipsticks are famous for. Personally the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me but I can understand it bothering others as it is quite fragrant. It&#x27;s a shame this shade isn&#x27;t a part of the regular line. It&#x27;s beautiful. Hint: If you order this or any other lipstick, stick it in the fridge for a bit to reset the bullet before trying it on or swatching. I made the mistake of trying it out immediately and it mushed onto the inside of the tube. Horrible! Luckily my vendor sent me a replacement tube, no questions asked! Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Great color - just not as described. L&#x27;oreal makeup is always a favorite. Will be giving to a friend since I am too fair and color is wrong for me.</li>
            <li> A lovely red pink hue and looks good with fair skin. Loreal makes some good cosmetics the only thing if you don&#x27;t like the trade mark smell of their lipsticks its still with this product. The color is well worth it though so pretty.</li>
            <li> I came across this color and purchased it on a whim.  I am so glad I bought it!  The color is great and will go with any skin tone and hair colors.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Love the shade and the color..It is a subtle color yet it has a beautiful effect..will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> Disappointing colour saturation and even worse longevity on the lips. The taste was okay, not the best, not the worst. I will never rebuy. I will never recommend.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the lipstick texture as the as it gives a blurred look on wearing. This item rather appeared as stock clearance or  by mistakenly manufactured color from the company color department.Felt cheated on seeing the product not expected, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> To me, it looked like a deep fuchsia pink, at least on my screens.  But in person it is sort of a tawny pink (a pink with some more neutral shadings in it).  I&#x27;m going to keep it anyway, because I&#x27;m sure I can make use of this color as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick but it does not stay on all day and the color goes on lighter the picture.</li>
            <li> your lips will thank you</li>
            <li> This lipstick is as red as it comes,its an amazing color</li>
            <li> The Queens Kiss is a great color, a pink berry color with beautiful iridescent sheen.  Like most of these Project Runway Limited Edition lipsticks they can be easily worn both sheer &amp; layered to opaque.  This lipstick lasts on the lips as long as any other comparable lipstick.  Formula is non-drying on my lips &amp; the lipstick bullet is stable in the tube(doesn&#x27;t easily break or turn to goo after a couple uses.)  I gave this to my mom for Xmas last year &amp; she saw it in the tube, she said it was too dark for her - I showed her on the back of my hand just how beautiful, subtle &amp; versatile this shade can be.  So now it&#x27;s my mom&#x27;s favorite lipstick &amp; I&#x27;m trying to find more of this discontinued shade!!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I expected, the one shown in the picture. I would like to know if it is moisturizing....</li>
            <li> this lipstick appears to be a shade of light bright purple. ha! far from. I had to double check that it was the same one. I am of olive skin tone. this lipstick looks like a bronze orangey sun kissed look. no purple or pink ! whatsoever. If you want a color that looks like it has brown shades mixed with orange then that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get. even to get that color I had to put several coats. more than I usually do. Its a great color to go to the beach and have that kimk bronze look lip. but I repeat NOT PURPLE.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something different.  I have been using Mary Kay for years and love the quality, but it is expensive.  I just thought I would give this a try...especially for 4.38.  The color looked really pretty online.  But when I got it, the color looked kinda orange.  I still tried to use it...thinking maybe I could tone it down and make it pinker with a gloss.  But that&#x27;s too much trouble for regular use.  And it didn&#x27;t look good anyway.  I threw it away!&lt;br /&gt;So much for that idea.</li>
            <li> I gave this lipstick a perfect score because it is just the right shade of pink and looks very good on me.</li>
            <li> Is very nice I love this colors</li>
