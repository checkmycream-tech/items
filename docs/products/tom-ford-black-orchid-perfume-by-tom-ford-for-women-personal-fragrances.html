            <li>It can be a bit overwhelming so stick to one squirt per use.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent and very bold.</li>
            <li>To me this is the most unique fragrance I own and because I love the smell of licorice or anise, I guess it is, this is what it smells like to me when it dries.</li>
            <li>Unique, elegant and a touch of class</li>
            <li>Its a perfume that is spicy and strong scent .</li>

            <li>My friend and sister liked it so much they to are now wearing it.</li>
            <li>Well I originally smelled it on a man and the gift was for the like.</li>
            <li>Tom Ford has acheived a creative masterpiece and I can only imagine the heavenly smell emmitted from his own sack.</li>
            <li>If I had to dissect it, it&#x27;s a bottle eruption of sweet and savory, yet musky and assertive.</li>
            <li>The aroma is sweet and mellow.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and mysterious.</li>
            <li>My Mom was thrilled too and thus I must conclude that the fragrance was the same as that sample from Sephora.</li>
            <li>It was well worth</li>
            <li>nothing turns your scenes to a higher level than Tom Fords &amp;#34;Black Orchid&amp;#34; The scent lingers..</li>
            <li>but this is most definitely my first and last fragrance purchase from amazon.</li>

            <li>Having sent my Mom a sample I received from Sephora, she just raved about how much she loved the Tom Ford Black Orchid fragrance.</li>
            <li>I could see a sexy, headstrong woman wearing it, or just a soft-spoken man in a cozy fisherman&#x27;s sweater.</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting and for those who love to mix fragrances</li>
            <li>I did not receive it until just before New Years Day because it was required to be delivered</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very strong scent and very bold. This is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Its a perfume that is spicy and strong scent . I gave it to my niece hoping she will like  it .</li>
            <li> I work in a men&#x27;s hospice, and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve scraped/bathed/scrubbed over a thousand filthy old scrotums and I&#x27;ve searched for years to replicate that scent, and nothing has ever come as close as Black Orchid. Tom Ford has acheived a creative masterpiece and I can only imagine the heavenly smell emmitted from his own sack. My only criticism is that Mr. Ford did not shape the bottle in the likeness of his scrotum so that I could cradle it genly in my hands while I sniff it.</li>
            <li> The words are simple....intoxicating. I am pleased that Amazon Prime had this for me..nothing turns your scenes to a higher level than Tom Fords &amp;#34;Black Orchid&amp;#34; The scent lingers..like it should all..&amp; even more. If you love the deeply intoxicating scent of black orchids~you will not be disappointed..my fav perfume always</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t purchase on Amazon, I wanted to express how lovely this deliciousness is. If I had to dissect it, it&#x27;s a bottle eruption of sweet and savory, yet musky and assertive. I prayed it at 4:30pm and when I got off work at 2:00am, people could sniff and whiff as I walked by. All the ingredients described are on point. I read a comment about licorice, that&#x27;s there too! I purchased on HSN but will now purchase body essentials on Amazon. Gotta layer it with the lotion and shower gel. You and your partner will enjoy!</li>
            <li> great scent and great price</li>
            <li> best perfume Iv ever purchased . Ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift - my sister loves it and she shares it with her boyfriend. They seem to think it&#x27;s a great unisex fragrance. It smells slightly spicy and has sweet vanilla notes too.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband because I don&#x27;t have the balls (pun intended) to rock it. I could see a sexy, headstrong woman wearing it, or just a soft-spoken man in a cozy fisherman&#x27;s sweater. There&#x27;s nothing like it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my Mom who loves this fragrance. Unfortunately, I cannot afford it. However, I found it on Amazon for a great price as I do my own fragrances. Having sent my Mom a sample I received from Sephora, she just raved about how much she loved the Tom Ford Black Orchid fragrance. Of course, she had no idea how expensive it is. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a price I could afford. My Mom was thrilled too and thus I must conclude that the fragrance was the same as that sample from Sephora. Happy Mother, Happy Daughter and all is well.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tom Ford&#x27;s Black Orchid Parfum 1 week before Christmas and aside from not being eligible for 2 day shipping (amazon prime) this item was &amp;#34;shipped and sold by amazon&amp;#34;. I did not receive it until just before New Years Day because it was required to be delivered ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume came sealed in celophane just as if purchased at the department store but the last half of the serial/batch number has been cut from the box and replaced with a tiny gold piece of tape. Initial unboxing revealed the scent on the cap and around the bottle but there did not appear to be any leaks. Usually I can&#x27;t smell the juice on the cap unless its been sprayed so this was my first thought, however, the bottle had never been sprayed as it needed to be primed for initial spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my skin the fragrance smells just like Black Orchid initially and during the dry-down phase. I have no doubt in my mind this is Black Orchid by Tom Ford but it is evident that this item is a &#x27;grey market&#x27; item because of the missing number. I recently acquired a sample from the Tom Ford counter and the fragrance is identical to the sample except on the potency scale I would give the sample 10/10 and this fragrance 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it but this is most definitely my first and last fragrance purchase from amazon. In the end I saved about $ 12 dollars for a marginally inferior product. For peace of mind I recommend purchasing fine fragrances from the authorized perfume counter.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, complex oriental chypre fragrance best worn at night. A heavier, darker scent for wearing with cashmere or jeans and leather coat.  The dark chocolate, amber, vetiver dry down will linger forever.  Intoxicating!</li>
            <li> This item was suggested as a unisex fragrance by one friend and then I was corrected by another friend who is adament it is only a womans fragrance. Well I originally smelled it on a man and the gift was for the like. I gave it and he absolutely loved it ! He gets compliments all the time and now I will be back soon to purchase a bottle for myself.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances I have purchased in a while! The scent is long lasting and for those who love to mix fragrances it&#x27;s a great mixture with citrus and floral scents.</li>
            <li> I got compliments all day long the first time I wore this scent. Smells expensive and classy.</li>
            <li> Did not receive with a cap on sample. Was not same scent I have been using. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Unique, elegant and a touch of class</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful smell, the best price too! If ever you want to walk into room and  have someone say &amp;#34; you smell so good&amp;#34; it would be this fragrance. I&#x27;m excited that I found a super great price and I didn&#x27;t have to bid for it!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best perfume.</li>
            <li> Black Orchid By Tom Ford is everything the name implies. The aroma is sweet and mellow. The orchid aroma makes you think of Hawaii. It was well worth the price.[[ASIN:B001KOTRJA Tom Ford Black Orchid By Tom Ford For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get compliments on my perfume, men and women. Very exotic and nothing out there like it I have found.</li>
            <li> Very sexy and mysterious. It can be a bit overwhelming so stick to one squirt per use. Use it on a night out. ;)</li>
            <li> To me this is the most unique fragrance I own and because I love the smell of licorice or anise, I guess it is, this is what it smells like to me when it dries. I don&#x27;t have anything else in my cologne repertoire that smells anything quite like it.</li>
            <li> I gave this parfum a 5 star.  The fragance is very light, stays on nicely and it not over powerding.  I get lots of comments on how nice it smells on me.  My friend and sister liked it so much they to are now wearing it.</li>
            <li> LOVE. Lasts forever, always complemented on it.</li>
