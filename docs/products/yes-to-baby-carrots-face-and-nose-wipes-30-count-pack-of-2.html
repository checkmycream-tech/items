            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>The Earth&#x27;s Best wipes are fantastic but he seemed to break out a little when I used them on his face.</li>
            <li>These wipes contain natural ingredients, smell fresh, make baby happy, and get the job done.</li>
            <li>And they are the best for noses with dried up and caked up &#x27;</li>
            <li>Great for the constant daycare snotty nose.</li>
            <li>and they smell nice and are gently on abused skin.</li>
            <li>Smell is a little strong but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>and then he puts the in his mouth right away:-)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably fine for wiping spaghetti sauce off of babies, but I am trying to clean off my blush and eye makeup before I work out</li>
            <li>Definitely works as advertised to clean up sticky fingers, runny noses, these are very handy to throw in your car, your diaper bag or purse.</li>
            <li>we use them to clean his hands and face after eating...</li>
            <li>I use these every morning/night to clean my newborn&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>We use these to clean baby&#x27;s face on non-bath days and also to remove his boogers.</li>
            <li>Good &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.  Not strong, but nice.</li>
            <li>Nothing special in the way of performance.</li>
            <li>I love these so much that I have them in each of the cars and on our subscribe and save orders.</li>
            <li>I thought i was doing a good thing to buy these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; wipes for him, but his face turned red and eyes puffy immediately after we wiped his face with it.</li>
            <li>But keeping my skin feeling clean and fresh before cream application is a must.</li>
            <li>I can clean the whole face easily.</li>
            <li>These are soft, have a wonderful clean smell and will do a great job wiping your babies&#x27; noses without irritating the sensitive skin on their face.</li>
            <li>Others have made my face feel like its burning, these are cool and refreshing, no sell and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>These are great for wiping my baby&#x27;s nose and face and hands and whatever is messy at the time.</li>
            <li>I tried them on my own face and had the same reaction.</li>
            <li>but my baby&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t flail around as much with these as with wet paper towels, and they do a good job cleaning up the smears of mashed fruits and veggies.  </li>
            <li>The cloths are soft and no weird smells, just mild and clean.</li>
            <li>My baby has sensitive skin especially around the mouth area (allergic to her own saliva).</li>
            <li>These wipes are big enough to clean up messes, moist enough to remove dried up crust and smell great (not too strong not too mild).</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>They are hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The cloth is really soft and expands to be quite large.</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a little, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>That is to say that they get mostly all of my makeup off, but my waterproof mascara is leaving little smudges under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love these wipes, I use them every day - gentle on the nose, have hardly any smell (and</li>
            <li>the smell is subtle and nice).  </li>
            <li>Wipe is good and thick as facial wipe</li>
            <li>These wipes have a light, fresh scent and even my kids who have very sensitive skin do not react negatively to these wipes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these wipes if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Try johnson wipes if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>clearly a 10!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed but first, with me, and then more recently with my daughter we have noticed it causes skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I like these alot, they are pretty big for the face</li>
            <li>The fragrance might be a little too strong, but I like them.</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li>My 9 month old hates to have her face wipes in any way, shape, or form</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural</li>
            <li>We use them anytime we are on the go for our 18 month old.  </li>
            <li>Soft on the babies sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We love these fragrant thick wipes at our house.</li>
            <li>They are thick material and dont tear off like many others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my son&#x27;s nose and face, but it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the other brand.</li>
            <li>The wipes seem to stay wet in the package too, much better than some other brands of wipes.</li>
            <li>It appears red and blotchy wherever the wipe had come in contact, particularly in the cheeks.</li>
            <li>After trying several &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; face and nose wipes on my baby - these are the first ones not to leave his face red and irritated.</li>
            <li>They are soft and gentle on his sensitive skin, and the scent is subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product from a company I knew didn&#x27;t test on animals, and I figured that if these were gentle enough for babies, they weren&#x27;t likely to make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, she loves them so much, she often tries to eat them.</li>
            <li>I am not much of a make-up person and can&#x27;t attest if these wipes are capable of removing make-up.</li>
            <li>The only problem I see is that the wipes are a bit too large for a single wipe and the napkin dries out by the time it needs to be used again.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin, and these wipes don&#x27;t dry out my skin at all!</li>
            <li>When she started eating solid food, I need wipes that is natural and can clean w/o irritating the skin.</li>

            <li> When she started eating solid food, I need wipes that is natural and can clean w/o irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> Pulling a single wipe out is difficult - more than one almost always comes out.</li>
            <li> Also, one day I used it on my face and I developed slight</li>
            <li> My kiddo has dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would use it on my infant, no matter how natural this item is claimed to be.</li>
            <li> I bought them 3 months ago and opened it last week and found them to be dry and with an odd smell.  </li>
            <li> I just put the unused half back in the packet and reseal it.</li>
            <li> Before, I would&#x27;ve given these a 5, hands down.</li>
            <li> I also bought Burts&amp;Bees, however it caused a slight rash.</li>
            <li> My daughter makes a mess whenever she eats</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit pricey</li>
            <li> so I usually just rip it in half</li>
            <li> We usually use these to wipe our daughter&#x27;s runny/stuffy nose or messy face after a meal, but because of the resulting rash we don&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I usually shower and wash my face in the mornings, so I use these wipes at night to cleanse my face before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Once it even worked to remove the gross perfume smell a substitute day care teacher left on him when she held him :(</li>
            <li> so I am not sure</li>
            <li> I tried to return, but since it was past the 30 day period I couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My lone complaint would be the packaging.</li>
            <li> Then I tried these and poof, no more rash!</li>

            <li> Before, I would&#x27;ve given these a 5, hands down. The cloths are soft and no weird smells, just mild and clean. We&#x27;ve been using them for several years now and I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed but first, with me, and then more recently with my daughter we have noticed it causes skin irritation. It appears red and blotchy wherever the wipe had come in contact, particularly in the cheeks. We usually use these to wipe our daughter&#x27;s runny/stuffy nose or messy face after a meal, but because of the resulting rash we don&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, we&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years and only recently have we had any problems. Perhaps the last 3 packs have been flukes? Or maybe environmental changes have made thus incompatible for us? Or the recipe has simply changed a bit. Just in case, I just thought I&#x27;ll put this info out there in case anybody us wondering.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item for my baby. I also bought Burts&amp;Bees, however it caused a slight rash. This brand never caused any kind of discomfort for my baby.</li>
            <li> My son loves these wipes. They are easy to use on the face and don&#x27;t have a smell. And they are the best for noses with dried up and caked up &#x27;ewwwww boobers&#x27; (what my son says)....on the nose... I love these so much that I have them in each of the cars and on our subscribe and save orders.</li>
            <li> I usually shower and wash my face in the mornings, so I use these wipes at night to cleanse my face before I go to sleep. I have pretty dry skin, and these wipes don&#x27;t dry out my skin at all! They make my skin feel soft and moisturized. I highly recommend these wipes if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great! I got them to wipe my son&#x27;s face and neck instead of using the Earth&#x27;s Best wipes. The Earth&#x27;s Best wipes are fantastic but he seemed to break out a little when I used them on his face. The Yes to Baby wipes are incredibly gentle and do a great job. Love the clean scent too!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my goddaughter. Her mom loves them. They have a nice light scent. They&#x27;re effective and best of all safe ingredients. I love this line. Great alternative to the chemical filled products at a good price.</li>
            <li> I really like these but I don&#x27;t think they are anti-bacterial wipes which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> These turned my daughter&#x27;s skin red. I tried them on my own face and had the same reaction. Try johnson wipes if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think I am addicted to the scent of these. I love them. I use them on my one-year-old son&#x27;s face and he doesn&#x27;t fight me with these like he does with the Boogie Wipes.</li>
            <li> Love these for my son...we use them to clean his hands and face after eating...he doesn&#x27;t like his &amp;#34;carrots&amp;#34; but what baby likes their face cleaned,  Mom and Dad are happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I use these every morning/night to clean my newborn&#x27;s face. They are soft and gentle on his sensitive skin, and the scent is subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> We use these to clean baby&#x27;s face on non-bath days and also to remove his boogers. Once it even worked to remove the gross perfume smell a substitute day care teacher left on him when she held him :( We keep a pack in every room. Smell is a little strong but very pleasant. Love this brand and trust using their products on my baby.</li>
            <li> These are great for wiping my baby&#x27;s nose and face and hands and whatever is messy at the time. I do S&amp;S and get 1 2-pack every 4 months and we always have plenty.</li>
            <li> I use these every night to remove my makeup and they work better than any wipes I have tried!  Others have made my face feel like its burning, these are cool and refreshing, no sell and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would use it on my infant, no matter how natural this item is claimed to be. It has a taste to it, so if it gets around child&#x27;s lips, it may not be a good thing. Also, one day I used it on my face and I developed slight reaction- face got patchy red. Yikes!</li>
            <li> We use these wipes quite a bit and they get the job done. My lone complaint would be the packaging. Pulling a single wipe out is difficult - more than one almost always comes out.</li>
            <li> The product was great but it came incomplete!!! I ordered two and only one package arrived. I&#x27;m very disappointed for this, especially since I depending on the second package.</li>
            <li> My kiddo has dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it. The smell is nice... My hubby always thinks I just gave the baby a bath after I use this!</li>
            <li> I love these wipes, I use them every day - gentle on the nose, have hardly any smell (and the smell is subtle and nice).  My kiddo even likes to use them herself.  Great for the constant daycare snotty nose.</li>
            <li> Great scent, soft. Perfect for wiping my toddlers nose and face after meals or runny nose</li>
            <li> They work and smell great</li>
            <li> We love these fragrant thick wipes at our house. We use them to wipe dirty faces and hands and I keep an extra pack in purse at all times in case.</li>
            <li> Bought it as had a cold and my nose was sore. These work well and they smell nice and are gently on abused skin.</li>
            <li> These are soft, have a wonderful clean smell and will do a great job wiping your babies&#x27; noses without irritating the sensitive skin on their face. I love that it contains saline solution. The only problem I see is that the wipes are a bit too large for a single wipe and the napkin dries out by the time it needs to be used again. My solution is to tear them in two and that way they last me longer. I just put the unused half back in the packet and reseal it.</li>
            <li> After trying several &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; face and nose wipes on my baby - these are the first ones not to leave his face red and irritated. The cloth is really soft and expands to be quite large. The smell is great and he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind when I wash his hands with them and then he puts the in his mouth right away:-) I can feel okay about him doing this because there isn&#x27;t anything in this product that would harm him.</li>
            <li> My baby has sensitive skin especially around the mouth area (allergic to her own saliva). When she started eating solid food, I need wipes that is natural and can clean w/o irritating the skin. I tried this and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s 100% natural. Doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter&#x27;s skin at all. I can clean the whole face easily. It&#x27;s a little bit pricey but my baby&#x27;s worth it. Now I always keep stock on them.</li>
            <li> I keep these by the table where I feed the baby.  He doesn&#x27;t flail around as much with these as with wet paper towels, and they do a good job cleaning up the smears of mashed fruits and veggies.  The wipes seem to stay wet in the package too, much better than some other brands of wipes.</li>
            <li> The fragrance might be a little too strong, but I like them. They are thick material and dont tear off like many others I have tried. And in the name of &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; ones, they dont stink.</li>
            <li> My 9 month old hates to have her face wipes in any way, shape, or form...expect for when I wipe her face with Yes to Carrots wipes! In fact, she loves them so much, she often tries to eat them. These wipes contain natural ingredients, smell fresh, make baby happy, and get the job done. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Grandson had a reaction to it.  I thought i was doing a good thing to buy these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; wipes for him, but his face turned red and eyes puffy immediately after we wiped his face with it.</li>
            <li> These are the only thing I can wipe my grandsons face with and not get a fuss. So soft and they smell great!</li>
            <li> These wipes are big enough to clean up messes, moist enough to remove dried up crust and smell great (not too strong not too mild). I keep one in may car and one in my diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Love these!  My daughter makes a mess whenever she eats (hey she&#x27;s a baby, it happens!) and I was trying to use regular baby wipes on her hands/face.  Even though I get &amp;#34;sensitive skin w/aloe&amp;#34; wipes, she was still getting a rash on her face.  Then I tried these and poof, no more rash!</li>
            <li> Wipe is good and thick as facial wipe but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent. It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural so maybe I just don&#x27;t like carrot smell.</li>
            <li> These wipes have a light, fresh scent and even my kids who have very sensitive skin do not react negatively to these wipes. They are hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are outstanding.  We use them anytime we are on the go for our 18 month old.  Have been using them since he was a newborn.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite wipes! I don&#x27;t have kids, but I use them to remove makeup.  They are really gentle (a must for the eye area), have a nice scent and do a great job removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my son&#x27;s nose and face, but it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the other brand.</li>
            <li> been using this on myself and my baby. Definitely works as advertised to clean up sticky fingers, runny noses, these are very handy to throw in your car, your diaper bag or purse. Highly recommend. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> These are the best wipes ever!! I keep them in the car for the grandkids!!! If there were 10 stars...clearly a 10!</li>
            <li> Perfect refreshing wipes. And I like that they contain Vitamin A antiager. I am sure it&#x27;s a little, but it&#x27;s there. I am not much of a make-up person and can&#x27;t attest if these wipes are capable of removing make-up. But keeping my skin feeling clean and fresh before cream application is a must.</li>
            <li> I bought these to take makeup off at the end of the day.  I wanted a product from a company I knew didn&#x27;t test on animals, and I figured that if these were gentle enough for babies, they weren&#x27;t likely to make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work...ok.  That is to say that they get mostly all of my makeup off, but my waterproof mascara is leaving little smudges under my eyes.  They&#x27;re probably fine for wiping spaghetti sauce off of babies, but I am trying to clean off my blush and eye makeup before I work out and I am underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I like these alot, they are pretty big for the face so I usually just rip it in half but I feel better about using these than the bottom wipes for my babies face.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the cloth used and the scent is refreshing.  Nothing special in the way of performance.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and no sticky residue.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning power. Soft on the babies sensitive skin. Regular &amp;#34;wipes&amp;#34; seemed to irritate the babies faces, these rock. Put them on the same plane as Medela brand wipes I think though these are cheaper. Good &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.  Not strong, but nice.</li>
            <li> Wipes are OK.  I bought them 3 months ago and opened it last week and found them to be dry and with an odd smell.  I have never used this before so I am not sure if I just got a defective product.  When i tried to wipe baby&#x27;s face he moved away from it several times... I tried to return, but since it was past the 30 day period I couldn&#x27;t.  Likely will not purchase again.</li>
