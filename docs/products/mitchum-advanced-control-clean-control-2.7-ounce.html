    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Very good antiperspirant/deodorant!</li>
            <li>Very good purchase</li>
            <li>As a result it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mitchum Advanced Control in my opinion is the best working deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better!</li>
            <li>I know we need to be sparing with products containing aluminum in order to be kind to our kidneys...</li>
            <li>applies very easily, does not break,  as some have said.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available on sale for around $3.00, which is a great price when the super strenth deodorants are sometimes around $7-8.00.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for about 5 months and have been pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>If you want your pits to smell like baby powder, mint or my unfavorite &amp;#34;pacific coast highway&amp;#34; - which i have ridden and which mostly smells like road kill - this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Nice and clear, good smell.</li>
            <li>I have never had any problems with Mitchum Advanced Control and have recommended it to many of my friends who also &amp;#34;run hot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Could not find a deodorant that kept me smelling fresh and clean all day!!  </li>
            <li>The scent is fine.  </li>
            <li>Product is under 3oz, which is important for those of us who do a lot of air travel with carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li>This is not alcohol free as listed.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that would keep me fresh all day I&#x27;d be able to rate this 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I do see there is a scent free product, so may give that a try.  </li>
            <li>Experience has shown that scent free doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth does not leave residue on your shirts.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive underarms, this may be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent of this product DOES seems to work to keep me smelling fresh all day even though I prefer scent free products.  </li>
            <li>I love the smart solid because it won&#x27;t ruin clothing with waxy build-up over time - I just ordered more of that.</li>
            <li>Doesnt seem as powerful as the regular mitchum, but its nice to switch it up.  </li>
            <li>had bought this because Mitchum makes another product (\\&quot;smart solid\\&quot;) where the first ingredient is water.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and am staying dry.  </li>
            <li>This helped a lot without killing my skin like certain dri did.</li>
            <li>I always tell my friends &amp;#34;I run hot&amp;#34; and I really do.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength deodorants, and if you take a look at the active ingredients, this deodorant has just as much of a percentage of the antiperspirant ingredient as the clinical strength deodorants, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It does leave white residue, and is more like other brands in terms of it not going on as clean.  </li>
            <li>But I think one key to this deodorant&#x27;s effectiveness is the &#x27;clean scent&#x27; of this product.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I have searched high and low for a good deodorant and about a year and a half ago, I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon.com is decent and I don&#x27;t have to drive to get it.</li>
            <li>If you want clean dry and not stinky</li>
            <li>At first, I was not pleased with the strong perfume-y scent of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I use the \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; program: a decent savings over regular price at big box stores and pharmacies, though not as cheap as when those stores have them on sale.</li>
            <li>My favorite, which is more difficult to find at general retailers.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ</li>
            <li>After using it for a few months, I do think this product works very well, and am getting used to the scent, which as some have said smells &#x27;clean&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>After spending a while with the unscented mitchum clear stick, I gave this one a try.  </li>
            <li>It features 20% of the active ingredient (formerly \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; or \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot;), not the 16% that was standard for so many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 18 and do not have success with any other deodrant/antipersperants.  </li>
            <li>When I went through menopause, suddenly, to my dismay, I had that musky \\&quot;old people&#x27; odor!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for certain, but I would predict it will leave a waxy build-up on clothing over time, like almost every other underarm stick</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the first few ingredients are waxes and oils, so it goes on white.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a man who sweats...a lot, and I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit it. I always tell my friends &amp;#34;I run hot&amp;#34; and I really do. My girlfriend often refers to me as her furnace when she is cold. That being said, I have searched high and low for a good deodorant and about a year and a half ago, I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchum Advanced Control in my opinion is the best working deodorant I have ever used. I have tried many &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength deodorants, and if you take a look at the active ingredients, this deodorant has just as much of a percentage of the antiperspirant ingredient as the clinical strength deodorants, at a fraction of the cost. I have never had any problems with Mitchum Advanced Control and have recommended it to many of my friends who also &amp;#34;run hot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> After spending a while with the unscented mitchum clear stick, I gave this one a try.  It does leave white residue, and is more like other brands in terms of it not going on as clean.  Doesnt seem as powerful as the regular mitchum, but its nice to switch it up.  I will probably rebuy, but wont be my everyday item.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 18 and do not have success with any other deodrant/antipersperants.  I can&#x27;t use the other varieties of this that they make and I am buy the solid from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum products for over  30 years. There have been times when they&#x27;ve had products I didn&#x27;t like, either because of a change in formula or a solid that was prone to breaking. But I like this one. I work very long days and this holds up. No strong scent. No problem with breaking. Product is under 3oz, which is important for those of us who do a lot of air travel with carry-on luggage. I use the \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; program: a decent savings over regular price at big box stores and pharmacies, though not as cheap as when those stores have them on sale.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only stuff that works for me yet it still leaves white marks inside my black shirts</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I live in AZ and I&#x27;m very active.  I use it year round but especially in the summers.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for about 5 months and have been pleased with its performance. I sweat a lot and it keeps me dry. I also appreciate that the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sent what was pictured!</li>
            <li> For years as a teen I had bad sweating. This helped a lot without killing my skin like certain dri did. This works well and after years of use I&#x27;ve yet to stain any clothing.</li>
            <li> My favorite, which is more difficult to find at general retailers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re shopping for deodorant online, you&#x27;re probably just like me - you&#x27;ve run out and you&#x27;re too lazy to go to the store, and would rather just wait a few days for it to show up. It&#x27;s deodorant. If you like this brand, buy it. If you don&#x27;t, buy something else.</li>
            <li> Does not make my pits stick together, yet does not permit me to smell too toxic even after hours on a bike. If you want your pits to smell like baby powder, mint or my unfavorite &amp;#34;pacific coast highway&amp;#34; - which i have ridden and which mostly smells like road kill - this is not for you. If you want clean dry and not stinky it is for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very standard deodorant/anti-perspirant.  It features 20% of the active ingredient (formerly \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; or \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot;), not the 16% that was standard for so many years.  As a result it is very effective.  The scent is fine.  It&#x27;s got Aloe and vitamin E in it, so if you have sensitive underarms, this may be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the first few ingredients are waxes and oils, so it goes on white.  I&#x27;m not sure how it could ever be construed as an invisible solid.  I don&#x27;t know for certain, but I would predict it will leave a waxy build-up on clothing over time, like almost every other underarm stick I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought this because Mitchum makes another product (\\&quot;smart solid\\&quot;) where the first ingredient is water.  I had assumed this product was the next generation of that one.  No such luck.  I love the smart solid because it won&#x27;t ruin clothing with waxy build-up over time - I just ordered more of that.</li>
            <li> Had been a Degree user for about 20 years.  Started in middle school.  Unfortunately, they changed their formula&#x27;s and turned the one I always used into &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; and started charging over $7 for it!!  No thanks.  Tried the regular ones, but they didn&#x27;t work for me.  I don&#x27;t like to sweat at all, and I found I was.  I hated it.  So...after my wife suggested I try something different, I went this direction.  Love it, and am staying dry.  Have been using for a few months now, and I don&#x27;t plan on switching.</li>
            <li> Very good antiperspirant/deodorant! Nice and clear, good smell. Very good purchase</li>
            <li> This is not alcohol free as listed.  Ingredient #2: alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. The price at Amazon.com is decent and I don&#x27;t have to drive to get it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was not pleased with the strong perfume-y scent of this deodorant.  After using it for a few months, I do think this product works very well, and am getting used to the scent, which as some have said smells &#x27;clean&#x27;.  When I went through menopause, suddenly, to my dismay, I had that musky \\&quot;old people&#x27; odor!  Could not find a deodorant that kept me smelling fresh and clean all day!!  The scent of this product DOES seems to work to keep me smelling fresh all day even though I prefer scent free products.  So this product must have a double whammy...the aluminum what-cha-ma-call-it PLUS the scent of the product.  I apply it to my underarms and also underneath my \\&quot;chest\\&quot;, because the musky odor seems to come from there also.  I know we need to be sparing with products containing aluminum in order to be kind to our kidneys...but I just can&#x27;t afford to walk around smelling musky.  If Mitchum could develop this deodorant \\&quot;scent free\\&quot; that would keep me fresh all day I&#x27;d be able to rate this 5 stars.  I do see there is a scent free product, so may give that a try.  Experience has shown that scent free doesn&#x27;t work as well.  But I think one key to this deodorant&#x27;s effectiveness is the &#x27;clean scent&#x27; of this product.  It is &#x27;creamy&#x27;. applies very easily, does not break,  as some have said.  It&#x27;s available on sale for around $3.00, which is a great price when the super strenth deodorants are sometimes around $7-8.00.</li>
            <li> Really good. Goes on smooth does not leave residue on your shirts.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better!</li>
            <li> Wrong item needed the one for women</li>
    </ol>
