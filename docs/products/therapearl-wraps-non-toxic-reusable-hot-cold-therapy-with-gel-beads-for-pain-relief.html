            <li>great product, will buy again</li>
            <li>Really effective!</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the updated design, which includes 6-cells instead of 3 and seems to support a more even distribution of the pearls.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am very impressed with the customer service of Therapearl for listening to customers and making a good product even better.</li>
            <li>I have chronic abdominal and pelvic pain and have used about every heating pad there is, this product from Thera Peal is wonderful and by far the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for knee or shoulder applications.</li>
            <li>Although I did not test this feature out, I do see how this could be a good asset to assist with abdominal cramps.</li>
            <li>SOSO,THE BELT IS NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li>I had already tried the Therapearl neck wrap and loved it</li>
            <li>Awww pain relief has never felt so good!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>handy because it pliable</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that I could move around</li>
            <li>The strap is useful, but the size and flexibility in folding/wapping/using this is what we love best.  </li>
            <li>: I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It is also used nicely for cramps.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea because it is not always possible to lay or sit in the perfect position to keep a cold/hot pack in place.</li>
            <li>we are six weeks into his recovery and honestly this product SAVED my husband.</li>
            <li>The adjustable velcroed belt works nicely to hold the pack in place.</li>
            <li>the Neighbor &amp; She wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it</li>
            <li>Good item, easy to wear, Would be nice if it stayed colder longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new best friend.</li>
            <li>I have bought many ice packs over the years but this by far is the ABSOLUTE BEST!  :D  </li>
            <li>Got this item as I thought it would be easier and more effective than just an ice pack.</li>
            <li>The strap was seemed good, and the plastic seemed to be strong secure.</li>
            <li>With the strap, it stays on my neck while sitting up, what a huge bonus!  </li>
            <li>BEST back ice pack ever.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of hot/cold wraps, and this is the one that we like the best.</li>
            <li>I needed something more.  </li>
            <li>Love the pearls, as it&#x27;s pliable and comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love that it has a strap to hold it on</li>
            <li>I stand most of my day at work</li>
            <li>The durability, comfort and ease of use, especially for keeping it on your body are all excellent.</li>
            <li>I like the strap to keep it in place to keep hands free!</li>
            <li>The buckle could work better too.</li>
            <li>This back wrap is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is a very helpful and great product.</li>
            <li>My wife recently broke her foot and it wraps perfectly around a foot and stays in place.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I personally love the heat.  </li>
            <li>I love how you can pop it in the microwave for 30-45 seconds to heatproof place in freezer to use as an ice pack.</li>
            <li>Love Therapearl packs.</li>
            <li>But I love them.</li>
            <li>so I knew that this would be perfect for my back sprain</li>
            <li>Works OK with heat also</li>
            <li>more bc</li>
            <li>Love that you can strap it around and keep moving but not as effective if it would have been full.</li>
            <li>you&#x60;d better get an adjustment first from some good chiorpractor and use this.&lt;br /&gt;Result</li>
            <li>Very very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good.</li>
            <li>, it heats up quickly and stays warm for a good amount of time, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that what I received was an old stock item (which explains the great price), which is not the item I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the ideal moist heat wrap for an aching sore back.</li>
            <li>This would fit comfortably up to a 50 inch waist or even more.</li>
            <li>Love it, great for my back.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot if you use the correct microwave setting and it stays comfortably warm for 20-25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty handy, I bought it a while ago</li>
            <li>sure to read my full review here:  </li>
            <li>Everything fine, no smells.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase for sure.  </li>
            <li>This works great for my back when I have problems and pain.</li>
            <li>This was such a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for neck, knees or back ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li>Because the ice pack has an adjustable strap attached to it it was a snap to keep it secure.</li>
            <li>Easy to wipe clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can adjust to fit you.</li>
            <li>The strap is comfortable around my back/waist</li>
            <li>Even though it is frozen, it is soft and pliable and conforms to the shape of your neck very easily and is very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>The covering is a super smooth clear plastic that feels good against the skin, and can be easily rinsed off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very useful, I have 2</li>
            <li>It looks funny and doesn&#x27;t appear to have as many pearls, although I haven&#x27;t seen any snicking away... and the wrap still</li>
            <li>I would return it, but I have already thrown away the original packaging and receipt.</li>
            <li>It looks funny and doesn&#x27;t appear to have as many pearls, although I haven&#x27;t seen any snicking away... and the wrap still works.  </li>
            <li>but I would have liked to have paid a little more for it and have more gel in it.</li>
            <li>buying another so that I can cool both knees, if need be, or extend the cooling of the one frankenknee.  </li>
            <li>that is not the case, the plastic wrap which contains the beads of course is fairly pliable and when the wrap is vertical - ie against your back while you sit or stand - all the beads are at the bottom and hence the effectiveness is compromised.</li>
            <li>I put in the freezer a lot to get the full benefit, but this is not bad all things considered.</li>
            <li>how it&#x27;s full of pearls/beads?</li>
            <li>Well mine is about 1/3 full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another so that I can cool both knees, if need be, or extend the cooling of the one frankenknee.  </li>
            <li>This back wrap is so perfect and comfortable to put on my lower back.  </li>
            <li>In terms of right fit</li>
            <li>Having the belt to keep it secure was a great addition to the TheraPearl back wrap, and have used it in more areas than just the back!</li>
            <li>It maintains the coldness for an adequate amount of time, and can be folded when you place it in the freezer.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky that someone loaned me one of the cooling devices; and I wish I had had one from the start.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for low back injuries or post-op.</li>
            <li>: We both found that the pack was more comfortable if we wore a shirt to keep the pack from direct contact with our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have this up under my shoulder blades, and it stays there feeling weightless, with only that wonderful soothing moist heat penetrating my sore back</li>
            <li>I was lucky that someone loaned me one of the cooling devices; and I wish I had had one from the start.  </li>
            <li>portable and handy as long as you have a microwave or freezer available</li>
            <li>This is a well-made wrap and is easily adjustable for many different parts of your body.  </li>
            <li>Stays cold for an impressive length of time and is very comfortable</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s amazing for my lower back</li>
            <li>Heating can make inflammation worse, so if you know your pain is caused by inflammation, &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; is the perfect answer.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, my order was sold by \\&quot;Your online convenience\\&quot; and fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have my own regular heating pad</li>
            <li>This makes a good ice bag for a knee but not so much for the back.</li>
            <li>So, therefore you have a two in one deal.this product is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>your back pain is caused by sore muscles or bruises, the TheraPearl pack should be effective for temporary pain relief and for helping the injured tissues to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A TheraPearl back wrap was provided to me for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It never gets too hot, but is just the right temperature, staying that temperature for a full 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is nice in that it lays flat in a freezer</li>
            <li>And with the help of the velcro strap, it stays right where you put it.</li>
            <li>About one minute in our 700-watt microwave oven heats the pack to a hot enough temperature to be effective.</li>
            <li>The strap fit around my lower back easily and stayed there.</li>
            <li>When I sit down to relax, the Thera Pearl feels so good</li>
            <li>The surface area is fairly large, nicely covering my lower back.</li>
            <li>This back wrap is great for people that are a bit bigger.  </li>
            <li>every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adjusts easily and heats/ cools easily</li>
            <li>strap that attaches around my waist is super long and very stretchy, so anyone can get a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>The Knee Wrap works but is better for those that need the cooling below and above the knee.  </li>
            <li>this would work for a larger size personi would buy more products from this co.</li>
            <li>Ok if your looking for something for occasional use, not every day use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But these are minor issues, and overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love to use my Back Wrap when I have menstrual cramps.</li>
            <li>The heat in them would be too hot in the lumps and there would be zero heat in places where the filling had migrated away from that</li>
            <li>For an even more soothing experience I wear this at the same time I wear the neck wrap.</li>
            <li>The Knee Wrap works but is better for those that need the cooling below and above the knee.  </li>
            <li>I find the Back Wrap to be superior for my knee usage because it cools front and back.</li>
            <li>My husband said the Back Wrap felt good on his aching back and relieved some of the &amp;#34;hotness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast I fell in love with the Thera Pearl Back Wrap.</li>
            <li>I find the Back Wrap to be superior for my knee usage because it cools front and back.</li>
            <li>Also it heats up a lot faster than most heating pads I&#x27;ve ever used and is not incredibly hot to the touch, but stays warm for a long time.</li>
            <li>It covers my entire neck as well as the base of my head which is where I need it the most, so this was a better fit for me than the one they make for &amp;#34;neck and shoulders.&amp;#34; I love this so much I&#x27;m going to buy two more</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than a hot water bottle and stays hotter longer.</li>
            <li>always warm me up before exercising and then ice me down afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfect as it stays in place and he could move around.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed cold for a long time and very comfortable .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned: the strap is too large for someone that is size zero -- the velcro has nothing to attach to.</li>
            <li>It works, but it could use about 2x more pearls than they have in there, which would likely give more cold/heat time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was contacted by a Therapeal representative and was asked about my Therapearl experience, so I told them that I really liked the product, but sent back the back wrap due to leakage.  </li>
            <li>But this is fine for an alternate heat pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have purchased many of there products and not only do they form well to wherever you should need the relief, but they are so much better than your average ice pack!</li>
            <li>so I am very thankful to have found this product.y</li>
            <li>so I am very thankful to have found this product.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li>it works very well.  </li>
            <li>That way it is always ready.</li>
            <li>The smell is very noticable when used on a shoulder.  </li>
            <li>- just wrap it wit a towel or pillow case and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>I always has some in the freezer and some ready to be heated.</li>
            <li>This works fast and it works well.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell from the picture</li>
            <li>But I still really like this product.</li>
            <li>I got while lifting too much weight at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for smaller problems other than an adult&#x27;s neck and back.</li>
            <li>If you do nuke it to use as a heat pack, I highly recommend buying a second one for rotation because if you renuke to warm it up again, you risk overheating the package, causing it to break open.  </li>
            <li>If you have sore muscles, on the other hand, heat is the most helpful.  </li>
            <li>Second, there must be a micro-hole in my original.</li>
            <li>It provides pain relief that I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other way.</li>
            <li>This is better than a heating pad or any other type of heated wrap</li>
            <li>This is better than a heating pad or any other type of heated wrap</li>
            <li>Second, there must be a micro-hole in my original.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a wet, slimy feeling against your back or clothing - then fine.  </li>
            <li>and the reason is that it can be adjusted to cool the back of the knee as well as the sides and tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do suggest putting a washcloth or something as putting it directly on skin will be too hot.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure what they could do to improve the situation</li>
            <li>and the reason is that it can be adjusted to cool the back of the knee as well as the sides and tops.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a large area which spans my entire width of my back, and radiates a strong but gentle heat after about 40 seconds in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Never tried it warm,  maybe it will hold heat better than cold.  </li>
            <li>I also have a chronic back pain condition and almost always, heat helps the most, but only ice helps with my neck pain.  </li>
            <li>I also have a chronic back pain condition and almost always, heat helps the most, but only ice helps with my neck pain.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cold wrap I have found by far.</li>
            <li>Stays in place, stays cold, and best of all is soft.</li>
            <li>After a crippling bout of bulging disc, I finally sprang for the Therapearl Back Wrap, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>At first, I shuddered at the thought of placing something so cold on my body but when you are in that much pain, its actually a welcome relief  once you start to feel the effects on your pain level.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for bad knees.  </li>
            <li>the velcro is a bonus and long enough to secure it around her!</li>
            <li>In physical therapy, they always warm me up before exercising and then ice me down afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I am actually using the TheraPearl right now.</li>
            <li>What surprised me the most was how long the back wrap retained heat.</li>
            <li>The Velcro is super-easy to attach and it can actually be used on several body parts comfortably.</li>
            <li>When I needed it again, it was nothing short of miraculous in taking care of my intense pain!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to heat the Therapearl packs and they just do not get hot enough to make any difference.</li>
            <li>It saves your lower back and really helps!</li>
            <li>My first TheraPearl product but won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for anyone who wants a moist heat wrap for a sore back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is filled with little (pretty blue) gel beads that squish and move around inside.</li>
            <li>sent it back though and still need cooling, pretty much like what they give you in Physical Therapy.  </li>
            <li>I sent it back though and still need cooling, pretty much like what they give you in Physical Therapy.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my back while pregnant, the strap is big and bulky, I tend to go for the ice pack without the strap</li>
            <li>so my husband would be able to use it a little later that evening.</li>
            <li>If you need a great cold pack, I recommend the Therapearl Hot/Cold Therapy pack.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for a while until the seam developed a tiny tear and leaked the beads and gel all over my bedding.</li>
            <li>This wraps really well around the back and stays on.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Lots of pain and swelling in the old mom-knee.  </li>
            <li>After we got home I fixed him an icepack (ice in a ziplock bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble wrapping this</li>
            <li>Then I put on a guided meditation mp3 for 40 minutes, and have a complete stress relieving interval in my hectic day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lots of pain and swelling in the old mom-knee.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a product worth having if you suffer from back pain.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve both used several types of hot/cold wraps, and the TheraPearl pack is at least as effective as any of them.</li>
            <li>am pretty much in constant back pain.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the back wrap---and so does my husband!</li>
            <li>The small beads shape to your body&#x27;s contour making icing as comfortable as can be....</li>
            <li>next day, I was excited to open the box and find the wraps, I instantly put the back wrap in the freezer</li>
            <li>I have other TheraPearl cold/heat packs and they are wonderful; I only use them for cold, but they work well</li>
            <li>A couple of days ago I received TWO new and redesigned back wraps - heavier plastic to hold in the pearls and the waist band also redesigned.  </li>
            <li>First, I need one for the other Knee.  </li>
            <li>First, I need one for the other Knee.  </li>
            <li>I have been sick and this product came fast ,protected good</li>
            <li>As Crossfiitter, whenver after heavy lifting like snatch, Clean and jerk, it hurts my lower back often but</li>
            <li>After being in an accident 2 years ago and being in agony for months I tried this and being able to use hot or cold is a plus I can&#x27;t refuse.</li>
            <li>Although the packaging says it will stay cold for ~20min, I found that it helped my feel better for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>The THERA Pearl Back Wrap surprised me.  </li>
            <li>It eased my back pain almost completely.</li>
            <li>However, that doesnt mean you are pain free</li>
            <li>The day I received these THERAÂ°PEARLâ€™s wraps, my husband started having major pain in his back that literally knocked him off his feet--sitting in a chair made it worse and lying down to get some relief only made him more stiff on top of the pain</li>
            <li>I have had several leaky ice packs in the past, and the elastic or velcro on the straps always tends to wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>The pearls can move around in the 3 cells, but even when I did this and got it evened out, the all the cells were very much less than half filled with pearls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it hot and cold and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Since this is very lightweight, it stays where I put it without sliding down.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, I noticed that some of the pearls had migrated into an adjacent cell, but it was simple enough to squeeze them back into the right</li>
            <li>I have used a few different types of heating pads, strips and even hot towel treatments to relieve sore muscles after a work out.  </li>
            <li>love it, but wished it stayed super cold a little longer.  </li>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> This one was great because it had the strap</li>
            <li> Great customer service.  </li>
            <li> It is also great to wrap around your knee or shoulder....</li>
            <li> and it is great</li>
            <li> This works great also.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it for heat yet, but as an ice pack, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> Really effective!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the updated design, which includes 6-cells instead of 3 and seems to support a more even distribution of the pearls.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am very impressed with the customer service of Therapearl for listening to customers and making a good product even better.</li>
            <li> I have chronic abdominal and pelvic pain and have used about every heating pad there is, this product from Thera Peal is wonderful and by far the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It is a good size for knee or shoulder applications.</li>
            <li> Although I did not test this feature out, I do see how this could be a good asset to assist with abdominal cramps.</li>
            <li> SOSO,THE BELT IS NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> I had already tried the Therapearl neck wrap and loved it</li>
            <li> Awww pain relief has never felt so good!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> handy because it pliable</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that I could move around</li>
            <li> The strap is useful, but the size and flexibility in folding/wapping/using this is what we love best.  </li>
            <li> : I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It is also used nicely for cramps.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea because it is not always possible to lay or sit in the perfect position to keep a cold/hot pack in place.</li>
            <li> we are six weeks into his recovery and honestly this product SAVED my husband.</li>
            <li> The adjustable velcroed belt works nicely to hold the pack in place.</li>
            <li> the Neighbor &amp; She wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it</li>
            <li> Good item, easy to wear, Would be nice if it stayed colder longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new best friend.</li>
            <li> I have bought many ice packs over the years but this by far is the ABSOLUTE BEST!  :D  </li>
            <li> Got this item as I thought it would be easier and more effective than just an ice pack.</li>
            <li> The strap was seemed good, and the plastic seemed to be strong secure.</li>
            <li> With the strap, it stays on my neck while sitting up, what a huge bonus!  </li>
            <li> BEST back ice pack ever.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of hot/cold wraps, and this is the one that we like the best.</li>
            <li> I needed something more.  </li>
            <li> Love the pearls, as it&#x27;s pliable and comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love that it has a strap to hold it on</li>
            <li> I stand most of my day at work</li>
            <li> The durability, comfort and ease of use, especially for keeping it on your body are all excellent.</li>
            <li> I like the strap to keep it in place to keep hands free!</li>
            <li> The buckle could work better too.</li>
            <li> This back wrap is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful and great product.</li>
            <li> My wife recently broke her foot and it wraps perfectly around a foot and stays in place.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I personally love the heat.  </li>
            <li> I love how you can pop it in the microwave for 30-45 seconds to heatproof place in freezer to use as an ice pack.</li>
            <li> Love Therapearl packs.</li>
            <li> But I love them.</li>
            <li> so I knew that this would be perfect for my back sprain</li>
            <li> Works OK with heat also</li>
            <li> more bc</li>
            <li> Love that you can strap it around and keep moving but not as effective if it would have been full.</li>
            <li> you&#x60;d better get an adjustment first from some good chiorpractor and use this.&lt;br /&gt;Result</li>
            <li> Very very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.</li>
            <li> , it heats up quickly and stays warm for a good amount of time, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that what I received was an old stock item (which explains the great price), which is not the item I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the ideal moist heat wrap for an aching sore back.</li>
            <li> This would fit comfortably up to a 50 inch waist or even more.</li>
            <li> Love it, great for my back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot if you use the correct microwave setting and it stays comfortably warm for 20-25 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty handy, I bought it a while ago</li>
            <li> sure to read my full review here:  </li>
            <li> Everything fine, no smells.  </li>
            <li> Worth the purchase for sure.  </li>
            <li> This works great for my back when I have problems and pain.</li>
            <li> This was such a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for neck, knees or back ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> Because the ice pack has an adjustable strap attached to it it was a snap to keep it secure.</li>
            <li> Easy to wipe clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can adjust to fit you.</li>
            <li> The strap is comfortable around my back/waist</li>
            <li> Even though it is frozen, it is soft and pliable and conforms to the shape of your neck very easily and is very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> The covering is a super smooth clear plastic that feels good against the skin, and can be easily rinsed off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very useful, I have 2</li>
            <li> It looks funny and doesn&#x27;t appear to have as many pearls, although I haven&#x27;t seen any snicking away... and the wrap still</li>
            <li> I would return it, but I have already thrown away the original packaging and receipt.</li>
            <li> It looks funny and doesn&#x27;t appear to have as many pearls, although I haven&#x27;t seen any snicking away... and the wrap still works.  </li>
            <li> but I would have liked to have paid a little more for it and have more gel in it.</li>
            <li> buying another so that I can cool both knees, if need be, or extend the cooling of the one frankenknee.  </li>
            <li> that is not the case, the plastic wrap which contains the beads of course is fairly pliable and when the wrap is vertical - ie against your back while you sit or stand - all the beads are at the bottom and hence the effectiveness is compromised.</li>
            <li> I put in the freezer a lot to get the full benefit, but this is not bad all things considered.</li>
            <li> how it&#x27;s full of pearls/beads?</li>
            <li> Well mine is about 1/3 full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another so that I can cool both knees, if need be, or extend the cooling of the one frankenknee.  </li>
            <li> This back wrap is so perfect and comfortable to put on my lower back.  </li>
            <li> In terms of right fit</li>
            <li> Having the belt to keep it secure was a great addition to the TheraPearl back wrap, and have used it in more areas than just the back!</li>
            <li> It maintains the coldness for an adequate amount of time, and can be folded when you place it in the freezer.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky that someone loaned me one of the cooling devices; and I wish I had had one from the start.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for low back injuries or post-op.</li>
            <li> : We both found that the pack was more comfortable if we wore a shirt to keep the pack from direct contact with our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have this up under my shoulder blades, and it stays there feeling weightless, with only that wonderful soothing moist heat penetrating my sore back</li>
            <li> I was lucky that someone loaned me one of the cooling devices; and I wish I had had one from the start.  </li>
            <li> portable and handy as long as you have a microwave or freezer available</li>
            <li> This is a well-made wrap and is easily adjustable for many different parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> Stays cold for an impressive length of time and is very comfortable</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s amazing for my lower back</li>
            <li> Heating can make inflammation worse, so if you know your pain is caused by inflammation, &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; is the perfect answer.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, my order was sold by \\&quot;Your online convenience\\&quot; and fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have my own regular heating pad</li>
            <li> This makes a good ice bag for a knee but not so much for the back.</li>
            <li> So, therefore you have a two in one deal.this product is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> your back pain is caused by sore muscles or bruises, the TheraPearl pack should be effective for temporary pain relief and for helping the injured tissues to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A TheraPearl back wrap was provided to me for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It never gets too hot, but is just the right temperature, staying that temperature for a full 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is nice in that it lays flat in a freezer</li>
            <li> And with the help of the velcro strap, it stays right where you put it.</li>
            <li> About one minute in our 700-watt microwave oven heats the pack to a hot enough temperature to be effective.</li>
            <li> The strap fit around my lower back easily and stayed there.</li>
            <li> When I sit down to relax, the Thera Pearl feels so good</li>
            <li> The surface area is fairly large, nicely covering my lower back.</li>
            <li> This back wrap is great for people that are a bit bigger.  </li>
            <li> every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adjusts easily and heats/ cools easily</li>
            <li> strap that attaches around my waist is super long and very stretchy, so anyone can get a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> The Knee Wrap works but is better for those that need the cooling below and above the knee.  </li>
            <li> this would work for a larger size personi would buy more products from this co.</li>
            <li> Ok if your looking for something for occasional use, not every day use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But these are minor issues, and overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love to use my Back Wrap when I have menstrual cramps.</li>
            <li> The heat in them would be too hot in the lumps and there would be zero heat in places where the filling had migrated away from that</li>
            <li> For an even more soothing experience I wear this at the same time I wear the neck wrap.</li>
            <li> The Knee Wrap works but is better for those that need the cooling below and above the knee.  </li>
            <li> I find the Back Wrap to be superior for my knee usage because it cools front and back.</li>
            <li> My husband said the Back Wrap felt good on his aching back and relieved some of the &amp;#34;hotness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast I fell in love with the Thera Pearl Back Wrap.</li>
            <li> I find the Back Wrap to be superior for my knee usage because it cools front and back.</li>
            <li> Also it heats up a lot faster than most heating pads I&#x27;ve ever used and is not incredibly hot to the touch, but stays warm for a long time.</li>
            <li> It covers my entire neck as well as the base of my head which is where I need it the most, so this was a better fit for me than the one they make for &amp;#34;neck and shoulders.&amp;#34; I love this so much I&#x27;m going to buy two more</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than a hot water bottle and stays hotter longer.</li>
            <li> always warm me up before exercising and then ice me down afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfect as it stays in place and he could move around.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed cold for a long time and very comfortable .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned: the strap is too large for someone that is size zero -- the velcro has nothing to attach to.</li>
            <li> It works, but it could use about 2x more pearls than they have in there, which would likely give more cold/heat time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was contacted by a Therapeal representative and was asked about my Therapearl experience, so I told them that I really liked the product, but sent back the back wrap due to leakage.  </li>
            <li> But this is fine for an alternate heat pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have purchased many of there products and not only do they form well to wherever you should need the relief, but they are so much better than your average ice pack!</li>
            <li> so I am very thankful to have found this product.y</li>
            <li> so I am very thankful to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> it works very well.  </li>
            <li> That way it is always ready.</li>
            <li> The smell is very noticable when used on a shoulder.  </li>
            <li> - just wrap it wit a towel or pillow case and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> I always has some in the freezer and some ready to be heated.</li>
            <li> This works fast and it works well.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tell from the picture</li>
            <li> But I still really like this product.</li>
            <li> I got while lifting too much weight at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for smaller problems other than an adult&#x27;s neck and back.</li>
            <li> If you do nuke it to use as a heat pack, I highly recommend buying a second one for rotation because if you renuke to warm it up again, you risk overheating the package, causing it to break open.  </li>
            <li> If you have sore muscles, on the other hand, heat is the most helpful.  </li>
            <li> Second, there must be a micro-hole in my original.</li>
            <li> It provides pain relief that I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other way.</li>
            <li> This is better than a heating pad or any other type of heated wrap</li>
            <li> This is better than a heating pad or any other type of heated wrap</li>
            <li> Second, there must be a micro-hole in my original.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a wet, slimy feeling against your back or clothing - then fine.  </li>
            <li> and the reason is that it can be adjusted to cool the back of the knee as well as the sides and tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do suggest putting a washcloth or something as putting it directly on skin will be too hot.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure what they could do to improve the situation</li>
            <li> and the reason is that it can be adjusted to cool the back of the knee as well as the sides and tops.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a large area which spans my entire width of my back, and radiates a strong but gentle heat after about 40 seconds in the microwave.</li>
            <li> Never tried it warm,  maybe it will hold heat better than cold.  </li>
            <li> I also have a chronic back pain condition and almost always, heat helps the most, but only ice helps with my neck pain.  </li>
            <li> I also have a chronic back pain condition and almost always, heat helps the most, but only ice helps with my neck pain.  </li>
            <li> This is the best cold wrap I have found by far.</li>
            <li> Stays in place, stays cold, and best of all is soft.</li>
            <li> After a crippling bout of bulging disc, I finally sprang for the Therapearl Back Wrap, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> At first, I shuddered at the thought of placing something so cold on my body but when you are in that much pain, its actually a welcome relief  once you start to feel the effects on your pain level.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for bad knees.  </li>
            <li> the velcro is a bonus and long enough to secure it around her!</li>
            <li> In physical therapy, they always warm me up before exercising and then ice me down afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I am actually using the TheraPearl right now.</li>
            <li> What surprised me the most was how long the back wrap retained heat.</li>
            <li> The Velcro is super-easy to attach and it can actually be used on several body parts comfortably.</li>
            <li> When I needed it again, it was nothing short of miraculous in taking care of my intense pain!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to heat the Therapearl packs and they just do not get hot enough to make any difference.</li>
            <li> It saves your lower back and really helps!</li>
            <li> My first TheraPearl product but won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for anyone who wants a moist heat wrap for a sore back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is filled with little (pretty blue) gel beads that squish and move around inside.</li>
            <li> sent it back though and still need cooling, pretty much like what they give you in Physical Therapy.  </li>
            <li> I sent it back though and still need cooling, pretty much like what they give you in Physical Therapy.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my back while pregnant, the strap is big and bulky, I tend to go for the ice pack without the strap</li>
            <li> so my husband would be able to use it a little later that evening.</li>
            <li> If you need a great cold pack, I recommend the Therapearl Hot/Cold Therapy pack.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for a while until the seam developed a tiny tear and leaked the beads and gel all over my bedding.</li>
            <li> This wraps really well around the back and stays on.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Lots of pain and swelling in the old mom-knee.  </li>
            <li> After we got home I fixed him an icepack (ice in a ziplock bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble wrapping this</li>
            <li> Then I put on a guided meditation mp3 for 40 minutes, and have a complete stress relieving interval in my hectic day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lots of pain and swelling in the old mom-knee.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a product worth having if you suffer from back pain.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve both used several types of hot/cold wraps, and the TheraPearl pack is at least as effective as any of them.</li>
            <li> am pretty much in constant back pain.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the back wrap---and so does my husband!</li>
            <li> The small beads shape to your body&#x27;s contour making icing as comfortable as can be....</li>
            <li> next day, I was excited to open the box and find the wraps, I instantly put the back wrap in the freezer</li>
            <li> I have other TheraPearl cold/heat packs and they are wonderful; I only use them for cold, but they work well</li>
            <li> A couple of days ago I received TWO new and redesigned back wraps - heavier plastic to hold in the pearls and the waist band also redesigned.  </li>
            <li> First, I need one for the other Knee.  </li>
            <li> First, I need one for the other Knee.  </li>
            <li> I have been sick and this product came fast ,protected good</li>
            <li> As Crossfiitter, whenver after heavy lifting like snatch, Clean and jerk, it hurts my lower back often but</li>
            <li> After being in an accident 2 years ago and being in agony for months I tried this and being able to use hot or cold is a plus I can&#x27;t refuse.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging says it will stay cold for ~20min, I found that it helped my feel better for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The THERA Pearl Back Wrap surprised me.  </li>
            <li> It eased my back pain almost completely.</li>
            <li> However, that doesnt mean you are pain free</li>
            <li> The day I received these THERAÂ°PEARLâ€™s wraps, my husband started having major pain in his back that literally knocked him off his feet--sitting in a chair made it worse and lying down to get some relief only made him more stiff on top of the pain</li>
            <li> I have had several leaky ice packs in the past, and the elastic or velcro on the straps always tends to wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> The pearls can move around in the 3 cells, but even when I did this and got it evened out, the all the cells were very much less than half filled with pearls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it hot and cold and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Since this is very lightweight, it stays where I put it without sliding down.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I noticed that some of the pearls had migrated into an adjacent cell, but it was simple enough to squeeze them back into the right</li>
            <li> I have used a few different types of heating pads, strips and even hot towel treatments to relieve sore muscles after a work out.  </li>
            <li> love it, but wished it stayed super cold a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been over working my back muscles, and this product came at just the right time.  </li>
            <li> I love the little beads inside and that the product is so versatile (hot and cold).</li>
            <li> For years I used an old icepack that I&#x27;d shove down the back of my shirt and then hope it stayed relatively close to where I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I use it as ice therapy since its been so hot lately it also helps me to regulate my temperature.</li>
            <li> This helped a lot when my back went out, pinched nerve, and we were leaving for a long road trip to GA.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long before it warms up</li>
            <li> My wife and I both suffer from lower back pain - hers is occasional, mine is chronic due to the residual effects of seven lumbar spinal surgeries.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, we mostly use it for a cold pack, and the velcro strap helps hold it in place and the three compartments of jell beads allow it to wrap around without bunching up</li>
            <li> been using it more as a cold pack.</li>
            <li> It does not stay cold for more than 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Use it mostly with cold.</li>
            <li> The package does give you guidelines on how long to nuke this depending on the wattage of your microwave.  </li>
            <li> had partial knee replacement earlier in the year.</li>
            <li> Using is under the Mueller Adjustable Lumbar Back Brace keeps it in place without slipping ever time I move.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep using disposable hot/cold products that in the long run will run you a bunch of money</li>
            <li> I had partial knee replacement earlier in the year.</li>
            <li> and my back is starting to feel much less pain.</li>
            <li> With every use, the strap winds up bunched up in the corner of the little plastic buckle, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to adjust it to the right size without taking the time to unbunch the whole thing.</li>
            <li> The product I received did bear all the markings of a legitimate Therapearl product, but is seemed to have around half the pearls as the item pictured on Amazon and in online reviews I&#x27;ve seen on various blogs.</li>
            <li> When it came, the middle section had 3/4 less pearls that the end sections.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased what appeared to be the same product  as I had, but when I received it- there was about half the pearl beads inside than I had before.  </li>
            <li> This is a convenient way to attach a hot or cold pack to a sensitive back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those tight aching muscles are finally smoothing out and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I am laying down with it on my back, I put a pillow up against it to keep it in place due to gravity.</li>
            <li> So I primarily use them as a cold pack and for this purpose they do the trick.</li>
            <li> None of that matters if it only lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It wraps around and Velcros closed.</li>
            <li> here?&lt;br /&gt;Excellent as you can wander round whilst icing or heating your sore back.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s wet, unlike fabric versions.</li>
            <li> And occasionally you have to knead the little freezer balls from one section to the other to provide an even disbursement of &amp;#34;therapearls.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> have had other wraps you heat in the microwave, but they were lumpy, and the filling would ball up in them and the covering would become rough and tattered.</li>
            <li> only minor complaint is with the strap.</li>
            <li> No more waiting for rock solid ice packs to melt a bit before using</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s now pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> flexible for other areas you have to ice.</li>
            <li> I chose a 3 star rating on this due to the lack of product inside the 3 cells.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get or stay super cold.  </li>
            <li> You will wish you had a wrap when you are in discomfort, sore from a good day&#x27;s exercise routine or miserable from pain.  </li>
            <li> Before I found this, I had to ice while laying down.</li>
            <li> I have days where it hurts to lay down, sit, or even stand.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay cold for long and leaked blue fluid.</li>
            <li> The black velcro strap is quite sturdy and holds the pack in place.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this to wrap around me neck because I have a chronic pain condition that gives me very painful flareups that last a long time and they occur quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it hot and cold and it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my share of hot and cold packs.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to mess with ice.</li>
            <li> Have used mine both hot and cold.</li>
            <li> Convenient belt strap for wearing and being able to ice while doing things, but it has to be worn against skin in order to be close to cold enough and doesn&#x27;t stay cold for longer than about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no condensation on the pack whether used hot or cold, so you and your clothes don&#x27;t get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looks and feels weird if you are new to the PEARLS.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little lean on the gel.</li>
            <li> but I did want to write a review for other people because I found it to be &amp;#34;EXCELLENT&amp;#34; !!  </li>
            <li> This started leaking the gel beads after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> But the cold doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> My first impression upon using it was that it did not get as cold as I wanted, and it didn&#x27;t stay cold very long.</li>
            <li> It is cold, but just cold enough to put directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I know people say to walk and exercise but its so hard to do and stay motivated when every movement hurts.</li>
            <li> The package says that you must freeze it for two hours and the cold only lasts for 20 minutes</li>
            <li> but I find that it lasts longer, at least 30-45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid to use it as a heat pack because I&#x27;ve bought a product like this before for my eyes and the vinyl wrapper broke open and caused the inside ingredients to leak out.  </li>
            <li> I also like that you can freeze the same pack to make a cold pack.</li>
            <li> The Pearls do not hold the cold as well as a solid gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cold last for about 15-20 minutes before there is a noticeable decrease in temperature.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having severe back pain, I&#x27;d stick to cold therapy, at least until things improve, and then alternate between cold and heat.</li>
            <li> For relief, I prefer heat, but the numbing effects of cold treatment usually last longer.</li>
            <li> The cold does not last as long as the gels and not as cold.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very cold, sits on your back in an odd way and moves around a lot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to stay cold for long..</li>
            <li> doesnt stay stay cold very long</li>
            <li> But worst thing about it, after about a weeks use it sprung a leak along one of the seams mid pack and blue gel balls</li>
            <li> so you have to tie the loose ends which is awkward.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get as cold as other units.</li>
            <li> I have about 3 other cold therapy products that do not work as well.</li>
            <li> Just wished it maintained it&#x27;s cold factor a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> For cold treatment, a couple of hours in the freezer chills the pack enough to remain cold for the recommended twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> The WORSE ice pack I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Does not stay very cold not for very long.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who needs a small localized heating pad or cold</li>
            <li> It stays very cold for at least 20 minutes (usually longer).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to use it and still be doing anything.</li>
            <li> They make me go through xrays and things but tell me they don&#x27;t see anything wrong.</li>
            <li> My husband was recently involved in a terrible car accident and this product has made his pain bearable.</li>
            <li> either~ SORRY~</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong about this thing.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this thing is useless, and I recommend you avoid it at all costs.</li>
            <li> The black straps had a very, very, unpleasant chemical smell that does not go away after use.</li>
            <li> Stays cold for a while.</li>
            <li> It stays cold for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wish it would stay cold longer</li>
            <li> I wish it stayed cold a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Put it in the freezer for 8-12 hours, stays cold for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also the plastic which comes in contact with your skin has a slimy feel to it when it is cold.</li>
            <li> That is about the time you should keep a cold pack on anyway</li>
            <li> You can heat it up in the microwave or place it in the freezer to have a cold pack.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it for both cold therapy and heat therapy, so it&#x27;s versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stay cold for longer than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Those are the worst for me</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This wraps really well around the back and stays on.  Worth the purchase for sure.  Stays cold for a while.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my sore back!!! Works great.</li>
            <li> handy because it pliable and you can wrap it around but it doesn&#x27;t get as cold as other units.</li>
            <li> BEST back ice pack ever. The small beads shape to your body&#x27;s contour making icing as comfortable as can be.... No more waiting for rock solid ice packs to melt a bit before using and you can walk around with it on as my chiropractor told me to do.</li>
            <li> This works great for my back when I have problems and pain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon but I did want to write a review for other people because I found it to be &amp;#34;EXCELLENT&amp;#34; !!  I actually use this to wrap around me neck because I have a chronic pain condition that gives me very painful flareups that last a long time and they occur quite frequently.  Even though it is frozen, it is soft and pliable and conforms to the shape of your neck very easily and is very comfortable to wear.  Before I found this, I had to ice while laying down. With the strap, it stays on my neck while sitting up, what a huge bonus!  It covers my entire neck as well as the base of my head which is where I need it the most, so this was a better fit for me than the one they make for &amp;#34;neck and shoulders.&amp;#34; I love this so much I&#x27;m going to buy two more so I can have two in the freezer for rotation.  The package says that you must freeze it for two hours and the cold only lasts for 20 minutes but I find that it lasts longer, at least 30-45 minutes.  I&#x27;m too afraid to use it as a heat pack because I&#x27;ve bought a product like this before for my eyes and the vinyl wrapper broke open and caused the inside ingredients to leak out.  The package does give you guidelines on how long to nuke this depending on the wattage of your microwave.  If you do nuke it to use as a heat pack, I highly recommend buying a second one for rotation because if you renuke to warm it up again, you risk overheating the package, causing it to break open.  When to ice vs. when to heat?  Every doctor I have asked has told me something different.  Heating can make inflammation worse, so if you know your pain is caused by inflammation, &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; is the perfect answer.  At first, I shuddered at the thought of placing something so cold on my body but when you are in that much pain, its actually a welcome relief  once you start to feel the effects on your pain level.  If you have sore muscles, on the other hand, heat is the most helpful.  In physical therapy, they always warm me up before exercising and then ice me down afterwards.  For me I learned through trial and error when to use heat vs. ice.  I also have a chronic back pain condition and almost always, heat helps the most, but only ice helps with my neck pain.  Finally, I just wanted to add that I can&#x27;t tolerate over the counter anti-inflammatory medication or prednisone so I am very thankful to have found this product.y always warm me up before exercising and then ice me down afterwards.

            <li> I have bought many ice packs over the years but this by far is the ABSOLUTE BEST!  :D  If I am laying down with it on my back, I put a pillow up against it to keep it in place due to gravity.</li>
            <li> Beware about overheating this belt--it retains an incredible amount of heat. Really effective!</li>
            <li> Got this item as I thought it would be easier and more effective than just an ice pack. It&#x27;s awful. It doesn&#x27;t get very cold, sits on your back in an odd way and moves around a lot. But worst thing about it, after about a weeks use it sprung a leak along one of the seams mid pack and blue gel balls come out. Can&#x27;t fix the break in the seem and so it&#x27;s now pretty much useless. $30 rip off.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and product as described.</li>
            <li> This was such a great product. I love the little beads inside and that the product is so versatile (hot and cold). The strap fit around my lower back easily and stayed there. I liked the fact that I could move around it wouldn&#x27;t move. I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> portable and handy as long as you have a microwave or freezer available</li>
            <li> The product I received did bear all the markings of a legitimate Therapearl product, but is seemed to have around half the pearls as the item pictured on Amazon and in online reviews I&#x27;ve seen on various blogs. Also, the product I received had only three segments (vertical divisions) whereas the product advertised on Amazon has six (vertical and horizontal divisions) so when I put mine on, all the beads fell to the bottom of the wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that what I received was an old stock item (which explains the great price), which is not the item I wanted. The packaging and everything actually look like this version of the [[ASIN:B004WQ4NB0 TheraPearl Back Wrap]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am returning the wrap and will try to buy the product I want (the one pictured in the Amazon ad) from a brick and mortar store. For what it&#x27;s worth, my order was sold by \\&quot;Your online convenience\\&quot; and fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I already had the TheraPearl ankle wrap so I got the back wrap for both me and my dog.  I use it cold for lower back and shoulder pain, my dog needs it warm for arthritis in her back.  I like it so far.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot if you use the correct microwave setting and it stays comfortably warm for 20-25 minutes.  It stays cold for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Awww pain relief has never felt so good! Have purchased many of there products and not only do they form well to wherever you should need the relief, but they are so much better than your average ice pack! Having the belt to keep it secure was a great addition to the TheraPearl back wrap, and have used it in more areas than just the back! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> doesnt stay stay cold very long</li>
            <li> I had some lower back pain and I figured I would try this one out. I&#x27;ve have my own regular heating pad but it&#x27;s difficult to use it and still be doing anything. This one was great because it had the strap and I could still walk around and finish the cooking I was doing. Also it heats up a lot faster than most heating pads I&#x27;ve ever used and is not incredibly hot to the touch, but stays warm for a long time. I also like that you can freeze the same pack to make a cold pack. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> We have just bought our second hot/cold wrap.  This is a well-made wrap and is easily adjustable for many different parts of your body.  Fits especially well on neck and shoulder spots.  We have used it around our knees too.  The strap is useful, but the size and flexibility in folding/wapping/using this is what we love best.  It maintains the coldness for an adequate amount of time, and can be folded when you place it in the freezer.  Highly recommended.  We&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of hot/cold wraps, and this is the one that we like the best.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for bad knees.  The product gives you the freedom to walk or move around while wearing it. It is the perfect size for those arthritic knees</li>
            <li> This is the best cold wrap I have found by far. Stays cold for an impressive length of time and is very comfortable</li>
            <li> This might not show up as Verified Purchase yet, but I just purchased a second one of these TheraPearl Back Wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m purchasing another is twofold. First, I need one for the other Knee.  Second, there must be a micro-hole in my original. It looks funny and doesn&#x27;t appear to have as many pearls, although I haven&#x27;t seen any snicking away... and the wrap still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EXPERIENCE&lt;br /&gt;I had partial knee replacement earlier in the year. Lots of pain and swelling in the old mom-knee.  I was lucky that someone loaned me one of the cooling devices; and I wish I had had one from the start.  Don&#x27;t skip that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back though and still need cooling, pretty much like what they give you in Physical Therapy.  Even now, after walking the dogs, I still need some cooling and it&#x27;s been months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Back Wrap and the Knee Wrap and I prefer the Back Wrap and the reason is that it can be adjusted to cool the back of the knee as well as the sides and tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I have found that I can use the straps to keep the wrap in place.  The Knee Wrap works but is better for those that need the cooling below and above the knee.  There is also no cooling over the patella where the incision is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;The Back Wrap works for backs!  I&#x27;ve used it hot and cold and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another so that I can cool both knees, if need be, or extend the cooling of the one frankenknee.  I find the Back Wrap to be superior for my knee usage because it cools front and back.</li>
            <li> The Pearls do not hold the cold as well as a solid gel.  I needed something more.  However, this is prefect for kids.  The cold does not last as long as the gels and not as cold.  Perfect for smaller problems other than an adult&#x27;s neck and back.</li>
            <li> Perfect for low back injuries or post-op. I have been looking for a portable ice pack and this one stays put with no problems. Love the pearls, as it&#x27;s pliable and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. My opinion is not influenced by any form of compensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty much in constant back pain. I sometimes forget what its like to not hurt, I have been like this since I was a child. The doctors have never found a reason for it. They make me go through xrays and things but tell me they don&#x27;t see anything wrong. The TheraPearl back wrap has come to my rescue. I have problems with my lower back the most and unfortunately as I have proven the smallest of falls causes me to pull a muscle in my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am actually using the TheraPearl right now. I use it as ice therapy since its been so hot lately it also helps me to regulate my temperature. It provides pain relief that I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other way. I know people say to walk and exercise but its so hard to do and stay motivated when every movement hurts. I have days where it hurts to lay down, sit, or even stand. Those are the worst for me but I haven&#x27;t had one in the time I have had TheraPearl but when I do you know what will be by my side. I love that it has a strap to hold it on so you could even use it while exercising</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, we mostly use it for a cold pack, and the velcro strap helps hold it in place and the three compartments of jell beads allow it to wrap around without bunching up</li>
            <li> This product came just as described. It is also used nicely for cramps. I stand most of my day at work so it&#x27;s amazing for my lower back</li>
            <li> it works very well.  I wish it would stay cold longer</li>
            <li> This item is helpful and lets me get things done while I ice my back.  I even packed it in my bag and took it on vacation.  I wish it stayed cold a bit longer.</li>
            <li> The day I received these THERAÂ°PEARLâ€™s wraps, my husband started having major pain in his back that literally knocked him off his feet--sitting in a chair made it worse and lying down to get some relief only made him more stiff on top of the pain he was already experiencing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He went to his massage therapist, got a massage and she suggested alternating ice and heat. After we got home I fixed him an icepack (ice in a ziplock bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I was excited to open the box and find the wraps, I instantly put the back wrap in the freezer so my husband would be able to use it a little later that evening. My husband said the Back Wrap felt good on his aching back and relieved some of the &amp;#34;hotness&amp;#34; in his lower back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the back wrap---and so does my husband!</li>
            <li> The WORSE ice pack I have ever used. Put it in the freezer for 8-12 hours, stays cold for 5 minutes. The durability, comfort and ease of use, especially for keeping it on your body are all excellent. None of that matters if it only lasts a few minutes. Definitely going to return it.</li>
            <li> This is pretty handy, I bought it a while ago and we all use it when needed. Good product.</li>
            <li> that is not the case, the plastic wrap which contains the beads of course is fairly pliable and when the wrap is vertical - ie against your back while you sit or stand - all the beads are at the bottom and hence the effectiveness is compromised. Also the plastic which comes in contact with your skin has a slimy feel to it when it is cold. So I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product..that conforms to knee contours...Just wished it maintained it&#x27;s cold factor a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Great for neck, knees or back ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> This is a great ice pack! My husband had knee joint replacement surgery and we had to ice his knee when he came home from the hospital. So I wrapped a damp paper towel around his knee and then wrapped the ice pack around is knee. Because the ice pack has an adjustable strap attached to it it was a snap to keep it secure. Then took a big bath towel and wrapped that around his knee. The ice pack worked like a charm. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels weird if you are new to the PEARLS.  But once you use it, forget the rest. A++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my share of hot and cold packs. I tend to like the microwavable packs that have rice or a similar substance inside because they offer moist heat. But this is fine for an alternate heat pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using it more as a cold pack. It is nice in that it lays flat in a freezer so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. That way it is always ready. It wraps around and Velcros closed. This is a great idea because it is not always possible to lay or sit in the perfect position to keep a cold/hot pack in place. I have a larger girth and I had no trouble wrapping this around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cold last for about 15-20 minutes before there is a noticeable decrease in temperature. That is about the time you should keep a cold pack on anyway so at that point, pop it back in the freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is filled with little (pretty blue) gel beads that squish and move around inside. Easy to wipe clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I have been sick and this product came fast ,protected good and this product fits perfect and adjust well with the locg strap being helpful for body size I am thin.but this would work for a larger size personi would buy more products from this co.</li>
            <li> I like the strap to keep it in place to keep hands free! But the cold doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I put in the freezer a lot to get the full benefit, but this is not bad all things considered.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good. it doesn&#x27;t last very long before it warms up but it still convenient. you don&#x27;t have to mess with ice. I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this item for my husband&#x27;s shoulder. Worked perfect as it stays in place and he could move around.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed cold for a long time and very comfortable .</li>
            <li> This makes a good ice bag for a knee but not so much for the back. It didn&#x27;t stay cold for long and leaked blue fluid.</li>
            <li> Have used mine both hot and cold. The best part is that you can strap it on and move about. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Well made and does the job.</li>
            <li> The black straps had a very, very, unpleasant chemical smell that does not go away after use. The smell is very noticable when used on a shoulder.  It is a good size for knee or shoulder applications. When it came, the middle section had 3/4 less pearls that the end sections.  I discovered that pearls can be moved from section to section to even them out.&lt;br /&gt;E-mailed faq@therapearl.com as comment 1 mentions and 2 days later got a package with 2 knee wraps, a sports pack and an eye-essential mask.  Everything fine, no smells.  Great customer service.  Thank you TheraPearl</li>
            <li> Does not stay very cold not for very long. The buckle could work better too.</li>
            <li> This started leaking the gel beads after a few months of use.  It also doesn&#x27;t get or stay super cold.  Convenient belt strap for wearing and being able to ice while doing things, but it has to be worn against skin in order to be close to cold enough and doesn&#x27;t stay cold for longer than about 10 minutes.  Never tried it warm,  maybe it will hold heat better than cold.  Ok if your looking for something for occasional use, not every day use.</li>
            <li> This back wrap is great for people that are a bit bigger.  You can adjust to fit you. It is also great to wrap around your knee or shoulder....flexible for other areas you have to ice.</li>
            <li> Very useful, I have 2</li>
            <li> Worked really well for a while until the seam developed a tiny tear and leaked the beads and gel all over my bedding. Save your money and just get 12 pocket cooler ice pack from tagged for 3 bucks.</li>
            <li> This helped a lot when my back went out, pinched nerve, and we were leaving for a long road trip to GA.  Although the packaging says it will stay cold for ~20min, I found that it helped my feel better for more than a few hours.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had purchased what appeared to be the same product  as I had, but when I received it- there was about half the pearl beads inside than I had before.  It does not stay cold for more than 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This back wrap is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have about 3 other cold therapy products that do not work as well. I got up in the middle of the night with hip bursitis and ordered this wrap. When I needed it again, it was nothing short of miraculous in taking care of my intense pain!</li>
            <li> I had back surgery 2 months ago and still use this everynight and sometimes in the afternoons. This is a very helpful and great product.</li>
            <li> If you need a great cold pack, I recommend the Therapearl Hot/Cold Therapy pack. The back wrap works well on shoulders too - just wrap it wit a towel or pillow case and you are ready to go. I just has shoulder surgery and it has been a godsend for icing after I do my physical therapy exercises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to heat the Therapearl packs and they just do not get hot enough to make any difference. So I primarily use them as a cold pack and for this purpose they do the trick. That is why they only get 4 stars.</li>
            <li> You see in the photo how it&#x27;s full of pearls/beads? Well mine is about 1/3 full. Love that you can strap it around and keep moving but not as effective if it would have been full. Didn&#x27;t return but wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> The best ice pack in the world.  Stays in place, stays cold, and best of all is soft.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have burcittus in the hip joint and I can wrap the ice bag around my hip and wear it while watching TV, if I have to get up from the chair it stays in place. My wife recently broke her foot and it wraps perfectly around a foot and stays in place. Nothing scientific about it - just well engineered - it does what it does.</li>
            <li> My husband was recently involved in a terrible car accident and this product has made his pain bearable. It can be frozen which we did in the initial stage of his treatment and we bought four so that he can go around the clock with one on. Then in the second stage when the Dr allowed us to go to heat we would heat for 75 seconds and put on his back- we are six weeks into his recovery and honestly this product SAVED my husband. He has been wearing one every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adjusts easily and heats/ cools easily and it truly stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER left an Internet review before but this product is truly amazing-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play tennis and use on my arms and legs too!!! Truly a break through product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for thinking of this!!!</li>
            <li> I have chronic abdominal and pelvic pain and have used about every heating pad there is, this product from Thera Peal is wonderful and by far the best I have ever used!  I have had it for over a month now and it is great, it heats up quickly and stays warm for a good amount of time, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> In terms of right fit its a five-star but I don&#x27;t get 20 minutes of deep freeze</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom she loves it the velcro is a bonus and long enough to secure it around her!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It is cold, but just cold enough to put directly on my skin.  After 15 minutes, the icing process is finished and it can go back in the freezer!  The Velcro is super-easy to attach and it can actually be used on several body parts comfortably.</li>
            <li> This multi gel hot/cold pack is the best RESUABLE product on the market. After being in an accident 2 years ago and being in agony for months I tried this and being able to use hot or cold is a plus I can&#x27;t refuse. I bought several that way I always has some in the freezer and some ready to be heated. Using is under the Mueller Adjustable Lumbar Back Brace keeps it in place without slipping ever time I move. Can&#x27;t be seen under clothes. I do suggest putting a washcloth or something as putting it directly on skin will be too hot. If you want to keep using disposable hot/cold products that in the long run will run you a bunch of money it&#x27;s your choice. Get your doctor to writ you a script for this product and take it off your medical tax expenses. Hope I&#x27;ve helped someone.</li>
            <li> As Crossfiitter, whenver after heavy lifting like snatch, Clean and jerk, it hurts my lower back often but&lt;br /&gt;Once you put this on your spot, pain will be gone. However, that doesnt mean you are pain free&lt;br /&gt;It just temperature sensory is faster than pain sensory, okay?&lt;br /&gt;so you&#x60;d better get an adjustment first from some good chiorpractor and use this.&lt;br /&gt;Result will be awesome ! I guaranteed !</li>
            <li> It saves your lower back and really helps!</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been over working my back muscles, and this product came at just the right time.  You can heat it up in the microwave or place it in the freezer to have a cold pack.  I personally love the heat.  I often will heat this up in the microwave, wrap it around my lower back, and go back to work without any pain.  This works fast and it works well.  No meds is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no condensation on the pack whether used hot or cold, so you and your clothes don&#x27;t get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who needs a small localized heating pad or cold pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read my full review here:  [...]</li>
            <li> The THERA Pearl Back Wrap surprised me.  I have used a few different types of heating pads, strips and even hot towel treatments to relieve sore muscles after a work out.  What surprised me the most was how long the back wrap retained heat. The flexibility of the of the three sections allows the wrap to conform to your body.  Although I did not test this feature out, I do see how this could be a good asset to assist with abdominal cramps. The black velcro strap is quite sturdy and holds the pack in place.  I fully endorse this product. You will wish you had a wrap when you are in discomfort, sore from a good day&#x27;s exercise routine or miserable from pain.  This wrap functions well to soothe sore back muscles when warm and reduce swelling when need cold.</li>
            <li> SOSO,THE BELT IS NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> Today I revived a Thera Pearl Back Wrap for lower back pain. I have a lot of back pain caused by a ruptured disk. I was amazed at how fast I fell in love with the Thera Pearl Back Wrap. It&#x27;s my new best friend. It eased my back pain almost completely. When I sit down to relax, the Thera Pearl feels so good I just wanna go to sleep. Now when I sit at the computer my back doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It is definitely a product worth having if you suffer from back pain. I love how you can pop it in the microwave for 30-45 seconds to heatproof place in freezer to use as an ice pack. So, therefore you have a two in one deal.this product is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Very very easy and comfortable to use. Much easier to use than a hot water bottle and stays hotter longer.</li>
            <li> If you have back pain, this is a must.  I can walk around and still ice my back.</li>
            <li> It broke after 15 uses.</li>
            <li> For years I used an old icepack that I&#x27;d shove down the back of my shirt and then hope it stayed relatively close to where I wanted it to be. After a crippling bout of bulging disc, I finally sprang for the Therapearl Back Wrap, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The surface area is fairly large, nicely covering my lower back. And with the help of the velcro strap, it stays right where you put it. You can also use it for both cold therapy and heat therapy, so it&#x27;s versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint is with the strap. With every use, the strap winds up bunched up in the corner of the little plastic buckle, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to adjust it to the right size without taking the time to unbunch the whole thing. To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure what they could do to improve the situation, I just know it&#x27;s a wee bit of a hassle. And occasionally you have to knead the little freezer balls from one section to the other to provide an even disbursement of &amp;#34;therapearls.&amp;#34;  But these are minor issues, and overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: 20-minutes max at a time. If you&#x27;re having severe back pain, I&#x27;d stick to cold therapy, at least until things improve, and then alternate between cold and heat. (I&#x27;m not a doctor, I just play one online.)  ;)</li>
            <li> I use this and it works but I would have liked to have paid a little more for it and have more gel in it. You can&#x27;t really tell from the picture but it&#x27;s a little lean on the gel.</li>
            <li> love it, but wished it stayed super cold a little longer.  Does the job though</li>
            <li> I love to use my Back Wrap when I have menstrual cramps. It&#x27;s great because I can strap it on and still get stuff done while it works!! Definitely a must-have for us ladies.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo25O7LV2IO6LDY]]If you&#x27;ve reached your 60s and don&#x27;t have back pain, I envy you. My wife and I both suffer from lower back pain - hers is occasional, mine is chronic due to the residual effects of seven lumbar spinal surgeries. For relief, I prefer heat, but the numbing effects of cold treatment usually last longer. We&#x27;ve both used several types of hot/cold wraps, and the TheraPearl pack is at least as effective as any of them. About one minute in our 700-watt microwave oven heats the pack to a hot enough temperature to be effective. For cold treatment, a couple of hours in the freezer chills the pack enough to remain cold for the recommended twenty minutes. The adjustable velcroed belt works nicely to hold the pack in place. After a few uses, I noticed that some of the pearls had migrated into an adjacent cell, but it was simple enough to squeeze them back into the right cell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: We both found that the pack was more comfortable if we wore a shirt to keep the pack from direct contact with our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your back pain is caused by sore muscles or bruises, the TheraPearl pack should be effective for temporary pain relief and for helping the injured tissues to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: A TheraPearl back wrap was provided to me for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in the US some years ago. It was in all the pharmacies - or a similar version was.&lt;br /&gt;When it popped in the microwave (my fault) I couldn&#x27;t replace it and had to go to amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t it time someone imported them or made a version of it here?&lt;br /&gt;Excellent as you can wander round whilst icing or heating your sore back.</li>
            <li> Love Therapearl packs. The only problem with these is that after 2+ months, they sometimes crack in a spot, and the blue pearls and liquid leak out. I use this daily for knee issues.  They have one specifically for the knee, but sometimes I want the knee cap cooled too.  I have had over 8 of these and each have cracked and leaked.  But I love them. Now I Have taken to saving the blue pearls and putting them in ziplock bags to freeze and use.  This works great also. But I still really like this product. Wish they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no velcro on the end of the straps so you have to tie the loose ends which is awkward. There should be velcro. Also, the plastic sweats so it&#x27;s wet, unlike fabric versions.</li>
            <li> Good item, easy to wear, Would be nice if it stayed colder longer. Suggest anyone buying get so it can be changed every 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had already tried the Therapearl neck wrap and loved it so I knew that this would be perfect for my back sprain I got while lifting too much weight at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a large area which spans my entire width of my back, and radiates a strong but gentle heat after about 40 seconds in the microwave. It feels like a moist heat and penetrates into my muscles, and maintains that heat for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had other wraps you heat in the microwave, but they were lumpy, and the filling would ball up in them and the covering would become rough and tattered. The heat in them would be too hot in the lumps and there would be zero heat in places where the filling had migrated away from that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This remains evenly heated throughout the entire wrap. It never gets too hot, but is just the right temperature, staying that temperature for a full 45 minutes. The covering is a super smooth clear plastic that feels good against the skin, and can be easily rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strap that attaches around my waist is super long and very stretchy, so anyone can get a comfortable fit. This would fit comfortably up to a 50 inch waist or even more. It attaches with velcro. Since this is very lightweight, it stays where I put it without sliding down. I have this up under my shoulder blades, and it stays there feeling weightless, with only that wonderful soothing moist heat penetrating my sore back muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been giving myself about four sessions a day with this and my back is starting to feel much less pain. Those tight aching muscles are finally smoothing out and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ideal moist heat wrap for an aching sore back. For an even more soothing experience I wear this at the same time I wear the neck wrap. Then I put on a guided meditation mp3 for 40 minutes, and have a complete stress relieving interval in my hectic day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a moist heat wrap for a sore back. This is better than a heating pad or any other type of heated wrap I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for a review.back. This is better than a heating pad or any other type of heated wrap I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for a review.</li>
            <li> I have other TheraPearl cold/heat packs and they are wonderful; I only use them for cold, but they work well and they were fully loaded with the pearls.  I chose a 3 star rating on this due to the lack of product inside the 3 cells.  The pearls can move around in the 3 cells, but even when I did this and got it evened out, the all the cells were very much less than half filled with pearls.  It works, but it could use about 2x more pearls than they have in there, which would likely give more cold/heat time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was contacted by a Therapeal representative and was asked about my Therapearl experience, so I told them that I really liked the product, but sent back the back wrap due to leakage.  The rep. was appologetic and offered to send me replacements at no cost.  A couple of days ago I received TWO new and redesigned back wraps - heavier plastic to hold in the pearls and the waist band also redesigned.  I am impressed with the updated design, which includes 6-cells instead of 3 and seems to support a more even distribution of the pearls.  The rep. also sent a Therapearl sports pack (Also redesigned) and the eye cover thingy (Might be something for the wife).  All in all, I am very impressed with the customer service of Therapearl for listening to customers and making a good product even better.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 the Neighbor &amp; She wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it either~ SORRY~ It didn&#x27;t work 4 Me OR my Neighbor!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong about this thing. I picked one up at a local store to help with a back problem. The strap was seemed good, and the plastic seemed to be strong secure. I have had several leaky ice packs in the past, and the elastic or velcro on the straps always tends to wear out quickly. My first impression upon using it was that it did not get as cold as I wanted, and it didn&#x27;t stay cold very long. In under one month of use, it had already sprung a leak, and spewed blue liquid on some of my clothes and my couch. I would return it, but I have already thrown away the original packaging and receipt. Sadly, this thing is useless, and I recommend you avoid it at all costs.</li>
            <li> This might not show up as Verified Purchase yet, but I just purchased a second one of these TheraPearl Back Wraps.  The reason I&#x27;m purchasing another is twofold. First, I need one for the other Knee.  Second, there must be a micro-hole in my original. It looks funny and doesn&#x27;t appear to have as many pearls, although I haven&#x27;t seen any snicking away... and the wrap still works.  MY EXPERIENCE I had partial knee replacement earlier in the year. Lots of pain and swelling in the old mom-knee.  I was lucky that someone loaned me one of the cooling devices; and I wish I had had one from the start.  Don&#x27;t skip that.  I sent it back though and still need cooling, pretty much like what they give you in Physical Therapy.  Even now, after walking the dogs, I still need some cooling and it&#x27;s been months.  I have the Back Wrap and the Knee Wrap and I prefer the Back Wrap and the reason is that it can be adjusted to cool the back of the knee as well as the sides and tops.  In fact, I have found that I can use the straps to keep the wrap in place.  The Knee Wrap works but is better for those that need the cooling below and above the knee.  There is also no cooling over the patella where the incision is.  SUMMARY The Back Wrap works for backs!  I&#x27;ve used it hot and cold and it works fine.  I&#x27;m buying another so that I can cool both knees, if need be, or extend the cooling of the one frankenknee.  I find the Back Wrap to be superior for my knee usage because it cools front and back.</li>
            <li> Use it mostly with cold. Works well in this manner. Works OK with heat also but I have something else for that.</li>
            <li> Love it, great for my back.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  If you enjoy a wet, slimy feeling against your back or clothing - then fine.  But this wrap actually leave a slimy residue on anything it touches.  It also doesn&#x27;t stay cold for longer than 10 minutes. I threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This back wrap is so perfect and comfortable to put on my lower back.  It stays very cold for at least 20 minutes (usually longer).  The strap is comfortable around my back/waist so I can ice while sitting on the couch or working at my desk.  I have not tried it for heat yet, but as an ice pack, it&#x27;s great.  I have also used it for a swollen ankle and the strap is adaptable to wrap around the ankle too.  My first TheraPearl product but won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li> great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to stay cold for long.. But wraps well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my back while pregnant, the strap is big and bulky, I tend to go for the ice pack without the strap more bc this strap annoys me as i lay on this!</li>
            <li> This is a convenient way to attach a hot or cold pack to a sensitive back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: the strap is too large for someone that is size zero -- the velcro has nothing to attach to.</li>
