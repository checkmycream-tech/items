    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The volume control works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think any hearing device is perfect.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, I have found it works just as well as the 5 to 6K models!!</li>
            <li>I am finding using just one for now is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>These work great and saved her thousands.</li>
            <li>In crowded situations I have great difficulty hearing the people close to me.  </li>
            <li>all around happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li>The instructional dvd was good.  </li>
            <li>Purchased one for my mother with good results.  </li>
            <li>Good company.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and it is really good.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>For the price, I recommend trying one for spending a lot more for the name brands-</li>
            <li>Great price and was a fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Love the Tweak..</li>
            <li>I was able to test out.  </li>
            <li>Set up was easy and this product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been especially pleased with the Tweak - after using a much more costly hearing aid and dealing with it&#x27;s limitations, I opted to go with the Tweak when I saw the price and read the many favorable reviews - it is so much easier to use and my wife and I are able to watch television, together, without arguing about the volume - the batteries last about 8-9 days which is better than before&lt;</li>
            <li>Most useful is the function to switch from omni directional to focused-I mostly use focused.  </li>
            <li>With a pair of them, it&#x27;s fairly easy to locate sounds and voices.</li>
            <li>The rocker (one button for everything) system is easy to understand and use without taking the amplifier off the ear.</li>
            <li>Their return guarantee is great and there was no trouble returning it and getting full refund plus they even refunded my postage.</li>
            <li>they are working fine</li>
            <li>The device is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust sound levels.</li>
            <li>just got it - great video to start using - simple - I like it</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good .</li>
            <li>So far this is a good replacement.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the two new hearing devices.</li>
            <li>Bought the second after very good results with the first.  </li>
            <li>I bought it baaed on favorable Amazon customer reviews and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>so it worked OK for movies and speech but did nothing for the higher frequencies.</li>
            <li>I was aware I was hearing much better with the &#x27;Tweaked&#x27; ear.</li>
            <li>and I can adjust it to make what I hear seem more normal.</li>
            <li>This instrument works real well for amplification of all ranges of sound.  </li>
            <li>I only use it when watching TV (can keep the sound lower and still hear it) and it helps most when having a conversation in a crowded place, noisy place (bowling alley, restaurant, etc).</li>
            <li>Working better that the old hearing aid</li>
            <li>When I wear it, sound is crisp and clear, no distortion, and easy to work the controls.  </li>
            <li>For me it is right in the frequency range I needed.  </li>
            <li>I adjusted it to the third sound level and it worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>As good as with my previous $3,000 in the ear hearing aids that eventually gave out.  </li>
            <li>UNITS WERE WELL DESIGNED, COMFORTABLE, BUT ONLY AMPLIFIED THE SOUND</li>
            <li>The personal sound amplifier or Tweak, is a great little device.  </li>
            <li>This is the first PSA I&#x27;ve purchased after I was told that I needed hearing aids.  </li>
            <li>They both function exactly ss advertised</li>
            <li>I suspect I will need real hearing aids at some point, but for now, this is an economical alternative.</li>
            <li>It is not a complicated device.</li>
            <li>The sound is totally natural.</li>
            <li>Now if it will just be reliable and last me for 5 or 6 years I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will help others whose problem is different from mine.</li>
            <li>The one feature I like most is being able to pick a volume setting, something I could not do with more expensive models.</li>
            <li>With the filter on, I can pick out and hear individual voices much better.</li>
            <li>For my use, I have the volume at 3 clicks which gives me a natural sound.</li>
            <li>The size of the amplifier case is fine and is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>The price I believe is fair and has the same quality than a medical device</li>
            <li>and you really HAVE to hear.</li>
            <li>The choice of either Omni-Directional sound (from behind and in front of you) or Directional sound (the focus on sound coming from in front of you).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>but now I can even understand the fast talking weather lady.  </li>
            <li>It is much bigger than the hearing aid, but this is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely have to use a hearing aid and do not have the desire to spend a fortune on  them.  </li>
            <li>I was blown away by how much I could hear with the hearing aid</li>
            <li>Great product my father was having a hard time with his hearing and with this equipment heÂ´s back into the conversations.</li>
            <li>They feel natural enough that I have stepped into the shower twice without removing them, but fortunately I remembered before they got soaked.</li>
            <li>I wanted an aid to boost just the high frequencies.</li>
            <li>In my case, I have lost my ability to hear high frequencies, and Tweak restores some of that loss.</li>
            <li>It is very simple to use and care for and Really Work!!</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this hearing aid.  </li>
            <li>My hearing loss is normal for guys my age who grew up with rock and roll music.  </li>
            <li>I keep them on the lowest setting, because the higher settings created a bit of an echo like being in a big concrete pipe.</li>
            <li>Opening the battery compartment to shut off the device makes sense because then when you use one of the dry and store devices toprotect your investment and insure the device is clean when you put it back on, you will also be certain no moisture is on the battery or in the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>want to commend the Customer Service and technical support of the firm - they have been outstanding and came to my assistance when I thought I&#x27;d goofed the unit up - I would highly recommend the Tweak to anyone in need of enhancing their hearing ability</li>
            <li>; I have severe hearing loss, and have found a whole new world that I have not heard in many years, I would strongly suggest anyone try these before you spend an outrageous amount on the so called &amp;#34;hearing aids&amp;#34; I would also suggest you purchase these with an amazon credit card as I did and have received and 1 yr warranty free from the credit card.</li>
            <li>I recently had a hearing test which found normal high range loss for may age.</li>
            <li>My wife says they are nearly invisible, and she thinks they are reducing the number of times I have to ask her to repeat things.</li>
            <li>This seems to blend the amplified sounds with what I could hear naturally.</li>
            <li>I really think they are about the same thing with the inflated price to pay for the audiologists overhead.</li>
            <li>my 90 year old mother has come alive with this device.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with feedback, and in fact, have not incurred any problems so far.</li>
            <li>It appears to boost the higher frequencies just enough to make it easier to distinguish the consonant sounds, but not enough to cause feedback squeals.</li>
            <li>So After careful research I selected one Tweak based on consistent information in reviews; functionality; size; and price.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>AND I STILL HAD DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING SOME CONVERSATION DUE TO LOSS OF HEARING AT THE HIGHER FREQUENCIES.  </li>
            <li>I like the neatness and barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The clearly written instructions helped me easily slip the battery in; click the listening tube onto the head of the amplifier case; place it behind my ear and insert the tube into my ear canal.</li>
            <li>It is like all these devices, it has trouble in crowd situations, but the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I could have demanded they sell me a pair at the agreed amount but, at this point, I was so discouraged that I dropped the entire process, deciding that the hearing aide industry is a big scam with way overpriced products that offered less than stellar results.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>

            <li> My only complaint is it&#x27;s tendency to whistle if my hand gets too close, probably a little more than the expensive</li>
            <li> Carefully reading the instructive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of buying another one and doing away with my &amp;#34;hearing aid.&amp;#34; for the other ear.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t doing well with it because it was unbalanced with my other ears hearing.</li>
            <li> When I tried Tweak for only $250, it was not sophisticated but it worked in terms of amplifying and help my hearing.  </li>
            <li> I was hard on them and shortly after the warranty expired I trashed one and lost the other.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I decide to go a less expensive route and purchased a single Tweak to improve my hearing.  </li>
            <li> I tried 3 separate very expensive brands with marginal success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using the little plastic baffles that can be attached to the tube that goes in the ear.</li>
            <li> Which was less than $1,000 on pairs that were being offered by the Audiologist at 5 to 6K!  </li>
            <li> but as I send them out of USA, I guess it will be too late under the return policy.</li>
            <li> the programming to switch from omnidirectional to directional microphones and back is awkward</li>
            <li> Last year, I had a terrible experience with the medical hearing aide business.</li>
            <li> also I purchased the serene innovations (was very reasonable in price also) hearing aid dryer, moisture is the worst thing for these devices....</li>
            <li> Still struggling with not great hearing, I purchased one of these just to see.</li>
            <li> unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Any adjustments to my expensive aid must be completed by my hearing specialist.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have a $2500 hearing aid in my really bad ear</li>
            <li> I hate to imagine what I&#x27;ve missed ....</li>

            <li> I bought two of them and send to to my grandmoms, both of them heard nothing but just some wind like noise. I wish to return them but as I send them out of USA, I guess it will be too late under the return policy.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  I adjusted it to the third sound level and it worked fine for me.  The volume control works perfectly.  It is like all these devices, it has trouble in crowd situations, but the price is right.  I am thinking of buying another one and doing away with my &amp;#34;hearing aid.&amp;#34; for the other ear.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over existing overpriced hearing aides.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the two new hearing devices.</li>
            <li> This is the first PSA I&#x27;ve purchased after I was told that I needed hearing aids.  They both function exactly ss advertised and I&#x27;m glad I got these and not a more expensive type.  Most useful is the function to switch from omni directional to focused-I mostly use focused.  Set up was easy and this product is outstanding.  I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of these. My wife says they are nearly invisible, and she thinks they are reducing the number of times I have to ask her to repeat things. I keep them on the lowest setting, because the higher settings created a bit of an echo like being in a big concrete pipe. It appears to boost the higher frequencies just enough to make it easier to distinguish the consonant sounds, but not enough to cause feedback squeals. They feel natural enough that I have stepped into the shower twice without removing them, but fortunately I remembered before they got soaked. With a pair of them, it&#x27;s fairly easy to locate sounds and voices. I&#x27;m not using the little plastic baffles that can be attached to the tube that goes in the ear. This seems to blend the amplified sounds with what I could hear naturally. I suspect I will need real hearing aids at some point, but for now, this is an economical alternative.</li>
            <li> I like the neatness and barely noticeable.  Still getting accustom to the noise level, volume very low at its highest.</li>
            <li> helped with my hearing a lot and did not cost an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;even got one for my brother-in law. and he likes it too.</li>
            <li> My mom needed hearing aids but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on them.  Found these online and took a chance.  I helped her try them on and set them up.  The instructional dvd was good.  She was amazed that she could now hear the water flowing in the nearby fish tank.  These work great and saved her thousands.</li>
            <li> its not a refined hearing aid, its just an amplifier. unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Initially purchased two for myself at two separate times.  Bought the second after very good results with the first.  As good as with my previous $3,000 in the ear hearing aids that eventually gave out.  Purchased one for my mother with good results.  Ordered the second at her request.  Both still doing well with them.  Thank you for you product.</li>
            <li> Great product my father was having a hard time with his hearing and with this equipment heÂ´s back into the conversations. The price I believe is fair and has the same quality than a medical device</li>
            <li> This instrument works real well for amplification of all ranges of sound.  Both upper and lower frequencies.  The focus model lets you adjust volume.  It also lets you turn off the rear microphone so you don&#x27;t hear all the sound from behind you.  I use it for watching TV and plays and public events.</li>
            <li> works well would buy again</li>
            <li> just got it - great video to start using - simple - I like it</li>
            <li> This product works quite well for me. I bought it baaed on favorable Amazon customer reviews and am not disappointed. Customer service is top notch. Don&#x27;t think any hearing device is perfect.</li>
            <li> UNITS WERE WELL DESIGNED, COMFORTABLE, BUT ONLY AMPLIFIED THE SOUND AND I STILL HAD DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING SOME CONVERSATION DUE TO LOSS OF HEARING AT THE HIGHER FREQUENCIES.  THEY DO AMPLIFY WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE ADVERTISED TO DO BUT I HAD TO RETURN THEM SINCE MY UNDERSTANDING OF CONVERSATION PROBABLY REQUIRES A HEARING AID.</li>
            <li> I wanted an aid to boost just the high frequencies. 5k and above. This aid boosted what seemed to be the midrange so it worked OK for movies and speech but did nothing for the higher frequencies. Their return guarantee is great and there was no trouble returning it and getting full refund plus they even refunded my postage. Good company. Good product. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who continually ask &amp;#34;what did he or she say?&amp;#34;, or to the one I am talking with, &amp;#34;what&amp;#34;? I have perfected the art of pretending to hear what someone is saying by nodding my head in such a way people think I am hearing them. I discovered last week in my French class that these methods will not work anymore especially when studying a foreign language and you really HAVE to hear. So After careful research I selected one Tweak based on consistent information in reviews; functionality; size; and price.&lt;br /&gt;My Tweak arrived yesterday, two days after ordering it. The clearly written instructions helped me easily slip the battery in; click the listening tube onto the head of the amplifier case; place it behind my ear and insert the tube into my ear canal. I WAS AMAZED!  It was like when your eye sight is corrected and you suddenly see the individual leaves on the trees! The big test was French class today. Voila! I could hear the professeur and my fellow students clearly!&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons I chose Tweak:&lt;br /&gt;1. Comparing the differences between the Tweak Focus and the other similar top-rated PSA&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;2. Carefully reading the instructive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;3. The two speaker system: The choice of either Omni-Directional sound (from behind and in front of you) or Directional sound (the focus on sound coming from in front of you).&lt;br /&gt;4. The Rocker adjustment system.&lt;br /&gt;5. Size of the amplifier and &#x27;the look&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;6. You can order one Tweak that can be used in either ear.&lt;br /&gt;7. Price.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU TWEAK!&lt;br /&gt;My hopes and expectations were all exceeded ...  It is not a complicated device. The provided DVD and written instructions couldn&#x27;t be clearer. The sound is totally natural. The rocker (one button for everything) system is easy to understand and use without taking the amplifier off the ear. Opening the battery compartment to shut off the device makes sense because then when you use one of the dry and store devices toprotect your investment and insure the device is clean when you put it back on, you will also be certain no moisture is on the battery or in the battery compartment. The size of the amplifier case is fine and is barely noticeable. I don&#x27;t feel it behind my ear nor am I aware of the tubing and tip in my ear canal.&lt;br /&gt;Its been a long, long time since I&#x27;ve heard what is being said. I hate to imagine what I&#x27;ve missed .... If you&#x27;ve been thinking about this order one.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Immediately after French class today I ordered a second one. I was aware I was hearing much better with the &#x27;Tweaked&#x27; ear.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Used it about 2 months. I have a $2500 hearing aid in my really bad ear but I needed something for my left ear also. This was a lot cheaper. Any adjustments to my expensive aid must be completed by my hearing specialist. I wasn&#x27;t doing well with it because it was unbalanced with my other ears hearing. Got the tweak and I can adjust it to make what I hear seem more normal. Now if it will just be reliable and last me for 5 or 6 years I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> It did not work for my hearing problem.  I&#x27;m sure it will help others whose problem is different from mine.</li>
            <li> So far so good . But to soon to give it five stars. Had the 6000$ hearing aids for years. I was hard on them and shortly after the warranty expired I trashed one and lost the other. So far this is a good replacement. The one feature I like most is being able to pick a volume setting, something I could not do with more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I recently had a hearing test which found normal high range loss for may age. Tried 2 different brand hearing aids for a few days and decided they didn&#x27;t make enough difference to spend $2000 to $3000 each for them. I decided to see if one of these did anything. To my surprise, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the expensive brands. I only use it when watching TV (can keep the sound lower and still hear it) and it helps most when having a conversation in a crowded place, noisy place (bowling alley, restaurant, etc). With the filter on, I can pick out and hear individual voices much better. For the price, I recommend trying one for spending a lot more for the name brands- I really think they are about the same thing with the inflated price to pay for the audiologists overhead.</li>
            <li> For me it is right in the frequency range I needed.  As with all aids takes a week or so for the brain to adjust to the sounds but now I can even understand the fast talking weather lady.  Great price and was a fast delivery.  Have recommend it to friends. Would have given it five stars but the programming to switch from omnidirectional to directional microphones and back is awkward should you want to turn that feature off.  Directions say you can adjust volume in that mode but that is not the case for the one I have.</li>
            <li> Love the Tweak..my 90 year old mother has come alive with this device. It is very simple to use and care for and Really Work!!</li>
            <li> The device is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust sound levels.</li>
            <li> Working better that the old hearing aid I had  Get a little feedback occasionally - not enough to be a problem...</li>
            <li> It worked well enough. I had a Wydex hearing aid ($3,500 for just one). I lost it. When I tried Tweak for only $250, it was not sophisticated but it worked in terms of amplifying and help my hearing.  It is much bigger than the hearing aid, but this is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this hearing aid.  I absolutely have to use a hearing aid and do not have the desire to spend a fortune on  them.  I read about the tweak and tried it and it is really good.</li>
            <li> Last year, I had a terrible experience with the medical hearing aide business. I have insurance that covers the cost of hearing aides. So I contacted an approved audiologist. I tried 3 separate very expensive brands with marginal success. Then, once the insurance claim was filed, I discovered that it did pay 100 percent.......of the ALLOWABLE! Which was less than $1,000 on pairs that were being offered by the Audiologist at 5 to 6K!  The audiologist office should have known this going in. I could have demanded they sell me a pair at the agreed amount but, at this point, I was so discouraged that I dropped the entire process, deciding that the hearing aide industry is a big scam with way overpriced products that offered less than stellar results.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward several months. Still struggling with not great hearing, I purchased one of these just to see. What could I lose at that price?  To my pleasant surprise, I have found it works just as well as the 5 to 6K models!! I am finding using just one for now is perfect for me. My only complaint is it&#x27;s tendency to whistle if my hand gets too close, probably a little more than the expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;One final caveat. My hearing loss is not profound at this point so I don&#x27;t need a lot of help. As a Therapist, whose job is listening, I find I struggle with probably 20 to 30 percent of my clients.</li>
            <li> I have the focus model which I prefer to use in noisy mode. For my use, I have the volume at 3 clicks which gives me a natural sound. I only have one Tweak, but when I have another $200+, i will probably buy a second one. In my case, I have lost my ability to hear high frequencies, and Tweak restores some of that loss. I have had no problems with feedback, and in fact, have not incurred any problems so far.</li>
            <li> The personal sound amplifier or Tweak, is a great little device.  My hearing loss is normal for guys my age who grew up with rock and roll music.  In crowded situations I have great difficulty hearing the people close to me.  I recently was evaluated at a hearing clinic where hearing aids were suggested.  The hearing aids presented were in the $1300 to $2400 range.  I was blown away by how much I could hear with the hearing aid I was able to test out.  Long story short, I decide to go a less expensive route and purchased a single Tweak to improve my hearing.  It did the trick.  I haven&#x27;t worn it a lot, but I would have this problem with any type of hearing aid I might purchase.  When I wear it, sound is crisp and clear, no distortion, and easy to work the controls.  You have to remove the battery if you want to turn it off, but it is not a big hassle.</li>
            <li> bought these units about 30 days ago, wanted to try them before I paid 4000.00 for &amp;#34;hearing aids&amp;#34; I have severe hearing loss, and have found a whole new world that I have not heard in many years, I would strongly suggest anyone try these before you spend an outrageous amount on the so called &amp;#34;hearing aids&amp;#34; I would also suggest you purchase these with an amazon credit card as I did and have received and 1 yr warranty free from the credit card. they are working fine and I am very happy with them. also I purchased the serene innovations (was very reasonable in price also) hearing aid dryer, moisture is the worst thing for these devices....I use the dryer every night when I take them out...all around happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been especially pleased with the Tweak - after using a much more costly hearing aid and dealing with it&#x27;s limitations, I opted to go with the Tweak when I saw the price and read the many favorable reviews - it is so much easier to use and my wife and I are able to watch television, together, without arguing about the volume - the batteries last about 8-9 days which is better than before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to commend the Customer Service and technical support of the firm - they have been outstanding and came to my assistance when I thought I&#x27;d goofed the unit up - I would highly recommend the Tweak to anyone in need of enhancing their hearing ability</li>
