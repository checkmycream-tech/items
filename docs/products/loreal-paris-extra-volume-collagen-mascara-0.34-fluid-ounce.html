            <li>but it is a good product while you have it...</li>
            <li>Good buy....</li>
            <li>This is another good mascara and it makes my eyelashes look good.</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
            <li>It is cheap but very good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Clean beautiful result</li>
            <li>I have always liked L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for my lower lashes and when I do want to wash it off, it comes off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it could stay like it does when newly opened</li>
            <li>Your eyelashes stay soft but look great!</li>
            <li>I have used so many products and this is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara and plan to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>The product itself seems to be pretty good</li>
            <li>and it comes off easily</li>
            <li>The brush is so important in separating lashes</li>
            <li>Its overall application, along with its great great value, keeps me coming back to it!</li>
            <li>Great colors, lasts long and makes your eyelashes appear fuller with no clump.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>but the one I received wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>This was very clumpy and did not stay on more than an hour before it flaked off.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this mascara from L&#x27;Oreal because they make such good mascara.</li>
            <li>(like I do) and it rarely flakes.</li>
            <li>It really does give much volume to your lashes!</li>
            <li>It creates a dramatically full effect like no other mascara out there.</li>
            <li>the mascara won&#x27;t stick to itself very well and gets clumpy, and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll start to see flakes.  </li>
            <li>This brush is real &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; and does just that.  </li>
            <li>It gives my lashes a real boost and makes them look even longer.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and typically won’t need any reapplication throughout the day.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend this mascara because it goes on smoothly for one coat, stays on very well, and it seems to thicken the lashes without making them feel dry or too crispy.</li>
            <li>And it comes off easily with those make-up remover wet wipes.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara because it isn&#x27;t clumpy at all, but has a way of making my lashes look extremely full and long.  </li>
            <li>Love I use all the expensive products and this is 100x better than Dior.</li>
            <li>The first few times I wore this mascara some many people asked my what did I do differently to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used many more expensive brands that doesn&#x27;t equal the quality of this one.</li>
            <li>This product definitely focuses more towards the volume side and less on the length of lashes.</li>
            <li>Only lasts about 3 weeks.... dries out fast</li>
            <li>I really like the Loreal Paris Extra Volume Mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it is thick but doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>I love to build up my lashes really thick</li>
            <li>Yes this and the non waterproof make my thin eyelashes become nice and fool.</li>
            <li>I really like the dramatic look and if I want a thinner coat I use one that’s has mostly ran out to comb my lashes through.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had this particular mascara not too long (about a month or two) and it&#x27;s seemed to have dried out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Can cause clumps if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I like the ability to apply a second coat to my lashes occasionally for a more dramatic look.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I also like the amount of coverage, not too thin, and it curls my lashes up so my eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible problem with mascara smudging under my eyes and have tried lots of brands.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed, I will never order the brand again!</li>

            <li> Can cause clumps if you are not careful. Only lasts about 3 weeks.... dries out fast but it is a good product while you have it...just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara because it isn&#x27;t clumpy at all, but has a way of making my lashes look extremely full and long.  The best thing about this mascara is that, although it&#x27;s not waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t smear even if you do have rather watery eyes (like I do) and it rarely flakes. It&#x27;s really great for my lower lashes and when I do want to wash it off, it comes off cleanly.  One thing I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that it&#x27;s really hard to apply a second coat for some reason.  I like the ability to apply a second coat to my lashes occasionally for a more dramatic look.  While my lashes don&#x27;t feel hardened by this and they are still flexible and soft, if I try to do a second coat a few minutes (or a few hours) later, it&#x27;s like the mascara won&#x27;t stick to itself very well and gets clumpy, and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll start to see flakes.  Also, I&#x27;ve had this particular mascara not too long (about a month or two) and it&#x27;s seemed to have dried out rather quickly.

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a mascara to give your eyes a \\&quot;pop\\&quot; this it! The first few times I wore this mascara some many people asked my what did I do differently to my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried similar products from other brands and I never have the same results. Of course, I gave the mascara all the credit. I really love this mascara and plan to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it is thick but doesn&#x27;t clump. It only takes one coat and you&#x27;re done. And it comes off easily with those make-up remover wet wipes.</li>
            <li> I really like the Loreal Paris Extra Volume Mascara! It really does give much volume to your lashes! I also like that it contains collagen. Another plus with this mascara is the fact that it isn&#x27;t waterproof, but it stays on so well. I love to build up my lashes really thick and this mascara does the job! I also got this mascara cheaper online than compared to my local drugstore. The price was great and the shipping was fast! Good buy....</li>
            <li> Clean beautiful result no smudging no lashes sticking together and it comes off easily</li>
            <li> This mascara is great! I have used so many products and this is by far one of the best. It goes on very easily and typically won’t need any reapplication throughout the day. This product definitely focuses more towards the volume side and less on the length of lashes.

            <li> I have always liked L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s mascara. It gives my lashes a real boost and makes them look even longer. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes and this mascara is the best I have tried, it will cover the hair perfectly and will give to your eyes the volume that you are looking for!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara i&#x27;ve ever owned. I have a terrible problem with mascara smudging under my eyes and have tried lots of brands. Even a silicone primer. This is the best no-smudge mascara I&#x27;ve used. I also like the amount of coverage, not too thin, and it curls my lashes up so my eyes look bigger. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems to be pretty good but the one I received wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> This was very clumpy and did not stay on more than an hour before it flaked off. Very, very disappointed, I will never order the brand again!</li>
            <li> very good product , super !!!!! thank you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just a makeup snob but this mascara doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I am trying to economize and cut back on frivolous spending so a $30 mascara falls into that category. But this is the second mascara from amazon that became clumpy almost immediately. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years. It is cheap but very good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this mascara from L&#x27;Oreal because they make such good mascara. This is another good mascara and it makes my eyelashes look good.</li>
            <li> Great colors, lasts long and makes your eyelashes appear fuller with no clump. I got this for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Yes this and the non waterproof make my thin eyelashes become nice and fool. Great stuff</li>
            <li> This is great mascara for the price.  I have used many more expensive brands that doesn&#x27;t equal the quality of this one. Your eyelashes stay soft but look great!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara! It creates a dramatically full effect like no other mascara out there. It would be perfect if it could stay like it does when newly opened but I use it for a couple of months before buying a new one without having too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Love I use all the expensive products and this is 100x better than Dior.</li>
