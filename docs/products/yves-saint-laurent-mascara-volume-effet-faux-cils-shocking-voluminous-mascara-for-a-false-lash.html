            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase it just because for the amount of money this product is I was hoping it was going to be phenomenal</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to buy designer makeup, buy for a reputable store and not on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Chanel is my favorite</li>
            <li>With just a little bit it makes my lashes darker, longer, and more voluminous and on top of that it smells awesome!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>But after I learned how to use the brush and got more comfortable with applying it, I cannot use anything else.</li>
            <li>Got this product super fast and was happy with every aspect of the order.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, never clumpy.</li>
            <li>It also washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>Not melts, and is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to get off with remover.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fabulous product --</li>
            <li>The only mascara that makes my nonexistent lashes look great.</li>
            <li>have used this product many times it never fails to make my eyes look lovely---it goes on smooth as silk</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is totally worth your money!</li>
            <li>Okay I&#x27;m giving this product 5-stars because it is an amazing product, however, for the price there is just so many other comparable mascaras out there.</li>
            <li>Just prepare to pay full price.  </li>
            <li>Also, pretty easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I really liked this initially.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a great mascara I would recommend Mally and it costs less!</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure the seller gave me old mascara.  </li>
            <li>Creates nice long eyelashes, but noticed mascara flaking by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Love it...........makes my lashes look so long and full.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely going to be using more of Yves products.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get much better even after several uses.</li>
            <li>Granted, it was slightly better than the cheap Maybeline mascara I had been using, it was not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Very nice thick mascara that does not clump up.  </li>
            <li>lashes are so long and black, and it is so easy and quick to use - just one minute and your lashes are so long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Mine run out/dried up really</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and smells like roses.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I look like I have eyelashes as I did when I was young!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it does take a few minutes to dry, but it does a great job of lengthening lashes and pumping up the volume.</li>
            <li>but that is really the only make up I wear.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful not to put too much on</li>
            <li>I use bare essentials lash builder under it.</li>
            <li>The formula is okay, but its poorly made.</li>
            <li>Not worth the price, no dramatic results.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I did not like the brush because it looks messy and clumpy.</li>
            <li>Was dry and felt old and clumpy.</li>

            <li> Was dry and felt old and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but stays on your eyes and not below it, easy to remove</li>
            <li> I have used YSL Volume Effet Faus Cils almost 10 years and tried many less expensive mascaras; all fall short in some way.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look so long, they almost appear as if they could be fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for that really long look, you can apply another layer.</li>
            <li> more!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to get dry...</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a knock off, or and old product, but it is dry and clumpy...not at all like the stuff I used at Saks.  </li>
            <li> Ive used other mascara brushes with it</li>
            <li> It is very wet tho which I do like a lot.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> one swipe works to produce dark long-looking lashes and even gives lashes a little curl.  </li>
            <li> The price is shocking for how many uses I got out of it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dried out or flaky.  </li>
            <li> It was clumpy and dried out in just a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does both makes them long and thick!</li>
            <li> I will buy this again even though it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Extremely clumpy and the brush is AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Who needs false eyelashes with this mascara!!</li>
            <li> and im still disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a person who use to wear fake lashes almost every day!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I agree with everyone else here! This mascara is hands-down, the best on the market! I have tried loads and loads of different mascaras, but now I have found the best! I even recommended it to a friend and she loves it as well! It does everything you want a mascara to do!---&gt;lengthen, volumizes, does not clump, does not smudge or flake!! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to spend almost 40.00 on a tube of mascara but that is really the only make up I wear. I have short lashes and not the best volume so I wanted a mascara that made my eyes pop. I put it on and I was so impressed in how my eyes looked. I have to be careful not to put too much on or it looks a bit clumpy but I am so use to going over and over my lashes with mascara. The smell of rose from the tube is just heaven. I am definitely going to be using more of Yves products. BRAVO!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different mascara&#x27;s but I have to say that this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used! With just a little bit it makes my lashes darker, longer, and more voluminous and on top of that it smells awesome! Got this product super fast and was happy with every aspect of the order. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I use bare essentials lash builder under it. It stays all day! Makes my lashes look gawwwwwwgus! This is coming from a person who use to wear fake lashes almost every day!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Fabulous product -- one swipe works to produce dark long-looking lashes and even gives lashes a little curl.  Doesn&#x27;t get dried out or flaky.  Also, pretty easy to remove.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing. One coat makes my lashes darker, longer, and more voluminous. Bonus: it smells great! Easy to apply, never clumpy. Great for sensitive eyes.I have used YSL Volume Effet Faus Cils almost 10 years and tried many less expensive mascaras; all fall short in some way.</li>
            <li> Was dry and felt old and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. The only mascara that makes my nonexistent lashes look great.</li>
            <li> Who needs false eyelashes with this mascara!! I look like I have eyelashes as I did when I was young! Does both makes them long and thick! Love love</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! When I first got it, I did not like the brush because it looks messy and clumpy. But after I learned how to use the brush and got more comfortable with applying it, I cannot use anything else. It gives you body and volume! It is totally worth your money!</li>
            <li> This is really great mascara!  I like the thickness my eyelashes achieve and it lengthens too.  It also washes off easily.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! The best ever..&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are so long and black, and it is so easy and quick to use - just one minute and your lashes are so long and beautiful. I recommend this item. Tnx. Alina</li>
            <li> Clumpy. Doesn&#x27;t get much better even after several uses.</li>
            <li> have used this product many times it never fails to make my eyes look lovely---it goes on smooth as silk</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, no dramatic results.  If your looking for a great mascara I would recommend Mally and it costs less!</li>
            <li> Clumpy going on. Flakey coming off. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I really liked this initially. However, it just doesn&#x27;t last. Mine run out/dried up really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Shocking? The price is shocking for how many uses I got out of it!</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;m giving this product 5-stars because it is an amazing product, however, for the price there is just so many other comparable mascaras out there. It is a great mascara but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase it just because for the amount of money this product is I was hoping it was going to be phenomenal but it&#x27;s just like a drugstore mascara. It is very wet tho which I do like a lot. Just not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> YSL exceeded expectations once more!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to get dry... But it gives you a femme fatale look</li>
            <li> Creates nice long eyelashes, but noticed mascara flaking by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t feel that should happen with such a pricey mascara.</li>
            <li> Very nice thick mascara that does not clump up.  Expensive, but stays on your eyes and not below it, easy to remove</li>
            <li> I loved a sample of this I got from Sephora and ordered on here and I am pretty sure the seller gave me old mascara.  It was clumpy and dried out in just a couple of weeks.  Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Extremely clumpy and the brush is AWFUL! it doesnt fan eyelashes or give them volume. The formula is okay, but its poorly made. Ive used other mascara brushes with it and im still disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever!! The eyelashes are awesome! Eyelashes like doll. Not melts, and is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascara and this is my favorite.  It goes on nicely without getting all clumpy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having sampled it at a Saks makeup counter.  Not sure if this is a knock off, or and old product, but it is dry and clumpy...not at all like the stuff I used at Saks.  Granted, it was slightly better than the cheap Maybeline mascara I had been using, it was not worth the cost.  If you are going to buy designer makeup, buy for a reputable store and not on Amazon.  Just prepare to pay full price.  Chanel is my favorite and I will be going to purchase some soon.</li>
            <li> Love it...........makes my lashes look so long and full.  Easy to get off with remover.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another one when I need it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had. All of the YSL mascara&#x27;s are. I have tried about 50 different mascaras and I worship this one. It is very creamy and smells like roses. It makes my eyelashes look so long, they almost appear as if they could be fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for that really long look, you can apply another layer. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and lush mascara.  My lashes look great with no clumping. I will buy this again even though it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best YSL mascara I have tried. As other reviewers have said, it does take a few minutes to dry, but it does a great job of lengthening lashes and pumping up the volume. It also stays in place all day, without smudging or flaking. Love it!</li>
