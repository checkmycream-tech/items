            <li>This set was very pretty.</li>

            <li>They look very cute with a pink ribbon on them</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks seller!</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase these again :-)</li>
            <li>At first I thought....</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Kleancolor</li>
            <li>I bought the 12 set of pinks and the mixed set of neon colors as well as the set of 6 pastels and the top coat, garlic nourishing coat and bottom coat.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how smoothly it glides on my nails.</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors and</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved them and even told me later on that the nail polish actually worked really well.</li>
            <li>The bottles very decent size</li>
            <li>Covers most of my needs for pink.</li>
            <li>Really like the colors, and the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>love all the pink colors</li>
            <li>The guests really like the colors.</li>
            <li>I am telling everyone who asks, where I got them, thanks .</li>
            <li>Ordered for gifts, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li>The colors and various types of polish are nice: shimmery, glitter, solid colors.</li>
            <li>Love all the Pink!</li>
            <li>Polish does not hold up very well under normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li>Has a whole new color wardrobe.</li>
            <li>I liked having the different shades of pink.</li>
            <li>If you love the color PINK, as I certainly do -- then you will love this set of nail polishes, in 12 different shades of pink, including a couple with glitter!  </li>
            <li>The regular colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed by this brand.. even if you don&#x27;t use the glitter, you still have at least six full size bottles of color for such a small price.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is fun that you get such a variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty colors and stays on a long time</li>
            <li>My girlfriend love&#x27;s them and all the different shades of pink .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 5 of the colors so far</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, the nail polish dries quicker than I expected, and the surprising part for me was that it didn&#x27;t chip as fast as some other expensive polishes.  </li>
            <li>The glitter stays in the bottle and you only get clear polish instead.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry well at all- smudging and rippling even with drying for an hour.</li>
            <li>A few that I know used the polish and said it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li>allow to dry completely before applying next coat...</li>
            <li>How could I get so much for so little?</li>

            <li> The regular colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this brand.. even if you don&#x27;t use the glitter, you still have at least six full size bottles of color for such a small price.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It is fun that you get such a variety of colors.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty colors and stays on a long time</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love&#x27;s them and all the different shades of pink .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 of the colors so far</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, the nail polish dries quicker than I expected, and the surprising part for me was that it didn&#x27;t chip as fast as some other expensive polishes.  </li>
            <li> The glitter stays in the bottle and you only get clear polish instead.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry well at all- smudging and rippling even with drying for an hour.</li>
            <li> A few that I know used the polish and said it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li> allow to dry completely before applying next coat...</li>
            <li> How could I get so much for so little?</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was broken and got all over the inside of the packaging and many of the other bottles.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this as a party favor but not if you want a long lasting polish.  </li>
            <li> Does not stay on long at all.</li>
            <li> It wears long....</li>
            <li> and I have long nails.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this brand again in the other colors they sell.</li>
            <li> It does not go on evenly and applying a second coat is a mess because it seems like it never dries.  </li>
            <li> great seller but terrible nail polish.</li>
            <li> A boost to my pink collection.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor polishes are inexpensive but I need to use them carefully .Most</li>
            <li> Of course we had a pink theme</li>
            <li> Still get clumpy wet results.</li>
            <li> a few are really pretty, but some are too similar to each other and the chunky glitters are a little tough to apply.</li>
            <li> I added small pink nail file and tied them together with white ribbon.</li>
            <li> I will be checking out some other kleancolor products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to see if any other shades are offered.</li>
            <li> Made me feel it had been on the shelf a little while</li>
            <li> I garden everyday</li>
            <li> Lasts no more than a few days/one week.</li>
            <li> I felt the nail polish was a little thick which caused some streaking.</li>
            <li> I usually buy &amp;#34;Essie or O.P.I.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but my daughter said her plain pink polish was very thin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like permanent glue hard to remove and chip.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quality of the polish is poor.</li>
            <li> everyone went crazy for them.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s just bad.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed with the sparkle colors.</li>

            <li> Covers most of my needs for pink. Don&#x27;t need all the shades. Wish they were individually available but there is one shade I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere! Thanks seller! Daughter likes some so great</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love&#x27;s them and all the different shades of pink .</li>
            <li> Bought this for baby shower gifts... Perfect. Everyone loved them and even told me later on that the nail polish actually worked really well. Happy customer. For around a $1.00 a gift how can you beat it.</li>
            <li> Fun colors! Perfect for party favors!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors! They are going to make great stocking stuffers! The order came in earlier than the estimated shipment date. Very happy</li>
            <li> A boost to my pink collection. Kleancolor polishes are inexpensive but I need to use them carefully .Most important : always apply thin coats...allow to dry completely before applying next coat...use a top coat. Not a slap it on and go polish! but if you have the patience, it will give you a very nice look.</li>
            <li> Love it fast delivery</li>
            <li> Loved all the colors!!!!! Everything was perfect</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful. Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Bought as favors for a baby shower. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Ordered as baby shower gifts.  I haven&#x27;t used them, but they made the perfect gift and worked out to be extremely inexpensive per person.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> I like the Kleancolor brand but am not the biggest fan of the selection of these pinks- a few are really pretty, but some are too similar to each other and the chunky glitters are a little tough to apply.</li>
            <li> I like the colors but the polish chipped after one day being on my nails.  Also, polish had leaked out of 3 of the bottles while being shipped.</li>
            <li> No nail file was included. I ordered 3 but no nail file....</li>
            <li> Used them for a girl baby shower favors, everyone loved them. The price was right, but didn&#x27;t like the $10.00 S&amp;H charge.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shower gifts!</li>
            <li> I felt the nail polish was a little thick which caused some streaking. Made me feel it had been on the shelf a little while</li>
            <li> Great but, pretty colors, good price!</li>
            <li> Love it! although one bottle broke in the box and stained the rest. All in all is worth it.</li>
            <li> great! was great way to get great colors and gave as party favors and leftovers I kept and still use!</li>
            <li> If you love the color PINK, as I certainly do -- then you will love this set of nail polishes, in 12 different shades of pink, including a couple with glitter!  They are very pretty, and also durable. Not only does the polish stay on your nails -- they are also good for painting crafts. (Nail polish is great for painting and decorating so many items.)  This set is also a great way to try out a certain color of pink, or great for sharing some with daughters or sisters.</li>
            <li> All the colors are amazing</li>
            <li> gave as favors for daughters bridal shower with the emery boards 6 dozen bulk and everyone thought it was a great idea. Of course we had a pink theme so worked well</li>
            <li> (Katie G.)I purchased the nail polish for a bridal shower and they were a big hit. I had these for a favor. I added small pink nail file and tied them together with white ribbon. They&#x27;re nice vibrant colors everyone went crazy for them. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth. I will definitely purchase these again :-)</li>
            <li> Love the colors of the nail polishes, ordered these as favors for a baby shower.  I would have rated this as a 5 star.....but when I opened one of the nail polish the smell was very strong.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for favors at my baby shower and they were a hit!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but you pay for what you gets. Does not stay on long at all.</li>
            <li> At first I thought....12 bottles at such a low price?  Must be crummy stuff.  Boy was I wrong!  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Kleancolor and I&#x27;ll never buy another brand again.  I bought the 12 set of pinks and the mixed set of neon colors as well as the set of 6 pastels and the top coat, garlic nourishing coat and bottom coat.  Absolutely wonderful product.  It wears long....I garden everyday and I have long nails.  This product stays on for about two weeks.  No chipping or cracking at all.  Shipping and packaging was great and arrived on time.  I definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for baby shower favors. The colors and various types of polish are nice: shimmery, glitter, solid colors. I had two left over and tested them out. Unfortunately the quality of the polish is poor. It does not dry well at all- smudging and rippling even with drying for an hour. It does not go on evenly and applying a second coat is a mess because it seems like it never dries.  I tried again using a quick drying top coat. Still get clumpy wet results.</li>
            <li> The color variety was great, however the nail polish chips easily. Lasts no more than a few days/one week.</li>
            <li> Really like the colors, and the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> Great deal!  Love the bundle package.  The colors are pretty, the nail polish dries quicker than I expected, and the surprising part for me was that it didn&#x27;t chip as fast as some other expensive polishes.  I usually buy &amp;#34;Essie or O.P.I.&amp;#34; nail polish and the polish chips on me either the same day I painted my nails or the next day.  This polish lasted 3 1/2 days for me before it chipped.  I would definitely buy this brand again in the other colors they sell.</li>
            <li> This set was very pretty. I liked having the different shades of pink. These were given as baby shower gifts, and were a hit.</li>
            <li> Well protected during the shipping and all of the colors were amazing. Thank you</li>
            <li> Sent to my mom for Mom&#x27;s Day.  She loves it.  Has a whole new color wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with them ! Great buy thanks so much !!!</li>
            <li> Ordered these as favors for a baby shower. Great assortment and guests loved them.</li>
            <li> These shipped perfectly and ahead of schedule! These will be a great addition to a baby shower favor.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Stays on my fingers along time. I use my hands a lot at work. It&#x27;s like permanent glue hard to remove and chip. I will be checking out some other kleancolor products.</li>
            <li> USED AS A BABYSHOWER FAVOR AND EVERYONE LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> Okay, I was leary about this. How could I get so much for so little? Yes, there are glitter ones included.. but I think they can be fun. The regular colors are very pretty. The no shimmer ones cover in one coat. I was so surprised at how smoothly it glides on my nails. I am very impressed by this brand.. even if you don&#x27;t use the glitter, you still have at least six full size bottles of color for such a small price.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids use them and they say some colors are fine and work great, others are too dry. I haven&#x27;t looked for a way to remedy this so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s just bad.</li>
            <li> I used these as a baby shower gift. All the ladies really loved them. A few that I know used the polish and said it stayed on pretty well. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used these as baby shower favors and they were a hit. Besides the ones with the confetti-like stuff in them, they went over wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just got my polish from kleancolor I luv my pinks is my favorite color my packages was so secure I had no leaks and no broken polishes I had order some more polish kleancolor</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors but it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> Polish does not hold up very well under normal wear and tear. Had to re apply after just doing dishes.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of colors just what she wanted</li>
            <li> I purchased these as favors for a baby girl Baby Shower and the guests loved them!</li>
            <li> The glitter polishes don&#x27;t work well.  The glitter stays in the bottle and you only get clear polish instead.  The pink colors are great for a child and with the mommy.  I was able to share the colors with my child.  I was just disappointed with the sparkle colors.</li>
            <li> There all nice colors and all came in good condition. And I also Got the nail file</li>
            <li> love all the pink colors</li>
            <li> These are see-through gel colors and I liked them very much.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a baby shower.  They are a nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> two thumbs up!!! Arrived complete, good condition, and fast.</li>
            <li> Great color choices. I bought this for a baby shower- it was great as a party gift.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors ! Loved it.. Great baby shower favors.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors and some are surprisingly sparkly! I really like these colors great to give someone as a gift for birthday or Christmas or sweet sixteen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Transaction and delivery time.. Excellent! I love the colors..</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The shades look somewhat different than shown in photo.</li>
            <li> I found one bottle I liked.  They were way too shiny and metallic.  The one I loved was a see thru rose color.  It was worth the price of the set, but the rest were given away.</li>
            <li> Used as a baby shower gift. The guests really like the colors. I haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to use as a baby shower thank you.  It is fun that you get such a variety of colors.  The only issue was that the shipping packaging was inadequate. One of the bottles was broken and got all over the inside of the packaging and many of the other bottles.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors were very cute and useable, there was one or two that could have been a little better. All in all they worked great. We used them as favors for my baby shower.</li>
            <li> The price fits the quality of nail polish. It chips easily.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy, I  have received more compliments on the colors, just eautiful.  I am telling everyone who asks, where I got them, thanks .</li>
            <li> For a dollar a polish, this is a great deal.  I ordered 24 polishes.  Two arrived with polish on the outside of the bottle but I used a cotton swab and polish remover and clean it up real easy.  I decorated the bottles and gave them away in a baby shower.  Everyone loved the party favor.  The quality of the polish is ok.  My sparkle polish went on nice and smooth but my daughter said her plain pink polish was very thin.  For a dollar a bottle, I don&#x27;t complain.  I would recommend this as a party favor but not if you want a long lasting polish.  :)</li>
            <li> The nail polish came quickly and the colors are beautiful! Such a nice assortment for a girl baby shower!</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors and stays on a long time,good buy.I do have to say,the sparkle colors take alot of polish remover to get off!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell nor the way it chips.</li>
            <li> These were used as baby shower favors! My guest loved it, and the color choices were perfect!</li>
            <li> Ordered for gifts, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted. I would definitely order them again. They were for a baby shower.</li>
            <li> It had wonderful colors. My daughters loved them!</li>
            <li> The more I use these polishes the more I love them! Highly recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great colors and amazing price for all 12 colors, perfect for a baby shower gift. Can&#x27;t wait to make them!</li>
            <li> Great selection. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Using them to repair an item.  Love the colors</li>
            <li> Love all the Pink! Very pretty colors!</li>
            <li> Nice-sized bottles of polish.  Using as shower favors.</li>
            <li> does not have nice finish</li>
            <li> These are the beat quality nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t believe how low they are priced. I&#x27;ve used 5 of the colors so far and I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase! I&#x27;m going to see if any other shades are offered. Love these</li>
            <li> Baby shower door prizes. They look very cute with a pink ribbon on them</li>
            <li> used these as a filler for a party favor. The bottles very decent size and they were packaged well for shipping.</li>
            <li> great seller but terrible nail polish.</li>
