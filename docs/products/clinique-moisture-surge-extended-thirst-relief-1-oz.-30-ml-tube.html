            <li>Item exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Great travel size of a product I use everyday.</li>
            <li>It smoothes on easily,  is instantly absorbed, and leaves a lovely surface for applying   makeup or (if in neck area) just feeling soft and enriched.    </li>
            <li>Just love it~~ it releases the dryness of skin in early spring.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and have not found many things that leaves you feeling refreshed and shower clean.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for travel</li>
            <li>I put it on right before makeup.</li>
            <li>the real deal!</li>
            <li>Since first time I bought,  I will use it first.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT just the same tho.  </li>
            <li>You can immediately put the  top back on the tube to save it from drying out.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be using you again. :)</li>
            <li>They sent me a FREE 1oz tube of the Clinique mild liquid facial soap with my order.</li>
            <li>Great stuff but very small amount.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one final   trick for this or any product: always, but always, feather upwards from   chest to chin - don&#x27;t give gravity any more help than it naturally has!</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>she really likes.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and it is excellent on dry skin especially in this winter weather which has been so hard on the skin.</li>

            <li> Having moderate skin, I can only guess that someone with excessively   dry dermis might not find this sufficiently moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Better buy a travel size from a major store, it is less expensive and they keep track of expiration dates for their products.</li>
            <li> and I noticed an immediate improvement in problem dry skin areas on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination to dry.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin for being on Accutane</li>
            <li> I wish I could find a larger bottle because I&#x27;m having to buy several small ones at a time.</li>
            <li> the younger you are, the less you probably need.  </li>
            <li> but this only helped slightly.</li>
            <li> really out of my surprice,  very small tube,  less than my expectation.  </li>
            <li> There is no odor and no wetness left a few seconds after application.   </li>
            <li> My wife has used it for years and still prefers it to other marketed items.</li>
            <li> This product hydrates but does not leave you feeling weighted down, &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; or greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since it IS clinique, it is a bit more expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and a little bit goes a long way (at least for me).</li>
            <li> and I find a little does go quite a way.  </li>
            <li> I use my fingertips for application and they are also left completely  dry in mere seconds, so no searching for a rag or tissue to mop off   excess...</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion is very thin, I don&#x27;t think much is needed to do the trick nor is it difficult to apply to larger areas because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube is so small and I am afraid it will not last.</li>
            <li> Mine was 6 months past expiration.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to purchase it as often as I&#x27;d like to.  </li>
            <li> Just received and was disappointed with the size....seems expensive for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> I am not  easily impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid of product being greasy and/or clogging my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a   spring chicken</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite moistuizer for the winter months. Nothing works as well as this does.</li>
            <li> Love it. This cream has an amazing light texture while at the same time feels super moist. My skin drinks it in and feels great.</li>
            <li> the real deal! came in a glass jar im so happy! saved a ton</li>
            <li> wow i love this product and this is a great price!</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feels very fresh and hydrated. I needed a good moisturizer and this did the trick! I wish I could find a larger bottle because I&#x27;m having to buy several small ones at a time. Oh well! It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was expired. You should call Clinique and provide them with the code on the tube, they will let you know the expiration date for it. Mine was 6 months past expiration. It is also marked as &amp;#34;not for individual sale&amp;#34;. Better buy a travel size from a major store, it is less expensive and they keep track of expiration dates for their products.</li>
            <li> Only used this product one time and I noticed an immediate improvement in problem dry skin areas on my face. I almost never get immediate results from anything I buy. My only complaint is that the tube is so small and I am afraid it will not last. But, if you only use in the specific problem areas, this might get you by. Also, the lotion is very thin, I don&#x27;t think much is needed to do the trick nor is it difficult to apply to larger areas because of the consistency. I hope it lasts because when it is gone, I definitely plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> This product feels so good on my face.  Very refreshing and clean feeling.  I will order a bigger size next time</li>
            <li> Great travel size of a product I use everyday.</li>
            <li> really out of my surprice,  very small tube,  less than my expectation.  Since first time I bought,  I will use it first.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for travel</li>
            <li> This clinique moisture surge extended thirst relief is FANTASTIC!!!  Unfortunately, since it IS clinique, it is a bit more expensive so I&#x27;m not able to purchase it as often as I&#x27;d like to.  LOVE IT just the same tho.  Will absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am not  easily impressed. This is the best moisturizer I have purchased. I have a jar on order, it works</li>
            <li> Just received and was disappointed with the size....seems expensive for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best. It is a bit pricey so to get the travel/sample sizes for cheap was great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid of product being greasy and/or clogging my skin.  With Moisture Surge, there&#x27;s no fear of that.  It smoothes on easily,  is instantly absorbed, and leaves a lovely surface for applying   makeup or (if in neck area) just feeling soft and enriched.    I use my fingertips for application and they are also left completely  dry in mere seconds, so no searching for a rag or tissue to mop off   excess... there simply isn&#x27;t any need.  You can immediately put the  top back on the tube to save it from drying out.  Having moderate skin, I can only guess that someone with excessively   dry dermis might not find this sufficiently moisturizing.  Also just a   guess:  the younger you are, the less you probably need.  I&#x27;m not a   spring chicken and I find a little does go quite a way.  There is no odor and no wetness left a few seconds after application.   Just lovely feeling skin.  I wish I could afford a larger size, as this is   not inexpensive (my rationale for 4 of 5 stars only).  Oh, and one final   trick for this or any product: always, but always, feather upwards from   chest to chin - don&#x27;t give gravity any more help than it naturally has!</li>
            <li> Really good daytime moisturizer. I put it on right before makeup. Lasts all day without that oily feel, and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems when I apply my foundation. I just wait about 2 minutes after I apply the moisturizer then apply my foundation. Perfect every time.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. It is perfect for all types of skin and provides quenching moisture. It contains no oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out cost and size.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but very small amount. It&#x27;s very light but has wonderful coverage. Next time will order the larger jar.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the competitive price on this :-)&lt;br /&gt;Unbeatable, unimaginable when compared with Stores !&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good price !!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has been the most effective for my skin in terms of balancing different needs. All you need is a dab and you are good to go. Great with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just love it~~ it releases the dryness of skin in early spring. My skin is combination to dry. Then it is perfect for me. My skin never cracks any more. It is a good news for me to find out this product.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but did not give the amazing relief I expected for the price. I have incredibly dry skin for being on Accutane but this only helped slightly.</li>

            <li> I have been using the moisturizer for a week and am very happy with it. It is great under makeup and at bedtime. I only bought 1 ounce as I wanted to see if I liked it and am happy to say I do.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and it is excellent on dry skin especially in this winter weather which has been so hard on the skin.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for years and still prefers it to other marketed items. Something about it she really likes.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use all Clinique Moisture surge extended thirst relief products.  What else can I say?  Glad to know if this product.</li>
            <li> Of all the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried this one is by far the best. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and a little bit goes a long way (at least for me). I have dry, sensitive skin, so my face absolutely loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say a HUGE thank you to KL Design &amp; Import. They sent me a FREE 1oz tube of the Clinique mild liquid facial soap with my order. Thanks guys!! Will definitely be using you again. :)</li>
            <li> This was incredibly overpriced.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I got it for the girlfriend and she&#x27;s happy! I&#x27;m glad I got another order or I&#x27;d have been in the dog house...</li>
            <li> Does what it says, and is prtecting my skin well from the ravages of this year&#x27;s savage Boston winter.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described! Very fast shipping! Great experience, great price!  This is the only product I can use on my face without any break out... Great product and again can&#x27;t beat the price here!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was happy to find it in a small convenient size for travel.</li>
