            <li>It&#x27;s worked better than I could have ever hoped for.</li>
            <li>TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]], that lots of guys recommended as a way to fight acne and razor bumps and gave it a try with the acne wash.    </li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that the same brand, has this</li>
            <li>:) one should give it a try.</li>
            <li>A great acne wash as my face feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is high quality product, and the energy contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li>(60ml)]] that I read works really well on razor bumps, and I&#x27;m happy to report that this is absolutely true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m gonna give it more time and try it during better weather to see if my cons are true or not.</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon, ordered it, and the delivery was quick and the shipping was (my favorite) free!</li>
            <li>This stuff is WAY more effective than the regular Neutrogena acne wash that most people buy.</li>
            <li>TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li>This product leaves the skin smooth, grease-free and irritation.</li>
            <li>But so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how to best write a review for soap.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dry my face out or irritate it, and it smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday....smells awesome and is the only thing that works with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna use this in the spring when the weather is better and see if it&#x27;s really the acne wash or the wind.</li>
            <li>So I bought it and from the first washing, my face started immediately clearing up!</li>
            <li>I, like most guys, decided to start working on my acne much later than my teens, when I realized how easy it is to take care of it rather than ignoring the problem.</li>
            <li>Fresh cologne smell</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li>I have been using this every day and although it hasn&#x27;t done much to the existing acne, it has prevented for the most part any new outbreaks to occur</li>
            <li>Try this first.</li>
            <li>I got a recommendation from one of my boys on using this wash, and in addition to helping with my adult acne, he said it would also help with my razor bumps if I kept my skin clean.    </li>
            <li>It cleans my face, so I guess it pretty much works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>My razor bumps are all but gone thanks to this, and I&#x27;m sporting a really clean and clear face.</li>
            <li>I tried the wash for two weeks and it worked well, but I still had a bit of acne that kept forming in certain spots.</li>
            <li>IT HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a man, like me, and you have tried absolutely everything.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I normally just use a bar of soap to scrub my face in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much for the acne.</li>
            <li>just ok, feels ok only makes my face feel dry for hour or 2 not real change</li>
            <li>The order was shipped quickly, but when I opened the shipping container I noticed that both bottles were split open and had spilled out into the shipping package.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this if you are having an issue with acne.</li>
            <li>Also helps clean your hands after a long day of digging, climbing, etc.</li>
            <li>I just wish they included a little more because I did pay 10 dollars for this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since the time i was about 13 years old, and it really got out of hand when i was around 20.</li>
            <li>But overall I feel like I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Which isn&#x27;t normal for me.</li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite face wash and we are having trouble locating it in stores.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin super dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>The acne wash kept me clean on a daily basis, while the exfoliator gave me a deep clean every few days.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this, it doesn&#x27;t even clear breakouts.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The old Men&#x27;s Face Clearing Face Wash was less drying due to a lower Salicylic Acid content, but this one is effective if used only once per day.</li>
            <li>, i barely ever have a blemish anymore.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful I found this product and if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve tried everything else and feel like nothing will ever work, especially if you have sensitive and oily skin, BUY THS</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>

            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li> This however, cleared up my acne and acne behind my head and neck where most of my acne were in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this product as long as it is shipped as loosely as it currently is.</li>
            <li> They last a damn long time.</li>
            <li> but it can leave your face dry</li>
            <li> but my face is sometimes really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> Been using alongside a moisturizer (for dry skin) once to twice a day</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t leave my face that dry at all.</li>
            <li> Gave me dry skin for a week then my face adapted and is my everyday facial cleaner...awesome.</li>
            <li> I was having some weird, stress- or hormone-related breakouts that were really unpleasant/cystic/inflamed, so I spent TONS of money on several fancy acne washes from Sephora and DermStore.</li>
            <li> works well and not much of a smell  boys like it.</li>
            <li> (I&amp;#34;ll be back to update this in a few months).&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s harder for me to notice acne disappearance</li>
            <li> the price doubled that is not cool not cool at all double the price</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin leaving it flakey, and it actually had a slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extreme acne or anything</li>
            <li> I have a family history of bizarre skin conditions, one of them being really bad acne.</li>
            <li> The wash wakes me up in the morning and calms me down in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a pro-active regimine or any other product.</li>
            <li> so I use a little bit of an acne moisturizing cream afterwards, not for severe acne</li>
            <li> Maybe ill try it again in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry, but for now it&#x27;s definitely not a recommended product.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> Not scented to heavily</li>
            <li> A little cheaper than the store but one of the covers was broke and peles on them and made am mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is the acne wash or the winter wind here in Wisconsin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it works for acne.</li>
            <li> (I wash twice a day and whenever my face is oily for the past month and</li>
            <li> Because of my cons being questionable I&#x27;m gonna give it a five star until further notice.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product as far as i can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like how it doesn&#x27;t really sud up because that can be annoying.  </li>
            <li> I mean, everything, even girl products to get rid of acne, and it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 years now and it not only cleared up my bad acne</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t remember the last time i had a bad break out.</li>
            <li> I get down and dirty</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how well this stuff works, and I try not to take my clear skin for granted because I remember how awful my life became when i never wanted to leave the house because of my terrible skin.</li>
            <li> For 2-3 years my life was basically ruined by terrible acne and I tried hundreds of store products, and even got prescription stuff from my doctor and tried Proactive (which is HORRIBLE if you have sensitive skin, it will just make it worse).</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of trying accutane and risking the bad side effects that come with that when my mom bought this neutrogena stuff for me on a whim.</li>

            <li> My son uses this. It has been great for his face.</li>
            <li> the price doubled that is not cool not cool at all double the price</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. This product actually made my skin worse. It dried out my skin leaving it flakey, and it actually had a slight burning sensation. It wouldn&#x27;t have been that big of a deal if it had worked, but it didn&#x27;t work. It actually made me breakout on my forehead. Maybe ill try it again in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry, but for now it&#x27;s definitely not a recommended product.</li>
            <li> I was having some weird, stress- or hormone-related breakouts that were really unpleasant/cystic/inflamed, so I spent TONS of money on several fancy acne washes from Sephora and DermStore. They kind of helped...but then one day I was in the grocery store and saw this Neutrogena mens acne wash....I&#x27;m a woman, but I thought, what the heck? So I bought it and from the first washing, my face started immediately clearing up! And the smell is divine! This stuff is WAY more effective than the regular Neutrogena acne wash that most people buy. This stuff is magic!!!</li>
            <li> works well and not much of a smell  boys like it.</li>
            <li> Fresh cologne smell but it can leave your face dry so I use a little bit of an acne moisturizing cream afterwards, not for severe acne</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a friend who has an acne problem.  I would have prefered to purchase one at a time to ensure that it worked before investing in two (2) tubes at a time.  But so far, so good.  My friend is quite pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> seems to be working... i guess lol</li>
            <li> The order was shipped quickly, but when I opened the shipping container I noticed that both bottles were split open and had spilled out into the shipping package. I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this product as long as it is shipped as loosely as it currently is.</li>

            <li> A great acne wash as my face feels clean and fresh. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t really sud up because that can be annoying.  The smell is nice as well.

            <li> Burned the area around my nose.  I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.  Don&#x27;t buy this, it doesn&#x27;t even clear breakouts.</li>

I went back to the inter webs and found this exfoliator  [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]], that lots of guys recommended as a way to fight acne and razor bumps and gave it a try with the acne wash.    The results were absolutely amazing. The acne wash kept me clean on a daily basis, while the exfoliator gave me a deep clean every few days. The exfoliator shrunk my existing pimples and reduced the redness that I found. The best thing about it is that the same brand, has this oil[[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)]] that I read works really well on razor bumps, and I&#x27;m happy to report that this is absolutely true. My razor bumps are all but gone thanks to this, and I&#x27;m sporting a really clean and clear face.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. It&#x27;s really effective for acne and for blemishes . It&#x27;s been a week, I m using dis product and I m happy with the results :) one should give it a try.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to best write a review for soap. It cleans my face, so I guess it pretty much works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Check the ingredients and you will see that this product is in fact 100% Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash inside (nothing is different at all- they just rearranged the order of the ingredients).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a man, like me, and you have tried absolutely everything. I mean, everything, even girl products to get rid of acne, and it doesn&#x27;t work... well you need to try this. Let me say, I&#x27;m a man. I don&#x27;t have an office job. I get down and dirty so I have sweat, dirt, dust, etc. built up. I normally just use a bar of soap to scrub my face in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much for the acne. This however, cleared up my acne and acne behind my head and neck where most of my acne were in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing, it isn&#x27;t sold in Target or any department stores in my area anymore. Thank you Amazon for having this. I bought 2 of these incase they ran out. They last a damn long time.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product as far as i can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- it smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;- the pack of two is a steal of a deal, regular moisture wash at Walmart is $9 for one. This pack of two acne wash is $9.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons?:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is the acne wash or the winter wind here in Wisconsin but my face is sometimes really dry and flaky. Which isn&#x27;t normal for me. I&#x27;m gonna use this in the spring when the weather is better and see if it&#x27;s really the acne wash or the wind. (I&amp;#34;ll be back to update this in a few months).&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it works for acne. I don&#x27;t have extreme acne or anything so it&#x27;s harder for me to notice acne disappearance but still i don&#x27;t see any visible change in acne. (I wash twice a day and whenever my face is oily for the past month and a half).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna give it more time and try it during better weather to see if my cons are true or not. Because of my cons being questionable I&#x27;m gonna give it a five star until further notice. I&#x27;ll be back to update this later.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this is the ONLY product that has worked for me. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a pro-active regimine or any other product. Try this first. I even use it as a shampoo. Since I work outdoors, it gets rid of all the dirt. Also helps clean your hands after a long day of digging, climbing, etc. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either. But again, what works for me, may not work for you.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite face wash and we are having trouble locating it in stores. Hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the energy contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
            <li> It is not oily, smells good, good product.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday....smells awesome and is the only thing that works with my sensitive skin.  Gave me dry skin for a week then my face adapted and is my everyday facial cleaner...awesome.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good deal</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this. Makes your skin super dry and itchy. Doesn&#x27;t treat breakouts</li>
            <li> Been using alongside a moisturizer (for dry skin) once to twice a day and it works great. Not scented to heavily</li>
            <li> A little cheaper than the store but one of the covers was broke and peles on them and made am mess!</li>
            <li> This product leaves the skin smooth, grease-free and irritation. It has a pleasant smell and it is easy to remove. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t leave my face that dry at all. The wash wakes me up in the morning and calms me down in the evening before bed. I would highly reccomend this if you are having an issue with acne.</li>
