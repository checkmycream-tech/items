    <ol>
            <li>so the mask is the best thing for that.</li>
            <li>it feels great to sleep again</li>
            <li>For the price I paid this is great.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Im happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I Love It.!</li>
            <li>I love this mask, it was a good price, and I&#x27;ve been sleeping much better since I got it.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Keep looking for better quality</li>
            <li>okay -</li>
            <li>Next time you fly, ask for an eye mask...might be better quality than this.</li>
            <li>through if you look into light, which you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing if you&#x27;re trying to sleep anyway.</li>
            <li>Really cheap material</li>
            <li>and it let&#x27;s a lot of light in, there is no point in even wearing it.</li>
            <li>Not overly comfortable, but it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Got it for my boyfriend since he&#x27;s a light sleeper.</li>
            <li>light can still leak in.</li>
            <li>Its light weight and comfortable on the face and stays on while you sleep.</li>
            <li>Cheap as anything for the price they&#x27;re charging plus shipping.</li>
            <li>The cut out for the bridge of the nose should be higher on this mask, which would make it more effective, but overall it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Nice enough, price</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s in some light, but overall for a quick and cheaper method for covering your eyes at night and keeping out light</li>
            <li>its exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Soft, fits well on the face and certainly does the job of keeping the light out.  </li>
            <li>straight,</li>
            <li>My whole life I could never sleep with the lights ANYWHERE and was always awoken due to light.</li>
            <li>Better option than the expensive ones that are so huge and bulky for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, and the two straps in the back keep it stable.</li>
            <li>Do not purchase this item, go into CVS and grab one of these cheap items for a few dollars, this is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>wish they had one with girly eyelashes or other funny designs.</li>
            <li>but at least the shipping was free.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Soft, fits well on the face and certainly does the job of keeping the light out.  Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Sleep masks really do help if you have trouble falling&lt;br /&gt;and staying asleep, especially if you wake up often.&lt;br /&gt;These appear carefully well made; stitching is even&lt;br /&gt;and straight, not quickly done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> it feels great to sleep again</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s ok.  Don&#x27;t care for the smell of the material, can&#x27;t get rid of it.  Will purchase again, if needed.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it was a good price, and I&#x27;ve been sleeping much better since I got it. The only thing is you have to be careful about the bands.</li>
            <li> Works well! I use it every night! (I like to sleep in)</li>
            <li> My whole life I could never sleep with the lights ANYWHERE and was always awoken due to light. Once I found this I thought I finally have to try it and I Love It.! I sleep with it every night and probably couldn&#x27;t sleep without it now.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Let&#x27;s in some light, but overall for a quick and cheaper method for covering your eyes at night and keeping out light it works.  I like that it&#x27;s not bulkly and I can just stuff it under my pillow.  Better option than the expensive ones that are so huge and bulky for me.</li>
            <li> I orderd the chespest blk masj i cld find and it does the job. The elastic is a little snug, but i stretched it out, pulling on it . Thankfully it didnt break. Maybe i hav a big head?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a pajama themed party because it was inexpensive and matched the pajamas I had. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, and the two straps in the back keep it stable. It&#x27;s see-through if you look into light, which you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing if you&#x27;re trying to sleep anyway.</li>
            <li> These are the same type you get on an airline. Certainly not worth the price but at least the shipping was free. Thin and the straps will stretch out and not not fit if you got a big head. Keep looking for better quality but I have nothing against the selller.</li>
            <li> Really cheap material and it let&#x27;s a lot of light in, there is no point in even wearing it.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid this is great.  Not overly comfortable, but it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend since he&#x27;s a light sleeper. It does what it suppose to do but according to my boyfriend it made the area around his eyes itchy.</li>
            <li> The cut out for the bridge of the nose should be higher on this mask, which would make it more effective, but overall it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Nice enough, price okay - but like all other sleep masks, this was too binding AND light can still leak in. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great and I use it every day. I work at night and sleep during the day so the mask is the best thing for that.</li>
            <li> Great. Its very basic and that is all you need when it comes to a mask for sleep. Its light weight and comfortable on the face and stays on while you sleep.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this item, go into CVS and grab one of these cheap items for a few dollars, this is a complete rip off. Cheap as anything for the price they&#x27;re charging plus shipping. Next time you fly, ask for an eye mask...might be better quality than this.</li>
            <li> Im happy with this purchase. its exactly what i was looking for. wish they had one with girly eyelashes or other funny designs.</li>
