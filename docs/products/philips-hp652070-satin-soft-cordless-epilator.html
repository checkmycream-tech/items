            <li>This may be the best epilator I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>For the price, best epilator I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Philips makes wonderful products and this one won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>My hair is probably thinner since those days, but I am really happy with this one!</li>
            <li>The job takes longer and the result is not the best.</li>
            <li>With some limitations, this is the best epilator</li>

            <li>This epilator is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The idea of owning a razor that works like a tweezer is very attractive, as I could not imagine spending time to tweeze any hair except my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on my underarms!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good epilator but not the best I’ve ever used.  </li>

            <li>Very good epilator.</li>
            <li>Would make an ideal gift.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully on the legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I greatly prefer corded epilators to cordless epilators.  </li>
            <li>Great for using to remove undesired hair growth on calves, underarms, leg and thighs.</li>
            <li>If it is, then this unit is great.</li>
            <li>If it is, then this unit is great.</li>
            <li>One of the extremely great things about this cordless is there’s no cord to get in the way as you change positions to move around your leg.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Not so great on my legs.</li>
            <li>cordless aspect is very nice, although you have to charge it fully before you can use it.  </li>
            <li>Very good product :)</li>
            <li>ergonomics of this epilator are really good.  </li>
            <li>, the massage attachment fit onto the Satinelle perfectly.</li>
            <li>, the massage attachment fit onto the Satinelle perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dollar for dollar, the two epilators are fairly closely matched.</li>
            <li>It sounded good in the ad, so I got it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Though it removes hair fairly well</li>
            <li>Though it removes hair fairly well</li>
            <li>Great product :-)</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this Epilator.  </li>
            <li>It works great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this thing is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The product is light and portable and makes for a great gift.</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my hand.  </li>
            <li>This is wet/dry as you probably want if you want to pamper your legs with warm water as you use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is rechargeable, which is really nice - no changing batteries or dangling cords.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for use, almost painless.</li>
            <li>It’s nice that this epilator is more portable in that you’re not chained to the wall while you’re using it.</li>
            <li>I also have a bright light over my bathroom mirror, so the location works well for me.</li>
            <li>I epilated pubic hair once on my own with the Satinelle, then got a wax, and epilated once more after that.</li>
            <li>Great purchase thanks!</li>
            <li>From an inspection of the hair that it did get, it looked like most of them were pulled out from the root.  </li>
            <li>He said the massage attachment sort of spread out the pain and made it more bearable.</li>
            <li>He said the massage attachment sort of spread out the pain and made it more bearable.</li>
            <li>it needs another row of tweezer wheels and definitely more power.</li>
            <li>So I have epilated my legs and armpits for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is like a row of tweezers pulling many hairs at one time.  </li>
            <li>It mostly does the job.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Arrived at Prime 2-day shipping accidentally, I&#x27;m guessing because my roommate has Prime :)</li>
            <li>love the fact that it is cordless, and rechargable</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The head on the epilator is wider than the Panasonic epilator, so I cover more area, but I think the Panasonic might have just a bit of an edge when it comes to pulling some of those tougher hairs because it has two roller heads that work in tandem.</li>
            <li>Whether the hurt is just a kind of light sting</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s more like itch</li>
            <li>This model has two settings (most do).  </li>
            <li>This is mostly a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s wet/dry</li>
            <li>:).  </li>
            <li>Underarms have to be done more often probably because of the texture of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>A winning product from Philips.</li>
            <li>Also the price is pretty good compared to the overpriced Braun epilators and their performance</li>
            <li>The price seems pretty good, assuming it holds up well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take it outside with me in the summer and get some vitamin D while I smooth my legs in the best light!</li>
            <li>Awesome seller, product arrived super super fast :-)</li>
            <li>, if you are not prone to ingrown hairs and do not have sensitive skin, this may work great.</li>
            <li>The Braun was fantastic at knees and calfves; the Remington better under the arms.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it&#x27;s as easy to take off as it is to put</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the head is easy.  </li>
            <li>the head is easy.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to hold on to while using.  </li>
            <li>I have liked it very much.</li>
            <li>even with full charge, it seemed to be more noise than anything.</li>
            <li>This thing mechanically rips out your hair, and is pretty effective at it...</li>
            <li>This epilator is pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I confess that I broke the first rule in the product information booklet and used the epilator on more than just one person.</li>
            <li>It takes many sweeps to remove the hairs compared to shaving which is quick and reliable.</li>
            <li>any event, this is a nice unit and will certainly see plenty of use.</li>
            <li>It gives smooth results with no fuss, no pain.</li>
            <li>I’ve epilated his back before, but he is by no means an experienced epilator like I am, so he’s not accustomed to the discomfort of it.</li>
            <li>I’ve epilated his back before, but he is by no means an experienced epilator like I am, so he’s not accustomed to the discomfort of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also comfortable to hold without causing hand cramps.  </li>
            <li>Therefore it can be (and is) more powerful than ones that can also be used on the face.  </li>
            <li>It might be useful if you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, to be sure you&#x27;re holding it in the correct position--it should be at a 90° angle to your leg, not tilted like a razor--but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>The question you have to ask is, &amp;#34;Is getting smooth, hairless, skin that lasts about 2 weeks before another use&amp;#34</li>

            <li>Even after the light stops blinking indicating it’s fully charged you can switch it on until you unplug it.  </li>
            <li>It is also very noisy and not the kind of noise that inspires confidence in how it is working.</li>
            <li>I was able to go so fast!</li>
            <li>This Epilator is so much better than the one I first got in</li>
            <li>Both are worth their price!</li>
            <li>I originally had the Philips corded epilator, which is about $20 cheaper.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the upgrade!</li>
            <li>Honestly, the hassle of making the sugar solution put me off it after a while, so I normally just shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do my epilating right by the sink so that the hairs that come out are gathered into an area that is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>epilator is for the most part the best one I&#x27;ve tried, though I&#x27;ll admit that I get the best overall results by using this one first then switching back to my old one for a quick pass over the same areas.  </li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE the little Satinelle, its a wonderful and efficient machine as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and</li>
            <li>I had hoped that it would also work under my arms, but it didn&#x27;t have much luck pulling many of those thicker, coarser hairs out.  </li>
            <li>That might not be true for a woman with finer body hair than a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fairly coarse darkish hairs, fair skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She likes the cordless feature, but I much rather be able to remove all the hair than having a cordless epilator.</li>
            <li>It ran full strength until it stopped.  </li>
            <li>My favorite epilator is the Emjoi AP18 which has more than double the number of tweezing heads than this epilator</li>
            <li>It works but it&#x27;s kind of the same result and pain of the cheap version of it</li>
            <li>The second time was more like - now I remember why I haven&#x27;t done this more often</li>
            <li>two main differences with this one and others I have owned is that this one comes with a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; attachment (a plastic piece that goes over the top of epilator and has two wavy strips that \\&quot;massage and sooth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It was my very first epilator, and I&#x27;d never waxed before-</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and fine, blonde hair that ranges from basically clear in some spots to light brown in others.</li>
            <li>Recommended for those with a high threshold for pain and/or experienced with using epilators only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using an epilator, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>This baby does both very well, and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It will rip out a good number of hairs on a single run.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;startling&amp;#34; at first to have hairs yanked out by the roots!  </li>
            <li>do like this better than sugaring, although it seems to me to be less effective in terms of hairs ripped.</li>
            <li>I thought it really just got in the way and prevented the head of the epilator from smoothly rolling over my skin.</li>
            <li>When the light stops flashing it’s fully charged and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>It’s definitely a different kind of pain than waxing.  </li>
            <li>It did far better with getting all the finer, thinner hair on my arms.  </li>
            <li>want to get my adult daughter who has more hair on her legs to also try it</li>
            <li>(you might be surprised, I find that legs hurt WAY more than bikini area)</li>
            <li>since graduated from lower legs to underarms, and now also full brazillian hair removal (both underarms and pubic area bled the first time for me).</li>
            <li>Made for the woman, this device provides &#x27;stain soft&#x27; and memorable experience.</li>
            <li>min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I also tried to use this product on my face and was treated to a weeks worth of</li>
            <li>For us it wasn&#x27;t worth getting used to the pain</li>
            <li>; worth it?</li>
            <li>; worth it?</li>
            <li>Worth to buy.</li>
            <li>It is loud, but most of these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The massage attachment is supposed to make it a more gentle experience - because I&#x27;ve used another epilator, I haven&#x27;t tried that attachment, but really question if any yanking of hair by the roots can be classifed as gentle!  </li>
            <li>Hey, there is no shame in that, right?</li>
            <li>different is that the top of the epilator is not open (as in others that I have owned allow you to get a brush in all around the most important part of the machine).  </li>
            <li>It didn’t work well on any of the three areas, mostly because the epilator was skipping across the wet skin and wasn’t gripping the hairs very efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The upside of this is that 90% of the time my legs are suitable for public viewing</li>
            <li>This fine epilator (hadn&#x27;t heard that word much before this) works very well.</li>
            <li>I love the little travel pouch, and the cleaning brush makes it super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the design works very well to remove hair quickly and as painless as any device manufactured to rip out your hair.  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t know if it really worth to pay more for almost the same result of the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more comfortable about using the Panasonic epilator in the water, however, simply because the areas where the cord plugs in and where the head attaches seems better suited to a wet environment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As epilators go, the Philips Hp6520/70 Satin Soft Cordless Epilator is fine, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>To me, it just obscured the head so it was harder to see and made for one more piece I had to clean after using it.</li>
            <li>To me, it just obscured the head so it was harder to see and made for one more piece I had to clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator!  </li>
            <li>and I’ve simply lost or thrown mine away.the product information booklet and used the epilator on more than just one person.</li>
            <li>But for the amount of hair it actually pulled out, I could hand-tweeze my legs with greater effect.</li>
            <li>With the water turned pretty hot and beating on my skin, the sensation of pain was lessened by a LOT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two-speed setting, however, is pretty nifty.</li>
            <li>When you first turn the epilator on, it spins at the fastest speed.</li>
            <li>They are just under the surface and actually look like they are on top of the skin, making my legs look like they need shaved.  </li>
            <li>It is better to take a shower first to open up the pores, then towel off and epilate.</li>
            <li>Like others have said it takes a bit of getting used to and will sting the first couple times around.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I got the Oh bleep, make it stop feeling.  </li>
            <li>this some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give better looking and longer last results than a razor.  </li>
            <li>but it does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>and they are each better at different things.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take some getting used to when you first begin using an epilator in place of razors.  </li>
            <li>When you first turn it on it</li>
            <li>The only difference between this epilator and an electric tweezer is that this epilator has more power.</li>
            <li>Actually, plain point tip tweezers ([[ASIN:B004KS2V9G like these]]) are a good thing to have around.  </li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s pretty much supposed to be that way.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all I have</li>
            <li>but it does exactly what it should.ave to replace the whole system).  </li>
            <li>Both work at just about full speed until they die completely.</li>
            <li>and it also spins at a higher rate so you can epilate large areas much faster.  </li>
            <li>While it does sting my legs just a touch (you quickly get used to it), the benefits far outweigh the pain.</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no cord in my way, nor am I limited to being within a certain distance of outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And when I was in the psychology experiment in college when I got jolts of electricity, the researcher said I have a very high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>And when I was in the psychology experiment in college when I got jolts of electricity, the researcher said I have a very high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with a nice little drawstring type storage bag, a charging cord, instructions, and a wavy &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachment.  </li>
            <li>I haven’t tried the massaging attachment yet; I doubt that it helps much with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel even a tinge, and the results were very thorough.</li>
            <li>and I really very seldom have to epilate or shave at all anymore.</li>
            <li>There are also two speeds and a very thorough instruction</li>
            <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have epilated quite so fast, but the water WAS getting cooler (epilating was a showering afterthought in this case).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit concerned about pain, since the one i used in the &amp;#34;80&#x27;s really hurt , but for some reason this did not compare to the pain.  </li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s really a misnomer.</li>
            <li>She has a lot of hair, and it grows really fast.</li>
            <li>It also works really fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips.</li>
            <li>It does, though, work very well considering the price difference.  </li>
            <li>You’ve probably heard how much it hurts to take the hair off in this way.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they got a defective unit, maybe I just got lucky, but I generally get a couple of weeks out of one charge.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they got a defective unit, maybe I just got lucky, but I generally get a couple of weeks out of one charge.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a different epilator for a few months before I got this one, but for the most part this has become my new favorite</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: After a few more weeks of usage, my wife has found the epilator more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>and, so far, no unfortunate incidents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we went back to tried and true methods of hair removal, but if epilator&#x27;s are your thing, this seems to be a decent entry unit.</li>
            <li>I charged the epilator fully right before starting, and it lasted on high for 19 minutes before the light began to flash to tell me the battery was running low.</li>
            <li>main issue with the epilator is that I get ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Battery powered epilators just don&#x27;t have enough power to spin that many heads at the same speed as a corded epilator, so they will always be slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>itch red bumps for a few hours ( a good lotion helps relieve</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted a picture to show what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent Epilator.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted a picture to show what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent Epilator.  </li>
            <li>As you continue use of the epilator, though, you won&#x27;t be &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; out as many hairs at one time, as they tend to grow back at different rates.  </li>
            <li>Since the rotating head on this one is the same general design, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll experience the same problem here.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>’s on high but with another upward click</li>
            <li>Very smooth n long lasting.</li>
            <li>This epilator is quite powerful and is intended for use below the neck only - not the face.  </li>
            <li>So the first time I tried it, I considered my leg hair pretty long.</li>
            <li>and I actually don&#x27;t feel much discomfort now, compared to the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, epilators are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>I selected this producted from Amazon thinking that I would receive a normal, electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The Philips removes most of the hair on the first try, but for some reason there are a few hairs that it will not get, whether I go over the same spot twice or 20 times.  </li>
            <li>It also has a 2 year warranty, which is longer than normal for most small appliances of this</li>
            <li>I have been epilating my legs and bikini area (most of it, anyway) for about the past year using a Philips Satinelle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators all the way back to the original Epilady back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>In general, I think philips epilators are good for beginners because they seem to be the least likely to pinch the skin of any epilators I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>, I have just done that in less time than it took for the hot water to run out!!</li>
            <li>I am not convinced that my problems are from this particular epilator but rather from years of depilating and my hair has become very fine, weak and prone to break.  </li>
            <li>run a lot outside, so I admit that as a guy I like to keep certain areas of my body shaved.</li>
            <li>Be cautious however because once you start taking hair off in this way it usually never grows back abundantly so don’t use it anywhere on your body that this might be a negative.  </li>
            <li>I don’t actually have much need for this feature, though.</li>
            <li>The epilator lasted another 3 minutes before completely dying.</li>
            <li>How much pain you experience will depend on a lot of factors such as where you&#x27;re removing the hair</li>
            <li>The extra parts are just junk and really don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say there is a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; as far as pain goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Satin Soft</li>
            <li>This Philips epilator has the convenience of a light which flashes red when the charge starts to get low, while there is no such indicator on the Panasonic</li>
            <li>If the old epilator isn&#x27;t charged a pair of tweezers also does the trick.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell it does nothing.  </li>
            <li>The entire cover will slide off so that you can access the battery (if it dies you have to replace the whole system).  </li>
            <li>I have two now that are probably two or three years old each (A Braun and Remington)</li>
            <li>Also, the epilator shave lasts much longer than that from a regular electric or non-electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a safety feature that protects the user by preventing use in or near water and risking electrocution.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating for a long time and have used many epilators, including previous philips models.  </li>
            <li>This might indicate that the older one actually came with a massager also</li>
            <li>This might indicate that the older one actually came with a massager also</li>
            <li>Granted,She&#x27;s been lucky enough not to brake them, so she only used three or four different ones</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this little tool actually does any (or much) epilation but is meant to practice on wet skin and in this way become more accustomed to epilation.</li>
            <li>I had one experience of not having my arm raised up high enough to keep the skin from folding a bit and the tweezers grabbed a bite of skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairlycertain the combination of pain endorphins (or whatever), plus the hot temperature and a bike commute on an empty stomach</li>
            <li>Once I got past the first few days, I found that using an epilator was better for me than shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>originally purchased the Satinelle HP6401, the smaller white/grey corded version at half the price.</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of epilating, but I know I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
            <li>Wet skin presents more friction than dry skin due to the surface tension of water, so you are much more likely to pinch your skin if you epilate on wet skin compared to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Works on dry or wet skin: Um…this is *technically* true.</li>
            <li>My lady has yet to try one that is significantly more effective or less painful than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it missed quite a few on my chest, but got more on other areas.</li>
            <li>comment about epilators in general:  </li>
            <li>By the way there’s a small white light at the bottom of the unit that flashes as it charges.  </li>
            <li>I can barely get one knee and thigh</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always shave but was told I should, so this seemed the natural next step.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to switch back to my old [[ASIN:B00DM34FKS Conair epilator]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had professional waxing services at different salons.  </li>
            <li>I felt no \\&quot;massage\\&quot; or anything else; it just kind of got in the way and made it difficult to see what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged, it needs to be charged to work and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to wax one whole leg.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to epilate my pubic area, but its been a long, extremely slow process that takes me several hours and gives me a sore neck from staring downward.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>So far, we heard one brand after the other claiming that they are more effective or less painful.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, that there are other epilators that have batteries last much longer</li>
            <li>It missed quite a few on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>Epilators for me are not a long term solution so I will go back to what I was using and save this for when I&#x27;ve missed something.</li>
            <li>I was very lazy and had full regrowth to deal with each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did my whole font, half back and butt in under 20</li>
            <li>My legs will typically stay smooth for up to a few months.  </li>
            <li>It hurt lots, like little bee stings that I could control, which is what made the whole thing bearable.</li>

            <li> This is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The idea of owning a razor that works like a tweezer is very attractive, as I could not imagine spending time to tweeze any hair except my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on my underarms!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very good epilator but not the best I’ve ever used.  </li>

            <li> It works beautifully on the legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> Great price</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I greatly prefer corded epilators to cordless epilators.  </li>
            <li> Great for using to remove undesired hair growth on calves, underarms, leg and thighs.</li>
            <li> If it is, then this unit is great.</li>
            <li> If it is, then this unit is great.</li>
            <li> One of the extremely great things about this cordless is there’s no cord to get in the way as you change positions to move around your leg.  </li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>
            <li> Not so great on my legs.</li>
            <li> cordless aspect is very nice, although you have to charge it fully before you can use it.  </li>
            <li> Very good product :)</li>
            <li> ergonomics of this epilator are really good.  </li>
            <li> , the massage attachment fit onto the Satinelle perfectly.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Dollar for dollar, the two epilators are fairly closely matched.</li>
            <li> It sounded good in the ad, so I got it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Though it removes hair fairly well</li>

            <li> Great product :-)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this Epilator.  </li>
            <li> It works great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> this thing is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The product is light and portable and makes for a great gift.</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It fits nicely in my hand.  </li>
            <li> This is wet/dry as you probably want if you want to pamper your legs with warm water as you use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is rechargeable, which is really nice - no changing batteries or dangling cords.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for use, almost painless.</li>
            <li> It’s nice that this epilator is more portable in that you’re not chained to the wall while you’re using it.</li>
            <li> I also have a bright light over my bathroom mirror, so the location works well for me.</li>
            <li> I epilated pubic hair once on my own with the Satinelle, then got a wax, and epilated once more after that.</li>
            <li> Great purchase thanks!</li>
            <li> From an inspection of the hair that it did get, it looked like most of them were pulled out from the root.  </li>
            <li> He said the massage attachment sort of spread out the pain and made it more bearable.</li>
            <li> He said the massage attachment sort of spread out the pain and made it more bearable.</li>
            <li> it needs another row of tweezer wheels and definitely more power.</li>
            <li> So I have epilated my legs and armpits for many years.  </li>
            <li> It is like a row of tweezers pulling many hairs at one time.  </li>
            <li> It mostly does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived at Prime 2-day shipping accidentally, I&#x27;m guessing because my roommate has Prime :)</li>
            <li> love the fact that it is cordless, and rechargable</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The head on the epilator is wider than the Panasonic epilator, so I cover more area, but I think the Panasonic might have just a bit of an edge when it comes to pulling some of those tougher hairs because it has two roller heads that work in tandem.</li>
            <li> Whether the hurt is just a kind of light sting</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s more like itch</li>
            <li> This model has two settings (most do).  </li>
            <li> This is mostly a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s wet/dry</li>
            <li> :).  </li>
            <li> Underarms have to be done more often probably because of the texture of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> A winning product from Philips.</li>
            <li> Also the price is pretty good compared to the overpriced Braun epilators and their performance</li>
            <li> The price seems pretty good, assuming it holds up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take it outside with me in the summer and get some vitamin D while I smooth my legs in the best light!</li>
            <li> Awesome seller, product arrived super super fast :-)</li>
            <li> , if you are not prone to ingrown hairs and do not have sensitive skin, this may work great.</li>
            <li> The Braun was fantastic at knees and calfves; the Remington better under the arms.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it&#x27;s as easy to take off as it is to put</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the head is easy.  </li>
            <li> the head is easy.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to hold on to while using.  </li>
            <li> I have liked it very much.</li>
            <li> even with full charge, it seemed to be more noise than anything.</li>
            <li> This thing mechanically rips out your hair, and is pretty effective at it...</li>
            <li> This epilator is pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I confess that I broke the first rule in the product information booklet and used the epilator on more than just one person.</li>
            <li> It takes many sweeps to remove the hairs compared to shaving which is quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> any event, this is a nice unit and will certainly see plenty of use.</li>
            <li> It gives smooth results with no fuss, no pain.</li>
            <li> I’ve epilated his back before, but he is by no means an experienced epilator like I am, so he’s not accustomed to the discomfort of it.</li>
            <li> I’ve epilated his back before, but he is by no means an experienced epilator like I am, so he’s not accustomed to the discomfort of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also comfortable to hold without causing hand cramps.  </li>
            <li> Therefore it can be (and is) more powerful than ones that can also be used on the face.  </li>
            <li> It might be useful if you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, to be sure you&#x27;re holding it in the correct position--it should be at a 90° angle to your leg, not tilted like a razor--but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> The question you have to ask is, &amp;#34;Is getting smooth, hairless, skin that lasts about 2 weeks before another use&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The question you have to ask is, &amp;#34;Is getting smooth, hairless, skin that lasts about 2 weeks before another use&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Even after the light stops blinking indicating it’s fully charged you can switch it on until you unplug it.  </li>
            <li> It is also very noisy and not the kind of noise that inspires confidence in how it is working.</li>
            <li> I was able to go so fast!</li>
            <li> This Epilator is so much better than the one I first got in</li>
            <li> Both are worth their price!</li>
            <li> I originally had the Philips corded epilator, which is about $20 cheaper.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the upgrade!</li>
            <li> Honestly, the hassle of making the sugar solution put me off it after a while, so I normally just shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do my epilating right by the sink so that the hairs that come out are gathered into an area that is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> epilator is for the most part the best one I&#x27;ve tried, though I&#x27;ll admit that I get the best overall results by using this one first then switching back to my old one for a quick pass over the same areas.  </li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE the little Satinelle, its a wonderful and efficient machine as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and</li>
            <li> I had hoped that it would also work under my arms, but it didn&#x27;t have much luck pulling many of those thicker, coarser hairs out.  </li>
            <li> That might not be true for a woman with finer body hair than a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fairly coarse darkish hairs, fair skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She likes the cordless feature, but I much rather be able to remove all the hair than having a cordless epilator.</li>
            <li> It ran full strength until it stopped.  </li>
            <li> My favorite epilator is the Emjoi AP18 which has more than double the number of tweezing heads than this epilator</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s kind of the same result and pain of the cheap version of it</li>
            <li> The second time was more like - now I remember why I haven&#x27;t done this more often</li>
            <li> two main differences with this one and others I have owned is that this one comes with a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; attachment (a plastic piece that goes over the top of epilator and has two wavy strips that \\&quot;massage and sooth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It was my very first epilator, and I&#x27;d never waxed before-</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and fine, blonde hair that ranges from basically clear in some spots to light brown in others.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those with a high threshold for pain and/or experienced with using epilators only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using an epilator, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> This baby does both very well, and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It will rip out a good number of hairs on a single run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;startling&amp;#34; at first to have hairs yanked out by the roots!  </li>
            <li> do like this better than sugaring, although it seems to me to be less effective in terms of hairs ripped.</li>
            <li> I thought it really just got in the way and prevented the head of the epilator from smoothly rolling over my skin.</li>
            <li> When the light stops flashing it’s fully charged and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> It’s definitely a different kind of pain than waxing.  </li>
            <li> It did far better with getting all the finer, thinner hair on my arms.  </li>
            <li> want to get my adult daughter who has more hair on her legs to also try it</li>
            <li> (you might be surprised, I find that legs hurt WAY more than bikini area)</li>
            <li> since graduated from lower legs to underarms, and now also full brazillian hair removal (both underarms and pubic area bled the first time for me).</li>
            <li> Made for the woman, this device provides &#x27;stain soft&#x27; and memorable experience.</li>
            <li> min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I also tried to use this product on my face and was treated to a weeks worth of</li>
            <li> For us it wasn&#x27;t worth getting used to the pain</li>
            <li> ; worth it?</li>
            <li> ; worth it?</li>
            <li> Worth to buy.</li>
            <li> It is loud, but most of these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The massage attachment is supposed to make it a more gentle experience - because I&#x27;ve used another epilator, I haven&#x27;t tried that attachment, but really question if any yanking of hair by the roots can be classifed as gentle!  </li>
            <li> Hey, there is no shame in that, right?</li>
            <li> different is that the top of the epilator is not open (as in others that I have owned allow you to get a brush in all around the most important part of the machine).  </li>
            <li> It didn’t work well on any of the three areas, mostly because the epilator was skipping across the wet skin and wasn’t gripping the hairs very efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The upside of this is that 90% of the time my legs are suitable for public viewing</li>
            <li> This fine epilator (hadn&#x27;t heard that word much before this) works very well.</li>
            <li> I love the little travel pouch, and the cleaning brush makes it super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the design works very well to remove hair quickly and as painless as any device manufactured to rip out your hair.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t know if it really worth to pay more for almost the same result of the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I feel a lot more comfortable about using the Panasonic epilator in the water, however, simply because the areas where the cord plugs in and where the head attaches seems better suited to a wet environment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As epilators go, the Philips Hp6520/70 Satin Soft Cordless Epilator is fine, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> To me, it just obscured the head so it was harder to see and made for one more piece I had to clean after using it.</li>
            <li> To me, it just obscured the head so it was harder to see and made for one more piece I had to clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator!  </li>
            <li> and I’ve simply lost or thrown mine away.the product information booklet and used the epilator on more than just one person.</li>
            <li> But for the amount of hair it actually pulled out, I could hand-tweeze my legs with greater effect.</li>
            <li> With the water turned pretty hot and beating on my skin, the sensation of pain was lessened by a LOT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-speed setting, however, is pretty nifty.</li>
            <li> When you first turn the epilator on, it spins at the fastest speed.</li>
            <li> They are just under the surface and actually look like they are on top of the skin, making my legs look like they need shaved.  </li>
            <li> It is better to take a shower first to open up the pores, then towel off and epilate.</li>
            <li> Like others have said it takes a bit of getting used to and will sting the first couple times around.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I got the Oh bleep, make it stop feeling.  </li>
            <li> this some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give better looking and longer last results than a razor.  </li>
            <li> but it does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> and they are each better at different things.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take some getting used to when you first begin using an epilator in place of razors.  </li>
            <li> When you first turn it on it</li>
            <li> The only difference between this epilator and an electric tweezer is that this epilator has more power.</li>
            <li> Actually, plain point tip tweezers ([[ASIN:B004KS2V9G like these]]) are a good thing to have around.  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s pretty much supposed to be that way.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much all I have</li>
            <li> but it does exactly what it should.ave to replace the whole system).  </li>
            <li> Both work at just about full speed until they die completely.</li>
            <li> and it also spins at a higher rate so you can epilate large areas much faster.  </li>
            <li> While it does sting my legs just a touch (you quickly get used to it), the benefits far outweigh the pain.</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s no cord in my way, nor am I limited to being within a certain distance of outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when I was in the psychology experiment in college when I got jolts of electricity, the researcher said I have a very high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> And when I was in the psychology experiment in college when I got jolts of electricity, the researcher said I have a very high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came with a nice little drawstring type storage bag, a charging cord, instructions, and a wavy &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachment.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t tried the massaging attachment yet; I doubt that it helps much with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel even a tinge, and the results were very thorough.</li>
            <li> and I really very seldom have to epilate or shave at all anymore.</li>
            <li> There are also two speeds and a very thorough instruction</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have epilated quite so fast, but the water WAS getting cooler (epilating was a showering afterthought in this case).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit concerned about pain, since the one i used in the &amp;#34;80&#x27;s really hurt , but for some reason this did not compare to the pain.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s really a misnomer.</li>
            <li> She has a lot of hair, and it grows really fast.</li>
            <li> It also works really fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips.</li>
            <li> It does, though, work very well considering the price difference.  </li>
            <li> You’ve probably heard how much it hurts to take the hair off in this way.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they got a defective unit, maybe I just got lucky, but I generally get a couple of weeks out of one charge.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they got a defective unit, maybe I just got lucky, but I generally get a couple of weeks out of one charge.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a different epilator for a few months before I got this one, but for the most part this has become my new favorite</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After a few more weeks of usage, my wife has found the epilator more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> and, so far, no unfortunate incidents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we went back to tried and true methods of hair removal, but if epilator&#x27;s are your thing, this seems to be a decent entry unit.</li>
            <li> I charged the epilator fully right before starting, and it lasted on high for 19 minutes before the light began to flash to tell me the battery was running low.</li>
            <li> main issue with the epilator is that I get ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Battery powered epilators just don&#x27;t have enough power to spin that many heads at the same speed as a corded epilator, so they will always be slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> itch red bumps for a few hours ( a good lotion helps relieve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted a picture to show what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent Epilator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted a picture to show what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent Epilator.  </li>
            <li> As you continue use of the epilator, though, you won&#x27;t be &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; out as many hairs at one time, as they tend to grow back at different rates.  </li>
            <li> Since the rotating head on this one is the same general design, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll experience the same problem here.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ’s on high but with another upward click</li>
            <li> Very smooth n long lasting.</li>
            <li> This epilator is quite powerful and is intended for use below the neck only - not the face.  </li>
            <li> So the first time I tried it, I considered my leg hair pretty long.</li>
            <li> and I actually don&#x27;t feel much discomfort now, compared to the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, epilators are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> I selected this producted from Amazon thinking that I would receive a normal, electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The Philips removes most of the hair on the first try, but for some reason there are a few hairs that it will not get, whether I go over the same spot twice or 20 times.  </li>
            <li> It also has a 2 year warranty, which is longer than normal for most small appliances of this</li>
            <li> I have been epilating my legs and bikini area (most of it, anyway) for about the past year using a Philips Satinelle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators all the way back to the original Epilady back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> In general, I think philips epilators are good for beginners because they seem to be the least likely to pinch the skin of any epilators I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> , I have just done that in less time than it took for the hot water to run out!!</li>
            <li> I am not convinced that my problems are from this particular epilator but rather from years of depilating and my hair has become very fine, weak and prone to break.  </li>
            <li> run a lot outside, so I admit that as a guy I like to keep certain areas of my body shaved.</li>
            <li> Be cautious however because once you start taking hair off in this way it usually never grows back abundantly so don’t use it anywhere on your body that this might be a negative.  </li>
            <li> I don’t actually have much need for this feature, though.</li>
            <li> The epilator lasted another 3 minutes before completely dying.</li>
            <li> How much pain you experience will depend on a lot of factors such as where you&#x27;re removing the hair</li>
            <li> The extra parts are just junk and really don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say there is a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; as far as pain goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Satin Soft</li>
            <li> This Philips epilator has the convenience of a light which flashes red when the charge starts to get low, while there is no such indicator on the Panasonic</li>
            <li> If the old epilator isn&#x27;t charged a pair of tweezers also does the trick.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it does nothing.  </li>
            <li> The entire cover will slide off so that you can access the battery (if it dies you have to replace the whole system).  </li>
            <li> I have two now that are probably two or three years old each (A Braun and Remington)</li>
            <li> Also, the epilator shave lasts much longer than that from a regular electric or non-electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a safety feature that protects the user by preventing use in or near water and risking electrocution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for a long time and have used many epilators, including previous philips models.  </li>
            <li> This might indicate that the older one actually came with a massager also</li>
            <li> This might indicate that the older one actually came with a massager also</li>
            <li> Granted,She&#x27;s been lucky enough not to brake them, so she only used three or four different ones</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this little tool actually does any (or much) epilation but is meant to practice on wet skin and in this way become more accustomed to epilation.</li>
            <li> I had one experience of not having my arm raised up high enough to keep the skin from folding a bit and the tweezers grabbed a bite of skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairlycertain the combination of pain endorphins (or whatever), plus the hot temperature and a bike commute on an empty stomach</li>
            <li> Once I got past the first few days, I found that using an epilator was better for me than shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> originally purchased the Satinelle HP6401, the smaller white/grey corded version at half the price.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of epilating, but I know I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
            <li> Wet skin presents more friction than dry skin due to the surface tension of water, so you are much more likely to pinch your skin if you epilate on wet skin compared to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Works on dry or wet skin: Um…this is *technically* true.</li>
            <li> My lady has yet to try one that is significantly more effective or less painful than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it missed quite a few on my chest, but got more on other areas.</li>
            <li> comment about epilators in general:  </li>
            <li> By the way there’s a small white light at the bottom of the unit that flashes as it charges.  </li>
            <li> I can barely get one knee and thigh</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always shave but was told I should, so this seemed the natural next step.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to switch back to my old [[ASIN:B00DM34FKS Conair epilator]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had professional waxing services at different salons.  </li>
            <li> I felt no \\&quot;massage\\&quot; or anything else; it just kind of got in the way and made it difficult to see what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged, it needs to be charged to work and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to wax one whole leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to epilate my pubic area, but its been a long, extremely slow process that takes me several hours and gives me a sore neck from staring downward.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> So far, we heard one brand after the other claiming that they are more effective or less painful.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, that there are other epilators that have batteries last much longer</li>
            <li> It missed quite a few on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> Epilators for me are not a long term solution so I will go back to what I was using and save this for when I&#x27;ve missed something.</li>
            <li> I was very lazy and had full regrowth to deal with each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did my whole font, half back and butt in under 20</li>
            <li> My legs will typically stay smooth for up to a few months.  </li>
            <li> It hurt lots, like little bee stings that I could control, which is what made the whole thing bearable.</li>
            <li> the main selling point of cordless epilators is the ability to use them in the shower, which is a bad idea in most cases.  </li>
            <li> The first two were fairly similar and my biggest complaint was that the design allowed them to occasionally catch your skin in the revolving head.  </li>
            <li> I did my male friend’s back, though (light brown skin; thick, black hairs),</li>
            <li> I did my male friend’s back, though (light brown skin; thick, black hairs),</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and has various attachments to deal with various types of body hair.  </li>
            <li> charges really fast, in about a hour, which is unbelievable since my flashlight takes</li>
            <li> Gross long leg hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun brand fan for epilators for a long time and should go back to it.</li>
            <li> There is a little apparatus if you are new to using an epilator and want to go at it cautiously.</li>
            <li> My other one hurt a lot and left me with red blotches everywhere.</li>
            <li> I feel no irritated sort of razor-burn pain, and the redness is not nearly so pronounced.</li>
            <li> The plus is that it stays gone for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As for the 30-minute battery that the product information claims, that’s not really true--at least not if you’re using the higher speed setting.</li>
            <li> This one is designed completely different where there is no plastic housing close enough to the revolving head to pull your skin down into.  </li>
            <li> She has tried the epilator both dry and wet and either way is about the same.</li>
            <li> Also, when the battery (inevitably) died on this one and we switched to my other epilator that plugs into the wall</li>
            <li> Also, when the battery (inevitably) died on this one and we switched to my other epilator that plugs into the wall</li>
            <li> I see that other reviewers have remarked on short battery life.  </li>
            <li> I see that other reviewers have remarked on short battery life.  </li>
            <li> I believe the epilation has to be done on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> As for underarm hair, I prefer to do that dry, while looking in the mirror -</li>
            <li> If you decide that epilating is not for you, you&#x27;ve spent very nearly the same amount and at least will get an electric razor out of it.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised by how small it is.</li>
            <li> Pressing the power button a second time will drop you down to the slower level.  </li>
            <li> neat feature is that it can be used on wet or dry</li>
            <li> the Philips and the Panasonic that I already owned indicate that they are for wet and/or dry use.</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that this device can be used either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Hairs, though, that have been shaved by the epilator tend to grow back at different rates, so weekly maintenance is usually necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did try using the epilator in both dry and wet settings and it works well both ways.</li>
            <li> It actually took less time than that, about 45 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> The part that plugs into the unit is notched so that you can distinguish the charging wire from other similar chargers that go with other epilators.  </li>
            <li> It feels like being pricked with little pins as it yanks out each individual hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the epilator heads are the same (I think), for some reason this product causes me little to no pain when using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a little ouchy.</li>
            <li> It was also more painful than I could stand, so</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This is more efficient and less painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That led me to realize that as a shaving convert, I just can NOT get used to body hair maintenance at any other time than showering.</li>
            <li> Do not use it for any other purpose.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The shape and design of this product is easier to hold and fits to your hand, unlike the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried various epilating agents in the past, like sugaring (using a gooey sugar-based product to rip hairs) and chemical ones (which burned and never worked).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using another epilator for about the past year</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh on the upper lip and stings a bit elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it left LOTS of stray hair behind even with several passings.</li>
            <li> I’ve had other cordless epilators and there was a gradual loss of power as the charge ran down.  </li>
            <li> The down side of this is that the charger isn’t interchangeable with other epilators.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> You can press the power button a second time to slow it down a little.</li>
            <li> it hurt much less then other one I had!  </li>
            <li> The different speeds help a little, but both speeds have one thing in common: pain.</li>
            <li> You can rinse the head, but after awhile either there is build up on the &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34; or they aren&#x27;t closing as tight or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really clean for hair removed</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with an added little plastic attachment that they call \\&quot;wavy message attachment\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this unit for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> except for a little pulling ,my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I have no idea why anyone would think a little plastic roller attachment running over your skin while the epilator is ripping your hair out would result in any noticeable reduction in pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did help LITTLE</li>
            <li> Not very satisfying.</li>
            <li> Also, there are a few little accessories that will help ease you into the process of epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it beats having to shave a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> It removes about 99% of the hair, but always seems to miss a few.  </li>
            <li> It removes about 99% of the hair, but always seems to miss a few.  </li>
            <li> However, just because you CAN use it on wet skin doesn’t mean that you SHOULD.</li>
            <li> At least not right now.</li>
            <li> This was our first experience with an Epliator and while we continue to prefer razors/electric razors, it wasn&#x27;t a bad experience by any means.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While epilating is no longer painful for me, the problem came that I noticed several areas where I was bleeding from the hair follicles and I was left with unsightly scabs.  </li>
            <li> Instead of being rolling coils like epilators I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is made of metal plates that come together to work as tweezers as the roller head turns.  </li>
            <li> red, angry bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, I don&#x27;t need to do anything for at least a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Less painful than the last two epilators I&#x27;ve owned It does grab even the smallest, shortest hair.</li>

            <li> Product arrived perfect and works perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product :-) it hurt much less then other one I had!  Awesome seller, product arrived super super fast :-)</li>
            <li> Not really clean for hair removed</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator!  Keep in mind though that it’s the only one that I’ve ever used.  The pain isn&#x27;t too bad.  It feels like being pricked with little pins as it yanks out each individual hair.  It’s definitely a different kind of pain than waxing.  I haven’t tried the massaging attachment yet; I doubt that it helps much with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get every hair on my legs.  It missed quite a few on the first pass.  From an inspection of the hair that it did get, it looked like most of them were pulled out from the root.  It did far better with getting all the finer, thinner hair on my arms.  I had hoped that it would also work under my arms, but it didn&#x27;t have much luck pulling many of those thicker, coarser hairs out.  It was also more painful than I could stand, so I didn&#x27;t try for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics of this epilator are really good.  It fits nicely in my hand.  I was actually surprised by how small it is. I love that there&#x27;s no cord in my way, nor am I limited to being within a certain distance of outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is seriously a breeze.  Use the brush that it comes with to remove the hair and then just rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> This may be the best epilator I&#x27;ve tried. It gives smooth results with no fuss, no pain. I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand and model. I would say that this is the easiest to operate. It has two speeds. You press again if you want to change speeds. There is a little apparatus if you are new to using an epilator and want to go at it cautiously. I didn&#x27;t feel even a tinge, and the results were very thorough. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and fine, blonde hair that ranges from basically clear in some spots to light brown in others. I have been epilating my legs and bikini area (most of it, anyway) for about the past year using a Philips Satinelle. I no longer use a razor on those parts of my body. I’ll focus my comments on the ways in which this epilator is or claims to be different from the Satinelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery powered: It’s nice that this epilator is more portable in that you’re not chained to the wall while you’re using it. I don’t actually have much need for this feature, though. I do my epilating right by the sink so that the hairs that come out are gathered into an area that is easily cleaned. I also have a bright light over my bathroom mirror, so the location works well for me. As for the 30-minute battery that the product information claims, that’s not really true--at least not if you’re using the higher speed setting. I charged the epilator fully right before starting, and it lasted on high for 19 minutes before the light began to flash to tell me the battery was running low. The epilator lasted another 3 minutes before completely dying. Also, the product does not work while it’s plugged in, so there’s no using it until the battery runs low and then continuing to use it while it’s charging. I can barely get one knee and thigh finished in 22 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Works on dry or wet skin: Um…this is *technically* true. However, just because you CAN use it on wet skin doesn’t mean that you SHOULD. I took mine into the shower and tried it on the lower leg region, where my hairs are sparse but also the thickest; on the back of my thigh, where I basically just have peach fuzz; and on my bikini area. It didn’t work well on any of the three areas, mostly because the epilator was skipping across the wet skin and wasn’t gripping the hairs very efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a “massage” attachment: Okay, so I confess that I broke the first rule in the product information booklet and used the epilator on more than just one person. I tried the massage attachment on myself and couldn’t feel a difference at all. To me, it just obscured the head so it was harder to see and made for one more piece I had to clean after using it. I did my male friend’s back, though (light brown skin; thick, black hairs), and he said he could feel a difference with the massager. I’ve epilated his back before, but he is by no means an experienced epilator like I am, so he’s not accustomed to the discomfort of it. He said the massage attachment sort of spread out the pain and made it more bearable. Also, when the battery (inevitably) died on this one and we switched to my other epilator that plugs into the wall so he wasn’t walking around half-hairy-backed, the massage attachment fit onto the Satinelle perfectly. This might indicate that the older one actually came with a massager also and I’ve simply lost or thrown mine away.the product information booklet and used the epilator on more than just one person.

            <li> i&#x27;ve owned epilators before and this one...just did not cut it. even with full charge, it seemed to be more noise than anything. it left LOTS of stray hair behind even with several passings. it needs another row of tweezer wheels and definitely more power. i did like that it was cordless and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> So I have epilated my legs and armpits for many years.  I like this epilator because it has plenty of power and it&#x27;s cordless (rechargeable) and has two speeds.  It&#x27;s also comfortable to hold without causing hand cramps.  It doesn&#x27;t grab the skin the way some others I have tried did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While epilating is no longer painful for me, the problem came that I noticed several areas where I was bleeding from the hair follicles and I was left with unsightly scabs.  I also noticed a few ingrown hairs from hairs that had broken off instead of being fully pulled out.  I am not convinced that my problems are from this particular epilator but rather from years of depilating and my hair has become very fine, weak and prone to break.  The upside of this is that 90% of the time my legs are suitable for public viewing and I really very seldom have to epilate or shave at all anymore.</li>
            <li> This epilator is quite powerful and is intended for use below the neck only - not the face.  Therefore it can be (and is) more powerful than ones that can also be used on the face.  It is like a row of tweezers pulling many hairs at one time.  It works beautifully on the legs and underarms.  I have to confess that I did not have the courage to try the bikini area yet (!).  It does not use batteries but is rechargeable and seems to hold the charge quite well -  the instructions say for up to thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an added little plastic attachment that they call \\&quot;wavy message attachment\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t believe this little tool actually does any (or much) epilation but is meant to practice on wet skin and in this way become more accustomed to epilation. I believe the epilation has to be done on dry skin.  There are also two speeds and a very thorough instruction booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to get my adult daughter who has more hair on her legs to also try it and I will post comments once she does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this unit for a little over a month now. I was hoping that after a few uses I would get used to the painful sensation, but not so. I don&#x27;t always shave but was told I should, so this seemed the natural next step. I guess there&#x27;s no way around feeling pain while having hair ripped from your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s pretty much supposed to be that way. It mostly does the job. Sometimes a second or third pass is necessary. That might not be true for a woman with finer body hair than a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with the product, only the process.</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips Epilator I&#x27;ve had.  The first two were fairly similar and my biggest complaint was that the design allowed them to occasionally catch your skin in the revolving head.  OUCH!  We&#x27;re talking a bloody mess when this happens.  This one is designed completely different where there is no plastic housing close enough to the revolving head to pull your skin down into.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and, so far, no unfortunate incidents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the design works very well to remove hair quickly and as painless as any device manufactured to rip out your hair.  How much pain you experience will depend on a lot of factors such as where you&#x27;re removing the hair (you might be surprised, I find that legs hurt WAY more than bikini area), how dense the hair in the area is, your pain tolerance, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I&#x27;ve had about the Philips epilators is that after about a year, they stop pulling the hair out as efficiently.  Since the rotating head on this one is the same general design, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll experience the same problem here.  You can rinse the head, but after awhile either there is build up on the &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34; or they aren&#x27;t closing as tight or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other epilators I&#x27;ve had came as a set with other pieces and a higher price tag.  The extra parts are just junk and really don&#x27;t do anything.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> For the price, best epilator I&#x27;ve tried. Less painful than the last two epilators I&#x27;ve owned It does grab even the smallest, shortest hair. And it works around knees &amp; ankles.</li>
            <li> I have fairly coarse darkish hairs, fair skin. So the first time I tried it, I considered my leg hair pretty long. Pulled it, but did not pull it out. Waited another 2 days. Gross long leg hairs. Again, pulled it and pulled SOME out, but not all. And that was going over the same area a bunch of times, following the directions RE angle etc. It also HURTS. And I have had electrolysis and laser hair removal. If it worked well, I could deal with the pain. But for the amount of hair it actually pulled out, I could hand-tweeze my legs with greater effect.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased the Satinelle HP6401, the smaller white/grey corded version at half the price. It was my very first epilator, and I&#x27;d never waxed before- I was a total newbie to ripping hairs out! It hurt lots, like little bee stings that I could control, which is what made the whole thing bearable. The subsequent epilating sessions were drastically less painful- they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say there is a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; as far as pain goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I since graduated from lower legs to underarms, and now also full brazillian hair removal (both underarms and pubic area bled the first time for me). I epilated pubic hair once on my own with the Satinelle, then got a wax, and epilated once more after that. I was very lazy and had full regrowth to deal with each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That led me to realize that as a shaving convert, I just can NOT get used to body hair maintenance at any other time than showering. At least not right now. I needed an epilator that wouldn&#x27;t electrocute me in the rain locker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE the little Satinelle, its a wonderful and efficient machine as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and so I went to the Philips website to find an aquatic relative. Alas! This model must be out of production- there is not wet/dry epilator on Philip&#x27;s website, but I found it here on Amazon. PURCHASED! Arrived at Prime 2-day shipping accidentally, I&#x27;m guessing because my roommate has Prime :) Yippee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just showered and let me tell you- this thing is AMAZING. With the water turned pretty hot and beating on my skin, the sensation of pain was lessened by a LOT. I mean, drastically a lot. I&#x27;m able to epilate my pubic area, but its been a long, extremely slow process that takes me several hours and gives me a sore neck from staring downward.&lt;br /&gt;With the Satin Soft, I have just done that in less time than it took for the hot water to run out!! I was able to go so fast! Beware, though. I&#x27;m fairlycertain the combination of pain endorphins (or whatever), plus the hot temperature and a bike commute on an empty stomach almost made me vomit. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have epilated quite so fast, but the water WAS getting cooler (epilating was a showering afterthought in this case). If your muscles are shaking, it a hint to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating in the shower also seems to have reduced the after-effects. I feel no irritated sort of razor-burn pain, and the redness is not nearly so pronounced. I rode my bike back to work and home again in jeans without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this Epilator.  It works great and easy to use.  Yes is hurts somewhat but wasn&#x27;t an awful pain.  For me it beats having to shave a few times a week.  Great price and it does have a year warranty.  Works well on the arms too.  Too bad it&#x27;s not recommended for the face.</li>
            <li> Philips makes wonderful products and this one won&#x27;t disappoint. Made for the woman, this device provides &#x27;stain soft&#x27; and memorable experience. The product is light and portable and makes for a great gift. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This Epilator is so much better than the one I first got in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it is cordless, and rechargable&lt;br /&gt;and It has a 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;It charges really fast, in about a hour, which is unbelievable since my flashlight takes about 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another neat feature is that it can be used on wet or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about pain, since the one i used in the &amp;#34;80&#x27;s really hurt , but for some reason this did not compare to the pain.  My hair is probably thinner since those days, but I am really happy with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun brand fan for epilators for a long time and should go back to it. This Philips just does not compare. The job takes longer and the result is not the best. I did like the cordless feature though.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife. She says she likes it. I like the results. That&#x27;s pretty much all I have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few more weeks of usage, my wife has found the epilator more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. It takes many sweeps to remove the hairs compared to shaving which is quick and reliable. She has tried the epilator both dry and wet and either way is about the same. At this point, she is giving up on the epilator and going back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought the  Panasonic ES-WD51-P Ladies Wet/Dry Epilator almost a year ago, and I love it. It still works wonders, but I decided to pick up this second epilator because I was intrigued by two things: the two speed setting and the massage attachment that is supposed to help take some of the pain out of epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to address the \\&quot;massage attachment.\\&quot; It&#x27;s really a misnomer. All it is is a spiral plastic piece that fits over the head of the epilator. The idea of it \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; your skin or providing any sort of stimulation or soothing is just that--an idea. I thought it really just got in the way and prevented the head of the epilator from smoothly rolling over my skin. Luckily, it&#x27;s as easy to take off as it is to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-speed setting, however, is pretty nifty. When you first turn the epilator on, it spins at the fastest speed. You can press the power button a second time to slow it down a little. To be frank, I&#x27;d rather the pain be quicker than not, so I only ever use the fastest setting. The head on the epilator is wider than the Panasonic epilator, so I cover more area, but I think the Panasonic might have just a bit of an edge when it comes to pulling some of those tougher hairs because it has two roller heads that work in tandem. The speed of the rotation on this head, though, almost (but not quite) balances that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Philips and the Panasonic that I already owned indicate that they are for wet and/or dry use. I feel a lot more comfortable about using the Panasonic epilator in the water, however, simply because the areas where the cord plugs in and where the head attaches seems better suited to a wet environment. In fact, the Panasonic epilator also has a shaving head that can be used in place of the epilator, to add some measure of flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic epilator holds a charge for about 40 minutes. This epilator holds a charge for about 30 minutes. Both work at just about full speed until they die completely. This Philips epilator has the convenience of a light which flashes red when the charge starts to get low, while there is no such indicator on the Panasonic epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dollar for dollar, the two epilators are fairly closely matched. However, I&#x27;d recommend the Panasonic epilator over this one, especially if you are newer to epilating. If you decide that epilating is not for you, you&#x27;ve spent very nearly the same amount and at least will get an electric razor out of it. Also, there are a few little accessories that will help ease you into the process of epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are an experience epilator user, I&#x27;d recommend the Philips because of the wider head. Both are worth their price!</li>
            <li> I had been using a different epilator for a few months before I got this one, but for the most part this has become my new favorite epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One disadvantage of every epilator: if you&#x27;ve never used one before, expect pain.  Once I got past the first few days, I found that using an epilator was better for me than shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is for the most part the best one I&#x27;ve tried, though I&#x27;ll admit that I get the best overall results by using this one first then switching back to my old one for a quick pass over the same areas.  The Philips removes most of the hair on the first try, but for some reason there are a few hairs that it will not get, whether I go over the same spot twice or 20 times.  If the old epilator isn&#x27;t charged a pair of tweezers also does the trick.  Actually, plain point tip tweezers ([[ASIN:B004KS2V9G like these]]) are a good thing to have around.  Since I started using an epilator I sometimes get an ingrown hair--not a big deal, but it&#x27;s easiest to fix with pointy tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to switch back to my old [[ASIN:B00DM34FKS Conair epilator]] if I want to use one on my face.  The instructions for this one include the warning \\&quot;This appliance is only intended for removing women&#x27;s body hair on areas below the neck: underarms, bikini line and legs. Do not use it for any other purpose.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve tried it with no damage, but now that I&#x27;ve read the instructions it seems safer to use an epilator that was designed for use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;massage attachment\\&quot; mystifies me.  As far as I can tell it does nothing.  It might be useful if you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, to be sure you&#x27;re holding it in the correct position--it should be at a 90° angle to your leg, not tilted like a razor--but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it you can probably take the training wheels off.  I felt no \\&quot;massage\\&quot; or anything else; it just kind of got in the way and made it difficult to see what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the head is easy.  I pop it off to the side, brush with the enclosed brush, and rinse under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for me for several uses.  I see that other reviewers have remarked on short battery life.  Maybe they got a defective unit, maybe I just got lucky, but I generally get a couple of weeks out of one charge.  It might help that I don&#x27;t have to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works.  It removes about 99% of the hair, but always seems to miss a few.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with battery life.  It should only be used to remove hair \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot;.

            <li> My lady has been using epilators for the longest time, over ten years. Granted,She&#x27;s been lucky enough not to brake them, so she only used three or four different ones so she can&#x27;t compare to all of them out there. She NEEDS an epilator. She has a lot of hair, and it grows really fast. If she shaves at night, the next day by noon she would have horrible black spots of hair. Also, after a couple of weeks, her hair would be so ingrown she would need to exfoliate for hours before she can do something with it.  So, shaving is not an option for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As epilators go, the Philips Hp6520/70 Satin Soft Cordless Epilator is fine, it works as advertised. It removes hair. So far, we heard one brand after the other claiming that they are more effective or less painful. My lady has yet to try one that is significantly more effective or less painful than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 2 stars? Because it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged, it needs to be charged to work and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to wax one whole leg. So here she was waxing, when on the middle of it, the thing stopped! With no way for her to use it while it was being charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the cordless feature, but I much rather be able to remove all the hair than having a cordless epilator. Not to mention, that there are other epilators that have batteries last much longer and they DO work while plugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using an epilator, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It sounded good in the ad, so I got it. Unfortunately, it hurts a lot more than I like, so I have stopped using it. Recommended for those with a high threshold for pain and/or experienced with using epilators only.</li>
            <li> I originally had the Philips corded epilator, which is about $20 cheaper. It was definitely worth the upgrade! The shape and design of this product is easier to hold and fits to your hand, unlike the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the epilator heads are the same (I think), for some reason this product causes me little to no pain when using. My other one hurt a lot and left me with red blotches everywhere. It also works really fast. I did my whole font, half back and butt in under 20 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and I actually don&#x27;t feel much discomfort now, compared to the first couple of times.  Instead of being rolling coils like epilators I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is made of metal plates that come together to work as tweezers as the roller head turns.  This is more efficient and less painful.  I like the design and it&#x27;s easy to hold on to while using.  The battery life is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used it about five times without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue with the epilator is that I get ingrown hairs.  They are just under the surface and actually look like they are on top of the skin, making my legs look like they need shaved.  Since they&#x27;re under the skin, I can&#x27;t get the epilator to grip them,nor can I shave them off.  I have to individually get each one out with tweezers.  I also tried to use this product on my face and was treated to a weeks worth of red, angry bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are not prone to ingrown hairs and do not have sensitive skin, this may work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for a long time and have used many epilators, including previous philips models.  In general, I think philips epilators are good for beginners because they seem to be the least likely to pinch the skin of any epilators I&#x27;ve used.  Also the price is pretty good compared to the overpriced Braun epilators and their performance is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I greatly prefer corded epilators to cordless epilators.  My favorite epilator is the Emjoi AP18 which has more than double the number of tweezing heads than this epilator and it also spins at a higher rate so you can epilate large areas much faster.  Battery powered epilators just don&#x27;t have enough power to spin that many heads at the same speed as a corded epilator, so they will always be slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the main selling point of cordless epilators is the ability to use them in the shower, which is a bad idea in most cases.  Wet skin presents more friction than dry skin due to the surface tension of water, so you are much more likely to pinch your skin if you epilate on wet skin compared to dry skin.  It is better to take a shower first to open up the pores, then towel off and epilate.</li>
            <li> This was our first experience with an Epliator and while we continue to prefer razors/electric razors, it wasn&#x27;t a bad experience by any means. Like others have said it takes a bit of getting used to and will sting the first couple times around. For us it wasn&#x27;t worth getting used to the pain and we went back to tried and true methods of hair removal, but if epilator&#x27;s are your thing, this seems to be a decent entry unit.</li>
            <li> Good product. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> except for a little pulling ,my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of epilating, but I know I&#x27;m never going back! This epilator is perfect for my needs. While it does sting my legs just a touch (you quickly get used to it), the benefits far outweigh the pain. Because hair grows in cycles, I use this epilator daily for 3-5 days. Then, I don&#x27;t need to do anything for at least a few weeks! I love the little travel pouch, and the cleaning brush makes it super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s kind of the same result and pain of the cheap version of it (i had one cheaper and work well for 5 years) so i don&#x27;t know if it really worth to pay more for almost the same result of the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> This is not a good machine, it dose not work well.  I&#x27;m returning it as soon as possible.  This style should be discontiue.</li>
            <li> Actually got this for an ex-girl-friend that I&#x27;m still friends with. This fine epilator (hadn&#x27;t heard that word much before this) works very well. Has two different speeds for - hair removal convenience, as it definitely removes unwanted hair in those unmentionable and hard-to-reach body areas. Great for using to remove undesired hair growth on calves, underarms, leg and thighs. Do keep in mind that this device can be used either wet or dry. Would make an ideal gift.</li>
            <li> This thing mechanically rips out your hair, and is pretty effective at it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should probably know that before you read the rest of this review, and keep it in the back of your head at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run a lot outside, so I admit that as a guy I like to keep certain areas of my body shaved. Hey, there is no shame in that, right? At any rate...I get sick of shaving every week in the summer, so I thought I would try this product. I have tried various epilating agents in the past, like sugaring (using a gooey sugar-based product to rip hairs) and chemical ones (which burned and never worked). Honestly, the hassle of making the sugar solution put me off it after a while, so I normally just shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator does work, but not perfectly. At least it didn&#x27;t for me. It will rip out a good number of hairs on a single run. However, it missed quite a few on my chest, but got more on other areas. The different speeds help a little, but both speeds have one thing in common: pain. The massage attachment does nothing to ease the pain. I have no idea why anyone would think a little plastic roller attachment running over your skin while the epilator is ripping your hair out would result in any noticeable reduction in pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this better than sugaring, although it seems to me to be less effective in terms of hairs ripped. The price seems pretty good, assuming it holds up well. I would say that you have to weigh the pain of using this, versus the lack of pain with shaving. Also, you will still have to shave some when you use this, because this isn&#x27;t going to rip out every hair. Some people report that hairs grow back thinner and thinner after being ripped out multiple times, and some hairs won&#x27;t grow back at all. This means that using this unit over time could result in fewer and weaker hairs in the future you have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I have emphasized the pain quite a bit, because frankly, you&#x27;ll notice that every second you use this thing. And when I was in the psychology experiment in college when I got jolts of electricity, the researcher said I have a very high pain tolerance. The question you have to ask is, &amp;#34;Is getting smooth, hairless, skin that lasts about 2 weeks before another use&amp;#34; worth it? If it is, then this unit is great. If the answer is &amp;#34;hell no&amp;#34; then you may want to stick with shaving. I&#x27;m going to keep using this unit, at least some, because despite the pain, it does work.econd you use this thing.

            <li> Very good epilator.I have liked it very much.Worth to buy.Very smooth n long lasting.</li>
            <li> I like it work well after charge ,I take it any places with me and use it .</li>
            <li> Very good product :)&lt;br /&gt;Just 20 min and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for use, almost painless. Thanks Philips.</li>
            <li> Great purchase thanks!</li>
            <li> So if you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before here is the mandatory disclaimer - they do hurt.  Whether the hurt is just a kind of light sting/itch  or is a oh bleep what in the world did I do to myself, make it stop level varies on the person, the location you&#x27;re using it on, how often you do it, etc.  Me?  The first time I used it I got the Oh bleep, make it stop feeling.  The second time was more like - now I remember why I haven&#x27;t done this more often but eh, it isn&#x27;t AS BAD as I remember.  Now it&#x27;s more like itch itch red bumps for a few hours ( a good lotion helps relieve this some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give better looking and longer last results than a razor.  This model has two settings (most do).  If you don&#x27;t read the manual -- be prepared turning it on &#x3D; the faster setting (for tough to get hairs).  Pressing the power button a second time will drop you down to the slower level.  A third press of the power button will turn it off.  It is loud, but most of these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, epilators are pretty much the same.  This is wet/dry as you probably want if you want to pamper your legs with warm water as you use it.  It has a drawstring storage bag.  A brush for cleaning it.  A charging cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two main differences with this one and others I have owned is that this one comes with a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; attachment (a plastic piece that goes over the top of epilator and has two wavy strips that \\&quot;massage and sooth\\&quot;.  This is mostly a gimmick.  It did help LITTLE but not enough that I would have purchased that attachment separately if it had not come with the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also different is that the top of the epilator is not open (as in others that I have owned allow you to get a brush in all around the most important part of the machine).  This one is enclosed in the plastic cover that will not open to expose the area immediately around all of those mini tweezers.  The entire cover will slide off so that you can access the battery (if it dies you have to replace the whole system).  I&#x27;ve posted a picture to show what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent Epilator.  Nothing that stands out but it does exactly what it should.ave to replace the whole system).

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators all the way back to the original Epilady back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  This is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  I have two now that are probably two or three years old each (A Braun and Remington) and they are each better at different things.  The Braun was fantastic at knees and calfves; the Remington better under the arms.  This baby does both very well, and very quickly.  I had shaved in the last week, but was still amazed at how well it de-fuzzed my legs; even the thighs where skins is not as taut;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cordless aspect is very nice, although you have to charge it fully before you can use it.  I&#x27;ll take it outside with me in the summer and get some vitamin D while I smooth my legs in the best light!</li>
            <li> I selected this producted from Amazon thinking that I would receive a normal, electric razor.  Well, I soon realized that I was wrong but that isn&#x27;t all bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew what an epilator was, let alone owned one.  I have used disposable razors and electric razors.  I&#x27;ve also had professional waxing services at different salons.  The idea of owning a razor that works like a tweezer is very attractive, as I could not imagine spending time to tweeze any hair except my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epilator doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore than waxing, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well.  It does, though, work very well considering the price difference.  Also, the epilator shave lasts much longer than that from a regular electric or non-electric shaver.  Hairs, though, that have been shaved by the epilator tend to grow back at different rates, so weekly maintenance is usually necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry option may matter to some--especially if you only shave in or out of the shower or bath.  However, it isn&#x27;t something that I would personally pay for.  I did try using the epilator in both dry and wet settings and it works well both ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using another epilator for about the past year so I have something by which to judge this one.  I love that it&#x27;s wet/dry and you can use it in the shower.  I do my legs in there.  As for underarm hair, I prefer to do that dry, while looking in the mirror - I had one experience of not having my arm raised up high enough to keep the skin from folding a bit and the tweezers grabbed a bite of skin.  OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some getting used to when you first begin using an epilator in place of razors.  It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;startling&amp;#34; at first to have hairs yanked out by the roots!  As you continue use of the epilator, though, you won&#x27;t be &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; out as many hairs at one time, as they tend to grow back at different rates.  I find that I can now use the Philips about once a week to keep things under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is rechargeable, which is really nice - no changing batteries or dangling cords.  It also has a 2 year warranty, which is longer than normal for most small appliances of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a nice little drawstring type storage bag, a charging cord, instructions, and a wavy &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachment.  It charges fully in an hour and gives you 30 minutes of &amp;#34;pluck time&amp;#34; :).  The massage attachment is supposed to make it a more gentle experience - because I&#x27;ve used another epilator, I haven&#x27;t tried that attachment, but really question if any yanking of hair by the roots can be classifed as gentle!  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, this is a nice unit and will certainly see plenty of use.</li>
            <li> Per the directions this cordless wet/dry epilator will charge within an hour.  It actually took less time than that, about 45 minutes or so.  I’ve had other cordless epilators and there was a gradual loss of power as the charge ran down.  I didn’t notice this with this the Phillips.  It ran full strength until it stopped.  By the way there’s a small white light at the bottom of the unit that flashes as it charges.  When the light stops flashing it’s fully charged and ready to use.  Even after the light stops blinking indicating it’s fully charged you can switch it on until you unplug it.  This is a safety feature that protects the user by preventing use in or near water and risking electrocution.  The part that plugs into the unit is notched so that you can distinguish the charging wire from other similar chargers that go with other epilators.  The down side of this is that the charger isn’t interchangeable with other epilators.*  One of the extremely great things about this cordless is there’s no cord to get in the way as you change positions to move around your leg.  With the corded ones I’m always worried I’m going to accidently cut through it, damage it, or electrocute myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two settings.  When you first turn it on it’s on high but with another upward click it scales back.  To turn it off click downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A comment about epilators in general:  You’ve probably heard how much it hurts to take the hair off in this way.  It does.  The plus is that it stays gone for a long time.  My legs will typically stay smooth for up to a few months.  Underarms have to be done more often probably because of the texture of the hair.  Be cautious however because once you start taking hair off in this way it usually never grows back abundantly so don’t use it anywhere on your body that this might be a negative.  A tip to help decrease the pain is to hold the skin taut and/or tighten your muscles as you take off the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good epilator but not the best I’ve ever used.  Though it removes hair fairly well it doesn’t do it a closely and thoroughly as others have.  It comes with something their literature refers to as a massager.  I didn’t feel any benefit from this attachment.  It also comes with a plastic drawstring case and a brush to use for cleaning the unit.  Both of these were handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have an Emjoi epilator that’s cord died and on a whim I tried another Phillips epilator version’s cord on it and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good epilator but not the best I’ve ever used.

            <li> This epilator is pretty effective.  It holds a charge for a long time and has various attachments to deal with various types of body hair.  It&#x27;s only a little ouchy.</li>
            <li> Love the cordless feature. Great quality. Works as expected. A winning product from Philips. Wife used it on overseas trip to India and gives it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this epilator and an electric tweezer is that this epilator has more power. It is a little harsh on the upper lip and stings a bit elsewhere. If the stubble is too short it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab it and does not remove it. It is also very noisy and not the kind of noise that inspires confidence in how it is working. I also think it is expensive for what it is and how it works. Epilators for me are not a long term solution so I will go back to what I was using and save this for when I&#x27;ve missed something.</li>
            <li> Works great on my underarms! Not so great on my legs. Takes lots of passes to get hair and never gets it all. It also feels like it breaks some of the hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> Not very satisfying. Dont work on thick hair and get cuts and bruises from it</li>
