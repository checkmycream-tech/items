            <li>Pure Cashmere body wash is my absolute favorite!  </li>

            <li>Shipping is fast and secure (no leakage).</li>
            <li>This is great , but it can be hard to find .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative for people who have sensitive skin &amp; suffer from harsh fragrances in their products.</li>
            <li>and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the pure cashmere.  </li>
            <li>On another note it&#x27;s probably wise to stock up at this price because it&#x27;s getting hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li>It lathers very gently &amp; caresses you in soft moisturizing foaminess.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body wash hands down.</li>

            <li>My teenagers say their skin feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Using it for years has resulted in the soft, touchable skin my husband loves.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft when your done using it</li>
            <li>I love the price and you can not find this brand of Softsoap in stores anymore (at least not in my area).</li>

            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it moisturized me skin at all, but it also doesn&#x27;t mess with the moisture balance of my skin, which I am very grateful for.</li>

            <li> This is the only body wash I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t bother my eczema. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it moisturized me skin at all, but it also doesn&#x27;t mess with the moisture balance of my skin, which I am very grateful for. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it on here in bulk. The 6 pack lasts me the better part of a year.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff. It has a very light scent and leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft. I have reduced the amount of lotion I have to use each day because this body wash provides lots of moisture for my skin.

            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive/dry skin.  It&#x27;s the only wash I have found that I can use and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the pure cashmere.  Shipping is fast and secure (no leakage).</li>
