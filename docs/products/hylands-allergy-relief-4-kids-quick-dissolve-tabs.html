    <ol>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>and I even got my stuborn (but wonderful) Hubby to try and use it too.  </li>
            <li>What a great product!!!!</li>
            <li>This product is great for seasonal allergies!  </li>
            <li>These pills work great!!!</li>
            <li>UM ALL I can say is AWESOME stuff!  </li>
            <li>These are great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to get away with over the counter allergy products from drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works good for my granddaughter 2 1/2 and grandson 8!  </li>
            <li>Great allergy relief that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling groggy.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re happy not having to give our son antihistamines.</li>
            <li>could see a great difference with my kid.</li>
            <li>this works great on my child, she doesn&#x27;t have the sniffles and sneezes after a day of taking this product</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>We have successfully kept allergy symptoms at bay by taking these every morning during allergy season.  </li>
            <li>and I feel good about skipping all the chemicals and synthetic stuff.</li>
            <li>and this is a good company.</li>
            <li>Just as effective</li>
            <li>These pills are working wonderfully for a friend&#x27;s child currently, with none of the side effects my children &amp; I experienced.</li>
            <li>It was kind of an impulse purchase.  </li>
            <li>and he is allergic to many things.  </li>
            <li>I have used many of Hyland&#x27;s products for years with my children, but just tried these allergy tabs as an alternative to zyrtec for seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li>After 2 doses she was much better &amp; the itching had subsided.</li>
            <li>However, we&#x27;re pleased with the fast-acting results of Hylands Allergy Relief 4 Kids.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I should have read the reviews and / or did research more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>If that works, then you take 3 more every 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>X 8) tablets to start, 3 more in four hours...assume you are awake for 12 hours...</li>
            <li>Up to 24 to start, 3 more at 4 hour intervals...  (children 6 to 12)&lt;br</li>
            <li>two at a time every 15 minutes until he starts to feel better.  </li>
            <li>No issues with swimming pool / pollen or rolling on the lawn.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue this for some more time.</li>
            <li>These quick dissolve tabs are amazing.</li>
            <li>Works great for my 3 year old!  </li>
            <li>Easy to take</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried this with the most success.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s experienced no side effects after several dosages over the weeks.</li>
            <li>I tried these pills on my 4 year old son after hearing good reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>I do also carry two other forms (liquid and pill) of allergy medicine as well as an epi-pen, just in case, but I do my very best to make sure that case never happens by keeping these always at the ready.</li>
            <li>When I would be a little hesitant to give him something &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; or use an epi-pen, I don&#x27;t hesitate to use these, and I think a quick reaction to any sign of allergic reaction is one of the best ways to keep him from having to go to the hospital.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but took much to long to get here</li>
            <li>My 8 yr old responded better to this than claritin!</li>
            <li>so I thought why not try this and see if it knocks the rash out who knows right!?  </li>
            <li>And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the product is a great value compared with other, more famous, over-the-counter allergy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ran into this hyland&#x27;s allergy relief quick dissolve tabs, 125 count.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and that she does get relief!</li>
            <li>It worked better than five other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; allergy meds and best thing other than working is there are no side effects.</li>
            <li>I just wish you could rate it higher!</li>
            <li>But at the time I was thining...wow, that&#x27;s about 4 month&#x27;s worth of allergy</li>
            <li>Claritin, $18 delivered price, for 30 days&#x27; worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyland&#x27;s Allergy Relief, about $64 delivered price, for 30 days&#x27; worth  </li>
            <li>This surely builds vital strength for my kid</li>
            <li>Other wise i like the product</li>
            <li>This was a good value over other sites I shop from</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s runny nose clears right up with this.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to take, and tastes fine, but it WORKS.</li>
            <li>Very mild and so natural!  </li>
            <li>OK, I should state that I suffer from MULTIPLE allergies.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re always on the lookout for new and more natural approaches to treat his symptoms - sneezing, stuffy nose, and</li>
            <li>A good natural remedy if you don&#x27;t want your child to be ingesting unnatural chemicals found in other medicines.</li>
            <li>Ditch Benadryl - this stuff is much easier and</li>
            <li>But this has really changed my mind.</li>
            <li>It really helped my preemie son.</li>
            <li>It really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t reprint the whole thing...</li>
            <li>It definitely works and it came by mail pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>This product saves me...when my child&#x60;s cough can be stopped with any other product, it does, and let him to rest and get better.</li>
            <li>For myself (middle age man), I have found zyrtec to be pretty effective, and claritin to be somewhat less so</li>
            <li>recently married a wonderful young lady who has an 8 year old son who suffers from indoor and outdoor allergies.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they no longer carry these particular products or</li>
            <li>Really helps 2 year old with itchy eyes and nose!</li>
            <li>Works really well for my 5-year old with mild to moderate seasonal allergies and I feel comfortable giving it to him over other medication that contain a mixture of chemicals and aspartame.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like homeopathics.</li>
            <li>I am much more at ease using these and to tell you the truth, they work every bit as well and dont have the side effects or harsh meds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Parents, some of the other products available on Amazon.com that we use (and recommend) to alleviate our son&#x27;s allergies and asthma are listed below.</li>
            <li>My daughters suffer from frequent runny noses and allergies and these products seem to help without the side effects of over the counter remedies you normally find.</li>
            <li>- they dissolve quickly with little to no taste - and they really seem to help.  </li>
            <li>B0027U33VE Hylands Allergy Relief 4 Kids]] took care of the sneezing and itchy eyes but couldn&#x27;t clear his stuffy nose.</li>
            <li>Trying to get allergy medicine in a 6 yr old boy was like pulling teeth.</li>
            <li>I like that it is completely natural eliminating concerns about safety.</li>
            <li>(but still offers</li>
            <li>125 tablets is about 4 days&#x27; worth of medicine, if you follow the directions carefully.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a shot to those who need to give their kids allergy meds and are concerned about the less natural alternative medications.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd year that no Rx is needed (so far).</li>
            <li>My daughter has had some mild symptoms the past and current spring when all the flowers and trees bloom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, we realize homeopathic remedies aren&#x27;t a guaranteed success, no more so than traditional medicine.</li>

            <li> I prefer these natural allergy tabs over other medications.</li>
            <li> Our youngest son (age 8) suffers from allergies and exercise-induced asthma.</li>
            <li> Every summer my child has skin reactions to either excessive chlorine in pools, rough sand from the beach, sunscreen....or a mix of these things on her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish I could find these products locally again.</li>
            <li> As a parent, I gave my first two kids the tylenol cold and allergy meds as little kids only when needed but was horrified when I learned the FDA pulled them and changed it to only 6 and up because of the fatalities cited.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as the other Hyland products.</li>
            <li> That worked, but it&#x27;s terribly expensive (compared to adult generic loratadine, for example)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has severe food and seasonal allergies, and if I notice even the least sign of allergic reaction (rash, puffy eyes, trouble breathing, etc.)  </li>
            <li> These get us through the allergy/pollen season without conventional medicines.  </li>
            <li> my kids don&#x27;t mind taking it one bit versus trying to syringe sticky yucky syrup down their throats.  </li>
            <li> I am sure this stuff works for some people, so I don&#x27;t want to drag the score down too badly for my poor luck.</li>
            <li> Math could be a little off, but that&#x27;s the way I read the directions anyway.  </li>
            <li> It was an unfortunate reminder that what may work for one, won&#x27;t necessarily work for another.  </li>
            <li> And in the past it has taken forever to heal the rash up to the point where by the time it almost heals she irritates it again and the cycle continues until the end of the summer</li>
            <li> His allergies are worse in the spring and fall with pollen.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my children &amp; self, &amp; while they did help with our allergies, we reacted poorly to them.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband is constantly reaching for it during this horrible allergy season.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sheesh, and I thought the Claritin was expensive...</li>
            <li> So my disappointment is partly my fault&lt;br /&gt;Having said that...</li>
            <li> He hated it all: tastes bad, makes me feel yucky, doesn&#x27;t work ...</li>
            <li> My kids hate taking liquids allergy meds and these work just as well.</li>
            <li> One time I got a horrible sinus headache.</li>

            <li> My daughter has had some mild symptoms the past and current spring when all the flowers and trees bloom. She&#x27;s had some congestion and runny/stuffy nose and watery eyes. We&#x27;ve tried this with the most success. I love that it&#x27;s natural and that she does get relief!</li>
            <li> Works great for my 3 year old!  Easy to take and she likes them!</li>
            <li> i wish it had a decongestant in it. Other wise i like the product</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old responded better to this than claritin!</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Even my husband is constantly reaching for it during this horrible allergy season.  Works great!  Ditch Benadryl - this stuff is much easier and my kids don&#x27;t mind taking it one bit versus trying to syringe sticky yucky syrup down their throats.  Just as effective and I feel good about skipping all the chemicals and synthetic stuff.</li>
            <li> Trying to get allergy medicine in a 6 yr old boy was like pulling teeth. He hated it all: tastes bad, makes me feel yucky, doesn&#x27;t work ... You name it I heard it. I had luck with Hyland&#x27;s teething tablets so when I saw this product I had to try it. OH MY !!!  Thank the Heavens. Not only is it easy to take, and tastes fine, but it WORKS. It worked better than five other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; allergy meds and best thing other than working is there are no side effects. It worked so well that I use it too and I even got my stuborn (but wonderful) Hubby to try and use it too.  What a great product!!!! I just wish you could rate it higher!</li>
            <li> Really helps 2 year old with itchy eyes and nose!</li>
            <li> This product is great for seasonal allergies!  My daughter&#x27;s runny nose clears right up with this.  She&#x27;s experienced no side effects after several dosages over the weeks.</li>
            <li> We have successfully kept allergy symptoms at bay by taking these every morning during allergy season.  This is the 2nd year that no Rx is needed (so far).</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as the other Hyland products.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t like homeopathics. But this has really changed my mind. It really helped my preemie son. One time I got a horrible sinus headache. I didn&#x27;t have anything on hand as it is not something that happens often at all. So I took some of these, extra than what I give my son. It really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Impressed</li>
            <li> These get us through the allergy/pollen season without conventional medicines.  They work well for my daughter&#x27;s seasonal allergies.  I am thankful for them.</li>
            <li> As a parent, I gave my first two kids the tylenol cold and allergy meds as little kids only when needed but was horrified when I learned the FDA pulled them and changed it to only 6 and up because of the fatalities cited. I am much more at ease using these and to tell you the truth, they work every bit as well and dont have the side effects or harsh meds.</li>
            <li> Great allergy relief that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling groggy.</li>
            <li> These quick dissolve tabs are amazing. My 3 kids don&#x27;t mind taking them - they dissolve quickly with little to no taste - and they really seem to help.  I prefer these natural allergy tabs over other medications.</li>
            <li> Great product, but took much to long to get here so I had to give my doggie Benedryl in the meantime.  I like that it is completely natural eliminating concerns about safety.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my 5-year old with mild to moderate seasonal allergies and I feel comfortable giving it to him over other medication that contain a mixture of chemicals and aspartame.</li>
            <li> Very mild and so natural!  It works good for my granddaughter 2 1/2 and grandson 8!  Highly recommend this product! cw</li>
            <li> I am sure this stuff works for some people, so I don&#x27;t want to drag the score down too badly for my poor luck. This is one of those hit or miss products. It is definitely worth a shot to those who need to give their kids allergy meds and are concerned about the less natural alternative medications.</li>
            <li> My son always seems to have a stuffy nose - we went to test his for allergies and he is allergic to many things.  His allergies are worse in the spring and fall with pollen.  These pills work great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used homeopathic remedies for several years now, on myself and on my children.  I bought these for my children &amp; self, &amp; while they did help with our allergies, we reacted poorly to them.  We had to come off them immediately.  It was an unfortunate reminder that what may work for one, won&#x27;t necessarily work for another.  These pills are working wonderfully for a friend&#x27;s child currently, with none of the side effects my children &amp; I experienced.</li>
            <li> My family loves these! My kids hate taking liquids allergy meds and these work just as well. I&#x27;ve used them for myself as well.</li>
            <li> I have used many of Hyland&#x27;s products for years with my children, but just tried these allergy tabs as an alternative to zyrtec for seasonal allergies. My daughter, who has never had any reaction to any food or medication, had one to this product. I followed the dosing on the package for her age (5 yrs.) and the very next morning she woke up itching with welts/hives on her belly, legs &amp; arms. We took her to her doctor and he said she was having an allergic reaction &amp; said to give her Benadryl. After 2 doses she was much better &amp; the itching had subsided. My son (7 yrs.) took the tabs with no reaction.</li>
            <li> I tried these pills on my 4 year old son after hearing good reviews about it.  It definitely works and it came by mail pretty quick.  I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Our youngest son (age 8) suffers from allergies and exercise-induced asthma. We&#x27;re always on the lookout for new and more natural approaches to treat his symptoms - sneezing, stuffy nose, and itchy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0027U33VE Hylands Allergy Relief 4 Kids]] took care of the sneezing and itchy eyes but couldn&#x27;t clear his stuffy nose. We followed the directions for children ages 6-11 years: Dissolve 3 tablets under tongue every 15 minutes for up to 8 doses until relieved; then every 4 hours as required. We gave our son three doses over a 45-minute time frame. We cleared his stuffy nose with the aid of a [[ASIN:B000ITHH86 NeilMed Neti Pot]] so there was no need to add another dosage four hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, we realize homeopathic remedies aren&#x27;t a guaranteed success, no more so than traditional medicine. However, we&#x27;re pleased with the fast-acting results of Hylands Allergy Relief 4 Kids. Maybe, with regular use, it will relieve our son&#x27;s stuffy nose, too. We&#x27;re happy not having to give our son antihistamines. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the product is a great value compared with other, more famous, over-the-counter allergy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents, some of the other products available on Amazon.com that we use (and recommend) to alleviate our son&#x27;s allergies and asthma are listed below. Hopefully, they can be of help for your child as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002WC83EO 3M Filtrete 2200 MPR Elite Allergen Reduction Filter]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BVIB1A Carlson Kids Chewable DHA]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CQU53C Childrens DHA 250 mg Strawberry Flavor By Nordic Naturals]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007DFJA6 Nordic Naturals DHA Junior]]</li>
            <li> Every summer my child has skin reactions to either excessive chlorine in pools, rough sand from the beach, sunscreen....or a mix of these things on her sensitive skin.  And in the past it has taken forever to heal the rash up to the point where by the time it almost heals she irritates it again and the cycle continues until the end of the summer so I thought why not try this and see if it knocks the rash out who knows right!?  Well within only a couple of hours her speckled heat looking rash went from itchy and all over her forearm to BAM NO ITCH and GONE the next morning.  AND it hasnt returned.  UM ALL I can say is AWESOME stuff!  So this works on sneezes as well as rashes from sensitivities!  A must try!</li>
            <li> OK, I should state that I suffer from MULTIPLE allergies.  For myself (middle age man), I have found zyrtec to be pretty effective, and claritin to be somewhat less so (but still offers relief)&lt;br /&gt;I recently married a wonderful young lady who has an 8 year old son who suffers from indoor and outdoor allergies.  I started him on children&#x27;s claritin.  That worked, but it&#x27;s terribly expensive (compared to adult generic loratadine, for example)&lt;br /&gt;I of course wondered if there might be a less-expensive alternative.  I ran into this hyland&#x27;s allergy relief quick dissolve tabs, 125 count.  It was kind of an impulse purchase.  But at the time I was thining...wow, that&#x27;s about 4 month&#x27;s worth of allergy relief.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!  Like I said, I should have read the reviews and / or did research more thoroughly.  So my disappointment is partly my fault&lt;br /&gt;Having said that...&lt;br /&gt;This medicine is probably the most expensive allergy medicine you could buy, for children.  125 tablets is about 4 days&#x27; worth of medicine, if you follow the directions carefully.  I won&#x27;t reprint the whole thing...but you take 3 at a time (up to 8 times).  If that works, then you take 3 more every 4 hours.  So...&lt;br /&gt;(3 X 8) tablets to start, 3 more in four hours...assume you are awake for 12 hours...&lt;br /&gt;***  33 TABLETS A DAY?!?!?!?!?  ***&lt;br /&gt;My Math could be a little off, but that&#x27;s the way I read the directions anyway.  Up to 24 to start, 3 more at 4 hour intervals...  (children 6 to 12)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s compare the cost of medicine here, Amazon prices (rounded)&lt;br /&gt;Children&#x27;s Claritin, $18 delivered price, for 30 days&#x27; worth&lt;br /&gt;Hyland&#x27;s Allergy Relief, about $64 delivered price, for 30 days&#x27; worth  (one box is almost 4 days&#x27; worth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh, and I thought the Claritin was expensive...</li>
            <li> I had to order this online because these Hyland&#x27;s products never seem to be on the shelves at my local Walgreen&#x27;s, Kroger, HEB, Walmart or CVS. I don&#x27;t know if they no longer carry these particular products or what but I used to use them regularly until I could no longer find them. My daughters suffer from frequent runny noses and allergies and these products seem to help without the side effects of over the counter remedies you normally find. My only complaint is that I wish I could find these products locally again.</li>
            <li> somehow, these seem to work.</li>
            <li> This was a good value over other sites I shop from and this is a good company. Don&#x27;t expect homeopathic remedies to work like non-homeopathic ones. Multiple doses are needed to see relief, just follow the directions. A good natural remedy if you don&#x27;t want your child to be ingesting unnatural chemicals found in other medicines.</li>
            <li> These are great!  My 3 year old son has severe food and seasonal allergies, and if I notice even the least sign of allergic reaction (rash, puffy eyes, trouble breathing, etc.)  I immediately start giving him these- two at a time every 15 minutes until he starts to feel better.  When I would be a little hesitant to give him something &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; or use an epi-pen, I don&#x27;t hesitate to use these, and I think a quick reaction to any sign of allergic reaction is one of the best ways to keep him from having to go to the hospital.  I do also carry two other forms (liquid and pill) of allergy medicine as well as an epi-pen, just in case, but I do my very best to make sure that case never happens by keeping these always at the ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to get away with over the counter allergy products from drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I could see a great difference with my kid. No issues with swimming pool / pollen or rolling on the lawn.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue this for some more time. This surely builds vital strength for my kid</li>
            <li> this works great on my child, she doesn&#x27;t have the sniffles and sneezes after a day of taking this product</li>
