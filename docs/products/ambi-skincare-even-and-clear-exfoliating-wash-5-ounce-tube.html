    <ol>
            <li>and I have to say that this is the best!  </li>
            <li>The best part about this product is the cost.  </li>

            <li>Great face wash</li>
            <li>It was a great price and you do get a lot.</li>
            <li>if youre like me and need a good scrub/exfoliating experience, you might want to consider something else</li>
            <li>But everything else is good about the product.</li>
            <li>I started using this face wash because i was having breakouts,and decided to try this product from the good reviews.</li>
            <li>this is good face wash.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t believe my results.</li>
            <li>I use it 3x per week, and it keeps my skin nice.  </li>
            <li>Not the best out there, by any stretch, but it does the job if you&#x27;re not looking to spend much.</li>
            <li>It works but it does not go on your face very smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many face cleaners and spot removers etc.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been getting so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I just love using it.</li>
            <li>I love the smoothness and creaminess of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>is much more even.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It also has helped make my skin&#x27;s texture smoother and my complexion more even.</li>
            <li>I try to let it sit on my face after rubbing it around my skin, for more effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>My favorite cleaner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Ambi</li>
            <li>I have also tried more abrasive products thinking that a deeper, harsher scrub would solicit a greater effect.  </li>
            <li>I love this exfoliating wash.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>have more pimple than before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But then, of course, a good cleanser is the first step to better skin.</li>
            <li>The granules are very fine and help keep skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>While it did a great job at exfoliating and making my skin feel clean, it didn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
            <li>A $6 cleanser isn&#x27;t going to do any miracles, but it is a very good basic cleanser and light exfoliator.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>but I do recommend that you have to wash your blankets, pillow covers, and for whatever bed stuff you have and make sure its clean.</li>
            <li>my skin tone, otherwise it&#x27;s a fine face wash.</li>
            <li>is going to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap, why not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>So far so good .</li>
            <li>My wife was happy with this purchase, Not sure how good the product is, only that my wife is very pleased with it</li>
            <li>So I ordered off of amazon and was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>by&amp;#34; dates as they are important on any sunscreen product and the odor takes some getting used to, although it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>I do not think there is anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>this seems more like a gentle cleanser than anything else.</li>
            <li>keeps my breakouts to a minimal and the best thing is that most of the litttle dark/reddish marks i had all over my face, left by acne, it has evened out my skin.tone to a level its bever been before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells, which is fresh and clean, and the way my face feels after applying it.</li>
            <li>I have been faithfully using the Exfoliating wash nightly and the complexion bar and moisturizer every morning, and in less than two weeks, there has been a great improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s worth it to note that there is added fragrance to this product).</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, goes on smoothly, and provides good protection from UV rays.</li>
            <li>Ambi is a great product, for problem skin with pimples and black heads, it takes a little while to work and get your skin in good shape.  </li>
            <li>The pump gives out just the right amount to use and doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li>This face soap/scrub and the scent is light and not at all harsh for my sensitive skin...but very effective.  </li>
            <li>This product is really good; my scarves in my face are a bit less visible now.  </li>
            <li>There is one more secrete to getting results to clear skin that I don&#x27;t hear anyone talk much about.</li>
            <li>This wash is very gentle</li>
            <li>Very gentle and can be used every day.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Used with the face cream, I can walk outside with no makeup on and be confident.</li>
            <li>I been trying  many different products for my face..</li>
            <li>Overall, an okay product</li>
            <li>This is a gentle exfoliator which isn&#x27;t too harsh on the skin - it has a pleasant smell, too.</li>
            <li>but this product didn&#x27;t do much for me not enough exfoliating balls :)</li>
            <li>The exfoliation beads are tiny, fine grains that give a really deep refreshing clense.  </li>
            <li>my skins super soft but tha spots and blemishes</li>
            <li>It did nothing for me except dry out my skin and give me more skin issues.</li>
            <li>This gets just as good if not better results than most other cleansers at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really judge if it helps acne much, since I don&#x27;t really have that problem, but I doubt this alone</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, you just have to be patient &amp; wait about 4-5 weeks to see your skin start to fade &amp; clear up, otherwise it was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have much expectations going in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my experience that products for \\&quot;our\\&quot; skin normally don&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t eat anything else for that whole day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly oily, or overly drying, and seems to work well for your whole face with just a dime sized dab.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference it</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to clean without stripping.  </li>
            <li>There are tons of other products that cost way more.  </li>
            <li>but i am a very light skinned Hispanic woman and when i scar, i scar dark brown</li>
            <li>Ambi Skincare Even &amp; clear Exfoliating Wash works pretty well</li>
            <li>id, bare essentials skin care line and clean and clear, anything that you can buy without a prescription.</li>
            <li>It also has a light natural smell that I personally don&#x27;t mind at all</li>
            <li>I drink nothing but a galon of water mixed with 2 cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice and a couple of table spoons of honey for a whole day once a month.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping it would deliver a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Along with this wash I also use Ambi Skincare Fade Cream for Normal Skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do product reviews, but wanted to provide insight into my experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product for long, so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s accurate that it clears up breakouts, but it definitely lightened my acne scars.</li>
            <li>how well it does on the clear skin issue, though.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since before puberty.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Ambi Skincare Even &amp; Clear foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I bought this poroduct thinking it was going to clear my face</li>
            <li>I do not feel like it helped clear up acne, nor did it improve my skin tone and texture-</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin with acne scars</li>
            <li>and I have noticed my breakouts stopped almost completely.</li>
            <li>Of course if you have sensitive skin or prone to rosacea then don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>i dont even have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have not gotten any new outbreaks, and my current blemishes are drying up</li>
            <li>I had tried other \\&quot;Three Step\\&quot; processes, and all I ended up with was over dried skin and even more acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American female and was getting large whiteheads around my chin area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too frothy or foaming, which can be good or bad depending on your tastes, but the bottom line is that it leaves your skin fresh and clean without irritating.</li>
            <li>It is my hope that my face will be completely clear within the next couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only negative is the extremely strong smell-it lingers on your face way after you wash it.</li>
            <li>and I look center after 2 months of steady use.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old african american female.</li>
            <li>However, a recent battle with hormonal acne (onset in mid thirties) and a layoff forced me to find an economical option to clear up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helped with my black heads.</li>

            <li> Ambi  hasn&#x27;t helped completely clear my acne, but it seems to keep it at bay a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with dark spots from acne.</li>
            <li> As long as it continues to work, I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> as far as correcting uneven skin tone it didn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but keep coming back to this one.</li>

            <li> (I have naturally dry skin) .</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin or irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a moisturiser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product especially because it can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> My dark marks are even starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing action is not too harsh like with some other exfoliators.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a few days (alternate between the 2) and feel like they&#x27;re making my spots less noticeable and making my skin softer.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this, I remember I had some rough patches of skin, like bumps or something.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few facial clensears that have worked for me.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical because usually face washes dry out my skin; however, this one makes your face feel so baby soft.</li>
            <li> no acnes, black spots and don&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> since i gave up.on all other products that dont even work.</li>

            <li> I have slight rosacea on my cheeks</li>

            <li> takes two weeks before you see results after everyday use.</li>

            <li> It keeps dead skin at bay and breakouts away ...unless I drink a soda.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I tried almost everything out there to the least expensive to expensive</li>
            <li> It is not to harsh on my skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old african american female. I started using this product a month ago and I honestly can&#x27;t believe my results. I&#x27;ve used so many face cleaners and spot removers etc. None have helped me the way Ambi has. I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve had bad acne and really sensitive skin all my life. After using Ambi my acne has been fading off. I have been getting so many compliments on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily just enough to keep my skin moist. Along with this wash I also use Ambi Skincare Fade Cream for Normal Skin. It works wonders. My dark spots have faded almost to the point where you can&#x27;t see them. It&#x27;s only been a month. I&#x27;ve had these marks and scars for years. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Im a African American woman and I&#x27;ve been using tha fade cream and the wash for a month now and i stiil have dark spots my skins super soft but tha spots and blemishes r still there...im gonna continue for another month and see how it goes!</li>
            <li> My skin is clearing up and I look center after 2 months of steady use. I feel refreshed and clean. I just love using it.</li>
            <li> This product is really good; my scarves in my face are a bit less visible now.  I am using this product for over 1 month now.    Too bad this product is not for sale in Holland! I have to re order soon.</li>
            <li> easy to use. takes two weeks before you see results after everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love the smoothness and creaminess of this product.  Would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical because usually face washes dry out my skin; however, this one makes your face feel so baby soft. I love it</li>
            <li> This is recommended for women of color but i am a very light skinned Hispanic woman and when i scar, i scar dark brown so I figured I would try this anyway. Okay so I suffer from really bad acne and have for years. I have tried everything on the market from proactive to skin id, bare essentials skin care line and clean and clear, anything that you can buy without a prescription. SO when i ran across Ambi skin care line, i figured ahy it&#x27;s cheap, why not. So I ordered off of amazon and was not disappointed at all. I used this with the skin bleaching face cream to get rid of my dark acne scars as well. I&#x27;ve been using the face wash for almost two weeks now and see a noticeable difference. I have not had a break out since i began to use the product and my skin tone is much more even. Used with the face cream, I can walk outside with no makeup on and be confident. Something that i would never of done two weeks ago. If you have bad acne and acne scars, use. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Great product...been using it for about 2yrs, and my skin has improved. My dark spots have faded, and I hardly experience any breakouts.The only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s not available in most stores of late. Walmart and target don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore, so you might have to order online....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female and was getting large whiteheads around my chin area. I started using this and have not had a whitehead since. I think I had too much dead skin. This wash is very gentle so I can use it once a day then apply a toner. My dark marks are even starting to disappear. Love it!</li>
            <li> Item as promised. Fast shipping. Great Seller recommended 100%. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far so good . Today I received the package on time and let me tell you my skin is in bad condition .it&#x27;s dry ,uneven with some breakouts so my skin needed help and when I used the product today I notice a slight difference ,my skin felt fresher and didn&#x27;t dry up so bad (I have naturally dry skin) . My skin breakouts went down . But I can&#x27;t rate it a 5 star because this is just day one but I do recommend that you have to wash your blankets, pillow covers, and for whatever bed stuff you have and make sure its clean. Because that can also be  the cause of breakouts and acne and bad skin.</li>
            <li> i got a really bad foundation and my face is filled with marks and pimples i&#x27;m trying to clear out. this seems more like a gentle cleanser than anything else. if youre like me and need a good scrub/exfoliating experience, you might want to consider something else</li>
            <li> Very gentle and can be used every day. I have tried other brands but keep coming back to this one. The granules are very fine and help keep skin smooth.  It is also non-drying.</li>
            <li> great buy and im  using this product for my face. no acnes, black spots and don&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> Ambi Skincare Even &amp; clear Exfoliating Wash works pretty well, you just have to be patient &amp; wait about 4-5 weeks to see your skin start to fade &amp; clear up, otherwise it was definitely worth the purchase. I would recommend this product to those reviewing the ratings of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with dark spots from acne. I read rave reviews and ordered this product and the Foaming Cleanser. I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a few days (alternate between the 2) and feel like they&#x27;re making my spots less noticeable and making my skin softer. The scrubbing action is not too harsh like with some other exfoliators.     The only negative is the extremely strong smell-it lingers on your face way after you wash it. But everything else is good about the product.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I Didn&#x27;t know this was targetted to african american women when I got it. I&#x27;m white actually I only use it once a day. that is when.i take my nightly shower. over the past few months my skin has improved a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my breakouts to a minimal and the best thing is that most of the litttle dark/reddish marks i had all over my face, left by acne, it has evened out my skin.tone to a level its bever been before.&lt;br /&gt;I attribute the improvements to this product and using mineral make up. since i gave up.on all other products that dont even work.</li>
            <li> Ambi  hasn&#x27;t helped completely clear my acne, but it seems to keep it at bay a little bit. It also has helped make my skin&#x27;s texture smoother and my complexion more even. I use it once a day. I try to let it sit on my face after rubbing it around my skin, for more effectiveness.  Before I started using this, I remember I had some rough patches of skin, like bumps or something. This face wash got rid of that.  I like the way it smells, which is fresh and clean, and the way my face feels after applying it.</li>
            <li> A $6 cleanser isn&#x27;t going to do any miracles, but it is a very good basic cleanser and light exfoliator. It&#x27;s thick, which I prefer because I hate watery liquid cleansers, and gentle enough for anyone. I can&#x27;t really judge if it helps acne much, since I don&#x27;t really have that problem, but I doubt this alone is going to make a huge difference. But then, of course, a good cleanser is the first step to better skin. It also has a light natural smell that I personally don&#x27;t mind at all (it&#x27;s worth it to note that there is added fragrance to this product). It only takes a small amount for your whole face, so a 5oz tube will last a while even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d be happy to buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleaner. Scrubs buts doesn&#x27;t tear skin.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle exfoliator which isn&#x27;t too harsh on the skin - it has a pleasant smell, too. I&#x27;m not too sure how well it does on the clear skin issue, though.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not too heavy, goes on smoothly, and provides good protection from UV rays. My skin is very fair and prone to freckle. Ambi helps even out my skin tones. The pump gives out just the right amount to use and doesn&#x27;t clog up. My only cautions are: watch the &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; dates as they are important on any sunscreen product and the odor takes some getting used to, although it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> This face soap/scrub and the scent is light and not at all harsh for my sensitive skin...but very effective.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap in the mornings for years.  It keeps dead skin at bay and breakouts away ...unless I drink a soda.</li>
            <li> I love Ambi but this product didn&#x27;t do much for me not enough exfoliating balls :)</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. I definitely recommend this product especially because it can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do product reviews, but wanted to provide insight into my experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have much expectations going in.  It&#x27;s been my experience that products for \\&quot;our\\&quot; skin normally don&#x27;t do much.  However, a recent battle with hormonal acne (onset in mid thirties) and a layoff forced me to find an economical option to clear up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambi has done the job.  I had tried other \\&quot;Three Step\\&quot; processes, and all I ended up with was over dried skin and even more acne.  I have also tried more abrasive products thinking that a deeper, harsher scrub would solicit a greater effect.  Ambi has proved me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been faithful with skin care systems or regimens, so the simplicity of using one product appealed to me.  I have been faithfully using the Exfoliating wash nightly and the complexion bar and moisturizer every morning, and in less than two weeks, there has been a great improvement in my skin.  I have not gotten any new outbreaks, and my current blemishes are drying up (although slower than I would like... it takes time for pimples under the skin to heal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, the hyperpigmentation left by past blemishes (I can&#x27;t resist popping pimples) is getting lighter as well.  It is my hope that my face will be completely clear within the next couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin or irritate the skin.  It&#x27;s simple.  It&#x27;s cheap.  As long as it continues to work, I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> My wife was happy with this purchase, Not sure how good the product is, only that my wife is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for long, so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s accurate that it clears up breakouts, but it definitely lightened my acne scars.</li>
            <li> This product has little hard something in it. It goes on rough like it has little crystals or something. It works but it does not go on your face very smooth.</li>
            <li> I been trying  many different products for my face..&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin with acne scars I am 40&#x27;s..&lt;br /&gt;using expensive, cheap, brand names, generic,dermatology approved, and finally this work for me.&lt;br /&gt;happy with purchase.. i will b uy again</li>
            <li> I love this product, I tried almost everything out there to the least expensive to expensive and I have to say that this is the best!  It does even your skin and make it glow.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of everything.  This is one of the few facial clensears that have worked for me.  The exfoliation beads are tiny, fine grains that give a really deep refreshing clense.  It has a moisturiser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  There is one more secrete to getting results to clear skin that I don&#x27;t hear anyone talk much about. I started doing a colon cleans once a month with a honey, lemon water.  I drink nothing but a galon of water mixed with 2 cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice and a couple of table spoons of honey for a whole day once a month.  I don&#x27;t eat anything else for that whole day. After doing this in conjunction with the Ambi facial wash it has done wonders. My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since before puberty.  The best part about this product is the cost.  There are tons of other products that cost way more.  This gets just as good if not better results than most other cleansers at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash because i was having breakouts,and decided to try this product from the good reviews. i use it every other day and I have noticed my breakouts stopped almost completely.I will definitely keep using abmbi products.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating wash.  It has done wonders on my face. I use it with the Ambi Skincare Even &amp; Clear foaming cleanser.  They work well together.  It is not to harsh on my skin.  I use it with a loofah.  It makes my skin feel great when I get out the shower.  I use this about twice a week. It really helped with my black heads.</li>
            <li> Great face wash if you like one with an exfoliator.  Of course if you have sensitive skin or prone to rosacea then don&#x27;t use it every day. I have slight rosacea on my cheeks so I only use a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry your skin out.  It is gentle enough to clean without stripping.  I use it 3x per week, and it keeps my skin nice.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I do not think there is anything special about this product. It does what any other scrub is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this poroduct thinking it was going to clear my face and it ended up breaking the left side of my face out worse.... i dont even have sensitive skin i dont know what went wrong but WARNING it could happen to you</li>
            <li> this is good face wash. it works well. it exfoliates while you wash your face and corrects uneven skin tone. supposed to help with acne too. to me it helped a little with the acne but not a lot. as far as correcting uneven skin tone it didn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me except dry out my skin and give me more skin issues. Never buy this product</li>
            <li> Ambi is a great product, for problem skin with pimples and black heads, it takes a little while to work and get your skin in good shape.  I like it very much.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this and Amazon is the only place I could find it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent cleanser. Not the best out there, by any stretch, but it does the job if you&#x27;re not looking to spend much. I recommend using it upon waking when there are no traces of makeup left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too frothy or foaming, which can be good or bad depending on your tastes, but the bottom line is that it leaves your skin fresh and clean without irritating. It&#x27;s not overly oily, or overly drying, and seems to work well for your whole face with just a dime sized dab. The only downside to this is that it&#x27;s not as exfoliating as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little while ago on Amazon and used it about 2-3 times a week at night for about a month and a half. While it did a great job at exfoliating and making my skin feel clean, it didn&#x27;t do much else. I do not feel like it helped clear up acne, nor did it improve my skin tone and texture- two things Ambi claims to do. If you&#x27;re looking for a product to just get rid of dead skin cells, you might think about purchasing this. It was a great price and you do get a lot. However, I wanted a product that improved the appearance of my skin and also helped reduce acne and it did not do either of those things. Overall, an okay product but I was hoping it would deliver a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Great on oily skins cleans very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now,&lt;br /&gt;I have more pimple than before.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recomment this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference it my skin tone, otherwise it&#x27;s a fine face wash.</li>
