            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this mirror!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good - the 7 x magnification is very good.  </li>
            <li>Again, thanks Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li>mirror has a great look and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is great for the price, just accept that you will encounter issues with the light bulb.</li>
            <li>I needed a brighter light to beat the shadows and side window in my bathroom, but this lighting didn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>I am far-sighted, yet find the illumination quite bright and the 5X magnification more than I need.</li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy product.</li>
            <li>I received this item in a very timely manner and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Still, it would be nice if this confusion were headed off by the vendor by not displaying incorrect product images.</li>
            <li>with is still nice for doing eyebrows or putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice compliment to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The double sides are awesome for magnification and the lights are great for make-up application.</li>
            <li>Great for plucking any facial hair and the lighting is perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve considered buying one of my own.</li>
            <li>it comes in handy</li>
            <li>handy</li>
            <li>Nice mirror.</li>
            <li>With both sides, you get the perfect perspective on how you really look.</li>
            <li>I needed a lighted mirror for my shave den and this does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The chrome frame does get a bit warm, but I&#x27;ve never burned myself with it.</li>
            <li>Very handy and precise.</li>
            <li>very nice mirror came quick</li>
            <li>the light does a good job according to her.</li>
            <li>Light bright.</li>
            <li>The light is not as bright as I would like.  </li>
            <li>It also looks nice on my vanity top.  </li>
            <li>I was able to determine that I would not have liked the magnification........</li>
            <li>This great looking mirror is just the right magnification for applying make up.  </li>
            <li>mirror is actually pretty nice: the lights are bright, magnification is what I need, and looks nice on my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mirror is the perfect size, the light works well, the cord is long, and the magnifying side is great.</li>
            <li>This one seemed to fit all of my specifications- large size, good quality, power cord with convenient power control, great style.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my daughter wanted, works great.</li>
            <li>This beautiful vanity mirror looks far more substantial than the photo illustrates!</li>
            <li>I think the beautiful and very well functioning design make this mirror a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>well I can honestly say that you have to be in a room where there is good light and the light from the mirror</li>
            <li>Sits nicely on counter and enables me to put on eye shadows and mascara easily.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for better visibility with the magnifying side of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>and it looks well-made and elegant in the online photos.</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it.......</li>
            <li>Love the lighted feature and the magnification on one side to help see close up.</li>
            <li>This mirror is okay.   </li>
            <li>I freaking love this mirror</li>
            <li>And for the 7x magnification lets just say my eyebrows have never been more on point</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say look for a better lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Top 2 photos with flash&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Despite that fact I love the mirror</li>
            <li>and it is lovely to look at.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I have a vanity but the light in my room is dim and this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the magnify mirror too.</li>
            <li>I have a good overhead light source and don&#x27;t need the light feature.</li>
            <li>This mirror is better than the $20 lighted Conair that&#x27;s sold in stores.</li>
            <li>sincerely th-t is not a problem.</li>
            <li>I love having this mirror on my vanity for makeup application and using the magnified side for plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The Conair BE47X fit the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li>Better than spending $100, though.</li>
            <li>Its and elegant piece</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this mirror</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I Love this.</li>
            <li>Mostly made of lower grade plastic.</li>
            <li>Mirror reflects well, nice amount of light.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The magnified side is perfect for eye and lip makeup, as well as eliminating unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li>I still have no answer for the question, but I am pleased that she likes it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, I use it for doing my makeup and</li>
            <li>Light surrounding the mirror has nice distribution causing no shade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then this would be a much better product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Light is nice.  </li>
            <li>Magnification shows me things I&#x27;m sure I want to see at 75.</li>
            <li>works better than the +$50 mirros at bed bath and beyond</li>
            <li>I love the size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year and is still working.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>The description said it is 8 inch tall, but actually it is more than 16 inch tall.</li>
            <li>The height is perfect on my dressing table and I can see my entire face.</li>
            <li>and this is sooo much better.</li>
            <li>I bought one for each of my 2 daughters, and they both love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it.  </li>
            <li>I buy most of my beauty products from them.  </li>
            <li>The light isnt very bright but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Most of us don&#x27;t live under photo shoot lights and this will be great for us.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The magnification is good and the light is adequate.</li>
            <li>The light is good, not too dim, not too bright.  </li>
            <li>The mirror magnification is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My mom still uses her old mirror (which is so bright it leaves spots in your vision for a minute or two), but this one is still nice too.</li>
            <li>I saw one for $129 at another store - and this was equally as good and more reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>light is just right and helps a lot if you don&#x27;t have good lighting in your room.</li>
            <li>The light is not so bright that it blinds you but bright enough that you can see without any additional lighting.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and great for makeup.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok with a light on in the room or sunlight.</li>
            <li>It was a great buy all the local stores carry battery only lighted mirrors and this one plugs in and made my wife very happy!!</li>
            <li>For the price, I dont think you could get a better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft light, could be brighter</li>
            <li>Well, I love this mirror, the light, the form and the color.</li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t cost much more than one without a light, and  it makes a world of difference to have the  illumination.  </li>
            <li>She loved mine so much I bought her one.</li>
            <li>forever but the best I could find was closed to fifty dollars!</li>
            <li>However it arrived with a bent stem that can&#x27;t easily be straightened.</li>
            <li>The 7X magnification is more powerful than most but doesn&#x27;t distort like cheaper mirrors.</li>
            <li>Illumination is ok but doesn&#x27;t substitute for more powerful task lighting.</li>
            <li>I assume that can easily be replaced though...</li>
            <li>mirror swivels easily to change sides &amp; magnification.</li>
            <li>I have another light-up mirror that uses really strong, blinding lights.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size to fit in the corner of my dresser and it looks nice too.</li>
            <li>I bought the first one and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It almost seems like a fire hazard, which is why I make sure to keep it in a cool area and unplugged.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to plug in a straightener, hair dryer, or even a hot plate for my coffee!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I exchanged it for another hassle-free and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The lighting is not the best, i am hoping to find replacement bulbs just a little brighter.</li>
            <li>so this is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>The light works well</li>
            <li>light stopped working 3 months after purchase</li>
            <li>It swivels smoothly and stays put when you adjust the angle of the mirror.</li>
            <li>After one week, the light did not work anymore.  </li>
            <li>Nope, the light was already.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Conair mirror with LED light which also runs on battery.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need the illumination it would be a fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the light to be about as bright as natural light.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Light and mirror are sufficient.</li>
            <li>The light stopped working after 6 months...</li>
            <li>The light works.</li>
            <li>The cord gets in the way if you don&#x27;t use the light feature.</li>
            <li>finish seems a bit cheap upon closer inspection, but if you&#x27;re looking for functionality, this works</li>
            <li>The lighting on this mirror is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>The light is working out well</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a mirror like this (magnification on one side, chrome finished, plus a light)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to replace the light bulb yet</li>
            <li>After one use, the light bulb burnt out.  </li>
            <li>She uses it almost daily and is happy with the size and the way it works.</li>
            <li>I Just wish the light were brighter</li>
            <li>The light could be brighter</li>
            <li>but I dont know how much light people are expecting from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is too tall to fit in.</li>
            <li>enjoy.</li>
            <li>It has a plug in to the wall with a switch on the cord to turn the light on and off.</li>
            <li>Much classier looking than others you can buy at a discount store, and the price was nice, too.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>So far so good on this lighted mirror.</li>
            <li>The light is a nice touch, although we don&#x27;t use it much in a well lit bathroom.</li>
            <li>It looks great in my dressing room, but I really wish the light was much brighter.</li>
            <li>- the light will be more consistent that way.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tested the anti-fog glass, but I do not doubt that it will work out fine.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice mirror the bronze one I read comes with a plug in attached to the back</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice mirror that actually revolves fully.</li>
            <li>I bought it only because when it is working, it is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a fluorescent lightbulb as a replacement, but it is not so easy, since most fluorescent bulbs are too large to fit inside the thinnest part of the mirror.</li>
            <li>For me, the oblong shape of the mirror looks nice, provides a good view and takes up less space than an oval shaped mirror.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this mirror so I could apply my eyeliner up close, but I use it to apply all of my make up.</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>I know I am very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is perfect for applying eye makeup or for evaluating small imperfections.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend if the light were brighter, but besides that it was overall a good value.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and pleased with the quality and having it light up is a plus!</li>
            <li>I loved that there were two different magnification options and that both sides light up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bright and yet still provides enough light to see everything, including the unsightly.</li>
            <li>The light was bright enough for me.</li>
            <li>Kind of a dim light.</li>
            <li>While the light is not overly bright, I have a lamp and window next to it, so it serves me</li>
            <li>I love the size and the light really works well for putting on make up and tweezing excess eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>and I love the light inside which makes putting on make-up and stuff so much easier to see.</li>
            <li>Sturdy mirror, good light provided for both magnification and regular mirror sides.  </li>
            <li>This light oval mirror has a regular and magnifier side that work nicely and the ability to light the mirror makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The edge around the mirror where the light is gets very, very hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice have sturdy, heavy enough and the light is awesome.</li>
            <li>She likes this one, but says it isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li>If you do more intense contouring/ heavier makeup application</li>
            <li>I like that the thing is big and the mirror is of really good quality, but there is one issue - the lighting is not so</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror, it has more magnification than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that much :)</li>
            <li>quality crafted-I love it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I wish I would have gotten the 10 XI really need the greater magnification</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price if you don&#x27;t mind using a lamp too.</li>
            <li>The light appears very sturdy and the bulb looks to be fairly easy to replace when the time comes.</li>
            <li>The mechanism of the rotation of the mirror was smooth and had the right suspension to hold any angle.  </li>
            <li>The  light  intensity  is just  right.</li>
            <li>I choose this one because the price was right and most of the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li>I had no problems returning it due to the great system of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all, as it matches my bathroom faucet and towel bars, even though the other finishes might be more popular.  </li>
            <li>The price tag, especially compared to those of similar mirrors found in department stores, was especially convincing.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but the double door models are way more efficient</li>
            <li>The soft glow is perfect not too much light and not too little.</li>
            <li>And then I can really feel not just light, but also the heat, which makes makeup melt and is generally not too pleasant.</li>
            <li>However, in real life I found the quality of the chrome to be a bit cheap and the mirror is surprisingly bulky (in depth) given the limited light output.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with both the product and Amazon service.  </li>
            <li>The light is not as good as on other mirrors i have tried nor does the magnification but for the price it worked well.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a good face-sized oval, the cord is plenty long</li>
            <li>Lol the day I got it in my half brother walked in and saw himself in the mirror and said &amp;</li>
            <li>But overall it feels a very high quality and would look good in any room or bathroom.</li>
            <li>bright enough to see whatever you need (or don&#x27;t need) to see hahaha</li>
            <li>it really helps  to have  a light, even tho</li>
            <li>The mirror is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>After using it my wife keeps asking why she had never purchased one of these before as it was so useful.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE $$&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>HAVE A DARK BEDROOM, AND WHILE THIS LIGHT SEEMS VERY DIM FROM FAR AWAY, IT IS PERFECT LIGHTING WHILE SITTING IN FRONT OF IT.</li>
            <li>Due to this, I&#x27;m taking better care of my skin now since the damage is more noticeable in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to turn on any other lights when I&#x27;m getting my face ready for the morning, which is great for my husband.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for, with a soft light that is sufficient enough to apply makeup, but not too bright.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the polished chrome which looks very nice and not cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was wanting, great little mirror with lighted magnification.</li>
            <li>so it was a bit of a struggle to choose the right one.</li>
            <li>THIS was the right one.</li>
            <li>I needed to use it right away.</li>
            <li>The magnification is just right with lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, I was hoping the color of the light would look more natural when looking into the mirror, rather than bright yellow.</li>
            <li>so I can see my whole face, the lighting is just perfect-bright enough, yet super soft and flattering, perfect magnification on the one side for tweezing (without being too strong and making you dizzy), and the overall height of the mirror is the best-nice and high, so I don&#x27;t have to hunch over to see!  </li>
            <li>It makes getting ready such a breeze, the halo light is such a great feature.</li>
            <li>It looks great on my dressing table and one side is a normal mirror while the other side is magnified.</li>
            <li>Portable, nice long cord</li>
            <li>Had to wait a long time to get it, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for applying makeup and getting those tiny little hairs from the brows.</li>
            <li>So, I am off to buy a replacement bulb today and make a suggestion to the manufacturer that they include spare bulbs with a new lamp and/or reassess the function of their product and the light bulbs required.</li>
            <li>These days tiny LED lights give off a huge amount of light and run on compact batteries</li>
            <li>The mirror is smaller than my last one, but the oval shape works great.  </li>
            <li>and this would suit an adult easily.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this mirror, I gave it four stars because I wanted it to be brighter but its still really nice.</li>
            <li>Construction is solid, looks good and the mirrors are clear.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought one of these for a co-worker&#x27;s birthday, and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Light is dim, you can put make up on, but the main light has to be on&lt;br</li>
            <li>It flips easily to give a complete view.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish looked really slick and made my vanity area look very nice.</li>
            <li>It is simple yet very effective with it&#x27;s double sides.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have other sources of light in the room.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my daughter wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Pretty much of a no-brainer!  </li>
            <li>I really like this mirror!</li>
            <li>Mirror does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>This mirror fits the bill as far as light and magnificiation</li>
            <li>The first mirror burned out within a day.</li>
            <li>I like this mirror and so far haven&#x27;t had any problems with the light.</li>
            <li>It gets hot so don&#x27;t leave it on all day or anything like that.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what my wife wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had one of these mirrors before this is my first time</li>
            <li>and thanks to the seller as well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed-</li>
            <li>It is too big for my needs and space, I should have paid more attention to its dimensions.</li>
            <li>magnification makes some of her close up work very simple and the light was a nice addition to her current lighting scheme.</li>
            <li>I prefer something a bit more squat, but that is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li>The mirror gets warm when the lights are on, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li>I used both sides and love the magnification side as well as the regular side.  </li>
            <li>Ive used this mirror everyday and it works so good.</li>
            <li>The magnified side is just right without zooming in so much you are scared to look at yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her make up is flawless now and her eyebrows since she can tweeze every tiny little hair that you don&#x27;t see with a normal mirror.</li>
            <li>I received this mirror and must say it is a little smaller than I originally thought, but after using it realized it is actually the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Love this lighted mirror, especially with it having a regular mirror and magnifying mirror side that I can easily flip between.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is double sided with two different intensities of magnification, also the cord is a good length.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and looks very modern</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, delivered promptly and very</li>
            <li>This mirror really helps so much!</li>
            <li>it was to small for my wife out side that it looks like it would be good</li>
            <li>The light is just bright enough, the magnified mirror really shows EVERYTHING which could be good or bad I guess.  </li>
            <li>Lighted is an extra plus that makes it easy to see yourself .</li>
            <li>The mirror is well made, stands very steady and it is ETL listed (rather than UL listed).  </li>
            <li>I think this mirror is good for the average user, but can&#x27;t compete with something professional quality.</li>
            <li>The glass area is large and rotates easily between regular and magnification.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and use it every single day.</li>
            <li>Large mirror area, swivel to any angle and height.</li>
            <li>Before I was using the large vanity mirror hung on my wall</li>
            <li>Firstly, the entire mirror heats up to quite a high temperature and very quickly at that.</li>
            <li>The mirror does have two different magnifications as promised and the lighting is fine.  </li>
            <li>Great for doing my eyebrows and seeing every last little hair.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really see this from the photos.</li>
            <li>Very shiny.  </li>
            <li>Returning it would cost me about that much in shipping fees</li>
            <li>To change the light bulb, there are two screws (one on each side) of the actual mirror part.</li>
            <li>Great mirror but poor lighting.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have for the mirror is that the light is not as bright as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>I have had the mirror for 9 months and then suddenly the light won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>and she never thought how much a difference a magnified mirror and lights can make.</li>
            <li>Very shiny chrome.</li>
            <li>I use it to pluck hairs or make my eyeliner straight.</li>
            <li>About 3 months later, the light went out and I could not find a replacement bulb anywhere.</li>
            <li>This one lasted only 10 months before the light burned out again.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>and we really like the finish...</li>
            <li>The product is excelent and aldo has a very goo price.</li>
            <li>there is only one light setting</li>
            <li>This mirror has been very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>It is very well made.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, several of the reviews reported that the light bulbs in this mirror are quite faulty.</li>
            <li>Not too much magnification which can be scary.&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional</li>
            <li>THAT IS ALSO VERY FUNCTIONAL.</li>
            <li>thanks conair.</li>
            <li>I wanted it for my vanity in my room, so I don&#x27;t have to get ready in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>way too much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>If it were brighter I don&#x27;t think I would like it as much.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the yellow light.</li>
            <li>Liked it enough to purchase a second.</li>
            <li>You have to be right up to the mirror to see anything clear with the 7x</li>
            <li>The other potential downfall (that could be a good thing) is that I can see every blemish and &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but I keeps it real here) but other than that I love this mirror when I bought</li>
            <li>I love the the double mirrors of where you can look on one side there is a normal view and a magnified side where you can see things much more easier especially when you are putting on make-up such as eyeshadow or lip gloss.</li>
            <li>and my cord can be disconnected, which is good because it sits on a shallow shelf</li>
            <li>The product comes in other finishes, but all were priced higher and the polished chrome looks just fine in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to use the light from this mirror for make-up without needing to turn on the over-head light, but alas that just isn&#x27;t possible with this mirror.</li>
            <li>will show even more brighter you can&#x27;t sit in a room with no light at all and expect the light from the mirror to be your only source that it not</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t understand how this large, plug in mirror can be so dim.</li>
            <li>I did not know this, but apparently the mirrors on the vanity itself were not quite right for the application of makeup.</li>
            <li>This mirror adds a classic look to a makeup table.  </li>
            <li>It casts a soft yellow halo light (about nightlight intensity).  </li>
            <li>The light is soft and yellow --</li>
            <li>We have several counter mirrors but ultimately this is the one that gets used most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent mirror.</li>
            <li>Decent size.  </li>
            <li>This item was shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Light is just right, not too dim or too bright and cord is long enough that I can hide it down the back of my vanity but still have it close to the front for use...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It looks a lot like the high priced mirrors that you see in stores like Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>The oval look is stylish but I wish it were just a little wider.</li>
            <li>my vanity is a little wider than most</li>
            <li>I dont know what all the bad reviews are about, this mirror is the best.</li>
            <li>The reverse side has a magnification that&#x27;s clear as the real thing.</li>
            <li>After taking the screws out, you have to carefully pull the mirror apart to get to the light bulb compartment.</li>
            <li>Really helps these old eyes do make-up.  </li>
            <li>Will never buy anything from this seller and recommend looking elsewhere (I normally do, but was in a bit of a rush this time).  </li>
            <li>The mirror was way too short and the light far too dim.</li>
            <li>The mirror is nice and heavy and doesn&#x27;t look cheap or flimsy, it is actually kinda thick (width wise) and a narrow oval shaped.</li>
            <li>The light is at a good brightness level - not overwhelming or hard on the eyes.</li>
            <li>she lives in New Jersey...</li>
            <li>I also like that the internal light bulb provides enough heat to keep the mirror fog</li>
            <li>So far no problems!</li>
            <li>(only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5-star), but it might be too hot for my taste if it was.  </li>
            <li>Before buying this mirror I read some reviews that said that the light was dim, but other reviews contradicted this fact, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light stopped functioning less than 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li>It is big enough to see your full face.</li>
            <li>I can use to magnifying side to apply my makeup and then see the full face view on the other side.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the soft lighting at first seemed too soft, but then when I used it, as before, realized that it is actually the perfecting lighting.  </li>
            <li>The light could be a little brighter</li>
            <li>amount of light (would prefer something a little brighter)&lt;br /&gt;Prefer</li>
            <li>have little natural light in my room</li>
            <li>but the light is a little dim.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a completely dark room with no other lighting, then consider buying something brighter or another light source</li>
            <li>and I really wanted this one to work out for me because I especially like the oval shape</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 11 year old daughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t really like the power plug either, I decided to return it altogether and try a different mirror.</li>
            <li>I keep it out of direct sunlight at all times and unplug it when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li>My only real issue is that it radiates warmth like WOAH.</li>
            <li>My face literally gets hot if I&#x27;m in front of the mirror for too long.</li>
            <li>but I have to use supplimental lighting since it&#x27;s so dim.</li>
            <li>Portable and not heavy at all</li>
            <li>The lighting shouldn&#x27;t be used alone, I still go to my bathroom to put on my foundation and powder because this just isn&#x27;t big enough and doesn&#x27;t provide enough light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft glow.  </li>
            <li>Scary but good.</li>
            <li>The design is classy, simple and clean and fits in with the other vanity hardware.  </li>
            <li>I searched high &amp; low for a mirror to apply my makeup</li>
            <li>The height of the stand, the light, the magnification,--all are what she was looking for ever since her previous similar mirror was given to someone else.</li>
            <li>and I paid 21 bucks on Amazon for it, about ten dollars less than in store plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>The electric cord is long enough to hide behind something and the easy on/off switch is accessible.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s plenty big for my needs, but the light could be a little brighter.</li>
            <li>My rating is due to the fact that the light is yellow and not white</li>
            <li>I recently broke my lighted/magnifying makeup mirror and needed a new one ASAP, as I use it every day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hours after I wrote the initial review, the lamp in my new mirror burned out as well.</li>
            <li>Only asked as I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Would be so much better if you could turn on by touching the base of mirror or having the</li>
            <li>The light is not very bright.</li>
            <li>The complaint I had was the light.  </li>
            <li>The light is still working despite being used at least once a day in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to both gift-buyers and general purchasers alike.</li>
            <li>As for the actual lighting, it is a bit too dim for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite dim.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this mirror is fantastic--the lighting is subtle and effective, while the magnification leaves me wanting to desperately take care of my skin a bit better.  </li>
            <li>The light could be a little stronger but its not bad - I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my fiancee after accidentally breaking her other one, not realizing how much these cost.  </li>
            <li>Both mirror sides are clear and functional, however, the light is not bright enough.  </li>
            <li>The lighting is pretty good - the only complaint is the base gets hot if the light is left over a few minutes.</li>
            <li>so the only downfall is that the mirror sits low and I have to lean down a little, but I don&#x27;t see that being a problem for most people.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but if I am a little more than a few inches away the image goes cross and it hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it took no where near as long as it use to.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t back up far enough to see both eyes at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The base is nice and heavy which helps make the mirror more stable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only down side is that the lights can get a bit hot in room temperature areas above 75 degrees.</li>
            <li>only downside is it gets a little hot, but it isn&#x27;t going to burn you or anything.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m keeping about half of mine looped with a twist tie), and I really like the on/off switch on the cord itself.  </li>
            <li>The lighting is not extremely bright, but compliments over-head lighting, providing enough extra light so that I can see where my razor is going.</li>
            <li>It is heavy in weight; certainly shouldn&#x27;t tip over.  </li>
            <li>This morning the light burnt out, which is ridiculous because I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long.</li>

            <li> The mirror is great for the price, just accept that you will encounter issues with the light bulb.</li>
            <li> I needed a brighter light to beat the shadows and side window in my bathroom, but this lighting didn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> I am far-sighted, yet find the illumination quite bright and the 5X magnification more than I need.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> I received this item in a very timely manner and in perfect condition.  </li>

            <li> handy</li>

            <li> very nice mirror came quick</li>

            <li> It also looks nice on my vanity top.  </li>
            <li> I was able to determine that I would not have liked the magnification........</li>
            <li> This great looking mirror is just the right magnification for applying make up.  </li>
            <li> mirror is actually pretty nice: the lights are bright, magnification is what I need, and looks nice on my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted, works great.</li>
            <li> This beautiful vanity mirror looks far more substantial than the photo illustrates!</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I freaking love this mirror</li>
            <li> And for the 7x magnification lets just say my eyebrows have never been more on point</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say look for a better lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Top 2 photos with flash&lt;br /</li>

            <li> I have a good overhead light source and don&#x27;t need the light feature.</li>
            <li> This mirror is better than the $20 lighted Conair that&#x27;s sold in stores.</li>
            <li> sincerely th-t is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I love having this mirror on my vanity for makeup application and using the magnified side for plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The Conair BE47X fit the bill nicely.  </li>

            <li> Overall very happy!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is perfect for eye and lip makeup, as well as eliminating unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> I still have no answer for the question, but I am pleased that she likes it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I use it for doing my makeup and</li>
            <li> Light surrounding the mirror has nice distribution causing no shade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then this would be a much better product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Light is nice.  </li>
            <li> Magnification shows me things I&#x27;m sure I want to see at 75.</li>
            <li> works better than the +$50 mirros at bed bath and beyond</li>
            <li> I love the size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year and is still working.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> The description said it is 8 inch tall, but actually it is more than 16 inch tall.</li>
            <li> The height is perfect on my dressing table and I can see my entire face.</li>
            <li> and this is sooo much better.</li>
            <li> I bought one for each of my 2 daughters, and they both love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it.  </li>
            <li> I buy most of my beauty products from them.  </li>
            <li> The light isnt very bright but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Most of us don&#x27;t live under photo shoot lights and this will be great for us.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The magnification is good and the light is adequate.</li>
            <li> The light is good, not too dim, not too bright.  </li>
            <li> The mirror magnification is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> My mom still uses her old mirror (which is so bright it leaves spots in your vision for a minute or two), but this one is still nice too.</li>
            <li> I saw one for $129 at another store - and this was equally as good and more reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> light is just right and helps a lot if you don&#x27;t have good lighting in your room.</li>
            <li> The light is not so bright that it blinds you but bright enough that you can see without any additional lighting.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and great for makeup.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok with a light on in the room or sunlight.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy all the local stores carry battery only lighted mirrors and this one plugs in and made my wife very happy!!</li>
            <li> For the price, I dont think you could get a better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft light, could be brighter</li>
            <li> Well, I love this mirror, the light, the form and the color.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t cost much more than one without a light, and  it makes a world of difference to have the  illumination.  </li>
            <li> She loved mine so much I bought her one.</li>
            <li> forever but the best I could find was closed to fifty dollars!</li>
            <li> However it arrived with a bent stem that can&#x27;t easily be straightened.</li>
            <li> The 7X magnification is more powerful than most but doesn&#x27;t distort like cheaper mirrors.</li>
            <li> Illumination is ok but doesn&#x27;t substitute for more powerful task lighting.</li>
            <li> I assume that can easily be replaced though...</li>
            <li> mirror swivels easily to change sides &amp; magnification.</li>
            <li> I have another light-up mirror that uses really strong, blinding lights.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size to fit in the corner of my dresser and it looks nice too.</li>
            <li> I bought the first one and really liked it.</li>
            <li> It almost seems like a fire hazard, which is why I make sure to keep it in a cool area and unplugged.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to plug in a straightener, hair dryer, or even a hot plate for my coffee!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I exchanged it for another hassle-free and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The lighting is not the best, i am hoping to find replacement bulbs just a little brighter.</li>
            <li> so this is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> The light works well</li>
            <li> light stopped working 3 months after purchase</li>
            <li> It swivels smoothly and stays put when you adjust the angle of the mirror.</li>
            <li> After one week, the light did not work anymore.  </li>
            <li> Nope, the light was already.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Conair mirror with LED light which also runs on battery.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need the illumination it would be a fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the light to be about as bright as natural light.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Light and mirror are sufficient.</li>
            <li> The light stopped working after 6 months...</li>
            <li> The light works.</li>
            <li> The cord gets in the way if you don&#x27;t use the light feature.</li>
            <li> finish seems a bit cheap upon closer inspection, but if you&#x27;re looking for functionality, this works</li>
            <li> The lighting on this mirror is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> The light is working out well</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a mirror like this (magnification on one side, chrome finished, plus a light)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to replace the light bulb yet</li>
            <li> After one use, the light bulb burnt out.  </li>
            <li> She uses it almost daily and is happy with the size and the way it works.</li>
            <li> I Just wish the light were brighter</li>
            <li> The light could be brighter</li>
            <li> but I dont know how much light people are expecting from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is too tall to fit in.</li>
            <li> enjoy.</li>
            <li> It has a plug in to the wall with a switch on the cord to turn the light on and off.</li>
            <li> Much classier looking than others you can buy at a discount store, and the price was nice, too.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> So far so good on this lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> The light is a nice touch, although we don&#x27;t use it much in a well lit bathroom.</li>
            <li> It looks great in my dressing room, but I really wish the light was much brighter.</li>
            <li> - the light will be more consistent that way.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tested the anti-fog glass, but I do not doubt that it will work out fine.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror the bronze one I read comes with a plug in attached to the back</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very nice mirror that actually revolves fully.</li>
            <li> I bought it only because when it is working, it is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a fluorescent lightbulb as a replacement, but it is not so easy, since most fluorescent bulbs are too large to fit inside the thinnest part of the mirror.</li>
            <li> For me, the oblong shape of the mirror looks nice, provides a good view and takes up less space than an oval shaped mirror.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this mirror so I could apply my eyeliner up close, but I use it to apply all of my make up.</li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> I know I am very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is perfect for applying eye makeup or for evaluating small imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend if the light were brighter, but besides that it was overall a good value.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and pleased with the quality and having it light up is a plus!</li>
            <li> I loved that there were two different magnification options and that both sides light up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bright and yet still provides enough light to see everything, including the unsightly.</li>
            <li> The light was bright enough for me.</li>
            <li> Kind of a dim light.</li>
            <li> While the light is not overly bright, I have a lamp and window next to it, so it serves me</li>
            <li> I love the size and the light really works well for putting on make up and tweezing excess eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> and I love the light inside which makes putting on make-up and stuff so much easier to see.</li>
            <li> Sturdy mirror, good light provided for both magnification and regular mirror sides.  </li>
            <li> This light oval mirror has a regular and magnifier side that work nicely and the ability to light the mirror makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The edge around the mirror where the light is gets very, very hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice have sturdy, heavy enough and the light is awesome.</li>
            <li> She likes this one, but says it isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li> If you do more intense contouring/ heavier makeup application</li>
            <li> I like that the thing is big and the mirror is of really good quality, but there is one issue - the lighting is not so</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror, it has more magnification than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that much :)</li>
            <li> quality crafted-I love it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I wish I would have gotten the 10 XI really need the greater magnification</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price if you don&#x27;t mind using a lamp too.</li>
            <li> The light appears very sturdy and the bulb looks to be fairly easy to replace when the time comes.</li>
            <li> The mechanism of the rotation of the mirror was smooth and had the right suspension to hold any angle.  </li>
            <li> The  light  intensity  is just  right.</li>
            <li> I choose this one because the price was right and most of the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li> I had no problems returning it due to the great system of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all, as it matches my bathroom faucet and towel bars, even though the other finishes might be more popular.  </li>
            <li> The price tag, especially compared to those of similar mirrors found in department stores, was especially convincing.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but the double door models are way more efficient</li>
            <li> The soft glow is perfect not too much light and not too little.</li>
            <li> And then I can really feel not just light, but also the heat, which makes makeup melt and is generally not too pleasant.</li>
            <li> However, in real life I found the quality of the chrome to be a bit cheap and the mirror is surprisingly bulky (in depth) given the limited light output.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with both the product and Amazon service.  </li>
            <li> The light is not as good as on other mirrors i have tried nor does the magnification but for the price it worked well.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a good face-sized oval, the cord is plenty long</li>
            <li> Lol the day I got it in my half brother walked in and saw himself in the mirror and said &amp;</li>
            <li> But overall it feels a very high quality and would look good in any room or bathroom.</li>
            <li> bright enough to see whatever you need (or don&#x27;t need) to see hahaha</li>
            <li> it really helps  to have  a light, even tho</li>
            <li> The mirror is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After using it my wife keeps asking why she had never purchased one of these before as it was so useful.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE $$&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> HAVE A DARK BEDROOM, AND WHILE THIS LIGHT SEEMS VERY DIM FROM FAR AWAY, IT IS PERFECT LIGHTING WHILE SITTING IN FRONT OF IT.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I&#x27;m taking better care of my skin now since the damage is more noticeable in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to turn on any other lights when I&#x27;m getting my face ready for the morning, which is great for my husband.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for, with a soft light that is sufficient enough to apply makeup, but not too bright.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the polished chrome which looks very nice and not cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was wanting, great little mirror with lighted magnification.</li>
            <li> so it was a bit of a struggle to choose the right one.</li>
            <li> THIS was the right one.</li>
            <li> I needed to use it right away.</li>
            <li> The magnification is just right with lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I was hoping the color of the light would look more natural when looking into the mirror, rather than bright yellow.</li>
            <li> so I can see my whole face, the lighting is just perfect-bright enough, yet super soft and flattering, perfect magnification on the one side for tweezing (without being too strong and making you dizzy), and the overall height of the mirror is the best-nice and high, so I don&#x27;t have to hunch over to see!  </li>
            <li> It makes getting ready such a breeze, the halo light is such a great feature.</li>
            <li> It looks great on my dressing table and one side is a normal mirror while the other side is magnified.</li>
            <li> Portable, nice long cord</li>
            <li> Had to wait a long time to get it, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for applying makeup and getting those tiny little hairs from the brows.</li>
            <li> So, I am off to buy a replacement bulb today and make a suggestion to the manufacturer that they include spare bulbs with a new lamp and/or reassess the function of their product and the light bulbs required.</li>
            <li> These days tiny LED lights give off a huge amount of light and run on compact batteries</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than my last one, but the oval shape works great.  </li>
            <li> and this would suit an adult easily.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this mirror, I gave it four stars because I wanted it to be brighter but its still really nice.</li>
            <li> Construction is solid, looks good and the mirrors are clear.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought one of these for a co-worker&#x27;s birthday, and I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Light is dim, you can put make up on, but the main light has to be on&lt;br</li>
            <li> It flips easily to give a complete view.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish looked really slick and made my vanity area look very nice.</li>
            <li> It is simple yet very effective with it&#x27;s double sides.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have other sources of light in the room.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my daughter wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Pretty much of a no-brainer!  </li>
            <li> I really like this mirror!</li>
            <li> Mirror does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> This mirror fits the bill as far as light and magnificiation</li>
            <li> The first mirror burned out within a day.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror and so far haven&#x27;t had any problems with the light.</li>
            <li> It gets hot so don&#x27;t leave it on all day or anything like that.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what my wife wanted.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one of these mirrors before this is my first time</li>
            <li> and thanks to the seller as well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed-</li>
            <li> It is too big for my needs and space, I should have paid more attention to its dimensions.</li>
            <li> magnification makes some of her close up work very simple and the light was a nice addition to her current lighting scheme.</li>
            <li> I prefer something a bit more squat, but that is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> The mirror gets warm when the lights are on, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I used both sides and love the magnification side as well as the regular side.  </li>
            <li> Ive used this mirror everyday and it works so good.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is just right without zooming in so much you are scared to look at yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her make up is flawless now and her eyebrows since she can tweeze every tiny little hair that you don&#x27;t see with a normal mirror.</li>
            <li> I received this mirror and must say it is a little smaller than I originally thought, but after using it realized it is actually the perfect size.  </li>
            <li> Love this lighted mirror, especially with it having a regular mirror and magnifying mirror side that I can easily flip between.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is double sided with two different intensities of magnification, also the cord is a good length.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and looks very modern</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, delivered promptly and very</li>
            <li> This mirror really helps so much!</li>
            <li> it was to small for my wife out side that it looks like it would be good</li>
            <li> The light is just bright enough, the magnified mirror really shows EVERYTHING which could be good or bad I guess.  </li>
            <li> Lighted is an extra plus that makes it easy to see yourself .</li>
            <li> The mirror is well made, stands very steady and it is ETL listed (rather than UL listed).  </li>
            <li> I think this mirror is good for the average user, but can&#x27;t compete with something professional quality.</li>
            <li> The glass area is large and rotates easily between regular and magnification.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Large mirror area, swivel to any angle and height.</li>
            <li> Before I was using the large vanity mirror hung on my wall</li>
            <li> Firstly, the entire mirror heats up to quite a high temperature and very quickly at that.</li>
            <li> The mirror does have two different magnifications as promised and the lighting is fine.  </li>
            <li> Great for doing my eyebrows and seeing every last little hair.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really see this from the photos.</li>
            <li> Very shiny.  </li>
            <li> Returning it would cost me about that much in shipping fees</li>
            <li> To change the light bulb, there are two screws (one on each side) of the actual mirror part.</li>
            <li> Great mirror but poor lighting.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have for the mirror is that the light is not as bright as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> I have had the mirror for 9 months and then suddenly the light won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> and she never thought how much a difference a magnified mirror and lights can make.</li>
            <li> Very shiny chrome.</li>
            <li> I use it to pluck hairs or make my eyeliner straight.</li>
            <li> About 3 months later, the light went out and I could not find a replacement bulb anywhere.</li>
            <li> This one lasted only 10 months before the light burned out again.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> and we really like the finish...</li>
            <li> The product is excelent and aldo has a very goo price.</li>
            <li> there is only one light setting</li>
            <li> This mirror has been very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li> It is very well made.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, several of the reviews reported that the light bulbs in this mirror are quite faulty.</li>
            <li> Not too much magnification which can be scary.&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional</li>
            <li> THAT IS ALSO VERY FUNCTIONAL.</li>
            <li> thanks conair.</li>
            <li> I wanted it for my vanity in my room, so I don&#x27;t have to get ready in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> way too much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If it were brighter I don&#x27;t think I would like it as much.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the yellow light.</li>
            <li> Liked it enough to purchase a second.</li>
            <li> You have to be right up to the mirror to see anything clear with the 7x</li>
            <li> The other potential downfall (that could be a good thing) is that I can see every blemish and &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but I keeps it real here) but other than that I love this mirror when I bought</li>
            <li> I love the the double mirrors of where you can look on one side there is a normal view and a magnified side where you can see things much more easier especially when you are putting on make-up such as eyeshadow or lip gloss.</li>
            <li> and my cord can be disconnected, which is good because it sits on a shallow shelf</li>
            <li> The product comes in other finishes, but all were priced higher and the polished chrome looks just fine in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to use the light from this mirror for make-up without needing to turn on the over-head light, but alas that just isn&#x27;t possible with this mirror.</li>
            <li> will show even more brighter you can&#x27;t sit in a room with no light at all and expect the light from the mirror to be your only source that it not</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t understand how this large, plug in mirror can be so dim.</li>
            <li> I did not know this, but apparently the mirrors on the vanity itself were not quite right for the application of makeup.</li>
            <li> This mirror adds a classic look to a makeup table.  </li>
            <li> It casts a soft yellow halo light (about nightlight intensity).  </li>
            <li> The light is soft and yellow --</li>
            <li> We have several counter mirrors but ultimately this is the one that gets used most.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent mirror.</li>
            <li> Decent size.  </li>
            <li> This item was shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Light is just right, not too dim or too bright and cord is long enough that I can hide it down the back of my vanity but still have it close to the front for use...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It looks a lot like the high priced mirrors that you see in stores like Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> The oval look is stylish but I wish it were just a little wider.</li>
            <li> my vanity is a little wider than most</li>
            <li> I dont know what all the bad reviews are about, this mirror is the best.</li>
            <li> The reverse side has a magnification that&#x27;s clear as the real thing.</li>
            <li> After taking the screws out, you have to carefully pull the mirror apart to get to the light bulb compartment.</li>
            <li> Really helps these old eyes do make-up.  </li>
            <li> Will never buy anything from this seller and recommend looking elsewhere (I normally do, but was in a bit of a rush this time).  </li>
            <li> The mirror was way too short and the light far too dim.</li>
            <li> The mirror is nice and heavy and doesn&#x27;t look cheap or flimsy, it is actually kinda thick (width wise) and a narrow oval shaped.</li>
            <li> The light is at a good brightness level - not overwhelming or hard on the eyes.</li>
            <li> she lives in New Jersey...</li>
            <li> I also like that the internal light bulb provides enough heat to keep the mirror fog</li>
            <li> So far no problems!</li>
            <li> (only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5-star), but it might be too hot for my taste if it was.  </li>
            <li> Before buying this mirror I read some reviews that said that the light was dim, but other reviews contradicted this fact, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light stopped functioning less than 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> It is big enough to see your full face.</li>
            <li> I can use to magnifying side to apply my makeup and then see the full face view on the other side.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the soft lighting at first seemed too soft, but then when I used it, as before, realized that it is actually the perfecting lighting.  </li>
            <li> The light could be a little brighter</li>
            <li> amount of light (would prefer something a little brighter)&lt;br /&gt;Prefer</li>
            <li> have little natural light in my room</li>
            <li> but the light is a little dim.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a completely dark room with no other lighting, then consider buying something brighter or another light source</li>
            <li> and I really wanted this one to work out for me because I especially like the oval shape</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 11 year old daughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t really like the power plug either, I decided to return it altogether and try a different mirror.</li>
            <li> I keep it out of direct sunlight at all times and unplug it when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> My only real issue is that it radiates warmth like WOAH.</li>
            <li> My face literally gets hot if I&#x27;m in front of the mirror for too long.</li>
            <li> but I have to use supplimental lighting since it&#x27;s so dim.</li>
            <li> Portable and not heavy at all</li>
            <li> The lighting shouldn&#x27;t be used alone, I still go to my bathroom to put on my foundation and powder because this just isn&#x27;t big enough and doesn&#x27;t provide enough light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft glow.  </li>
            <li> Scary but good.</li>
            <li> The design is classy, simple and clean and fits in with the other vanity hardware.  </li>
            <li> I searched high &amp; low for a mirror to apply my makeup</li>
            <li> The height of the stand, the light, the magnification,--all are what she was looking for ever since her previous similar mirror was given to someone else.</li>
            <li> and I paid 21 bucks on Amazon for it, about ten dollars less than in store plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> The electric cord is long enough to hide behind something and the easy on/off switch is accessible.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s plenty big for my needs, but the light could be a little brighter.</li>
            <li> My rating is due to the fact that the light is yellow and not white</li>
            <li> I recently broke my lighted/magnifying makeup mirror and needed a new one ASAP, as I use it every day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hours after I wrote the initial review, the lamp in my new mirror burned out as well.</li>
            <li> Only asked as I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Would be so much better if you could turn on by touching the base of mirror or having the</li>
            <li> The light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> The complaint I had was the light.  </li>
            <li> The light is still working despite being used at least once a day in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item to both gift-buyers and general purchasers alike.</li>
            <li> As for the actual lighting, it is a bit too dim for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite dim.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this mirror is fantastic--the lighting is subtle and effective, while the magnification leaves me wanting to desperately take care of my skin a bit better.  </li>
            <li> The light could be a little stronger but its not bad - I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my fiancee after accidentally breaking her other one, not realizing how much these cost.  </li>
            <li> Both mirror sides are clear and functional, however, the light is not bright enough.  </li>
            <li> The lighting is pretty good - the only complaint is the base gets hot if the light is left over a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so the only downfall is that the mirror sits low and I have to lean down a little, but I don&#x27;t see that being a problem for most people.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it, but if I am a little more than a few inches away the image goes cross and it hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it took no where near as long as it use to.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t back up far enough to see both eyes at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The base is nice and heavy which helps make the mirror more stable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only down side is that the lights can get a bit hot in room temperature areas above 75 degrees.</li>
            <li> only downside is it gets a little hot, but it isn&#x27;t going to burn you or anything.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m keeping about half of mine looped with a twist tie), and I really like the on/off switch on the cord itself.  </li>
            <li> The lighting is not extremely bright, but compliments over-head lighting, providing enough extra light so that I can see where my razor is going.</li>
            <li> It is heavy in weight; certainly shouldn&#x27;t tip over.  </li>
            <li> This morning the light burnt out, which is ridiculous because I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long.</li>
            <li> The lights however are very dim and wont help very much in a dark room.</li>
            <li> It is reversible, one side has a higher magnification (which I don&#x27;t typically use) and the other is lower magnification.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that if it felll off the counter it would break very easily.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers who think that the light from this mirror is not bright enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it does what I paid for it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror is long enough that I can curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> The graduated design of the base (very Art Deco) looks lovely seated on my vintage 1930&#x27;s manicurist station, which I use as a dressing table.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, I assumed I had it on low and tried to turn it up, but alas, there is only one setting.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is on the cord which was not very clear in the description, but it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lightbulb is incadescent, and rather weak, so to get right illumination, my face has to be quite close to the mirror surface.</li>
            <li> I bought the chrome finish, which was far less than other finishes in the same product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see of any way to replace the light, and the mirror is now useless to me.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not wireless and features  long</li>
            <li> It was much bigger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The mirror is wide enough to see your face as well as your hair (and I have a lot of hair).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.  </li>
            <li> #34;I hate your mirror!!!&amp;#34; because you know..everyone hates how their face looks in the zoom part of these mirrors, but its good because you can fix your imperfections easier</li>
            <li> I got one at first that barely even tilted, it was useless.</li>
            <li> My wife had looked for a mirror at several stores but did not want a round one, which seems to be the only thing offered in the stores.</li>
            <li> Though the description does state &#x27;&#x27;soft halo lighting&#x27;&#x27;, so I probably should of not been lazy and took that into consideration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying the lights are too dim.  </li>
            <li> When applying make-up, I realize I am now using much less make-up than before because I can actually see every detail of my eyes and can see where more/less needs to be applied.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I expected, but she likes it.</li>
            <li> The light could be brighter and the in-line wheel switch stinks.  </li>
            <li> Will save you at least $20 (especially since I have the Target red card &#x3D; 5% off, then there was the $40 and get $10 gift card promotion.</li>
            <li> My wife had purchaesed at least three different mirrors at local stores and none fither needs.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Mirror does everything expected and my wife likes the product.</li>
            <li> Spent alot of time reading reviews as I have never owned a mske up mirror.  </li>
            <li> I luuurrrrvvveee staring at myself, and with 10x magnification on one side, i can stare even harder.</li>
            <li> work as expected</li>
            <li> This makes putting on eye shadow a bit harder for me.  </li>
            <li> , next time I&#x27;ll buy a round mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mirror is well made, as I expected from Conair.  </li>
            <li> Clear Night Light Candelabra Base 4</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better is to have a plug on the base of the mirror.</li>
            <li> When I contour It is hard to ensure everything is blended in due to the dim lighting.</li>
            <li> The base stem is tall enough because the mirror flips easily</li>
            <li> I chose this mirror from other brands because it advertised a 1X side and a 5X side, unlike others with a 7X side.</li>
            <li> know manufacturer intended other uses</li>
            <li> Will not purchase any other products from Conair again.</li>
            <li> Wish I considered reading the other reviews before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> too all i can say for now due to</li>
            <li> If you have a small vanity area, this is a space saver and works every bit as well as a traditional rectangular makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> Get better glue. :(</li>
            <li> so be very, very careful.  </li>
            <li> All in all, not nice enough to keep</li>
            <li> Only negative comment would be...</li>
            <li> but, that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Then again, why would you be putting on makeup in a completely dark room?</li>
            <li> what that is for (not trying to down play anyone</li>
            <li> This has saved me money on my make-up purchases as I run out less now.  </li>
            <li> Takes up less room on my desk and is built well.  </li>
            <li> That only thing is it has been a little hard to get used to because I have used a round one for years.  </li>
            <li> The only dissappointment is that the glass on one side has a tiny scratch on it, but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> (sometimes I think it&#x27;s not bright enough -- but</li>
            <li> The selection was limited and the prices were at least $60, which I thought was a lot.  </li>
            <li> However, the lighting is a little too ...spaced out?</li>
            <li> Could be a little brighter</li>
            <li> It was a little bit of an adjustment for me because this is truly an oval shape</li>
            <li> There is a little toggle switch on the cord which turns it off/on.  </li>
            <li> A little to narrow.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s extremely helpful for every inch of application!!</li>
            <li> For everyday makeup application this mirror does the trick.</li>
            <li> It is made heavy and just as it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> I prefer the round design.</li>
            <li> enough cable to run behind a makeup desk.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> Also, oval shape for a usually round face.....</li>
            <li> The one my husband bought me was a few steps up from this one.</li>
            <li> I just wish the light switch was on the base instead of on the cord.</li>
            <li> I ordered on Saturday evening and with Prime Shipping, had it on Monday evening, which was even faster than usual.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that the mirror would be small from what I can see in the picture.</li>
            <li> Met our needs for a small mirror for guests in our guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Too small in my opinion to use for every day.</li>
            <li> too small-</li>
            <li> I was not able to remove it well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look any further, for the people who say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not bright enough&amp;#34; well I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> The light on this is terrible</li>
            <li> Seems to be very sturdy on it&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> The switch is located on the cord and is very tight, so if you get out of the shower and your hands are moist, it&#x27;s very hard to turn it on.</li>
            <li> It is a well-balanced design with a weighty base (just like mirrors 500% more expensive), so no worries about kitty knocking it over...impossible!</li>
            <li> Although the text on the listing does indicate that the switch is located on the power cord, it is ridiculous for vendors to use incorrect images that convey conflicting details about a product.  </li>
            <li> It was also much less expensive than others I&#x27;d priced--</li>
            <li> I was a  little bummed that the description was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where this mirror goes wrong for me is that it is a little too tall.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bright at all</li>
            <li> though so I&#x27;m not sure how difficult  it will be.</li>
            <li> She has poor lighting in her bedroom</li>
            <li> This was WAY cheaper than others we were looking and and probably not any worse.  </li>
            <li> It needs to have the mechanical switch back on the base.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the sticker that was on the base.</li>
            <li> so it left ugly/sticky residue on my mirror&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> it arrived broken on one side.</li>
            <li> it was just an ordinary mirror with lights, boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Oval shape being too narrow on the magnified side.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look expensive.  </li>
            <li> so unfortunately will keep it.</li>
            <li> For disposable - it&#x27;s way to expensive.  </li>
            <li> This has the power to point out infinite flaws in my complexion, and has the power to leave its owner miserable and disgusted with his or her appearance :)</li>
            <li> I still use it, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> It was really confusing before I bought this if it would be on the base or the cord.  </li>
            <li> These are very expensive at retail stores.  </li>
            <li> But then the on/off switch went bad after about 11 months</li>
            <li> Some reviews talk about how bad is the illumination but</li>
            <li> You will see all of your pores and ugly blackheads</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve adjusted but still disappointed in my choice</li>
            <li> Read the reviews about how it can crap out on you, but nothing has happened yet</li>
            <li> Although I do wish the switch was placed on the base of the mirror instead of on the cable, would&#x27;ve made turning it on/off easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars because i bought this one because it had the button on the base in the picture, but the model I received doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch on the base of mirror.</li>
            <li> We would have prefered the base</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s annoying to adjust the mirrors</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The packing was terrible.........</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use these at hotels and has worked so well so got one for my home.  Works great.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, you get what you pay for.  I had hoped for better visibility with the magnifying side of the mirror.  The light works well and so does the regular mirror.  Nice, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good lighted mirror and I really wanted this one to work out for me because I especially like the oval shape and it looks well-made and elegant in the online photos. However, in real life I found the quality of the chrome to be a bit cheap and the mirror is surprisingly bulky (in depth) given the limited light output. You can&#x27;t really see this from the photos. I have to agree with the other reviewers who think that the light from this mirror is not bright enough. These days tiny LED lights give off a huge amount of light and run on compact batteries so I really don&#x27;t understand how this large, plug in mirror can be so dim. All in all, not nice enough to keep - I am returning this item.</li>
            <li> I received this item in a very timely manner and in perfect condition.  I love it and don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it.......</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my lighted magnifying mirror.  I shopped around and this was an excellent price, lived up to the writeup and was shipped quickly.  The packaging kept the mirror safe and I am very happy with the vendor.  The mirror itself ROCKS!</li>
            <li> light stopped working 3 months after purchase</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I got along without this mirror before.  Perfect for applying eye makeup and tweezing eyebrows.  Love the lighted feature and the magnification on one side to help see close up.</li>
            <li> The photo does not match the text description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;My wife ordered the \\&quot;polished chrome\\&quot; version, the only model that displays the base-mounted on-off switch (i.e., not on the power cord).  Although the text on the listing does indicate that the switch is located on the power cord, it is ridiculous for vendors to use incorrect images that convey conflicting details about a product.  We&#x27;re not replacing the item, and it is otherwise of good quality.  Still, it would be nice if this confusion were headed off by the vendor by not displaying incorrect product images.</li>
            <li> This mirror is okay.   Very shiny.  Doesn&#x27;t look expensive.  If I were to do it again, Costco has a cuter lighted mirror for $19.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister since she&#x27;d been asking for a vanity mirror for a while now, so I got it for her birthday in November. She loved it then, she still loves it now. Read the reviews about how it can crap out on you, but nothing has happened yet so I can only hope that it&#x27;ll stay that way. Although I do wish the switch was placed on the base of the mirror instead of on the cable, would&#x27;ve made turning it on/off easier.</li>
            <li> it was to small for my wife out side that it looks like it would be good</li>
            <li> The mirror does have two different magnifications as promised and the lighting is fine.  However it arrived with a bent stem that can&#x27;t easily be straightened.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror the bronze one I read comes with a plug in attached to the back and I was hoping this one would also but it didn&#x27;t. You have to be right up to the mirror to see anything clear with the 7x with is still nice for doing eyebrows or putting on makeup.  Over all I do like the mirror and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror for my wife for Christmas and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered it on a Saturday and it arrived on Tuesday!&lt;br /&gt;I have little natural light in my room and I always felt as if my makeup didn&#x27;t look as good as it could because there were always shadows on my face when applying my make up. Well PROBLEM SOLVED. I freaking love this mirror I could go on for days telling you why it&#x27;s a good buy but you just need to make the investment yourself. Don&#x27;t look any further, for the people who say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not bright enough&amp;#34; well I&#x27;m sorry but if it were any brighter I would prob get a headache from looking in it while doing my makeup. The soft glow is perfect not too much light and not too little. And for the 7x magnification lets just say my eyebrows have never been more on point and it took no where near as long as it use to.</li>
            <li> I like that this is double sided with two different intensities of magnification, also the cord is a good length. It swivels smoothly and stays put when you adjust the angle of the mirror. I use the 1x side for makeup application and the 7x side for plucking my eyebrows (and you can see EVERYTHING on your face, ick!). As for the actual lighting, it is a bit too dim for me. When I contour It is hard to ensure everything is blended in due to the dim lighting. Though the description does state &#x27;&#x27;soft halo lighting&#x27;&#x27;, so I probably should of not been lazy and took that into consideration. For everyday makeup application this mirror does the trick. If you are looking for a lighted magnification mirror for a good price I still recommend this. If you do more intense contouring/ heavier makeup application I&#x27;d say look for a better lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Top 2 photos with flash&lt;br /&gt;* Bottom 2 photos without flash</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my daughter wanted for Christmas. It is the same as described in the item information.</li>
            <li> so good you might be horrified...</li>
            <li> Pretty good - the 7 x magnification is very good.  The light could be a little stronger but its not bad - I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
            <li> I recently broke my lighted/magnifying makeup mirror and needed a new one ASAP, as I use it every day.  I looked at the web sites for local chain stores to check out the options before getting in the car to make the purchase.  The selection was limited and the prices were at least $60, which I thought was a lot.  I looked at Amazon and saw this product, which was about $22 and had received good reviews.  Pretty much of a no-brainer!  I ordered on Saturday evening and with Prime Shipping, had it on Monday evening, which was even faster than usual.  The mirror is smaller than my last one, but the oval shape works great.  The product comes in other finishes, but all were priced higher and the polished chrome looks just fine in my bathroom.  Overall, I am very satisfied with both the product and Amazon service.  BTW, I have no idea what \\&quot;touch activated power\\&quot; is, as my mirror has a regular on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I like that the thing is big and the mirror is of really good quality, but there is one issue - the lighting is not so perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The lightbulb is incadescent, and rather weak, so to get right illumination, my face has to be quite close to the mirror surface. And then I can really feel not just light, but also the heat, which makes makeup melt and is generally not too pleasant. I have been trying to find a fluorescent lightbulb as a replacement, but it is not so easy, since most fluorescent bulbs are too large to fit inside the thinnest part of the mirror.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 11 year old daughter for her birthday. There are a lot of these on amazon so it was a bit of a struggle to choose the right one. THIS was the right one. It&#x27;s nice have sturdy, heavy enough and the light is awesome. The reverse side has a magnification that&#x27;s clear as the real thing. We are very impressed.....and this would suit an adult easily.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror! It does a great job illuminating, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I was a  little bummed that the description was wrong. I chose this mirror from other brands because it advertised a 1X side and a 5X side, unlike others with a 7X side. This mirror DOES have a 7X side, though. I don&#x27;t mind it, but if I am a little more than a few inches away the image goes cross and it hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li> This mirror adds a classic look to a makeup table.  It is simple yet very effective with it&#x27;s double sides.</li>
            <li> This met all my expectations, plus.  It was also much less expensive than others I&#x27;d priced--so glad I have amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this mirror when it arrived.  It had great clarity in the reflection of the mirror.  The magnification was excellent.  The mechanism of the rotation of the mirror was smooth and had the right suspension to hold any angle.  The chrome finish looked really slick and made my vanity area look very nice. The complaint I had was the light.  After one week, the light did not work anymore.  I tried the mirror in several different plugs in my home, just in case there was a faulty plug.  Nope, the light was already.  I had no problems returning it due to the great system of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t really like the power plug either, I decided to return it altogether and try a different mirror. I ordered the Conair mirror with LED light which also runs on battery.  Will review this mirror once it arrives.</li>
            <li> OVERPRICED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip: DO NOT buy from this seller. Rips you off. I was in a bit of a rush to buy it, and upon receiving it in a package from Target (when did I make an online purchase from Target? huh.), looked it up on Target&#x27;s website and it was about a $20+ difference.  Returning it would cost me about that much in shipping fees so unfortunately will keep it. Will never buy anything from this seller and recommend looking elsewhere (I normally do, but was in a bit of a rush this time).  Will save you at least $20 (especially since I have the Target red card &#x3D; 5% off, then there was the $40 and get $10 gift card promotion. sigh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is actually pretty nice: the lights are bright, magnification is what I need, and looks nice on my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, AVOID seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: check Target and save yourself $$$, a big headache, and frustration, (and for me, a reader for college with the money I could have saved from NOT buying from this seller, two hours of working at my part-time job, and enough for two weeks of meals).</li>
            <li> Mirror does exactly what it is suppose to do. It&#x27;s a nice compliment to the bathroom. Recommend purchase and  gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars because i bought this one because it had the button on the base in the picture, but the model I received doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice mirror that actually revolves fully. I got one at first that barely even tilted, it was useless. The magnified side is just right without zooming in so much you are scared to look at yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is just right and helps a lot if you don&#x27;t have good lighting in your room. After a while it may heat up a bit though. But overall it feels a very high quality and would look good in any room or bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror- I have had it for 3 years now! To change the light bulb, there are two screws (one on each side) of the actual mirror part. After taking the screws out, you have to carefully pull the mirror apart to get to the light bulb compartment. I used \\&quot;GE Clear Night Light Candelabra Base 4 Watt C7 Bulbs Lamps 73257 91854\\&quot; - they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this mirror, I gave it four stars because I wanted it to be brighter but its still really nice.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift a year ago to our daughter. She still uses it daily and loves it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror but poor lighting.  I had to return this.  It casts a soft yellow halo light (about nightlight intensity).  If you don&#x27;t need the illumination it would be a fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would need to shave sitting by bathroom sink but this device is great assist to a temporary invalid.&lt;br /&gt;I know manufacturer intended other uses but that&#x27;s my story</li>
            <li> For the price this is amazing! Lol the day I got it in my half brother walked in and saw himself in the mirror and said &amp;#34;I hate your mirror!!!&amp;#34; because you know..everyone hates how their face looks in the zoom part of these mirrors, but its good because you can fix your imperfections easier</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking mirror. It is big enough to see your full face. I was concerned that the mirror would be small from what I can see in the picture. The only complaint I have for the mirror is that the light is not as bright as I would like it to be. It&#x27;s actually quite dim. I was expecting the light to be about as bright as natural light. Despite that fact I love the mirror and I am very happy with the price I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last minute add on for my mom&#x27;s Christmas gifts. Her current makeup mirror is ancient and falling apart. She likes this one, but says it isn&#x27;t bright enough. She will however, use it for clients. My mom does makeup and eyebrow arches for extra money. I think this mirror is good for the average user, but can&#x27;t compete with something professional quality. You cannot beat it for the price! My mom still uses her old mirror (which is so bright it leaves spots in your vision for a minute or two), but this one is still nice too.</li>
            <li> So far so good on this lighted mirror. Works great. Lights up and magnifies perfectly. Very very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Switch was cracked upon arrival. Cheap plastic. Taped together and kept cause I needed to use it right away. Would have sent back otherwise. Light and mirror are sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have had the mirror for 9 months and then suddenly the light won&#x27;t work.  So if you purchase, consider it a disposable lighted mirror.  For disposable - it&#x27;s way to expensive.  I would NOT order again.</li>
            <li> This product is everything I hoped it woul be! Large mirror area, swivel to any angle and height. Portable, nice long cord and it is lovely to look at. Lighted is an extra plus that makes it easy to see yourself .</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my cousin for Christmas. She loves it still. She has poor lighting in her bedroom and she never thought how much a difference a magnified mirror and lights can make. Her make up is flawless now and her eyebrows since she can tweeze every tiny little hair that you don&#x27;t see with a normal mirror. I also bought the bulbs that someone mentioned in one of these reviews just because it seems like it sells out a lot.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Seems to be very sturdy on it&#x27;s base. Very shiny chrome. The light is at a good brightness level - not overwhelming or hard on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very handy and precise. I love it. I would recommend it to anyone. I will order again and again.</li>
            <li> The light stopped working after 6 months...you have to hit it to get it to work but that doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I have a vanity but the light in my room is dim and this was the perfect solution. I love that it has the magnify mirror too.</li>
            <li> This mirror fits the bill as far as light and magnificiation BUT I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch. It&#x27;s one of those on the cord switches. Would be so much better if you could turn on by touching the base of mirror or having the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch on the base of mirror.</li>
            <li> The first mirror burned out within a day. I exchanged it for another hassle-free and it works fine. People complain about the magnification side... It does require you to put your face within a foot of the mirror in order to see yourself. You will see all of your pores and ugly blackheads no doubt. I use it to pluck hairs or make my eyeliner straight. I like this mirror and so far haven&#x27;t had any problems with the light. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it does what I paid for it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/01/13&lt;br /&gt;I TAKE IT BACK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours after I wrote the initial review, the lamp in my new mirror burned out as well. I don&#x27;t feel like sending it back so I&#x27;m just going to take away one star instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/8/13&lt;br /&gt;Okay nevermind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using it I flicked the switch out of habit and it came on again. I think the cord was kinked or something and it caused it to not turn on. The light works. It gets hot so don&#x27;t leave it on all day or anything like that. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend.  The electrical cord can&#x27;t be disconnected. The cord gets in the way if you don&#x27;t use the light feature. I have one like it and my cord can be disconnected, which is good because it sits on a shallow shelf and there&#x27;s no room for the cord.  I have a good overhead light source and don&#x27;t need the light feature. I think the ability/choice to detach the electrical cord is a must.</li>
            <li> This lighted mirror was perfect.  My wife loved it.  It is a great value for the price and will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a great height to use with vanity or if your sitting at a table or counter. The double sides are awesome for magnification and the lights are great for make-up application. The lights however are very dim and wont help very much in a dark room. The mirror is nice and heavy and doesn&#x27;t look cheap or flimsy, it is actually kinda thick (width wise) and a narrow oval shaped. The mirror is not wireless and features  long white/beige cord with an on/off switch on it. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend if the light were brighter, but besides that it was overall a good value.</li>
            <li> Just  what  I  wanted. The  magnifying  side  lets me  see  well how  to  apply  eye cosmetics. The  light  intensity  is just  right.</li>
            <li> My wife had purchaesed at least three different mirrors at local stores and none fither needs. This mirror is exactly what my wife wanted.  The height of the stand, the light, the magnification,--all are what she was looking for ever since her previous similar mirror was given to someone else.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have priced many mirrors and this is a GREAT value. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is made heavy and just as it shows in the picture. I was surprised and pleased with the quality and having it light up is a plus!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  It looks great on my dressing table and one side is a normal mirror while the other side is magnified.</li>
            <li> I bought the first one and really liked it. But then the on/off switch went bad after about 11 months and I had to replace the cord. About 3 months later, the light went out and I could not find a replacement bulb anywhere. The manufacturer could not even help on this. I waited almost one year before I decided to buy another one. I bought it only because when it is working, it is a very nice product. This one lasted only 10 months before the light burned out again. Will not purchase any other products from Conair again.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror, it has more magnification than the one it replaced.  It looks very nice sitting out on my vanity. The oval look is stylish but I wish it were just a little wider. Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars. Received in record time, too!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and refuse to spend over $100 on a mirror, get this one. This mirror is better than the $20 lighted Conair that&#x27;s sold in stores. It looks a lot like the high priced mirrors that you see in stores like Bed Bath and Beyond. The 7x side is perfect for doing detailed makeup looks without being too close. I absolutely love it and use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a month now and I use it almost every day. So far no problems! I use the mirror the way the instructions told me to...I keep it out of direct sunlight at all times and unplug it when I&#x27;m not using it. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. Firstly, the entire mirror heats up to quite a high temperature and very quickly at that. It almost seems like a fire hazard, which is why I make sure to keep it in a cool area and unplugged. Secondly, I was hoping the color of the light would look more natural when looking into the mirror, rather than bright yellow.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very cute. The light is soft and yellow -- I wonder if that&#x27;s the best lighting, though (sometimes I think it&#x27;s not bright enough -- but maybe it&#x27;s that way so you don&#x27;t over-do your makeup). My only real issue is that it radiates warmth like WOAH. My face literally gets hot if I&#x27;m in front of the mirror for too long.</li>
            <li> I dont know what all the bad reviews are about, this mirror is the best. Ive used this mirror everyday and it works so good. Great for plucking any facial hair and the lighting is perfect! Its sooo inexpensive and its one of the best item Ive purchased.</li>
            <li> The mirror was way too short and the light far too dim. I couldn&#x27;t use it. I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for my niece last Christmas. It is a very impressive product and she was thrilled to receive it. It&#x27;s a nice size and seems of good quality.</li>
            <li> The switch was on the cord.  It was really confusing before I bought this if it would be on the base or the cord.  We would have prefered the base but oh well, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has a great look and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  This was WAY cheaper than others we were looking and and probably not any worse.  We would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very stylish.  Both mirror sides are clear and functional, however, the light is not bright enough.  When I first turned it on, I assumed I had it on low and tried to turn it up, but alas, there is only one setting.  Also wish it had an auto-off feature.  Now I know what features to look for in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific deal! This mirror really helps so much! Great value for the price! I would recommend this item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size mirror but the light is a little dim. I thought it would be great for my vanity table with the maginfier and all but I have to use supplimental lighting since it&#x27;s so dim. Not bad for the price if you don&#x27;t mind using a lamp too.</li>
            <li> i like the mirror.  That only thing is it has been a little hard to get used to because I have used a round one for years.  I didn&#x27;t think there would be such a difference in the oval.  Lighting is good and that is nice to have. Magnifying side is also good.  Scary but good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She absolutely loves it.  Only negative comment would be...I couldn&#x27;t get it gift wrapped. I sent an email but never received a returned comment stating if they could or could not wrap it.  Only asked as I live in Florida she lives in New Jersey...I never had possession of it as I sent it to her house.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive mirror. The lighting is not the best, i am hoping to find replacement bulbs just a little brighter.</li>
            <li> A little to narrow.  I prefer the round design.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s plenty big for my needs, but the light could be a little brighter. I know I&#x27;m asking a lot from a 30 dollar mirror...but, that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Long enough cable to run behind a makeup desk.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use (just open and plug in!)&lt;br /&gt;-Light still working&lt;br /&gt;-Enough light&lt;br /&gt;- I gave this as a gift in December 2013. The light is still working despite being used at least once a day in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The finish seems a bit cheap upon closer inspection, but if you&#x27;re looking for functionality, this works&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re in a completely dark room with no other lighting, then consider buying something brighter or another light source&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: A good purchase that is dependable. Make sure you have other sources of light in the room. Then again, why would you be putting on makeup in a completely dark room?</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother as a Christmas gift and she loved it.  My wife and daughters now want one as well.</li>
            <li> The mirror was great while it worked. I loved that there were two different magnification options and that both sides light up. It&#x27;s big enough, but not so big that it takes up a ton of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this mirror for only two months and I used it to apply makeup 3-4 times per week for about 10 minutes at a time. This morning the light burnt out, which is ridiculous because I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long. I can&#x27;t see of any way to replace the light, and the mirror is now useless to me.</li>
            <li> She likes it a lot... uses it every day and we really like the finish... the light does a good job according to her.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. It&#x27;s perfect for applying makeup and getting those tiny little hairs from the brows. Portable and not heavy at all</li>
            <li> The light is not as good as on other mirrors i have tried nor does the magnification but for the price it worked well.</li>
            <li> We have several counter mirrors but ultimately this is the one that gets used most. The 7X magnification is more powerful than most but doesn&#x27;t distort like cheaper mirrors. The glass area is large and rotates easily between regular and magnification. Illumination is ok but doesn&#x27;t substitute for more powerful task lighting. Cleans up well; chrome finish has remained in good condition for 2+ years. Liked it enough to purchase a second.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. Light bright.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this mirror so I could apply my eyeliner up close, but I use it to apply all of my make up. Before I was using the large vanity mirror hung on my wall that was about 2 feet away from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taller so the only downfall is that the mirror sits low and I have to lean down a little, but I don&#x27;t see that being a problem for most people. The other potential downfall (that could be a good thing) is that I can see every blemish and &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34;. Due to this, I&#x27;m taking better care of my skin now since the damage is more noticeable in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, my vanity is set up in a low lit corner of my bedroom, and I often apply my makeup before sunrise. The ring of lighting is perfect! It&#x27;s not too bright and yet still provides enough light to see everything, including the unsightly.</li>
            <li> The light stopped functioning less than 6 months after purchase. The cord is faulty. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my mom for Christmas. She opened it, and within 5 minutes, she had it plugged in. The appearance of the mirror is very nice; it would look nice on a variety of vanities or nightstands. The price tag, especially compared to those of similar mirrors found in department stores, was especially convincing. I have another light-up mirror that uses really strong, blinding lights. The lighting on this mirror is gentle, yet effective. I would recommend this item to both gift-buyers and general purchasers alike. I&#x27;ve considered buying one of my own.</li>
            <li> The product is excelent and aldo has a very goo price. The illumination is not led but it is very good. Some reviews talk about how bad is the illumination but sincerely th-t is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I love having this mirror on my vanity for makeup application and using the magnified side for plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love this lighted mirror, especially with it having a regular mirror and magnifying mirror side that I can easily flip between.  Light is just right, not too dim or too bright and cord is long enough that I can hide it down the back of my vanity but still have it close to the front for use...my vanity is a little wider than most so this is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my fiancee after accidentally breaking her other one, not realizing how much these cost.  I have to say that this mirror is fantastic--the lighting is subtle and effective, while the magnification leaves me wanting to desperately take care of my skin a bit better.  This has the power to point out infinite flaws in my complexion, and has the power to leave its owner miserable and disgusted with his or her appearance :)</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife&#x27;s because she always talked about wanting a lighted, magnified makeup mirror but never made the purchase.  My considerations were that it is big enough to use but not so big as to overwhelm our shared vanity.  The Conair BE47X fit the bill nicely.  She loves the mirror and it&#x27;s getting daily use.  For me, the oblong shape of the mirror looks nice, provides a good view and takes up less space than an oval shaped mirror.  The design is classy, simple and clean and fits in with the other vanity hardware.  The lighting is pretty good - the only complaint is the base gets hot if the light is left over a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Do not buy unless you like &amp;#34;illuminated&amp;#34; mirrors without illumination....Wish I considered reading the other reviews before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Compared to competitiors in this price range, this mirror is definitely a winner. However, the lighting is a little too ...spaced out? The lights aren&#x27;t even and do not illuminate your face evenly. I still use it, but it&#x27;s not perfect. Better than spending $100, though.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup, I can truly see everything to help apply makeup evenly.  The light isnt very bright but it does a decent job. Its and elegant piece and I paid 21 bucks on Amazon for it, about ten dollars less than in store plus free shipping.Great quality for the price except for the not so bright light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this mirror it comes in handy and I noticed that people are complaining about the lightening on the mirror well I can honestly say that you have to be in a room where there is good light and the light from the mirror will show even more brighter you can&#x27;t sit in a room with no light at all and expect the light from the mirror to be your only source that it not what that is for (not trying to down play anyone but I keeps it real here) but other than that I love this mirror when I bought it was at a great price! So I couldn&#x27;t help myself but to go ahead and buy it I&#x27;ve never had one of these mirrors before this is my first time and I&#x27;m very pleased with my product. Again, thanks Amazon!!!!! and thanks to the seller as well! I love the the double mirrors of where you can look on one side there is a normal view and a magnified side where you can see things much more easier especially when you are putting on make-up such as eyeshadow or lip gloss. This mirror does come in handy I can tell you that much :)</li>
            <li> This mirror is the perfect size, the light works well, the cord is long, and the magnifying side is great.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great mirror :) Had to wait a long time to get it, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Mirror does everything expected and my wife likes the product.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror. It has a good size and weight. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap. The lighting isn&#x27;t as bright as it could be but still happy with this mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I had for several years. The magnification is good and the light is adequate. I like that I can use to magnifying side to apply my makeup and then see the full face view on the other side.  I would recommend this to anyone that needs a double-sided mirror.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It is clear and great for makeup. I wish it was just a bit bigger so I wont have to get so close to it, but Its still s great product. Only down side is that the lights can get a bit hot in room temperature areas above 75 degrees.</li>
            <li> Met our needs for a small mirror for guests in our guest bathroom.  Too small in my opinion to use for every day. Construction is solid, looks good and the mirrors are clear.  The light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> too small- and this should have been obvious to me.but there is only one light setting and it&#x27;s not bright at all</li>
            <li> This mirror has been very helpful.  The light is working out well and I don&#x27;t have to turn on any other lights when I&#x27;m getting my face ready for the morning, which is great for my husband.  The only dissappointment is that the glass on one side has a tiny scratch on it, but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot  it&#x27;s great for the price.  Could be a little brighter but it works great for me.  Love how it has two sides of magnification and looks great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome mirror. Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and looks very modern</li>
            <li> The light could be brighter and the in-line wheel switch stinks.  It needs to have the mechanical switch back on the base.</li>
            <li> I Love this. Exactly what I needed- Altho I thought I read there was a plug on back to plug something into??</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected. The magnification is great and lighting is bright. Great buy!</li>
            <li> It is a great size for setting on the bathroom counter.  The magnification is just right with lighted mirror.  I saw one for $129 at another store - and this was equally as good and more reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror to put my makeup on in the morning. The light could be a little brighter but it&#x27;s ok with a light on in the room or sunlight. It&#x27;s a decent mirror.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. It works great. Quality of build is not the best though. Mostly made of lower grade plastic. I am afraid that if it felll off the counter it would break very easily.</li>
            <li> Mirror reflects well, nice amount of light.</li>
            <li> It is too big for my needs and space, I should have paid more attention to its dimensions. Also, oval shape for a usually round face.....</li>
            <li> These are very expensive at retail stores.  Works great and looks good on the vanity.  Decent size.  Great value.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 years now and it&#x27;s still just as wonderful as the day I bought it. Great deal and great quality.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping around for a lighted mirror for a while and finally was set on this one.  I love it!  The light is just bright enough, the magnified mirror really shows EVERYTHING which could be good or bad I guess.  Great for doing my eyebrows and seeing every last little hair.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone thinking of purchasing it!</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace the one I broke. The one my husband bought me was a few steps up from this one. This one works just as we&#x27;ll I just wish the light switch was on the base instead of on the cord.</li>
            <li> For my Granddaughter. She loved mine so much I bought her one.</li>
            <li> Awesome mirror my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a mirror like this (magnification on one side, chrome finished, plus a light) forever but the best I could find was closed to fifty dollars! This is beautiful and has everything  I want. I haven&#x27;t tried to replace the light bulb yet though so I&#x27;m not sure how difficult  it will be. Overall very happy!</li>
            <li> very nice mirror came quick too all i can say for now due to it being a christmas gift thumbs up bigger and prettier then i thought it would be</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. I was worried that it would be low quality because it was affordable but it was not. The light was bright enough for me. The mirror is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife had looked for a mirror at several stores but did not want a round one, which seems to be the only thing offered in the stores. Found this one and bought it for her. It is a little bigger than I expected, but she likes it. It is very well made. The light is a nice touch, although we don&#x27;t use it much in a well lit bathroom. The base is nice and heavy which helps make the mirror more stable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> I must have read 200 reviews before deciding which mirror to purchase. I choose this one because the price was right and most of the reviews were positive. Unfortunately, several of the reviews reported that the light bulbs in this mirror are quite faulty. And, my purchase was no exception to the rule. After one use, the light bulb burnt out.  I was furious, but I knew it was risky after reading the reviews. So, I am off to buy a replacement bulb today and make a suggestion to the manufacturer that they include spare bulbs with a new lamp and/or reassess the function of their product and the light bulbs required. The mirror is great for the price, just accept that you will encounter issues with the light bulb.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was very happy when she opened the Amazon box to find the lighted mirror.  She is 19.  She uses it almost daily and is happy with the size and the way it works.</li>
            <li> This great looking mirror is just the right magnification for applying make up.  I Just wish the light were brighter</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this mirror. I love it. After two days of using it, I can&#x27;t believe I ever applied my makeup without it. The magnified side is perfect for eye and lip makeup, as well as eliminating unwanted facial hair. With both sides, you get the perfect perspective on how you really look.</li>
            <li> I bought the chrome finish, which was far less than other finishes in the same product.  Not disappointed at all, as it matches my bathroom faucet and towel bars, even though the other finishes might be more popular.  The mirror is a good face-sized oval, the cord is plenty long (I&#x27;m keeping about half of mine looped with a twist tie), and I really like the on/off switch on the cord itself.  The light could be brighter (only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5-star), but it might be too hot for my taste if it was.  I actually bought one of these for a co-worker&#x27;s birthday, and I liked it so much I purchased another for myself!  If you have a small vanity area, this is a space saver and works every bit as well as a traditional rectangular makeup mirror.  What a joy to not be fighting half-frame glasses anymore to smoothly apply makeup or shape a brow!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!! It makes getting ready such a breeze, the halo light is such a great feature. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> The mirror magnification is pretty good.  The light is not as bright as I would like.  Mirror height is also good.</li>
            <li> I searched high &amp; low for a mirror to apply my makeup and this one was the BEST!  It provided the largest mirror so I can see my whole face, the lighting is just perfect-bright enough, yet super soft and flattering, perfect magnification on the one side for tweezing (without being too strong and making you dizzy), and the overall height of the mirror is the best-nice and high, so I don&#x27;t have to hunch over to see!  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, delivered promptly and very quality crafted-I love it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It looks great in my dressing room, but I really wish the light was much brighter. I was hoping to be able to use the light from this mirror for make-up without needing to turn on the over-head light, but alas that just isn&#x27;t possible with this mirror. Otherwise it&#x27;s of good quality.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this mirror after having watched her juggling a hand mirror while sitting at her vanity. I did not know this, but apparently the mirrors on the vanity itself were not quite right for the application of makeup. After using it my wife keeps asking why she had never purchased one of these before as it was so useful. I still have no answer for the question, but I am pleased that she likes it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification makes some of her close up work very simple and the light was a nice addition to her current lighting scheme. The light appears very sturdy and the bulb looks to be fairly easy to replace when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This is a very good mirror.  Not too much magnification which can be scary.&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional product at an exceptional price.</li>
            <li> Its good but gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I use it for doing my makeup and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it gets a little hot, but it isn&#x27;t going to burn you or anything.  It was worth the money and I am very happy</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago as a replacement and use it every day!! it&#x27;s great! bright enough to see whatever you need (or don&#x27;t need) to see hahaha The only thing that would make it better is to have a plug on the base of the mirror. It would be nice to plug in a straightener, hair dryer, or even a hot plate for my coffee!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS, HIGH-END LOOKING MIRROR THAT IS ALSO VERY FUNCTIONAL. WELL WORTH THE $$&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE A DARK BEDROOM, AND WHILE THIS LIGHT SEEMS VERY DIM FROM FAR AWAY, IT IS PERFECT LIGHTING WHILE SITTING IN FRONT OF IT. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Before buying this mirror I read some reviews that said that the light was dim, but other reviews contradicted this fact, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Two sided with great magnification&lt;br /&gt;2) Light surrounding the mirror has nice distribution causing no shade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Light is dim, you can put make up on, but the main light has to be on&lt;br /&gt;2) The switch is located on the cord and is very tight, so if you get out of the shower and your hands are moist, it&#x27;s very hard to turn it on. I would prefer a switch on the mirror itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will do the job, but not the best choice</li>
            <li> I needed a lighted mirror for my shave den and this does the job nicely. The lighting is not extremely bright, but compliments over-head lighting, providing enough extra light so that I can see where my razor is going. I also like that the internal light bulb provides enough heat to keep the mirror fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this mirror goes wrong for me is that it is a little too tall. I prefer something a bit more squat, but that is just a personal preference. What I really don&#x27;t like about this mirror is that it is narrow. I wished the oval was larger by two inches and then this would be a much better product. As it is, it just doesn&#x27;t provide enough viewing space without having a cramped feeling when looking into it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mirror!  The light is perfect, as is the magnification.  It also looks nice on my vanity top.  Would definitely recommend it for quality, appearance and functionality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was just an ordinary mirror with lights, boy was I wrong!  The mirror itself is gorgeous and well made!  And the magnification side makes me feel like a model when applying makeup, it&#x27;s extremely helpful for every inch of application!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Really helps these old eyes do make-up.  Light is nice.  Magnification shows me things I&#x27;m sure I want to see at 75.</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research comparing the different lighted mirrors online and in the stores. This one seemed to fit all of my specifications- large size, good quality, power cord with convenient power control, great style. I was NOT disappointed. This product comes packed exceptionally well, is beautiful, has a very nice size, without being cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Great Mirror. I like the look and lighting of this mirror. I do wish it were a bit wider though. That&#x27;s the only thing that knocks it back to 4 stars!</li>
            <li> It was a great buy all the local stores carry battery only lighted mirrors and this one plugs in and made my wife very happy!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for, with a soft light that is sufficient enough to apply makeup, but not too bright.  If you want to put make-up on under photo-shoot lights, this is not for you.  Most of us don&#x27;t live under photo shoot lights and this will be great for us.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the mirror is on a stand that puts it up at face level when set on my vanity - I don&#x27;t have to lean over to see my face (like with the rectangle ones).  I also like that it is not battery operated - the light will be more consistent that way.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tested the anti-fog glass, but I do not doubt that it will work out fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for the price.  It is heavy in weight; certainly shouldn&#x27;t tip over.  The light is good, not too dim, not too bright.  The electric cord is long enough to hide behind something and the easy on/off switch is accessible.  It was a little bit of an adjustment for me because this is truly an oval shape but it&#x27;s a great mirror.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this to sit on my vanity, it works perfectly! The lighting shouldn&#x27;t be used alone, I still go to my bathroom to put on my foundation and powder because this just isn&#x27;t big enough and doesn&#x27;t provide enough light. But up close for eyeliner, lip liner, eye shadow, and brows it is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I returned it as the description state 1 and 5X, I received 1 and 7X...I could not focus in this mirror. I did speak with customer service about the conflicting decision...the rep said, he would look into the decription.</li>
            <li> works better than the +$50 mirros at bed bath and beyond</li>
            <li> Spent alot of time reading reviews as I have never owned a mske up mirror.  This is perfect.  Sits nicely on counter and enables me to put on eye shadows and mascara easily.  I like the magnification.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for a good mirror. For the price, I dont think you could get a better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft light, could be brighter but I dont know how much light people are expecting from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnifying  excellent to put eye makeup on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good overall mirror</li>
            <li> I luuurrrrvvveee staring at myself, and with 10x magnification on one side, i can stare even harder. i&#x27;m beautiful. that&#x27;s all. thanks conair.</li>
            <li> I love the size.  The purpose of this mirror is for my hair and make up.  I wanted it for my vanity in my room, so I don&#x27;t have to get ready in the bathroom.  The mirror is long enough that I can curl my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying the lights are too dim.  They&#x27;re perfect.  Any brighter and it would hurt my eyes.  The mirror gets warm when the lights are on, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  My mom was so impressed with this mirror, she has just purchased her own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year and is still working. My rating is due to the fact that the light is yellow and not white but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Looks nice. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the sticker that was on the base. I was not able to remove it well so it left ugly/sticky residue on my mirror&#x27;s base. Get better glue. :(</li>
            <li> This light oval mirror has a regular and magnifier side that work nicely and the ability to light the mirror makes it easy to use.  Great price.  Arrived on time in perdect condition.</li>
            <li> Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Good Size&lt;br /&gt;Good amount of light (would prefer something a little brighter)&lt;br /&gt;Prefer touch lighting instead of the switch (personal preference)</li>
            <li> The packing was terrible.........it arrived broken on one side. It was much bigger than I had expected. I was able to determine that I would not have liked the magnification........way too much.  It made my stomach feel quesy when looking in it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and was given a refund......no hassle.</li>
            <li> The light on this is terrible so I have to use a desk lamp when I use it and it&#x27;s annoying to adjust the mirrors but it does it&#x27;s job, I guess.</li>
            <li> Happy Customer Item just like discribed</li>
            <li> Well, I love this mirror, the light, the form and the color. I just love it. The only reason I have to return this is that I want to put it in my bookcase but it is too tall to fit in. The description said it is 8 inch tall, but actually it is more than 16 inch tall. 8 inch is just the mirror part, not include the support stick. So, hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  I needed a mirror to put my make-up on while my husband sleeps in the morning and it works for me without bothering him. I check the make-up application in the car in the day light and its perfect!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted, works great. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> Kind of a dim light. Not terrible, but the double door models are way more efficient</li>
            <li> This mirror serves my purposes well. The 7x is perfect magnification for eye make-up application and tweezing. It flips easily to give a complete view. The height is perfect on my dressing table and I can see my entire face. While the light is not overly bright, I have a lamp and window next to it, so it serves me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chrome frame does get a bit warm, but I&#x27;ve never burned myself with it.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the light really works well for putting on make up and tweezing excess eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was wanting, great little mirror with lighted magnification. Looks attractive just sitting by itself. The on/off switch is on the cord which was not very clear in the description, but it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> I never knew I had a tiny mustache until today. Thank you Conair. Thank you. I would recommend pairing this mirror with a tweezer and a backhead pore strip. enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very nice. High quality.</li>
            <li> A very elegant mirrors with great magnifying quality.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. It has a plug in to the wall with a switch on the cord to turn the light on and off. It is reversible, one side has a higher magnification (which I don&#x27;t typically use) and the other is lower magnification. It is just the right size to fit in the corner of my dresser and it looks nice too. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had one of those stick on enlarging mirrors in the bathroom and this is sooo much better. It&#x27;s good size, I can move it around if I want to and I love the light inside which makes putting on make-up and stuff so much easier to see. I absolutely love this mirror, great quality and a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought one for each of my 2 daughters, and they both love it.  Much classier looking than others you can buy at a discount store, and the price was nice, too.</li>
            <li> I received this mirror and must say it is a little smaller than I originally thought, but after using it realized it is actually the perfect size.  I used both sides and love the magnification side as well as the regular side.  When applying make-up, I realize I am now using much less make-up than before because I can actually see every detail of my eyes and can see where more/less needs to be applied.  This has saved me money on my make-up purchases as I run out less now.  Plus, the soft lighting at first seemed too soft, but then when I used it, as before, realized that it is actually the perfecting lighting.  If it were brighter I don&#x27;t think I would like it as much.  It&#x27;s a soft glow.  It does plug in which is great because no batteries to purchase.  There is a little toggle switch on the cord which turns it off/on.  All in all, this is a great purchase and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it.  Takes up less room on my desk and is built well.  It&#x27;s not bulky at all.  I recommend this lighted mirror.  I know I am very pleased with it so far.  I even get one for my daughter to use.</li>
            <li> The mirror is well made, stands very steady and it is ETL listed (rather than UL listed).  The base stem is tall enough because the mirror flips easily so you can angle it however you need to.  The mirror is wide enough to see your face as well as your hair (and I have a lot of hair).  The light is not so bright that it blinds you but bright enough that you can see without any additional lighting.  The magnification is perfect for applying eye makeup or for evaluating small imperfections.  I purchased the polished chrome which looks very nice and not cheap.  An excellent price at $21.  I would have paid twice the price and I would have still felt that I had gotten a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.  The edge around the mirror where the light is gets very, very hot so be very, very careful.  Remember, it is not UL listed.</li>
            <li> I needed a brighter light to beat the shadows and side window in my bathroom, but this lighting didn&#x27;t do a great job. I like having a double sided mirror though!</li>
            <li> This beautiful vanity mirror looks far more substantial than the photo illustrates! It is a well-balanced design with a weighty base (just like mirrors 500% more expensive), so no worries about kitty knocking it over...impossible! I am far-sighted, yet find the illumination quite bright and the 5X magnification more than I need. The graduated design of the base (very Art Deco) looks lovely seated on my vintage 1930&#x27;s manicurist station, which I use as a dressing table. The &amp;#34;stems&amp;#34; of the &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; frame that allow the mirror to pivot are solid and well-designed - again, details that lend an overall high-quality look to this piece. I think the beautiful and very well functioning design make this mirror a bargain for the price. It would also make a great gift for the glamorous woman in your life. Well done, Conair!</li>
            <li> work as expected but I wish I would have gotten the 10 XI really need the greater magnification</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they seemed happy with it</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Oval shape being too narrow on the magnified side.  It&#x27;s great for putting on liner and mascara...but one can&#x27;t see both eyes at the same time...maybe it&#x27;s my eye sight so I can&#x27;t back up far enough to see both eyes at the same time.  This makes putting on eye shadow a bit harder for me.  I have to use the regular side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve adjusted but still disappointed in my choice, next time I&#x27;ll buy a round mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is well made, as I expected from Conair.  I buy most of my beauty products from them.  It&#x27;s a good product but just not the perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> Looks good on my vanity but I don&#x27;t like the yellow light. I assume that can easily be replaced though...</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for my daughter in law, She said she loves it an  it does just what&lt;br /&gt; she wanted it for</li>
            <li> it really helps  to have  a light, even tho we then need a plug and have to tangle with the cord.  this didn&#x27;t cost much more than one without a light, and  it makes a world of difference to have the  illumination.  sturdy with good quality glass and magnification.</li>
            <li> Sturdy mirror, good light provided for both magnification and regular mirror sides.  mirror swivels easily to change sides &amp; magnification.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it....</li>
    </ol>
