            <li>Perfect scent...lasts all day</li>
            <li>I also ordered Girlfriend fragrance and it is wonderful also!</li>
            <li>I had no idea that Patti LaBelle had a perfume out till I was on amazon.com doing some browsing and searching and then came across this wonderful smelling perfume,I bought it for my mom as a gift</li>
            <li>But it has a great aroma.</li>
            <li>Seems better worn in the fall &amp; winter months, because of it&#x27;s great sillage.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells really nice.</li>

            <li>I love it, so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>This I think is more appropriate for evening wear, and only when you&#x27;re in the mood to be bold.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of sprays on the pulse points is almost too much for me.</li>
            <li>This has a very musky floral mature smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely, delicate scent...to be worn gently.  </li>
            <li>cause she is really into perfume and has like a zillion bottles of all different kinds of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>If you can last 4 hours wearing this it becomes quite engaging &amp; a somewhat comforting scent, but only after the dry down.</li>

            <li> Love It!!!!! Enough said.</li>
            <li> as a gift , my daughter love this products...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely, delicate scent...to be worn gently.  It compliments the finer fabrics and lingers even the day after.  I would purchase this item for friends and family, birthdays and holidays going forward.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t  the one I  wanted. But it has a great aroma.</li>
            <li> My wife is now speaking to me!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really nice. I purchased one for myself and another as a Christmas present. I prefer this perfume over some of my more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume...Perfect scent...lasts all day</li>
            <li> I loved this product as most things by Miss Patti Labelle. I also ordered Girlfriend fragrance and it is wonderful also!</li>
            <li> I had no idea that Patti LaBelle had a perfume out till I was on amazon.com doing some browsing and searching and then came across this wonderful smelling perfume,I bought it for my mom as a gift cause she is really into perfume and has like a zillion bottles of all different kinds of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the smell and so do I.</li>
            <li> I love my perfume Amazon</li>
            <li> I was dissapoointed in the nail hardener because it said pack of two and i only received one.</li>
            <li> I love it, so glad I found it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been looking all over.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Now I&#x27;m looking for a gift set, might as well start my Christmas shopping now.</li>
            <li> This has a very musky floral mature smell. If you can last 4 hours wearing this it becomes quite engaging &amp; a somewhat comforting scent, but only after the dry down. Seems better worn in the fall &amp; winter months, because of it&#x27;s great sillage. Just a couple of sprays on the pulse points is almost too much for me. It&#x27;s a heavy white floral with notes of gardenia that scream out. I do smell hints of tangerine &amp; lily from time to time. This I think is more appropriate for evening wear, and only when you&#x27;re in the mood to be bold. Otherwise, this may be offensive to some, especially if worn in the spring or summer.</li>
