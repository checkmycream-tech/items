            <li>My hygienist said it was as good or better than flossing and excellent for the gums.</li>
            <li>It was a pleasant surprise for me to receive an electric toothbrush along with my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt feel pleasant to apply the toothbrush head on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt my teeth so clean before !!!</li>
            <li>Amazing deal to get both a great toothbrush and the waterpik.</li>
            <li>Just had my dental check up and have been using my pik, brushing and flossing morning and night and the hygienist said my teeth were really good.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good ，High performance price ratio，Feel good</li>
            <li>i loved this product and my boyfriend gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is good.  </li>
            <li>If you looking for good water pick made in good ol US, you will have problem.</li>
            <li>About 2 months ago when I purchased this unit , they claimed that this unit pic was made in states with good warrantee.  </li>
            <li>the good.</li>
            <li>Good pressure..</li>
            <li>Really good unit.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>We three have used it for a year and it works good.  </li>
            <li>Again, who knows if it is an improvement over good ol&#x27; flossing.</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these units for myself and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my wife, she loved the convenience of having both unit in one.</li>
            <li>However, he did agree my teeth and gums are in good shape.</li>
            <li>i never imagined that it would be so good.</li>
            <li>I figured I was getting a good deal.)</li>
            <li>so I have no idea whether or not the toothbrush is all that good or not.</li>
            <li>The product until it was fully functional was great and effective.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Good for home use .</li>
            <li>This product looks good.</li>
            <li>Tested and the power of the jet is good and also the speed of the brush.</li>
            <li>I would not buy again with the sonic brush as it does not do a good job of cleaning my teeth, so I use my Philips Soniccare brush to brush with.  </li>
            <li>Good Price.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>so that was good.  </li>
            <li>All good things, but that&#x27;s where it winds down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is quite good.</li>
            <li>Quality wise</li>
            <li>This should NOT replace good flossing habits.</li>
            <li>good product, but it needs stowage for the brushes</li>
            <li>I did not notice that the toothbrush was not as good until about a month after I got it.</li>
            <li>Good 2-in-1 oral care.</li>
            <li>Keeps me focused on getting a good brushing</li>
            <li>This is a really nice unit, and the sonic toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li>I went for a dental check up on Thursday and the dentist did mention I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The merchandise arrived in good shape in a timely fashon.</li>
            <li>We tested it out and it works good.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is really good quality too.</li>
            <li>The sonic toothbrush works great and completes the cleaning process nicely.</li>

            <li>Works good.  </li>
            <li>It is a good feeling knowing that that this machine works.</li>
            <li>anyway, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Works well and comes with a good selction of tips.  </li>
            <li>Good power.</li>

            <li>loved mine</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved my unit and depended on it to get my teeth their cleanest.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good at cleaning and now i&#x27;m fond of brushing my teeth..</li>
            <li>its good and multi choice for cleaning tooth</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>It was a good buy</li>
            <li>Good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I believe this was a good deal.</li>
            <li>works good just what we needed</li>
            <li>but I was taken aback by how good this is.</li>
            <li>Does a really good job and everything stores inside the storage compartment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for teeth care!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>cause it doesnt rotate, but that is the good of it because the vibration and manual work takes care of the nastiest stains (ie coffee he drinks by the gallon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause it doesnt rotate, but that is the good of it because the vibration and manual work takes care of the nastiest stains (ie coffee he drinks by the gallon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>A must-have for good dental care.  </li>

            <li>good by gum disease...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This unit looked like a good idea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The sonic toothbrush that is integrated works good too.</li>
            <li>Since I have implants, it&#x27;s a good idea to use a waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Use this twice a day for just two weeks (with a good baking soda/peroxide toothpaste), and my teeth were shades whiter.</li>
            <li>this is good for a touch up.</li>
            <li>I would say that the tooth brush works just as good as my Sonicare as well.</li>
            <li>it has a lot of good reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Price is good for what you get.</li>
            <li>The sonic brush is as good as the Sonicare I was using.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a sonic toothbrush anf came across the waterpik sonic toothbrush plus water flosser and thought I might as well try it because the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>good customer service and a good product; i have no problems recommending this to anyone scared of the price tag.</li>
            <li>, you are on the road to good gum health.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my impression is that this sonic toothbrush and water flosser pair work fairly well.  </li>
            <li>After the meal is good for removing plaque.</li>
            <li>Dentist told me to stay away from flossing under my bridge and showed me an air cleaner that shoots air through, did not like it and didn&#x27;t  seem to work good</li>
            <li>Wall mounting model might be a good idea too.</li>
            <li>good :</li>

            <li>i had an oral B toothbrush that i loved but collected mold on the handle after a while.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this since I wanted a good quality electric toothbrush as well as a water flosser.</li>
            <li>size is fairly compact for the 2 items in one unless you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space</li>
            <li>good pressure with the waterpik as well.</li>
            <li>Compact, good quality, good price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very handy having the water pic and tooth brush in one handy unit.  </li>

            <li>This brush is definitely powerful and the two settings are perfect.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job and is a nice combo with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been a SonicCare toothbrush user, but I honestly think this toothbrush does just as good of a job.</li>
            <li>Got new braces and needed both the toothbrush and water pic, this set is perfect and great value.</li>
            <li>A very nice product and I am glad to bought it.</li>

            <li>I was leery of investing nearly $100 in this product, however, it works perfectly and has greatly improved my oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Most were quite good but none as good as this.</li>
            <li>Happy clean teeth!</li>
            <li>The flossing pik is very effective and my teeth feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome first time I ever used one</li>
            <li>Always fill up with warm water! :)</li>
            <li>He likes using it &amp; am sure it will be beneficial!</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>First time using a Waterpik - both my Dentist and myself are very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>And one more thing, also a travel case for the brush!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This was pretty awesome to find both a toothbrush and water pic in one product.</li>
            <li>got it for the wife and daughter, they love it!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never looked or felt better!  </li>
            <li>That is one reason I want to advocate it for others by giving it 5 STARS, but also want to note for Water Pik that they need to design a better handle holder to hold the waterpik apparatus!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have used this brush and flossed for about a year now and love it!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this unit!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they ARE working together to improve my dental health!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost a week and love it!  </li>
            <li>Also, my dentist mentioned a &amp;#34;water flosser&amp;#34; and I think I thought this might be more pleasant than flossing my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tooth care product was easy to use and it does a great job of cleaning between my implants and crowns.  </li>
            <li>The waterpik is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If I would have known that a waterpik was so easy to use and would make my teeth and gums feel so great</li>
            <li>The Pik is easy to use but a bit noisy but it seems to do a great job of cleaning out the spaces between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
            <li>Great to have both tools in one place and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has strong water pressure that is adjustable, and the toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are strong, but i still feel like it does a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush speaking husband says is great works just fine for him.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush speaking husband says is great works just fine for him.</li>
            <li>Excellent ,I love it very much!</li>
            <li>and I love the ultrasonic brush, it makes my teeth and gums feel so clean!!!</li>
            <li>I love this unit, my teeth get an awesome clean  with the tooth brush and my gums get a great clean with the water flosser.  </li>

            <li>Amazing pik.</li>
            <li>Amazing tooth brush.</li>
            <li>toothbrush does a great job and is quite comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li>This waterpik is amazing.  </li>
            <li>OMG this this is amazing ....</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for keeping your teeth free of yesterday&#x27;s meals.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is an Amazing Company as well....  </li>
            <li>It does an amazing job at cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing after using it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, &amp; great value.</li>
            <li>Then you can blast your gums with the handy dandy sprayer which also does an amazing job of cleaning the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective but can&#x27;t complain at this price point.</li>
            <li>so well my wife wanted her own.</li>
            <li>But still worthwhile, as a good transformer is around $40 from China.</li>
            <li>My dentist liked it as well</li>
            <li>Cleans between teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li>Plus now that it is winter, I&#x27;d have to wait for the warm water to come up the tap, which again just feels so wasteful to me.</li>
            <li>After 15 years of using Braun, I&#x27;ve decided this is as good or better.</li>
            <li>Having the toothbrush and water pik together in one device is handy and makes sense.</li>
            <li>Great product, as expected: good quality and excellent for teeth</li>
            <li>A Quality and effective dental products that everyone should have</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enthusiastic that it will go well.  </li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush seems particularly effective.</li>
            <li>I liked the reviews,thewaterpik WP  </li>
            <li>I had to buy her one of her own.  </li>
            <li>The water container is a nice size for someone who is vegetarian, and eats a lot of seeds, nuts, and greens.</li>
            <li>so nice to have both items in oe unit ...</li>
            <li>It really does an excellent job I use it with the pocketpik attachment  </li>
            <li>I was a sceptic about this kind of thing, but my gums are healthier, my teeth whiter</li>
            <li>It takes up some room on the counter but it looks nice still</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how effective the waterpic is.  </li>
            <li>I really, really liked this toothbrush as it cleaned so well.</li>
            <li>I guess it kind of pricey</li>
            <li>You rinse it and fill it with warm water.  </li>
            <li>We each have our own method of use.  </li>
            <li>I love the water pic and already have a good electric brush.</li>
            <li>And the Waterpik is really nice too.</li>
            <li>We own it for over a year and it still works.</li>
            <li>Nice travel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so adept at handling the waterpik part for flossing.</li>
            <li>Size good for counter top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an effective waterpik and sonic toothbrush system.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t always have time to wait for it to warm up to use it.  </li>
            <li>really nice sonic toothbrush and both</li>
            <li>Such a great buy and works incredibly well!</li>
            <li>I had a waterpik flosser before that I liked.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this combo with both the water pik and the electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of nice because the toothbrush has a two minute timer on it and pauses every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, all-in-one.</li>
            <li>I did not know that  a brush can be that effective in cleansing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The storage area for tips is nice and the water canister holds plenty of water without needing to refill it.</li>
            <li>and it gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li>Well, it is quite nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;s nice to have them together</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so nice</li>
            <li>: Is nice to have waterpik and toothbrush in one unit.</li>
            <li>Why will the customer bear the price of this kind of a mistake in shipping?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li>A nice, compact unit.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had bought this years ago, The tooth brush is really nice too.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say this thing has changed my life.</li>
            <li>but I am loving how my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>Nice to have one machine talking up space rather than two.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice combination flosser/toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is really nice also - two speeds and a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>Not only does the 2 in 1 design save space, the toothbrush is awesome, and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Honestly feel like I have gone through an awakening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik flosser before, but I forgot just how effective they are at removing debris in between teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The results are astounding, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice compact unit.</li>
            <li>I have never had a toothbrush that is so effective.  </li>
            <li>The water spray feature cleans the crevices around the teeth effectively and reduces gum irritation.</li>
            <li>The pulse cleaning pressure is good, and better than competing brands I have tried, in flushing particles at the gum tooth interface.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as sonicare but way better price.</li>
            <li>My dentist is thrilled.</li>
            <li>The water floss function is really effective.</li>
            <li>I also put a capful of mouthwash in the water container, and I also use warm water.</li>
            <li>nice thing.</li>
            <li>and they were so incredibly nice and helpful.  </li>
            <li>I guess if it worked it would be nice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving this thing</li>
            <li>Nice unit.</li>
            <li>The sonic brush is awesome and more powerful than the Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>And the Water Pik is really nice too.</li>
            <li>The travel case is also nice &amp; sturdy.</li>
            <li>works nicely, but a bit noisy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have an all in one waterpik and sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>Came in nice packaging; items were well protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m over it, and it gets the job done effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have all dental appliances in one to save space and stuff falling off shelf.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping excellent product!</li>
            <li>My dentist has smiled after my routine visits ever since I acquired this Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>If it is as durable as it is effective, it will be a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water flosser is great too, very powerful and effective at reducing gum inflammation.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and is super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Both the flosses and toothbrush are great and it&#x27;s worth it to buy!</li>
            <li>Very good teeth waterline used, and the price is very appropriate, very affordable</li>
            <li>I never thought I would say flossing would be fun!!!</li>
            <li>but my mouth is so FRESH!!!</li>
            <li>Best thing ever I don&#x27;t usually like to floss so this is great!</li>
            <li>What is great is this one I don&#x27;t have to fill up three times to clean my teeth(one shot)</li>
            <li>My mouth feels really clean after each use and the quadrant timer on the toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>Feels great to have clean teeth again.</li>
            <li>This is great, my teeth are clean and sparkling.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use it I am blown away by how clean and great my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Great clean feeling every morning and night</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on Amazon and took note of the problems people had, but the high ratings were encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;After a month with the product, I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased except the flossing tool should better store on the unit.</li>
            <li>They both keep my teeth so clean!!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new Waterpik WP-900 Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to have the combination of brush and waterpik, which reduces clutter on the bathroom sink and is much more cost effective than buying two separate units.</li>
            <li>This 2 in 1 gizmo solved the problem splendidly and economically.</li>
            <li>She actually said &amp;#34;your at home care has done a 360, keep up the good work!&amp;#34; Very happy!!!</li>
            <li>Just a great, quick cleaning</li>
            <li>what a wonderful device, after brushing I use the waterpick it leaves your mouth super clean and refreshed</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned it runs out of water too quickly, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that yet.</li>
            <li>the more i used it the more i saw good results  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this company or this very excellent product.</li>
            <li>When we called the company with the issues they responded immediately and were very easy to deal with .    </li>
            <li>The waterpik is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use-</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I bought it from Amazon, which made it very easy to return.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the battery on the toothbrush lasted over a week without having to be charged again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>But now its very easy.</li>

            <li>Very good product, fast deliver.</li>
            <li>It is not replaceable, although some handy people (who know how to solder) are able to replace it.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot tell if this brush is any better than the oralB or the philips sonic</li>
            <li>Got this for husband who had Oral B brand previously-He liked this set up better</li>
            <li>This by far is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>she wasn&#x27;t thrilled because I have now fallen in love with brushing my teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the waterpik and sonic toothbrush, it is nice to have both items in one compact appliance.</li>
            <li>I liked the toothbrush ok, but after I got rid of this thing and bought one from the industry leader</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this system so far.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this system so far.  </li>
            <li>PS- Brushing before the pik seems to be more effective for me as well as filling it after each use</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush I have used so far.</li>
            <li>This produce helps produce a great smile.</li>
            <li>I have to use warm water if I wanna use that part and be able to tolerate it.  </li>

            <li>Great fresh feeling</li>
            <li>Impressed so far.</li>
            <li>My dentist says my gums &amp; teeth look great which means it was worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Great product; worth the money.</li>
            <li>Best price on Amazon by far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use but it took some practice to not get water all over myself and the bathroom!</li>
            <li>This Waterpik does the job and so easily!</li>

            <li>the unit is attractive and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>It is by far a great Waterpik and the toothbrush is every bit as good as sonic is for cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>Love this complete care by Sonic, this is the best dental care system I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it is good work to clean the tooth pitch.</li>

            <li>so my at-home care is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>It feels like I get a great clean and it is incredible simple.</li>
            <li>NOTE the water does run quickly so you may have to fill it twice for a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Excellent choices of water pik heads, that fit better than an older model</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and good quality</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>To brush is ok.</li>
            <li>and we love how it works.</li>
            <li>They should come up with a better solution to this issue.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look so much better since using this waterpik.</li>
            <li>I love have the toothbrush and water flosser together in one unit.</li>
            <li>Am hoping to have better luck with a model that has a pause switch instead of a button.</li>
            <li>I order this from amazon for about 100$ and after just about a week of use im in love.  </li>
            <li>AND LOVE</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure my dentist will be pleased</li>
            <li>and so will my gums :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t know of any comparable sonic toothbrushes to say if it&#x27;s better than the rest - while it&#x27;s still better and quicker than manual brushes.  </li>
            <li>Love it -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The highest setting is very forceful and of great use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend to everyone who would like healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Waterpik&#x27;s ad copy on their website and on Amazon claims that the Sonic is much better than the Philips Sonicare, which is the brand I have used for over a decade in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love the design of the separate, lidded compartments for the water reservoir and one that holds the water-flosser heads and the head of the Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The pause buttons on the Waterpik water flosser and the Sonic electric toothbrush both work much better than those on the Model WP-60W Waterpik and the Sonicare electric</li>
            <li>could not be more satisfied with this product, and I recommend it without reservation.em with the handle of the Sonic.</li>
            <li>I love the design of the separate, lidded compartments for the water reservoir and one that holds the water-flosser heads and the head of the Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The pause buttons on the Waterpik water flosser and the Sonic electric toothbrush both work much better than those on the Model WP-60W Waterpik and the Sonicare electric</li>
            <li>could not be more satisfied with this product, and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Multiple adjustments for water pressure makes it easier to choose the setting that is best for your mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how precise it works with cleaning my mouth.</li>
            <li>I love the built in timer on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 with Diabetes 2 &amp; my dentist recommended investing in a waterpik to keep gums healthy.</li>
            <li>love the built in toothbrush.</li>
            <li>is what I love about this</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush also</li>
            <li>so I thought what better way than to use a Waterpik .</li>
            <li>I find that my gums were not  as  healthy using  the  water pik alone for flossing, so  </li>
            <li>Love having both dental care products together.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>If I would&#x27;ve known better I would have bought just the waterpik without the brush, but</li>
            <li>I love this combo by Waterpick</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>A better deal than buying both separately.  </li>
            <li>There portable one Piks my teeth better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Water Flosser is something coarsely, nut Sonic Toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Tooth brush alone cost more then buying this combo unit.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love my waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I REALLY want to give this five stars as I LOVE the results, teeth feel great</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>The sonic brush works as well or better than my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Purchased another for my son and grand children.</li>
            <li>Deserves way more.</li>
            <li>Fits on my sink better then having separate items to use.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>The pieces snap on with a satisfying click.</li>
            <li>I love the water pik.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to use manufacturer&#x27;s discounts online yet, but have not called about that either.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve always been just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; at brushing their teeth, so they needed to floss more and this thing seems to keep them motivated to do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I love having tooth brush and water flosser all in one.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS WATERPIK AND THE SONIC TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>It makes you want to brush your teeth more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>but I still love this product.</li>
            <li>and we both  love it.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dental hygienist  for a more thorough flossing/cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Still love it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never felt better in my life.</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare before and this is way better.</li>
            <li>Great product cleans mouth fully but gently</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love my Waterpik.</li>
            <li>While I can feel what/where I&#x27;m flossing, I prefer to be able to see my teeth and gums during it--to ensure I don&#x27;t miss anything.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I love that you get a carrying case</li>
            <li>We have really enjoyed our waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61, and many times over the years, my dentist has recommended a &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; as I have some gum recision.  </li>
            <li>so glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>had firmer bristles and felt like it worked better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>Love the 2 levels of power on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Dentist office recommended that I purchase this..  I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Better than Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Vibrates 2x more.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel much better after using.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth better than any electric toothbrush I have owned.</li>
            <li>Love the water pik also.</li>
            <li>Glad I  bought this product with both the pick and brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth  feel better after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>OMG, I am so glad I made this investment.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The various floss options are great!</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this one after reading the reviews, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I am sure it was because of the water pick.</li>
            <li>His dentist even commented about his healthy oral care during his February visit.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>So leaning into the mirror, I aimed the head every so precisely, released the button on the wand...and....WATER PARK IN THE BATHROOM!  </li>
            <li>it helps:)</li>
            <li>I also find the water pic does a much better job than &#x27;convential&#x27; flossing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>it does better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion:  It&#x27;s a great set up that takes up just as much counter space as it looks like in the picture.  </li>
            <li>For those that don&#x27;t floss as often as they should this may be even better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the timer effect on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The SC brush is lightyears better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose the brush as well as the flosser in one unit.</li>

            <li>Outstanding customer service from Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>But was surprisedly pleased by the sonacare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>you first use the flosser, I find that it is best to brush our teeth first.</li>
            <li>sure that the toothbrush is in your mouth before turning it on.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with it and nervous to switch to the Waterpik version.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe what a difference for the better the Waterpik flosser and the sonic toothbrush make.</li>

            <li>Pleased with the product, thank you.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I also love the 2 speeds on the the toothbrush, it makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist office :)</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this package deal.</li>
            <li>It will make you and your dentist better frineds.  </li>
            <li>I just bought it many root canals and bridges later and find that it is the most wonderful painless method of cleaning teeth that prevents and removes tarter.</li>
            <li>A great gift for anyone capable of using the product.</li>
            <li>This is more compact and easier to use.</li>
            <li>The price was the best  I compared it to local stores</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>gets better with prctice)</li>
            <li>I love my waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I love this duo.  </li>
            <li>I love this product when you finish rising you mouth</li>
            <li>My Dentis love this product also</li>
            <li>and I know they will help keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I feel it is more sanitary.</li>
            <li>I love love love mine.</li>
            <li>and I am hoping for a better checkup.</li>
            <li>used this product for 2 months and it saved me 400.00$ at the dentist.the water pick works great and the sonic brush really cleans great.would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It works better.</li>
            <li>and she is able to get it out easier.</li>
            <li>Just the thing for keeping healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>The waterpik has many attachments.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to WaterPic to put a variable speed control on the toothbrush so you can precisely dial-in your own preference.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works well, and my mouth, teeth and gums definately feel better since using the water-pic and sonic toothbrush combination.</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a place for it.</li>
            <li>I love the water pik.  </li>
            <li>AND MORE..</li>
            <li>Love both the toothbrush and the waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I can be anal with dental hygiene and just knowing that I&#x27;m being proactive in my dental care makes me feel a lot more confident that I&#x27;m doing everything I can against tooth decay and gum disease.</li>
            <li>The last dental visit was greatest checkup - no plaque....</li>
            <li>I think there could be a better longer cord design for the water flosser.  </li>
            <li>the famous words of The Doctor... &amp;#34;Water is patient, Adelaide.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is a 2-in-1.</li>
            <li>It beats the flossing with a thread and it is much better for your teeth and gums to brush with this sonic toothbrush vs manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this unit.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is I went from gum disease to healthy gums between dentist visits.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>My hygienists and I love this combination and recommend it to all of our patients.</li>
            <li>I love it and will tell my friends to buy it.</li>

            <li>Love the timer feature on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and love it.  </li>
            <li>The sonic motion of the toothbrush sometimes helps break free congestion in my sinus as I brush and the adjustable rate of the waterpik was nice after periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li>has thanked me more for it than</li>
            <li>, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>I love it and will be getting one for my husband for Christmas.</li>

            <li>Have one, buying two more for my sons.</li>
            <li>she asked if I had gotten gum contouring done :).  </li>
            <li>(Expect to get water all over you and your bathroom until you get the hang of using the waterpik :))</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I checked my local stores before purchasing here, and this was the best price.</li>
            <li>and I love not having to wait for it to charge.</li>
            <li>Love the combo of irrigater and sonic toothbrush in one.</li>
            <li>I went to the dentist and he told me my gums needed to be cared for better and suggested I get a vibrating toothbrush and water pick.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would say this, but I&#x27;m actually enjoying flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this water flosser and sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge longer than most.</li>
            <li>I like the brush design on this more</li>
            <li>I love having the toothbrush and waterpick in one.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with portable,  rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My gums are in much better shape than they were three months ago.  </li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>I know for a fact that Braun is better.</li>
            <li>I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li>And the stains are mostly gone (not even the dentist cleaning was able in one time to get rid of those stains in 2 teeth.</li>

            <li>I love my sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>Having both the tooth brush and water flosser together makes it more compack.</li>
            <li>I love that there are the two things together, the brush and the waterflosser.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare toothbrush is different and would have been perfect with a sanitizer package.</li>
            <li>Love brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li>The battery takes 24 hours or more to fully charg .</li>

            <li>And my family is satisfied too.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist told me my teeth and gums are so much better with use of this flosser and toothbrush.  </li>

            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This replaced my Hydro Floss and I am so pleased with the performance of the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Love the water flosser and sonic toothbrush combo.</li>
            <li>Love it, won&#x27;t ever switch from Waterpik now that I&#x27;ve tried them.</li>
            <li>This device does all and more than described...</li>
            <li>I would rate this product with the highest rating available!</li>
            <li>So much better than flossing.</li>
            <li>It allows me to better control the tarter I am prone to.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me to use a water pic for better gum health.</li>
            <li>For the price, you just can&#x27;t get a better tool for cleaner, healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>Waterpik makes models with more bells and whistles, but this model contains everything you need in a water flosser.</li>
            <li>I like doing things by hand more.</li>
            <li>hand floss is better.</li>
            <li>I love my Waterpik (plus</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Wife and kids love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t the tubing that attaches the waterpik to the unit be more flexible and/or stretchy?</li>
            <li>ab bit more care  almost 6 months ago&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it because it can reach my wisdom</li>
            <li>i would love if they offer the attachments&#x27; replacements on stores where they sell there water flosser like walmart n target  </li>
            <li>I am now in the habit of better care of teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Better to use in in pj&#x27;s then get dressed, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better than the rotating brush generation of  tooth brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We loved the Waterpik, it cleaned great, however it only lasted 2 months.  </li>
            <li>More junk from China.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;very safe delivery</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and def recommend for daily dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I love the mechanics of this product...</li>
            <li>AND IT FEELS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT</li>
            <li>Really love the toothbrush, but the waterpik side broke just after the return date expired.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>my gums do for sure.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>We have not gotten used to the toothbrush and still use manual brushes :)</li>
            <li>l was able to return through Amazon and get a refund.</li>
            <li>love this product, i received 2 by mistake</li>
            <li>so we both love the way our teeth and mouth feel after we finish</li>
            <li>I always was a flosser, but have been pleased to find that Waterpik gets rid of particles which even flossing and brushing don&#x27;t seem to remove.  </li>
            <li>I love the value with this 2-in-1 solution.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the cord (thus the four stars instead of 5)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THS THING</li>
            <li>Overall this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Last checkup went great!</li>
            <li>Better than the one the Dentist asked me to buy.</li>
            <li>She was completely pleased with both the brush and the flossing attachment.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>all is ok.</li>
            <li>I have had this appliance for some time now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Love using it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it if you are looking for something to maintain your oral health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a much better brusher and water flosser than I ever was a thread flosser.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>I am sure.  </li>
            <li>would buy another love it</li>
            <li>I love it because it cleanses my gums as well.</li>
            <li>With the water flosser it takes care of both those problems plus I find it to be rather refreshing.</li>
            <li>do wish the toothbrush heads were made of a more &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my teeth feels.  </li>
            <li>I checked electricity and from my side every thing is  ok</li>
            <li>Before I bought this I had an electric toothbrush (LOVE) and a separate Waterpik (Love).  </li>
            <li>Highly satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>Love this waterpik because it has both water flosser and sonic brush in one unit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to report that it does, and now I&#x27;m going to use it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I just love it and also my wife:-)</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>and we love.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it , meets all expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this set.  </li>
            <li>With the proper  attachments this is the best dental product!</li>
            <li>I brush &amp; floss more now than ever.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love the carry case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can also see where the sonic toothbrush will be gentler on the teeth while offering a better cleaning over manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to have the jet tip in your mouth and be over a sink when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because eventually you will be needing to replace many parts, I still would have bought it</li>
            <li>I love it for cleaning around my gumline.</li>
            <li>I love the pick.can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I Love this</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>awesome..it really does a great job on my teeth..</li>
            <li>I have so many dental implants, and it helps a lot clenning all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much of a difference a water flosser and good electric toothbrush can make.</li>
            <li>if you have more than one person using it you must buy additional brushes and tips.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and are now used as well will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li>the more you the easier it is to use.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy!</li>
            <li>Man, you better buy it.</li>
            <li>did find the replacement brushes are better though.  </li>
            <li>I literally drive to work in the morning running my tongue over my teeth marveling in how amazingly smooth and polished they feel!</li>
            <li>I love the electric toothbrush, along with the water pik.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WATERPIC</li>
            <li>is even better.</li>
            <li>Love it don&#x27;t know how I lived</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself also seems more sturdy than the SoniCare -</li>
            <li>I got much better force with my sink-attaching one.</li>
            <li>I had many implants done and flossing was not getting food particles out until I used this pik.</li>
            <li>I felt like it was doing an OK job but</li>
            <li>I love the Sonic tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>and it feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great investment, I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>It more than serves the purpose for both of us.</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel after I use the water flosser, I have tried almost all the attachments.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this for maintaining healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love it and enjoying it</li>
            <li>My son and daughter love it.</li>
            <li>Also, the water flosser is the most ingenious hygienic invention ever.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Just wish toothbrush has more accessories.  </li>
            <li>My dentist suggested it and just love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoying this now I am looking for a travel version wit h110 and 220 electrical options</li>
            <li>Works better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>but other wise this is a great deal if you are looking to get a water pix, why not get an amazing toothbrush with it.</li>
            <li>and it is performing beautifully, couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>but now he always wants to use mine because its better!!  </li>
            <li>Also, the LEDs on the toothbrush are very handy to determine how much charge is remaining on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very nice experience, to protect my teeth very well</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has two settings and the higher setting really does an awesome job - the most thorough brushing job I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li>The sonic toothbrush and charger built makes this system handy and user friendly.</li>
            <li>I returned this, because it doesn&#x27;t have some of the features I liked about the original.  </li>
            <li>When I needed to replace my Waterpik, I was excited to see this cost effective combination.  </li>
            <li>nice unit,feels dentist clean, ever time.</li>
            <li>Very effective for maintaining clean teeth and fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Great product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The high speed does a great job of  massaging the gums.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and great value for the flosser as well as the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great high powered cleaning of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love using it to clean the sink!</li>
            <li>I feel very clean after I finish using it every morning.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets your teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a portable flosser and toothbrush to use in our RV, but after 10 days my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel very clean.</li>
            <li>This thing gets so much stuff out of my mouth, even after brushing, its amazing!</li>
            <li>Also great for cleaning teeth after eating food that gets stuck between teeth, where you would normally use a toothpick.</li>
            <li>Loved this when we first received it.  </li>
            <li>Best purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good return on investment.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Best investment we have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I loved it when I first got it, but it has two speeds and the fastest one has quit working.</li>
            <li>As the other reviews emphasize, the functionality of this device is just awesome -- the water flosser works great and reliably, the toothbrush and accompanying attachments are top notch, and the battery life is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they had included two full size tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>No bad breath and my Hygienic gave me an amazing A+ on my cleaning.</li>
            <li>Best purchase i have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I loved it for the first week</li>
            <li>Bought this the end of Nov 2014 and loved it at first.</li>
            <li>Its a useful!!</li>
            <li>Had no idea that the new ones were so well made, attractive and,</li>
            <li>The sonic toothbrush seems to be doing a great job as well, certainly better than my old mechanically-rotating electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how easy it will clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve been able to share the unit easily by swapping out attachments.</li>
            <li>I am taking much better care of my teeth because this is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it, so easy to keep your mouth hygiene.  </li>
            <li>This waterpik is easy to use and my gums and teeth are enjoying the experience.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, compact on my counter, use warm water for comfort.  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to trying the brush, but honestly, the flosser alone, is enough to win me</li>
            <li>Almost comical &amp; once I got the hang of it, I actually enjoy flossing more &amp; find myself flossing</li>
            <li>Overall a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>, the spread out bristles do a much better job of getting along the gum line, the sonicare did a really good job on what it reached, but wasn&#x27;t very flexible to get between teeth.  </li>
            <li>This flosser works great, but I must say that this is very rickety and cheap.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I bought 4 more for my children.</li>
            <li>The sonic toothbrush is great as well - very quiet but effective.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to others who want overall good health, which always starts with good oral health.</li>
            <li>You can get to places you can&#x27;t with a normal toothbrush and very effectively, and in 99% of cases, it can even replace flossing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fits perfectly on the limited space I have on my sink.</li>
            <li>, you can really maintain the level of &#x27;clean&#x27; that you experience right after a cleaning, between cleanings - my dentist tells me it&#x27;s the greatest improvement between visits that they have ever</li>
            <li>I am so happy that my old WaterPik bit the dust!</li>
            <li>I feel my tooth becoming more strong..</li>
            <li>all is working fine once more</li>
            <li>The brush of the Sonic toothbrush is smaller than the Sonicare, and the feel of the brush, including its size, shape and the vibration of its movement, is exponentially more pleasant and effective to use than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>

            <li>my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel dentist clean after each use!</li>
            <li>The most impressive outcome is that a return visit to the dentist this summer showed that my gum overall health has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Tooth brush is better then the other one I had and the water pick is awesome.</li>
            <li>Amazing results after the first use!</li>
            <li>I t feels  so clean, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Really cleans my teeth after brushing it continues to clean my teeth and is great for my gums  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job of making your teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The wireless charging of the toothbrush is Very cool.  </li>
            <li>The low speed is for the gums and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li>Overall very good quality and design, BUT,,,  Would have given it five stars if they offered a travel charger - talked to CS and they don&#x27;t have a solution.  </li>
            <li>So according to my new experience, I really liked the way water clean my teeth, and I loved the brush.</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>It is great to have both in one unit as to not have the whole area full of wires.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>For years I was able to find a reason not to floss, but now I enjoy flossing with the waterpik WP-900.  </li>
            <li>Great so far.  </li>
            <li>You can adjust the flow, so finding the pressure most comfortable for</li>
            <li>It works great so far.  </li>
            <li>BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY</li>
            <li>The brush that came with it seems to do a better job than my cheap OralB.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has great battery life, is very sturdy and quality, and has cool features like the 30-second buzz that divides up your brushing time.</li>
            <li>We do get complete care with this Waterpik device at an attractive price.  </li>
            <li>Best money i have every spent on my mouth</li>
            <li>This thing is actually kind of fun though, flossing with the water instead of flossing with a slimy, stinky piece of string.  </li>
            <li>It works great, makes your teeth feel like you have had a professional cleaning and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The water pick has a good strong stream and you can really feel it getting in all the crevices and spaces.</li>
            <li>While some reviewers said the high was too high, I found it to be perfect-</li>
            <li>So far, a very effective waterpik.</li>
            <li>more fun than flossing!</li>
            <li>I have never owned an electric toothbrush or a waterpik, so this is my first unit, but I love it!  </li>
            <li>AND this is my first sonic toothbrush and love it as well!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this waterpik!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I floss and brush and think my teeth are clean, but then I use the Waterpik and still more food particles are flushed out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This was easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>The pieces are easy to put onto the pic-head and to remove.</li>
            <li>easily recommend this item to anyone.</li>

            <li>So based on good reviews and a decent price for this set I went ahead and purchased it, so let me go ahead and give some impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>watter pic not too strong but the toothbrush</li>
            <li>it plenty strong and has a conveint storage for its tips.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, for those wondering how strong it is, that helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully, for those wondering how strong it is, that helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The floss pik isnt as strong as i would like it to be</li>
            <li>My hygienist suggested quite a while ago that I get a Waterpik, since flossing wasn&#x27;t my strong suit.</li>
            <li>On speed two, the vibrations of the handle are so strong that once i even got a nerve twitch in my cheek where the toothbrush touched (god knows what it was</li>
            <li>This one is just as good as the older model</li>
            <li>Strong motor on the toothbrush, which was my biggest worry.</li>
            <li>But be warned it is strong.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik is great – cleans my teeth like no other brush I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Fantastic clean!  </li>
            <li>I have many caps with some margins that need special attention.  </li>
            <li>The flosser also includes a special attachment for those who have dental bridges, so I can use the unit confidently.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is good on normal setting, the strong setting makes you feel your filings will come out :</li>
            <li>I love my waterpik flosser and sonic brush, my teeth feel very clean and fresh when I am done using it.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised; is much more efficient, effective and enjoyable than the old school methods of dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>The hot button stop on the pik is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the first really nice sonic toothbrush and flosser  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I use it on full speed.</li>
            <li>I use the warm warter flossing first and it removes all particulate matter from the smallest crevices and gums; then I use the brush whicht finishes the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can use Listerine in the flosser, but I wish the power could go higher.</li>
            <li>And the toothbrush is pretty nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note to buyers:  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with the water tank, it tends to run out either right at a good time (when I&#x27;m done flossing) or right before I finish.</li>
            <li>Amazing machine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this machine and my teeth feels so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Have 3-unit bridge that is kept clean by brushings, but most importantly, the water flosser.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick and cleans better than&lt;br /&gt;a tooth brush and floss.</li>
            <li>It keeps my tooth smooth and clean, and Flosser cleans my gum healthy.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for easier and more effective dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>My hygienist recommended I purchase a waterpik (specifically this brand) and when I discovered the new flosser and sonic toothbrush combination, I was delighted.  </li>
            <li>Never had a water flosser before and I needed a new electronic toothbrush so this ended up being a good buy for me.</li>
            <li>The product works fine and we would not hestitate buying one again.</li>
            <li>However this product as been great, I have even notice how much more my gums are because they are so extra clean from using the water pik.</li>
            <li>The sizr is fine.</li>
            <li>What I like best is the all in one feature and small footprint on my counter top</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>The best part of it less space an just one plug.  </li>
            <li>We use a cup to fill it now and they works fine.</li>
            <li>Items I rated were all fine..</li>
            <li>I use one cap of Advanced Care Listerine &amp; the rest water in the reservoir (Which detaches for easy</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>and because I wasn&#x27;t in the US, I was not eligible for an exchange or repair, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It is working just fine</li>
            <li>Every component works fine.</li>
            <li>Have used it a month or so and everything is fine.</li>
            <li>The waterpik works just fine.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is fine.</li>
            <li>Waterpik wirks fine.</li>
            <li>We bought this after a suggestion from our dentist when we disclosed our less than perfect flossing habits (non habits).</li>
            <li>I also love the sonic toothbrush, that came with it, 2 minutes go by quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean, gums are healthy and breath is fresh!</li>
            <li>I am in absolute love!</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush, as now my teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, and adjusting well to the &amp;#34;power washer&amp;#34; which wife uses to keep the pockets clean.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, comes with everything you need (two different sized brush heads, five closer heads) and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>This thing works great, is easy to operate and is quiet.</li>
            <li>The water pic works great with various levels of pressure, easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My teeth showed a huge difference after a week of use.</li>
            <li>The price of the replacement brush heads for the Sonic are about 1/4 the cost of the replacement heads for my Sonicare--which is a huge savings over the life of an electric</li>
            <li>The price of the replacement brush heads for the Sonic are about 1/4 the cost of the replacement heads for my Sonicare--which is a huge savings over the life of an electric</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for people who have braces, dentures, implants, porcelain teeth and need to use a waterpik to avoid hurting their gums, as well as a soft tooth brush to avoid damaging any type of sensitive dental work.</li>
            <li>i was expecting some huge monster</li>
            <li>I enjoy &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;The whole water pressure technique is just amazing.</li>
            <li>I JUST WISH that replacement toothbrush heads were available in brick and mortar stores or that they were available with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>And the water flosser makes a huge difference that you can see which in one use.</li>
            <li>The brush is great pausing every 30 seconds to let you know to change quadrants, but you have to pay attention because its a very brief pause.</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>he liked it so much, he considered buying one, but instead i ordered him one as a gift.  </li>
            <li>Its really nice to have waterpik and toothbrush in one unit, but there is no place to store the tooth brushes and the whole setup of heads and brushes in the unit.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought my husband one too.</li>
            <li>My Teeth Feel Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Messy, but it is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy having the toothbrush and water pick in one unit.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great product</li>
            <li>Great product, especially the dual speed brush!</li>
            <li>I really only use the waterpik because its great at cleaning between braces.  </li>
            <li>The flosser I feel could be a bit more powerful</li>
            <li>and it took some time to find a setting that I was comfortable cleaning</li>
            <li>It is important to brush with correct techniques to ensure you take care of both sides of your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use it daily with great esults.</li>
            <li>This product is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Having an electric brush with a second head coming with the flosser makes it a great bundle.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s enjoy as.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive but I have three concerns that equaled only four stars.</li>
            <li>The unit is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend that you don&#x27;t use your bathroom outlet if connect to your light</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be charging once the light is off.  </li>
            <li>Great Valentine&#x27;s present for my honey!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for a few years and it worked great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that it has different levels of water pressure.</li>
            <li>just want to add that now that I&#x27;ve had this a while, I find it almost indispensable.</li>
            <li>The water flosser is fantastic, I have braces</li>
            <li>Thoroughly enjoy the product.  </li>
            <li>Everything is easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>the downside the plastic construction seems a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li>Thoughtful design.</li>
            <li>I would say buy the water pik part, its great, but get the sonic toothbrush through philips or a different company.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine someone wanting something more powerful than this</li>
            <li>waterpik is great; it got stuff out from between my teeth even after I used regular floss picks.  </li>
            <li>I find that the waterpik is much nicer with warm water and you have to practically put your head in the sink.</li>
            <li>Admittedly that gives it a slightly cheap feel.</li>
            <li>I would have contacted the seller and tried having this issue address, but the option isn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;IT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE MUCH MORE USEFUL</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, it feels like you just left the dentists office each time you use it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the toothbrush and waterpik combination.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush beats the competition, both quality and value, so the Waterpik is....like free.</li>
            <li>Cheap on Amazon too.</li>
            <li>As an RN, I find it really easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>I can vary the pressure of the water to easily remove food and clean my gums and mouth.</li>
            <li>We both have gum issues and this is just a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>the site that I was told to use by customer service never figured out how to give me the free item, so I decided to just order what I wanted from someone else at a lower price anyway.</li>
            <li>this thing is fantastic, +</li>
            <li>I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office and had a great teeth cleaning everytime</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it</li>
            <li>Love it mouth fills so fresh</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient, clean , easy and nice use.  </li>
            <li>But overall i am happy that I brought this.</li>
            <li>The various attachments are great- there is something for every need.</li>
            <li>There is a great compartment to hold the extra waterpik and toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>It just does not hold the handle in place securely and if you move the unit it falls out .</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to get this unit, with the addition of the toothbrush feature, in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterpik: The waterpik flosser is fantastic.</li>
            <li>tongue cleaning attachment (not included) would have been more useful than some of the attachments that were included.</li>
            <li>The cradle for the handle is just a cheap tapered piece of plastic to cup around the body of the waterpik.</li>
            <li>The feel so smooth and whiter.  </li>
            <li>The waterpik has several settings of pressure, which is great for cleaning different areas of your mouth and seems to do a great job at removing built-up plaque.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I invested in this economical and neat gadget.</li>
            <li>available pieces.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth,</li>
            <li>Everything on this feels cheap and  not at all sturdy.</li>
            <li>Start off at light and work your way up.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the pressure to a level comfortable to you and with a variety of heads</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference between this waterpik flosser and the waterpik</li>
            <li>; I was glad that she said that because it proves to me that this flosser and toothbrush are doing what they claimed to do.</li>
            <li>Combined with the sonic toothbrush, the unit does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>I think the idea is great (having the tooth brush AND the water dispenser in the same unit)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap trash.</li>
            <li>I used the water pic brush and it didn&#x27;t quite make my teeth feel smooth again.</li>
            <li>However I also feel it does a fantastic job and in my opinion, beats out Sonicare in the tooth cleaning</li>
            <li>sound:</li>
            <li>Downsides: loud, requires user dexterity to not blast self in eye, and definitely not the most impressive thing to talk about with women, but neither is gingivitis.</li>
            <li>Recently had a bridge installed so flossing is out and the waterpik is a great option.</li>
            <li>The company replaced it Hassle free.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how much food the waterpik removes, even after flossing.</li>
            <li>The value is great, I would definitely buy this set again.</li>
            <li>This thing is great, and a much smaller footprint on the counter than two separate dental tools.</li>
            <li>It provides great dental care and leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist office</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the water pik though.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after using the Ultra Flosser and warm water.</li>
            <li>Fantastic unit.</li>
            <li>Overall this was definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>My children have more fun using this</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>There are cheap plastic components, but the product works, and works damned well.  </li>
            <li>Individually, the water flosser and the sonic toothbrush are both great products.</li>
            <li>The difference is the Waterpik is much more powerful than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>did have an incident with a missing piece in my box and contacted Amazon and, as always, they are awesome to deal with.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased 2 1 in Il. &amp; 1 in Fl.</li>
            <li>I went to the web site and filled out their contact form.</li>
            <li>I have had a waterpik for several years but the toothbrush is great</li>
            <li>A great product, I just hope it continues to work for several years.</li>
            <li>I gave the regular one to my son and he says its great.</li>
            <li>but it was a cheap one.</li>
            <li>Fantastic value.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel like my dentist will be happy when she sees me next visit.</li>
            <li>one get one free coupons for replacement parts.</li>
            <li>whe the wate Pik tip is inserted,  it still rotates freely.  </li>
            <li>and is great for daily dental care.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself if fantastic and automatically turns off after about 2.5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have only been using it for a week but every time I use it my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>works fantastic....</li>
            <li>Bought this about 2 months ago, after about a month the charger light indicator stopped working.</li>
            <li>So fantastic 2 months use and now throw it away.</li>
            <li>You have never truly experienced life until you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I wish there were denser brush heads available.</li>
            <li>works great when used daily.</li>
            <li>The kids even enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much food the water pik removes.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>But so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The result is so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, all is good.  </li>
            <li>So far So good</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Well, maybe your dentist won&#x27;t like you better because he or she won&#x27;t have as much work to do in your mouth, but the hygenist will love you for it.</li>
            <li>Works like it should, so far so good</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I have been using this machine for 4 days now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Now my toothbrush tells me when to change quadrants, flossing is no longer a pain (and kind of fun) and my mouth feels super clean every day.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and he said WOW good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my Waterpik Complete for about a year and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>havent been able to use it much but its better than a trip to the dentest.add to it</li>
            <li>The ability to finely adjust pressure, as well as the different tip options, are also very nice, and I find the water tank has plenty of capacity.</li>
            <li>When I was shopping for a new electric toothbrush, I settled on this Water Pic model, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It pulses every 30 seconds for two minutes to make sure you brush your teeth for the right about of time, 30 seconds for each quadrant.</li>
            <li>Just the right size &amp; I love the all in one.</li>
            <li>Tooth brush more powerful than my original waterpik brush.  </li>
            <li>THANKS,  WATERPIK!!!  </li>

            <li>The waterpik is very powerful with a range of settings and attachments&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I noticed this Waterpik combo while browsing on Amazon and made a (very rare) impulse buy</li>
            <li>I have also used the plaque seeker tip and found it to be very useful around the gum</li>
            <li>I have also used the plaque seeker tip and found it to be very useful around the gum</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist was very complimentary when she checked my gums.  </li>
            <li>Me and my wife love it, is nice, practical, does the service is intended for, I have used electric toothbrushes in the past but this system is by far the best one I got.</li>
            <li>The adjustable jet of water can be very powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The cost of replacement brushes is very economical compared to the competition.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush it&#x27;s very powerful and the timer helps you to use it the enought time.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brush is very powerful, the replacement heads are affordable, and this unit comes with two of them already.</li>
            <li>It works great, however, it would be nice to have a speed that is between the low and extremely high.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush design makes it easy to clean although you still have to clean the charger area</li>
            <li>Although water flossing is great and feels really clean you should still floss regularly as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and has made a HUGE difference this time on the appearance of his teeth and the tartar build up.</li>
            <li>The water pik is so smooth and the tooth brush makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Between the sonic brush and the water pic, my teeth stay smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The water container is super easy to refill because it lifts out of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water container is super easy to refill because it lifts out of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this is easy to use and quick</li>
            <li>super easy with this Waterpik.</li>
            <li>The older one was more ergonomic and therefore worked better and easier to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>but this makes flossing super easy.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect little waterpik station!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update if my joy turns south, but I think this will go down as one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly if you have any kind of gum problem.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Water Pik Toothbrush/Water Flosser on June 6, 2014, from Drugstore.com, and was enjoying the use of it very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a dentist fresh clean every time I use this tooth brush and water pick!</li>
            <li>Now I have one that provides just as powerful a clean and a waterpik.  Score!</li>
            <li>So fresh and so Clean!</li>
            <li>From my standpoint, you can foget the special offer of getting a free accessory is you purchase two . . .</li>
            <li>Product works great and according to my dentist, my gums are healthier, I have less plaque and teeth are looking better.</li>
            <li>Although this product may seem a little bulky for some bathrooms it is completely awesome and really makes your mouth feel more clean then</li>
            <li>I bought a lot of things this past year but without a shadow of a doubt, this was my best purchase of 2014.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic and simple way to floss your teeth without using floss and more effective too.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days my gingivitis improved significantly.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Kid&#x27;s tooth cleaning has improved significantly and so has the willingness to brush and floss twice per day.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>WITHOUT the toothbrush is in my local grocery store for $59.99 and the toothbrush on its own will run $89.99 so don&#x27;t pass this deal up!</li>
            <li>what a powerful toothbrush and the water flossing is bomb! ....</li>
            <li>After many years of manual brushing, I took the chance on one of those rotary pulsating brushes, Oral B to B exact.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Supper excited to get it</li>
            <li>Why would the most used part of the system be the first to break?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, this unit is just as good as the Waterpik unit my mother had from the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Waterpik puts out a great product, makes me wonder why we took so long to buy one.</li>
            <li>quick and fine</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference from using this product.</li>
            <li>I originally got this thinking</li>
            <li>Some people might find it to be too powerful, but I like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m genuinely excited to brush and floss... like a weirdo...</li>
            <li>The water pick was also an interesting experience the first time...</li>
            <li>the flosser is not hard to do, it just takes some practice to learn your own method.  </li>
            <li>the waterpik is pretty neat it will clean your mouth better then any swishing will, but it doesnt replace flossing or anything.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>This setup works great, I wish the water bowl would hold a little more.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, my  dental problems have been  minimal, I  kept all my own teeth, and , for a 66 year old , that is stellar.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot, however the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work like it did when it was new.</li>

            <li>I found that a setting of 9 was needed to really clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve mastered it, your teeth will feel dentist clean every time you use the flosser.  </li>
            <li>the sonic toothbrush &amp; my mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Just ordered for the Waterpik to replace  old one, but really impressed with tooth-brush, especially high-speed setting.</li>
            <li>I decided on the complete care system and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>High is very strong .</li>
            <li>I think it is more effective at removing particles, while at the same time being more gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Used it and afterwards my teeth felt clean not as good as dentist clean but clean enough that I feel my dental situation will improve.</li>
            <li>the high-speed on the toothbrush is WAY too strong; it will vibrate your teeth right out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>specially the toothbrush it comes with.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for anyone, specially those who have braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decide to try this waterpick tooth brush as the price was much better then the oral b smart scenes.  </li>
            <li>my teeth really feel clean and healthy...</li>
            <li>but overall you get a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The water flosser takes a little to get used to, but works great, I like putting some mouthwash in the water, it cleans better and keeps the water fresh.  </li>
            <li>I admit I rarely return things, but I will hesitate to buy anything through Amazon again if it costs more than I am willing to throw away.</li>
            <li>The Waterpark complete care is amazing.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is pretty good, its brush is almost to soft though</li>
            <li>Works great, just as expected.</li>
            <li>You may have a splatter control problem for the first few flosses :D</li>
            <li>Set up and clean up is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>You WILL give your bathroom a shower the first few times using it, but the product does a WONDERFUL job.</li>
            <li>toothbrush comes with 2 heads, and runs on a timer to help get the full 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>Works well, wish it had 2 full power brush heads though.</li>
            <li>Have gotten so many compliments on how much whiter my teeth are.</li>
            <li>so much I am brushing and flossing a lot more....</li>
            <li>Everything works great only thing to make it perfect is the battery for the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>SO...I had extra money in my FSA, and I figured this was as good a time as any to get braces...</li>
            <li>Brushing and flossing turned into the most cumbersome tasks, so I started shopping for a reasonably priced electric toothbrush and water flosser</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit arrived at my doorstep today, and although I am letting the toothbrush charge the full 24 hours, I couldn&#x27;t help but try the water flosser.</li>
            <li>I had to fill the tank twice, but I&#x27;m sure that is because I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect  </li>
            <li>but the design is cool.</li>
            <li>I really think my teeth look and feel much better since I bought this.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about the WaterPik WP 900.</li>
            <li>I am nothing but satisfied with this whole purchase.</li>
            <li>The timer settings makes sure I am very thorough with each quadrant of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I like that much speed because I feel like I am getting a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>Tested the pressure on my hand, nice a soft.</li>
            <li>Mine took overnight to reach full status with three lights on it.  </li>
            <li>The brush is cool too.</li>
            <li>It should be used in addition to good dental care to save you from tooth problems that may occur later along with unwanted dental bills that are never cheep.</li>
            <li>I love the pik/tooth brush combo, it really does save room.</li>
            <li>not it sounds like a jackhammer, with water on full blast</li>
            <li>I really like the Waterpik ; it has everything I wanted, flosser, sonic toothbrush and more.</li>
            <li>My husband wanted one too, we love it so much.</li>
            <li>Love it, absolute cleanest mouth feeling.  </li>
            <li>After paying way too much money to my dentist, I decided to become more proactive.  </li>
            <li>I had to hunt for a good price on replacement heads and then the price went up the next time I ordered.  </li>
            <li>However, the Sonic Toothbrush is no where near as nice as the Phillips Sonicare brush I replaced with this unit.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I brush and floss, this thing can always find more to root out of the gaps between my teeth and gums, and my dentist says that my oral hygiene has improved a lot since I started using this.  </li>
            <li>Use the low and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>my mouth feels super clean after using this.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fresh feeling it leaves.  </li>
            <li>Love it and it works very well</li>
            <li>makes my mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>but overall good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>And shipping is so fast that I satisfied.</li>
            <li>Loving this care set so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping the dentist will be able to tell me how much of a difference she sees</li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t say enough of how good this product is.</li>
            <li>The price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>Love it having both is very convenient</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean after using the brush and water floss function.</li>
            <li>HAVE REALLY GOTTEN MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is not holding a full charge anymore</li>
            <li>The dentist good see an improvement in his oral health after only 1 week.</li>
            <li>Very simple to operate and does a good job for which it was designed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the unit.teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Now my wife wants to use it. :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The many heads of the floss really motivates me to try each one.  </li>
            <li>-10 are nice to customize for those with sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On 4-5, it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, going to the dentist has gotten a lot more pleasant since using this little gadget.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful but the toothbrush just vibrates and doesn&#x27;t really move, like circular motion or up and down.  </li>
            <li>if you want a powerful water pik along with a very powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li>If the Waterpik worked, I&#x27;d be happy, even with the less comfortable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>excellent device, much improved over previous models.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is nothing more than a cheap very loud electric brush.</li>
            <li>I put it in my mouth, rotated the head so it was comfortable, and turned it on, almost right away</li>
            <li>My theory was to kick things up a bit and make sure my gums also were as healthy and clean as possible before I had surgery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first one, and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>Other than those two preferences, the brush and pic work great</li>
            <li>ALWAYS FEELS FRESH CLEAN.</li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels to clean and fresh after each use.  </li>
            <li>I put a splash of Listerine in the water tank and get a really clean, fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my mouth so fresh and so clean with almost no effort...</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, rinsed feeling.</li>
            <li>Give you a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth fresh and clean</li>
            <li>it makes your mouth feel clean &amp; fresh.  </li>
            <li>Say their mouths have never felt so fresh and teeth so clean.</li>
            <li>It does run out of water quickly.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik used with a mild solution of mouthwash or, in my case, diluted peroxide, has saved my teeth.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve seen some reviews have mentioned that the reservoir runs out too quickly.</li>
            <li>the spray is a super addition.</li>
            <li>Your gum health will drastically improve, and quickly.</li>
            <li>Compared to dentures or partial plates,  I am thinking $80 is getting off kind of cheap!    </li>
            <li>However, I knew I needed to do something quickly to help my gums and teeth to be stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth seem super fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and was just what it said it would be.</li>
            <li>Much better than older Waterpik models.  </li>
            <li>Quick service in shipping and would buy from that vendor anytime.</li>
            <li>i went from one of those devices that sprays out a quick burst of air/water, but switching to this waterpik</li>
            <li>it is better than the older model of water pik.</li>
            <li>although I give Waterpik 4 stars (didn&#x27;t like that my unit was faulty), it&#x27;s zero stars for Waterpik&#x27;s customer service, and 5 stars for Amazon&#x27;s quick resolve of my issue.</li>
            <li>I would suggest starting with the setting in 1 and working your way up to what pressure is comfortable for you, I have found that 4 is a nice pressure for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges quickly .  </li>
            <li>The brush is kind of big and the travel case is huge,  </li>
            <li>After using as instructed twice a day for three months with regular flossing and seeing my dentist for a follow up visit, I can say that the report came back excellent.  </li>
            <li>We love that a tooth brush came with this one for slightly more than the one we ordered last year without the brush.  </li>
            <li>As a recent recipient of an All on Four permanent denture the dentist recommended one of these, and at the cost of the teeth I&#x27;ll darn likely take care of them this time as best</li>
            <li>Powerful and gets them looking clean really quick.</li>
            <li>It is super at cleaning between the teeth; makes floss seem a primitive device.</li>
            <li>The battery died super quick and when I tried to change the batteries.</li>
            <li>The waterpik has more tips than I think I&#x27;ll ever use, but I absolutely love it, and I actually consider it</li>
            <li>It does a super job of cleaning the teeth and gum areas.  </li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t take up nearly as much counter space as I thought it would - very compact and everything fits all together nicely.</li>
            <li>The reservoir does go through the water quickly.</li>
            <li>It is more compact than expected and fits nicely on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and you will clearly see that it gets food out</li>
            <li>This was a great black Friday special purchase .</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I find the brushing at high mode more soothing than my Sonicare- almost like massing my gums.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  :)</li>
            <li>Be sure to click the toothbrush button twice to put it in &#x27;high&#x27; mode</li>
            <li>with a lower pressure and then work up go ahead and aim it at an angle right into the gum line because this gentle massage will keep the blood flowing and keep it healthy so you will never ever have gingivitis.</li>
            <li>The fact that it comes with an electric toothbrush makes it even more of a good buy, and it&#x27;s the same kind of toothbrush that I previously bought for $110; this one lets you know when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants of my teeth.</li>
            <li>You r teeth feel so clean right after you brush and floss.</li>
            <li>..is just the right product to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>There was at most 1/10th of what I would normally find.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, because it&#x27;s more than just the normal Waterpik flosser.  </li>
            <li>The waterpik works great but the toothbrush is not worth it.</li>
            <li>Dentist was very pleased at last check up.</li>
            <li>This results in a sound that ran my cat out of the bathroom the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Much easier than dental floss and much more effective in overall cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li>in all a good product for as long as it lasts and the cost associated with a healthier oral life</li>
            <li>The cord is long which is good for my bathroom since</li>
            <li>I was not gifted with naturally perfect snow white teeth, but they are healthy, clean and polished.  </li>
            <li>The brush works really well to get my teeth feeling clean and smooth though</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel extremely clean and refreshed, actually better than a professional cleaning..  </li>
            <li>The flossing action is superior to the older models.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my teeth and entire mouth feels clean, clean, clean.</li>
            <li>it better than most other electric toothbrushes -- which sometimes sound like you are sticking a helicopter inside your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Love my new toothbrush and water pik.  </li>
            <li>This new device is even better and easier to use.</li>
            <li>Love this thing, can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
            <li>I have teeth very close together and flossing with string was not working and taking me a long time without great results.</li>
            <li>I had to buy another Waterpik to get a good powerful toothbrush with 2 speeds and a long battery life.</li>
            <li>It is possible, but the way that the teeth are cleaned is so good, I am willing to put up with it.  </li>
            <li>It is possible, but the way that the teeth are cleaned is so good, I am willing to put up with it.  </li>
            <li>overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Waterpick is super powerful (will spray across the room).</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really cleans your teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li>very efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I got a pretty good report at the dentist after using this for several months.  </li>
            <li>This unit is well made, easy to use, takes up little counter space, has good power on the flosser.</li>
            <li>It has what I wanted in a single package at a good price.</li>
            <li>I had a recent bridge placed, and this method is much better than using floss under it!</li>
            <li>Ladies, tie your hair at first or you will be soaked!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not small, so make sure you have space on your sink counter.</li>
            <li>I love this complete gum cleaning machine!</li>
            <li>No cavities for the first time in 10 years!</li>
            <li>My new dentist also was surprised by how good the accompanying sonic tooth brush performed.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing, works better than the previous two waterpik&#x27;s I have had.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective the toothbrush was going to be because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I used it and it&#x27;s easy to use and does a good job taking all the excess waste from your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old and oral hygiene is very important to me and I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Clean, easy to set up, easy to use, all around terrific buy.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, complete clean after meals.</li>
            <li>better than just a sonic care, battery last a full week or more brushing twice daily, space saving, love the water pick.</li>
            <li>thank you for creating this, though you could use a little more pressure that&#x27;s probably the only problem ( the sonic toothbrush also does very good. )</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t necessarily anything phenomenal, granted is does its job just fine.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that many bathroom outlets on older homes are switched so the unit wont charge.</li>
            <li>but I have had a very easy time with it thus far, aside from the first time I turned it on and realized it should already be in your mouth when you hit on.</li>
            <li>It has everything I want in an electric toothbrush and water flosser in a nice small footprint that fits easily on my counter and is easy to store when company is coming over</li>
            <li>Nice having both things combined but the toothbrush I think could be a little more aggressive.</li>
            <li>Amazing tiny pressure washer for your mouth.</li>
            <li>Customer Service was absolutely great, and they replaced both parts within a few days with the 2-year warranty.</li>
            <li>Really like it - fantastic having 2 products in.  </li>
            <li>The water flosser is very stronger and smooth level to adjust for the pressure.</li>
            <li>is that it is a bit loud, a bit more than most electric toothbrushes (the flosser part is loud)</li>
            <li>The waterpik itself is sooooooo(I can&#x27;t add enough o&#x27;s) amazing.</li>
            <li>I didnt know waterpik was so powerful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember seeing this in the instructions, but it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li>it is well worth it</li>
            <li>Any time it includes a built in timer is a nice feature but short of that</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don&#x27;t replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won&#x27;t stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love and and actually look forward to using it because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li>Hmmmm ... why don&#x27;t I have a warm and cozy feeling about that? :-)  </li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Affordable and useful</li>
            <li>powerful water flosser; and I like the dual speed of toothbrush</li>
            <li>Wife wants to use it, and when she does, I know she&#x27;ll love it and want to use it as much as me.  </li>
            <li>That alone is worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Powerful and convient.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice product and works well except for problems noted.</li>
            <li>Definetely well worth the money.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The travel case is nice and the battery will last a coupe of weeks.</li>
            <li>The water pick dose a good job as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Love the complete system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 68 year old surgeon and have had many water type flossers over the years.</li>
            <li>It worked okay with a fresh set of batteries but as time went on they seemed to drain faster requiring frequent changes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush was a nice extra.</li>
            <li>Lots of extra tools to try out, and a nice carrying case for the brush on the road.</li>
            <li>Six more words required to complete.</li>
            <li>My dentist said never go over 4 as it can irritate and hurt your gums since it&#x27;s so powerful over that.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>But, as far as the way it works, I love it.</li>
            <li>It works much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>This sure beats our old electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you want that fresh out of the dentist feeling every day then this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Really powerful but</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is not as powerful as the sonicare.</li>
            <li>Currently own this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li>This unit is well made and powerful.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have both as standard sized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Great pressure and not as loud as my last water pik.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush is far better than any Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Easier than flossing and fun to use.</li>
            <li>But still worth it</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>A powerful sonic brush without the jackhammer feel that some have.  </li>
            <li>So I moved it to the kitchen because it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have had a number of electric toothbrushes and water flossers with varying success.</li>
            <li>honestly feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist after each use.</li>
            <li>Overall, kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about this product.</li>
            <li>Great product it does make a mess with the water but other than that it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li>This product has so many different kinds of interchangeable heads to fit whatever gum/tooth cleanup need you have.</li>
            <li>Sonicare was the best brush experience I had to date in my middle aged life.  </li>
            <li>I decided that since the producer offers such great warranty it was worth the risk to get a defective piece.</li>
            <li>totally worth</li>
            <li>I used the sonic and oral b. i personally liked the oral b but on a trip, I left the charger.</li>
            <li>worth the money, I think.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>The ease of working through my mouth with the Waterpik has definitely gotten me to improve my own dental health.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>husband loves it, the extra accessories are quite nice</li>
            <li>Worth the money, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>The water flosser, complete with adjustable pressure setting and multiple tips, is great.</li>
            <li>Water flossing is a fun and pleasurable activity.</li>
            <li>rarely flossed  </li>
            <li>i cannot get a fresh breath without using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it totally worth your money&lt;</li>
            <li>but it really worth it</li>
            <li>What a snazzy upgrade to an old favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is convenient and compact and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>My teeth feels fresh every time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li>If I had had this Waterpik Complete Care Flosser and Toothbrush, I most like would not have had this problem.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing a quick,easy and fun thing to do.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price</li>
            <li>Looks nice but the only thing working is the flosser.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this thing, having had it about a month or so.</li>
            <li>*fun*</li>
            <li>Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Works like a champ &amp;#34;Feels fresh after every Brush&amp;#34; I give 7 Star</li>
            <li>It makes brushing/flossing so much fun.</li>
            <li>A DEAL,THE TOOTHBRUSH ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and it just makes my mouth feel so fresh.  </li>
            <li>It kind of sounds like a tiny pressure washer.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the old toothrush and waterpick.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not sure what that means, but she was excited about it and my gums and teeth feel much better and way more clean than ever before.  </li>
            <li>and it does not dry out very easily.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought that a jet of water could be that strong and effective in cleaning down below the gum line.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of waterpik water flossers and love using them, so I was excited to get this and also have a waterpik brand toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This works so easy and takes no time away from my normal routine, I should have bought this years ago.</li>
            <li>Item delivered quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I had an older waterpik for many many years but it finally started leaking and needed replacement.</li>
            <li>It comes with several items that really clean teeth and promote healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on the different types, but the sensation is so refreshing and clean</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to make use of the button which stops the water from flowing out; You can easily turn a dry bathroom into a water park if you don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the clean feeling-just like a professional cleaning- that this unit provides.</li>
            <li>Some times I mix in some mouthwash (just male sure to run clean water through the system afterwards).</li>
            <li>Overall, however, my teeth are clean and my gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush makes my teeth feel very clean, but the waterpik is obnoxiously loud.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they work good</li>
            <li>one daughter is so excited she is really looking forward to Santa</li>
            <li>Other than that it is good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for super clean teeth and moufh.</li>
            <li>The dentist was right</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
            <li>Water water everywhere is right...</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It did not leak right away</li>
            <li>and they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>He was right on.</li>
            <li>right ~~~~~~&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m worried a little.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The capacity of the water container is just right.</li>
            <li>so you brush each quadrant the right amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is now right there</li>
            <li>As I  am left-handed and my outlet  is on the right side of the sink.</li>
            <li>, I feel the difference right away</li>
            <li>I can see and feel the difference right away after using this product.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to get the right angles so as not to splash out over things, but be patient.  </li>
            <li>they were right on.</li>
            <li>First of all, the toothbrush is a much slimmer profile and is comfortable</li>
            <li>Electric than manual brush clean, coordination with the cleaning is very practical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun in the past and I liked this toothbrush better, besides now</li>
            <li>and it really does CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>The sonic toothbrush really shines up your teeth and creates an all-day clean feeling on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Really gets my teeth dentist clean.</li>
            <li>after I use it, my mouth really feels clean</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth clean and ready to talk up close to people.</li>
            <li>In 3 or four minutes my mouth feels completely clean, so much so that I don&#x27;t even get morning breath.</li>
            <li>I also use dental floss as well, but the combination really makes my teeth feel clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>It does however clean really well.</li>
            <li>The WP-900 really gets our teeth clean.</li>
            <li>A great little machine!</li>
            <li>When you use it, fill it with whatever temp water is comfortable for your teeth and wipe it all down after your done to keep it nice and to prevent mildew.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the wait and the price is very reasonable for a sonic toothbrush and the water-flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waterflossing makes flossing all that more enjoyable and less time consuming.</li>
            <li>Now i floss everyday because it&#x27;s easy and effective.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to apply anywhere near the pressure you would use with a normal brush as it vibrates any stuff off the teeth easily leaving you with that fresh smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have purchased this amazing flosser and toothbrush a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the two-speed toothbrush - the higher speed setting seems to help in areas that occasionally have a higher buildup of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have to refill it twice each use to increase my cleaning time because of the small reservoir but the electric toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is great for getting rid of the small seeds.</li>
            <li>Wish I knew about this long ago, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>But I had the process down fairly well within a week.</li>
            <li>and I am a little bit upset , but I still give it a 5 star as it is very well made and great values included.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews and instructions, I used it with no spills right from the first try.</li>
            <li>Sonic Tooth brush is easy to use and makes a complete dental care team.&lt;br /&gt;-Sonic</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use so the kids use it frequently.</li>
            <li>Brush is good, but product as a whole did not work as expected</li>
            <li>Does a super job thanks</li>
            <li>Just ok, not crazy about the toothbrush, next time I&#x27;d purchase each separately and go with oral b.  </li>
            <li>Works great and dislodges any tiny particles left in teeth after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>The Two speed tooth brush is as good as my SonicCare that I keep in the downstairs half Bath.</li>
            <li>Five minutes a day with this toothbrush and flosser to reduce the frequency of 90 minute professional deep cleanings is a good trade.</li>
            <li>I am happy enough with the product overall.  </li>
            <li>Our power outlet in the bathroom is connected with the light, meaning it has only power when the light is on.</li>
            <li>You get that wonderful fresh feeling without the scary dentist part.</li>
            <li>Good unit &amp; easier to use than the previous model.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take that much time to do a quick pass.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik and sonic tooth brush give you the super clean feeling of a professional cleaning without the bleeding gums--get one.</li>
            <li>Great product , I have been using it daily for the last 3 months.</li>
            <li>If you do not enjoy flossing with string then the waterpik is excellent as it does the same job using water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several levels so this is a good product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I prefer this toothbrush to my old Philips Sonicare since the brush part pulls off easily.</li>
            <li>I had a sonicare years ago and this is just as good for way less cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having three crowns replaced soon at a total cost of $2,475 which I could have likely prevented or greatly delayed</li>
            <li>great product though larger than my last one.</li>
            <li>The pause button is particularly useful unless you enjoy an unexpected bast of streaming water shooting up your nostril.</li>
            <li>AND WORKS LIKE NEW!!!</li>
            <li>very soft, comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and compact and has a limited 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel just out of the dental office clean everyday,  I love it!</li>
            <li>The waterpik is good too, but less than 5 minutes during the first use, the pause button quit working.</li>
            <li>works great better than regular flossing never will go back to regular flossing again</li>
            <li>my braces).&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush is very gentle on my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The convenience of having one plug for both your toothbrush and your water flosser leaves your precious bathroom outlets free for other things.</li>
            <li>She said my pockets were significantly reduced and there was only light tartar build-up.</li>
            <li>I have now adapted to placing a space-age toothbrush in my mouth that creates abnormal brain waves if allowed to rattle against my epiglottis, but removes all matter of plaque, uncleanness, and has brightened my teeth while still offering the tried and true water flossing and tonsil cleaning of a classic Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>This setup does not always hold the one on the right in the picture (2014) and that can be frustrating from such an important and awesome device otherwise.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it and it really helps! !</li>
            <li>That made me feel very good because I was not a great flosser otherwise.</li>
            <li>The flosser works great but the button has begun to stick and make it hard to start and stop.  </li>
            <li>decided I would very much like to try the Sonic, but I noted that the price for the Sonic and a Waterpik higher quality water flosser model, when sold separately, would amount to about $170--a pretty steep cost and out of my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works so much more effectively than what I&#x27;ve been struggling with previously, that I am able to do my dental care in literally half the time it took me with my Sonicare and Model</li>
            <li>It works so much more effectively than what I&#x27;ve been struggling with previously, that I am able to do my dental care in literally half the time it took me with my Sonicare and Model</li>
            <li>This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>This is my first waterpik.  </li>
            <li>the bottom (where the battery is) was quite hot.</li>
            <li>however the waterflosser can be used while the toothbrush is charging for the first day.</li>
            <li>It really has helped my gums and my teeth a lot!  </li>
            <li>will need replace the handle with the tube pretty soon.  </li>
            <li>That first one was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love that it has two speeds on the toothbrush and that there are multiple waterpik heads.</li>
            <li>Diabetics more likely to develop gum disease than others.</li>
            <li>I found that the water pick combination  was exactly as I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the toothbrush has a timer to let you know when to move to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; in your mouth and shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>The handle vibrates quite a bit more than either of those did, but thats not really a big issue.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty meticulous about flossing,  so what would&#x27;ve taken me 30+ min with waxed floss and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will gladly review the brush later.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much I enjoy the toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do NOT expect a $99 item (what I paid for this in 2015) to last forever, but geesh, I should get a couple of years or more off of it...  </li>
            <li>Waterpik has recently elected to make a change to our Water Flosser products to be more compliant with energy efficiency.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to a long and happy future with waterpik- WP-900</li>
            <li>My first dental checkup after purchasing this device is coming soon</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first water flosser my family has ever used.</li>
            <li>I have been contemplating buying Waterpik, and I&#x27;m glad I have finally opted to order it.</li>
            <li>Finally I haven&#x27;t been able to find ANY brush refills at Target or Walmart which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush stopped recharging in August 2016 exactly 15 months after I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a water pik.</li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;flosses&amp;#34; much better than actually using dental floss.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, last time I better understood an issue with a gap between the bottoms of two teeth</li>
            <li>first time buying water flosser.</li>
            <li>Exactly as hoped.</li>
            <li>would probably still be using my first one</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t get lectured for not flossing ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>it is pretty well constructed and sensibly designed.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I decided to get a rechargeable system and at first was just looking at a sonic brush but then noticed this combo.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>Love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased the Waterpic brand</li>
            <li>It came with several different accessories so that I could try the different ones out and then order the replacements that worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first thing that you do is set up the area that you plan to put the unit.  </li>
            <li>More than 4 would actually result in damaging my gums.</li>
            <li>Sonic does such a better job.</li>
            <li>i love the 2 in one package and that waterpik comes with various heads replacements soft/sprays etc.  </li>
            <li>i love the multiple spray settings too.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare brushes had a much longer useful life.</li>
            <li>- Better by a mile than traditional flossing</li>
            <li>I bought it, use it twice daily and love it.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth!</li>
            <li>This was my first &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it has a toothbrush and a waterpik flosser and spots to store the extra flosser heads, as well as the bonus travel case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I also like that the flosser comes with so many different heads, including an orthodontic tip.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer covers everything for the first year.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used something like this</li>
            <li>and I have flossed more time  with this in the last year then</li>
            <li>Take time and read the directions as you go about doing this for the first time step by step.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like using regular floss, you will love this.  </li>
            <li>First time I ever had one of these</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his first Waterpik</li>
            <li>I still remember the first time I used mine.</li>
            <li>I love this, especially for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li>received the package on the exact date it was estimated.</li>
            <li>It really eliminates plaque!</li>
            <li>It appears to be healthier because I was able to wash away the gunk deep in the gum line.  </li>
            <li>(Okay, maybe not a water park but definitely an aquatic mess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many attachments for the waterpik for whatever your needs are as well as two tooth brush heads that are different sizes.</li>
            <li>It does make noise but NOT annoying or too loud.</li>
            <li>OR contrary to expectation was more than the standard 15 amp outlet.  </li>
            <li>This means I&#x27;ll now have two toothbrushes, but will need extra counter space and another electrical outlet if I want to be able to charge the toothbrush and keep using the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Wish I used it the first 50 years, I might have saved a tooth and the pain that went with that loss.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik  I purchased was recommended by my dentist this the first one for me</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li>(this was my first experience with a waterpik).  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that it does not replace flossing.</li>
            <li>My teeth were cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li>All these feelings were gone after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Although the replacement brush heads were much more costly than the Oral B ones, and ultamitly the replacement cost of the brush heads is what drove me back to purchase another Oral B rotary type tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i spit blood all over.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i spit blood all over.</li>
            <li>My dentist always comments about how the health of the teeth and gums of his patients who use a Waterpik, on a regular basis, is significantly better than those who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The first time we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing</li>
            <li>The first one the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after just 15 days.</li>
            <li>would it really do a better job than a standard toothbrush and dental floss?  </li>
            <li>My first automatic toothbrush--love it.  </li>
            <li>So she finally recommended a water pic, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not random, so this may be a feature, but  I&#x27;m not a fan of</li>
            <li>There are several attachments, most of which I haven&#x27;t tried.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush &amp; water flosser are gentle but powerful.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely use this item well after my braces treatment.</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>The button turns the brush on at the first, slower speed setting.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than dentures!</li>
            <li>This is also my first electric / sonic toothbrush as well as a water floss / pick thing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t consistent when it came to flossing</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time using a Waterpik</li>
            <li>It sprayed my bathroom walls and floor the first couple of times I tried it.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s a lot more convenient than using regular floss.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush &amp; water flosser are gentle but powerful.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve used a water flosser</li>
            <li>/more enjoyable water flossing is relative to manual flossing.  </li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare toothbrush before with all the bells and whistles, and the Waterpik Total Care product is much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Over 6 months later I still love the product.  </li>
            <li>This Pik requires TWO (2) hands to operate it when you first start.</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference from the first use.  </li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s a timer on the toothbrush that systematically does 30 second increments on 4 quadrants of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Second, the waterpik is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I took me exactly one use before I was sold on the Waterpik model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterpik has combined their proven water flosser with a powerful sonic toothbrush in one very well executed unit.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is my first water flosser and WOWW</li>
            <li>Having the toothbrush and flosser in the same unit also makes me more likely to use both of them more often.</li>
            <li>Compare around like I did, but I am sure you will come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Not many more are going to be able to offer everything this one has and does.</li>
            <li>n found it better than regular flosser  just because it doesnt hurt my gum&lt;</li>
            <li>but it definitely cleans better than the 1st one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has been working fantastic.</li>
            <li>At age 62 and having braces for the first time it makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li>The first unit I received had a problem.</li>
            <li>This is my first WaterPik.</li>
            <li>my wife and I have been using this on a regular basis we really love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first sonic brush, and I can&#x27;t believe the speed the brush moves.</li>
            <li>We love it, it was open box</li>
            <li>She also feels like her gums actually feel better.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was on the charger for days when it first arrived and never charged.</li>
            <li>Much better than an Intellisonic toothbrush that I recently purchased from my dentist.</li>
            <li>First one, the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>Will not ever be able to use a regular toothbrush or floss again.</li>
            <li>The Water Flosser portion was heaven sent and my mouth feels so much better with this total cleaning program.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a waterpik</li>
            <li>the toothbrush would just be a convenient add-on to the waterpik, but I love them both equally!</li>
            <li>Does a much better job than  regular floss.  </li>
            <li>Chinese customers are satisfied</li>
            <li>Although I like it, be aware, the water pic flow cut off button</li>
            <li>The Waterpik take several times to learn to use, more use the easier it is to use.</li>
            <li>My only problem is after two weeks the brush can&#x27;t hold a charge, but that&#x27;s ok cause with the two year warranty that comes with the unit Waterpik</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference in the first use.</li>
            <li>Love the double Pik.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are several water pik attachments and water dispensing options.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s better than just brushing your teeth alone.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>This is a product that is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>entirely however I find it much easier to be on top of oral health when its fun /enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The first one I got had a toothbrush that lost its charge after I traveled with it, and would regain charge.  </li>
            <li>Ten times better than using dental floss.</li>
            <li>I can see difference on first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many different electric toothbrushes, but this one has worked</li>
            <li>I love this because of the different attachments included with the water flosse; as well as being to adjust the speed of the flossing.</li>
            <li>I thought it to be a good investment, we started using it Christmas day, and today we went to use it and the toothbrush is dead..  </li>
            <li>good product, I hope I can ues it everyday.</li>
            <li>toothbrush has two settings, but the high setting is way too powerful for me; the lower setting is just right.  </li>
            <li>Works better than I expecte, the cord on the water pick could be a little longer but other than that it&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li>I love the the clear plastic reservoir which makes it easy to track how much water is left.</li>
            <li>OMG I LOVE my new Waterpik (R) ultra flosser complete with toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The water flosser is great; no more floss fingers for me!  </li>
            <li>The price is ridiculously low compared to the other popular sonic brush and I like this brush much better.</li>
            <li>A brand new full unit is on its way to me.  </li>
            <li>No other way to get a mouth feeling as fresh and clean than to use a Waterpark and their sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am concerned, no one wants to lose their teeth, right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the reservoir to be just the right size for a cleaning of the whole mouth without needing refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an oral b floss action brush before and it did such a better job of keeping my teeth plaque free for the whole day.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old and 6 year old are also big fans which is great, getting kids to properly and thoroughly brush and floss isn&#x27;t always easy.</li>
            <li>Add a little mouthwash to flosser water &amp; enjoy clean teeth, gums &amp; fresh breath!  </li>
            <li>I could see where it could be too large for some spaces, especially if you have more than one.  </li>
            <li>Product works great, flosser makes a splash,a little loud.  </li>
            <li>a little loud but works great</li>
            <li>The technology is really great, and the footprint is very small.  </li>
            <li>As a couple other reviewers have mentioned, it would be nice if there were three speed settings for the toothbrush instead of two.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard use the word \\&quot;love\\&quot; when referring to such a product but after having it a week I can say I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Extremely functional, and much easier and more effective than regular flossing.</li>
            <li>Had a power surge which fried the unit and Waterpik sent me a brand new unit quickly.</li>
            <li>While this product is a bit loud and messy it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Sonic Toothbrush leaves my mouth and teeth clean however the water pik does not do a complete job of removing food between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to use, but I feel like it&#x27;s doing a much better job than regular flossing ever did.  </li>
            <li>The best part, it didn&#x27;t take as long as usual and the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li>I got it with a low price so fair enough.</li>
            <li>Not only no bleeding, but no swollen hurt gums, and my mouth feels super clean.  </li>
            <li>It might feel funny or even hurt in the beginning, but it gets better as long as you proceed using it.</li>
            <li>So that is my only issue with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is big and holds a good amount of water.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think you will find a better toothbrush for the deal- especially considering all it comes with.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is loud, too but the flosser is top notch loud.</li>
            <li>: I haven&#x27;t had the super clean, just-got-out-of-a-professional-dental-cleaning feeling outside of my visits to my dentist until I purchased the flosser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not convinced the water flosser actually does much for me, but the toothbrush is okay.</li>
            <li>The one thing I will say is, I wish that the tip holding area was a bit larger, I really had to cram to get all of mine to go in, but they are safely inside now.</li>
            <li>Overall really like it, much better than flossing.</li>
            <li>Good product a bit expensive for what it is ,the information on usage is not up to spec as i need to know more.</li>
            <li>Very helpful and better than the regular flossing by the threat</li>
            <li>She described them as gentle, but I showed her the softest settings first and told her once she got used to them, then we could go to a higher setting.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll know better about how much I like it after my next dental check-up in march.</li>
            <li>I was  expecting to be able to use the water pick straight out of the box  but had to go purchase brush and floss attachments at a local store.  </li>
            <li>It sounds too loud when it works but overall a nice thing to have.</li>
            <li>So back to the old fashion dental floss, which is a shame I liked the waterpik when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Tracy</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, and it&#x27;s loud both with the pik and toothbrush, but it works and glad I got it!!</li>
            <li>the toothbrush has 2 settings, the high power setting is really powerful.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely feel the clean difference!</li>
            <li>the on/off switch could be a little more one-handed friendly.  </li>
            <li>The water flosser is actually very easy and quick to use, however the first few times you might make a mess, so keep a towel handy.  </li>
            <li>Very Good, It&#x27;s only fault is the water reservoir should be larger especially when using it</li>
            <li>Anyway, my old electric toothbrush kicked it recently, and when I went on amazon to research a replacement, I found this amazingly reviewed and very competitively-priced sonic toothbrush/water-flossing combo.</li>
            <li>I do have to point out that the first use is a real shocker with water spraying all over the place--just always use to staring at my face and opened mouth when flossing.  </li>
            <li>For all the skeptics out there, this product really works and does exactly what it says on the box.</li>
            <li>After using the product for a few weeks I am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love that the toothbrush pauses, indicating to me how long to brush each section.</li>
            <li>I have not had it long, but it sure works.</li>
            <li>The sound that the flosser emits is very similar to one of a more quiet jackhammer once its on.</li>
            <li>Works very well, toothbrush has two speeds and the higher speed is a bit noisy</li>
            <li>The waterpik has 10 settings, and once again, get used to the lower settings first, do not jump straight to the highest setting.</li>
            <li>Only been using this a few days but very happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is as good as any sonic type toothbrush (if not better), and the waterpik holds plenty of water..  </li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush is good, nothing our of the ordinary, just does its job.</li>
            <li>I hesitated upon reading others comments about the high speed being too high and that maybe an intermediate speed would be helpful but, upon buying it, I find the high speed setting to be just fine...</li>
            <li>gentle mode, the toothbrush is nowhere near as strong as the SoniCare, but on high, it&#x27;s stronger.</li>
            <li>I had been fairly satisfied with the Sonicare, but mainly because it was the only brand I have ever used, so I hadn&#x27;t compared it with anything</li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if the toothbrush had a pause button so you could spit before toothpaste goes running down your chin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to just set the tooth brush down in the slot and see it charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to find myself feeling very self conscious about my breath by the end of the work day because I could feel a funny taste in my mouth and knew I needed to brush, now my breath stays fresh so much longer!</li>
            <li>No more bleeding from the gums (unless I put the water pressure too high) and a nice clean feeling every morning.</li>
            <li>The product is well packed, such that the flosser and toothbrush are well protected, but everything was easily opened--</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is super loud.  </li>
            <li>this was fixed with some super glue on the colored metal ring.</li>
            <li>The flosser is easily knocked off its holder which was not a problem with the earlier model.</li>
            <li>The same hygienist as before concluded that a normal cleaning was appropriate this time.  </li>
            <li>Easy controls for starting and intensity and</li>
            <li>Also, it has such easy to use force control switch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very quiet.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts about the quality at first - I had seen mixed reviews and it felt so light weight.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up, and she was using it the next day.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I got my first cavity filled last month</li>
            <li>Machine is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>It has multiple pics for caring for your gums, fighting plaque and just feeling really orally fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and I am able to switch up and use Periodex with the water, or my mouthwash for Dry Mouth.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this because my long time electronic toothbrush finally died and saw this combo which seemed like a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be smart guy and put a suit on then complain you have stuff all over you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am certain this will make a difference in oral health with timed brushing cycles &amp;  stimulation of gums.  </li>
            <li>It buzes at certain time intervals to tell you it has been 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>For travelers, you may want to purchase the water pick and tooth brush separately, since the combined unit is rather large.  </li>
            <li>i dont have a large space in my sink to buy 2 products separately  </li>
            <li>You can still use your favorite toothpaste and mouthwash, and its only slightly more expensive than just a plain ole waterpic.&lt;br /&gt;Update: definitely happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>The product is good and looks very well made, I have 3 other waterpiks in house , every one works very well, the only easy broken part is the on/off push button on the handle, I already replaced two handles because of this ,but overall this product is very good</li>
            <li>Price is right and beats going to a dentist only for cleaning every 6 months when u can clean ur mouth as much u want anytime.</li>
            <li>I mean, it seemed good in the first place.</li>
            <li>After many decades I am not about to turn over a new leaf and start flossing daily.    </li>
            <li>Personally experienced less gum bleeding versus flossing with regular floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I previously had a Phillips sonicare that was much smaller and worked great for five years until the battery died.  </li>
            <li>Take it from a guy who loathes flossing, I also have a permanent brace on my bottom row of teeth, so the water pik makes cleaning down there so much easier and a lot more fun than threading a piece of string through my teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it with the casual elegance of the guy in the waterpik ads, but it&#x27;s easy and fairly mess-free.    </li>
            <li>It worked fine  for only 2 weeks, after this time it started to clatter and now  it almost doesnt work........</li>
            <li>Wish I had this as a teen - so got one for my teen to set her on a path to super healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I actually use the Waterpik and regular floss, as well, to make sure my teeth are super</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product very highly.</li>
            <li>Recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Can you say amazing little product?</li>
            <li>After using and loving this water pik for a little over a year, the battery in the toothbrush stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little gum massage too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Use on the lowest setting and work your way up, gums will bleed if its too high at first.</li>
            <li>I typically will buy things on Amazon (even if its a couple of dollars more) versus other unknown companies - even if the other company provides free shipping, because I know that I will get my item in perfect shape and in two days or less (Prime Member), and if I am less than happy with the product they will send me a packing slip to return it at no cost to me!!!  </li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong, my oral hygiene has always been very good.</li>
            <li>The entire unit fits comfortably on the counter and it does not take up much.</li>
            <li>There has been a huge improvement in the overall health of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter&#x27;s mouth hardware has been fabulously cleaned and she really loves the different heads.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter&#x27;s mouth hardware has been fabulously cleaned and she really loves the different heads.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected, water pic and electric tooth brush in one and both high quality!</li>
            <li>Brushes wear out fast .</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and works well.</li>
            <li>To me the brush was a bonus I really came for the Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li>but if it doesnt bother you it serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>I really feel and see the difference after using the Waterpik toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The brush speeds up that process and Ive never flossed (mouth burned too much by then),</li>
            <li>I would highly recommendoubt this product!</li>
            <li>It also re-charges much faster than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It also re-charges much faster than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>only one light battery when i received</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush</li>
            <li>Really gets everything out from between your teeth fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>For the rave reviews I expected it to be better, but it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The waterpic Sonic care tooth brush combo works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to try and return it.  </li>
            <li>Put it straight to work.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it came</li>
            <li>my teeth feel so much cleaner and easier to floss.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product combo.</li>
            <li>The Hygienist said that it was &amp;#34;excellent home care&amp;#34; that accomplished that...</li>
            <li>This waterpik is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was bummed out the brush had to charge, because I wanted to try out the whole package.</li>
            <li>Basically everyone wants it so no one gets it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>WILL REALLY VIBRATE THEM.</li>
            <li>The distal jet they had inserted in her mouth kept getting food stuck inside (as did the braces) leaving her with really obnoxious breath and a very sore mouth.</li>
            <li>Really like the all in one flosser and toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The whole package seems well thought out, with attention to the details.  </li>
            <li>The rubbery grips on it don&#x27;t seem to function very well as... rubbery grips.</li>
            <li>I REALLY want to spend another $65 to keep it alive?&amp;#34; At the end of the day, the answer to that question is a begrudging yes...</li>
            <li>so when my teeth are more sensitive I&#x27;m thankful the low setting is so gentle.</li>
            <li>It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>

            <li>of just brush 2 times I day, I really need to step up my gum and tooth regime.  </li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s always ready to go.</li>
            <li>It comes with a travel case that is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and am now a reformed Sonicare user!</li>
            <li>Ease of use &amp; it really does work well as a flosser.</li>
            <li>Very good!I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Pik/brush combo since the combined price made the brush very inexpensive when compared to the price of the Pik price alone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it is very  well designed with practical storage for everything.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn’t need to move the whole thing.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>a big bottle of Listerine fits, this will fit.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>it really helpfull.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>My sister wants one.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well but is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush</li>
            <li>so I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much of a flosser, but ever since visiting my dental for my checkup and being told my gum health is borderline and that I should invest in a waterpik,  I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter and she likes it so much</li>
            <li>Practical and very efficient to use</li>
            <li>the feeling you get after using the waterpick is a much cleaner feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She likes it so much</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>is so much easier than flossing.</li>
            <li>But once you use the waterpik........no so much.  </li>
            <li>Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>And the waterpik really couldn&#x27;t be easier.  </li>
            <li>The whole of the world.</li>
            <li>While bulky on the bathroom counter, it performs very well.</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased it for the Waterpik flosser since I didn&#x27;t really have much faith in the sonic toothbrush (my last sonic toothbrush was a Sonicare), but was I</li>
            <li>I told you how much</li>
            <li>I really like the power process for the toothbrush that is very nifty.</li>
            <li>Consolidated both functions in the WP-900.  Works very well.  </li>
            <li>my dentist checked out and I  doing very well</li>
            <li>so much  </li>
            <li>waterpik works very well.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>its quite different than those cheap ones you buy...</li>
            <li>Cleans between teeth very well .</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how much stuff comes out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Was worried about counter space but did not take up much.</li>
            <li>The waterpik leaks out the whole water bin if the handle pops out of its cradle.</li>
            <li>For gentle, low-pressure delivery of antimicrobial rinses</li>
            <li>The tooth brush really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>Because tooth care affects my whole health I decided to stop with the piecemeal gadgets</li>
            <li>if you had brace, buy this  work very well for my wife</li>
            <li>much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it since it arrived I really like it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone who values their teeth!</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush was ready immediately</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>It really cleans in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Both utensils have been upgraded and are much improved.  </li>
            <li>You would be amazed how much stuff stays between your teeth after brushing (and you see it all in the sink when you spit out the water).</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that the whole setup is in one place which makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much room on my sink either, but I don&#x27;t think that it takes up that much room.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this, it was listed as being made in USA, it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s made in China</li>
            <li>but I really like that it has one.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are being cleaned, and the fast is so jarring</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>Customer service was very polite and accommodating.</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>I then switched to Braun and it worked much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But having said that I do think that this product will increase your dental health, if it holds up and doesn&#x27;t leak too much, that is.</li>
            <li>but it is quite compact and will fit in any standard shelf (NOT the med cabinet</li>
            <li>i can tell is i am really in awe from this machine.</li>
            <li>i can tell is i am really in awe from this machine.</li>
            <li>wish I had bought one years ago, probably wouldn&#x27;t be having dental surgery very soon...</li>
            <li>You never know how much stuff gets into your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It amazes me how much the flosser rinses out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works very well for me if I brush for the 1.5 to 2 min.....  </li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t travel with it really.  </li>
            <li>after using a sense of purity for the whole day, I recommend)))</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is kept on charger so it is always ready.</li>
            <li>really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It seems that they&#x27;re only available on line.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the difference from the cheap Spinbrush I purchased from the local store while my toothbrush was out of commission.  </li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.   </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I just purchased another one for another family member who got braces and he is using it very well.</li>
            <li>They replaced the whole thing under warranty.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how much cleaner my teeth would look and feel after using the toothbrush and water flosser.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and I was really noticing stains and buildup of plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li>As my dentist says, I have a very &amp;#34;crowded&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I take the tooth brush with me when I travel, but not the whole flosser -</li>
            <li>This unit works well but the water flosser does not do a very thorough job.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the teeth and gums, you can see the results in the sink.  </li>
            <li>All what I expected, even the hygienist is pleased with the results of the product.</li>
            <li>and I am really sold.</li>
            <li>The irrigator is just a  straight line of water.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Absolutely blown away with the performance (but not the structural integrity) of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up too much real estate, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t travel with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner since purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>If a person has only one hand available to use it would be tricky.</li>
            <li>Do you really want the kids grubby hands rooting around trying to do this every morning?  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in your gums after a month using it.</li>
            <li>I really like having the brush and the water in one.</li>
            <li>The item is straight forward and the instruction tell you how to use the waterpik.</li>
            <li>fast shiped&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much cleaner my mouth feels, and I was a diligent brusher before.</li>
            <li>Even better then I expected.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is always charged and ready to go</li>
            <li>and my husband absolutely loves the waterpik.</li>
            <li>MY TEETH AND GUMS FEEL SO MUCH HEALTHER AND CLEANER.</li>
            <li>i called waterpik; their customer service was very polite and helpful.</li>
            <li>an really cleans</li>
            <li>but at much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This machine does it all very well.</li>
            <li>I feel as though the spaces between my teeth and my gums are much cleaner after using this product.  </li>
            <li>And, though the product feels very flimsy, it is very functional.  </li>
            <li>As an experiment for this brush, my cleaning habits will not change much.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans all the stuff out.</li>
            <li>That holds it real</li>
            <li>Like it so much that it is what my kids are getting for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Waterpik should really consider improving that</li>
            <li>there is no way of recharging without taking the whole unit with you.&lt;br /&gt;Other than online, no one sells the flossers.</li>
            <li>really cleans underneath the rings on my braces like floss could not.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much counter space and having the sonic toothbrush as part of it</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>problem I have seen is that it uses water fast so you might have to refill the cup often.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really like the power of the water pic and the 2 speeds of the brush.  </li>
            <li>The product is built really well.</li>
            <li>And being in one unit, it is a very convenient reminder to use both sides in my dental health care program.  </li>
            <li>and i knew i really needed to with them</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush as much as the water flosser.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of weeks to get used to, but eventually you&#x27;ll crank it up to 10 and be amazed at how much stuff this device will take out of your gums.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve really got to try this.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all one unit that doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I also like the quad timer - it keeps me from focusing too much on one area of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I find the toothbrush okay, but I feel the bristles are too widely spaced; I still feel roughness on my tooth surfaces after brushing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it because I expected that most of them were going to leak in some form or another.</li>
            <li>This works really well for me.</li>
            <li>and the bristles really clearing out between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The floss water does get in-between my teeth really well</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it really does give you the feeling of going to your dentist...</li>
            <li>Works great and at only a fraction of the cost from such stores  stores such as Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product has improved my teeth and gum health so much.</li>
            <li>The whole family can use by trading out brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have two crowns and this really gets all the yuck out.</li>
            <li>was surprised how powerful the water flosser is.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat compact and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to mind much, but then I&#x27;ve been doing their teeth since they were babies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too big to fit on the landing in my bathroom</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like doing negative reviews and tend to have a bit of mercy with companies if they&#x27;ve supplied good customer service when there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li>The pick also has a pause button which is nice and keeps things from getting messy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, I have sensitive problem gums and the sonic brush with its soft bristles is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this after get adult braces and only this and went to my latest dental exam</li>
            <li>Surprised to see how many particles regular flossing doesn&#x27;t  get out of teeth.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my old Waterpik unit I used for many years, but the plastic has finally met</li>
            <li>I bought this item a few months ago and liked it however now it does not work and</li>
            <li>On the face of it, this seems like good value, but the quality is too poor to make it worth buying.</li>
            <li>At first the high speed feels very intense, but in the long run, if you work up to it, it really does clean the teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>So easy to use, can&#x27;t believe how much debris is left over after normal brushing.</li>
            <li>Beats the toothbrush by far!!!</li>
            <li>the battery pack is soldered directly into the board!!!</li>
            <li>When I went to the dentist last week for a cleaning the hygienist commented &amp;#34;you certainly don&#x27;t leave much for me to clean, do you?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>it is a quick and easy way to remove all those little pieces of spinach or not or whatever straight after meals.&lt;br /&gt;start</li>
            <li>low and super high!!</li>
            <li>I know this because I took our 1st one apart, we don&#x27;t live in the States and my wife fried our first one by plugging it into a 220v socket...</li>
            <li>First one did not work at all water pic sent me new one</li>
            <li>system comes with 2 classic tips, 1 plaque seeker tip, and pik pocket tip, a large toothbrush head and a compact toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>system comes with 2 classic tips, 1 plaque seeker tip, and pik pocket tip, a large toothbrush head and a compact toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>The little one also (very surprisingly) loves to use the water flosser, wants to do it even longer than the typical 90 seconds, and is eager to try all the attachments.</li>
            <li>I really like the deep clean feeling after using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So I came across this package, which was only a few bucks more and got me a very cool Cordless, rechargeable sonic toothbrush,</li>
            <li>excited I fired up the pick head and did front and back.</li>
            <li>sonic toothbrush is better than the other leading brand.  </li>
            <li>Last August I got braces and it quickly became apparent that keeping my teeth clean would be a challenge.  </li>
            <li>Once the brush is done, we remove the top and stand it up in the unit or other storage</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is better than the other ultrasonic one.  </li>
            <li>Once the on button is pressed, you get the sensitive setting first and then the normal setting (something I wasn&#x27;t aware of until I tried turning off the toothbrush).</li>
            <li>This combination toothbrush/water pick unit is space saving and works just as well as the original individual units.</li>
            <li>After first use feels like professional teeth cleaning from dentist!</li>
            <li>The Waterpik model, especially compared with many of the Sonicare models, is pretty basic.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essentially pointing a small, high-powered hose at your face, but after the first use, I&#x27;ve successfully used it without covering myself/</li>
            <li>I bought it for the Waterpik feature to try to prevent losing more teeth due to ill-fitting implants.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660) on Prime Day but ended up returning it because it didn&#x27;t seem to produce enough pressure.  </li>
            <li>My gums do look a bit healthier and I am only using original Listerine and Hydrogen Peroxide as my cleaning material.</li>
            <li>The waterpik feature always makes me feel that I am getting my mouth so much cleaner, particularly coupled with flossing and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it to clean my electric razor next.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently thinking of getting one for my wife,she likes the way mine clean s my teeth</li>
            <li>Holds 20oz of water, which isn&#x27;t much when you &#x27;prime&#x27; the unit, but refill after that and 20oz lasts a decent while.</li>
            <li>The water flosser is plenty powerful and I didn&#x27;t know at first if what I was feeling was actually doing anything.  </li>
            <li>I have recently gotten braces, and this makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth only feels this clean after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>It cleans, flosses, and messages the gums in such a way that your teeth feel as clean as they do after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Two months of using the system and my teeth still feel as clean as the last time I had them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is solid and gets everything squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Initially there will be clean up while you get used to flooding your mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel so clean after using this its almost like the same feeling as if I just had my teeth polished!</li>
            <li>The clear plastic reservoir  makes it easy to track how much water is left during your cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the amount of food that the water pic removed from between my teeth, I found using the mid range on the jet dial worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>Fill the reservoir of half mouthwash and half luke warm water, and your teeth will reach a whole new level of clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Shipper was fast and efficient would highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li>My dentist HIGHLY recommended that I buy an electronic toothbrush so after much reviewing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are looking to have the absolute cleanest teeth on the block for the price of 1x dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the high is a bit too fast.  </li>
            <li>Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.</li>
            <li>Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.</li>
            <li>is sending me a entire new unit to keep for free.</li>
            <li>I said above, this unit has the ability to change the strength of the stream from soft to strong, with settings ranging from 1 to 10.</li>
            <li>I recently got braces and they were the reason I purchased this unit, it is gentle enough for the braces to be safe but it also has enough water pressure to clean throughly.</li>
            <li>Also the waterpik device is a little fussy as to placement in its holder, and can fall out easily if you don&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li>Mine has 10 jet pulse options, which is why I clearly put the exact item description in my title...</li>
            <li>We all have our own preferences and usually there are things we disagree on even if we agree.  </li>
            <li>Far better than my old standard electric that always felt like it was assaulting my gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor surprised me the first time I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I travel 17 days a month and a full charge only lasts about two weeks</li>
            <li>My mouth feels like I just had a deep cleaning done at the dentists and not a painful one either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product but definitely not a 5-star one either.</li>
            <li>The high is every powerful, get used to the low setting first before trying the high one.</li>
            <li>Works great- be sure to clean between the brush head &amp; base regularly.</li>
            <li>Make sure you seat the water container all the way down or else it may leak.</li>
            <li>The waterpik is forceful but can be turned down, which I love.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars.</li>
            <li>But I can live with it!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>Slightly less powerful than my original 1999 waterpik</li>
            <li>I really like my new Waterpic, does everything that I want it to do.</li>
            <li>So now I have to buy a whole new unit since the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer was easy to work with, but I am surprised they would rather send a new (different) replacement product than fix the one with the problem.</li>
            <li>The product worked much better than the previous flosser</li>
            <li>Love that this takes up so much less space.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the previous model</li>
            <li>The bonus of a sufficiently sized reservoir that allows me to do my entire mouth without refill and a toothbrush that has easily sensed signally at 30 second intervals while brushing only confirmed my satisfaction with this unit.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I cannot believe what was being missed during my previous brushing processes.</li>
            <li>I was told that I had slight gum disease and that I need to do better at flossing.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is powerful but gentle at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t particularly find anything that differentiates it from a $20 electric brush.  </li>
            <li>and so is the pick, but you have train yourself to turn it off and on at the main control, because the push button quit working almost immediately.</li>
            <li>the 2 week battery life is most likely on low setting .the</li>
            <li>When the Orthodontist recommended this particular waterpik for our teenager, we had to buy it.</li>
            <li>I made her open the box when it arrived and received only an &amp;#34;Oh, OK...</li>
            <li>love that it has several different tips depending on what needs to be flossed</li>
            <li>(although I am lucky I just need to use the standard tip).</li>
            <li>I have noticed now that beyond the routine morning/night use, I find myself constantly using this for a quick but thorough rinse after meals, snacks or coffee.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve gotten better about not spraying the whole bathroom, You do have a pause button on the handle, but you need to press it firmly to suppress the water flow, otherwise, it will leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love the different heads that come with the waterflosser and the especially the fact that we don&#x27;t have to use wax floss!!</li>
            <li>The tank runs through the water in about 30 seconds, which is more than enough time to go between all of your teeth and go back and hit any areas</li>
            <li>First of all, the first time, the blue basin comes out of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I seen the same pic at costco for more and I purchased here with a combo sonic brush and water pic for the same price.</li>
            <li>Love the different water pressure settings and various brushes included.</li>
            <li>I really like this product,very enjoying everyday to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always brushed my teeth simply out of obligation to keeping a healthy mouth....</li>
            <li>I replaced a sonicare toothbrush and older waterpik with this model which is all I need.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the adjustment of water pressure, and the two speeds of the brush.</li>
            <li>Classic Jet Tip -</li>
            <li>Far better than i expected it to.</li>
            <li>I use it twice daily and see my teeth brightening quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had the older model for years until it broke</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has a redesigned handle...not as fat as the older one.  </li>
            <li>the toothbrush is an extra plus) and so does my husband since we share the waterpik - although we do use different toothbrush attachments :)  My mouth feels cleaner</li>
            <li>The most recent was purchased in August 2014 and it blew a hole in the waterpik hose this week (2 months later).  </li>
            <li>The cord is a decent length.</li>
            <li>i got my return label in the mail quickly and mailed it back to them.</li>
            <li>The simple way it&#x27;s constructed will make it much easier to keep clean than my old one.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will get lucky, I personally did&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>And it comes with many different attachments (which all have a dedicated storage area next to the water</li>
            <li>Love it and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Includes a carrying case for two brush heads and the main brush itself.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that both the toothbrush and waterpik are combined.</li>
            <li>be careful strong water</li>
            <li>I love the larger toothbrush area and high speed setting, some newer toothbrushes are smaller with one speed</li>
            <li>/&gt;The floss pressure gets pretty high actually and the pressure works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I found the 1st setting to be too soft and the 2nd setting to be too high, no mid-range available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive he will continue using it even after his jaw is fixed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this combo for adults, older children, and teens.</li>
            <li>This cheap little thing cannot keep your teeth as clean as the traditional flosser, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the whole build quality is rather</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t very consistent with traditional floss, but loves using this 100%!</li>
            <li>The water glosser is easy although messy at first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I am sure these are normally recmmended for anyone with braces (which I had previously, and this IS a must-have)</li>
            <li>It was great until then but the failure means the total cost was about twenty five dollars a week to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>(at first I felt like I was being electrocuted when I turned on the brush), as it&#x27;s not a conventional motor that drives the brush...</li>
            <li>and i would highly recommend to a friend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doreen</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this unit.</li>
            <li>oh high.</li>
            <li>I now use the high setting and both brush heads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>the machine (sonic brush) had a problem on high speed while still under warranty.  </li>
            <li>, I have used the waterpik flosser on medium after brushing my teeth on high speed.  </li>
            <li>, I have used the waterpik flosser on medium after brushing my teeth on high speed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t start on high speed....</li>

            <li>item was highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>End price is kinda high for the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective the water flosser is as my hygenist said you really need the mechanical action of  normal floss to remove plaque.</li>
            <li>;  ,this is high praise indeed.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me on high at all.  </li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>though the high setting on both of these tools are Rambo-eque.</li>
            <li>It has two speeds, which I use the high speed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the investment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik does its job and the brush on high speed</li>
            <li>The waterpik handle is too high in the holder.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>irritate the sensitive part of my gums - neither the brush nor the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;-Small brush head and a large brush head.  </li>
            <li>The new motor is lighter and may be louder than the previous motor making it more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loves the brush and plans to use it as her travel brush since it is a little more compact than the one she has been using.</li>
            <li>A little noisy, but works fantastic!</li>
            <li>takes up little space on the counter top</li>
            <li>and it works to get the mouthwash into your teeth / gum areas a little better than just swishing the stuff in your mouth.</li>
            <li>however anyone wanting a little more focus on their teeth-health care should invest in this.</li>
            <li>As an adult who recently got braces I was looking for something to help keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>exactly the same cost as a whole new WP-900!</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to believe</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very high quality, I like that it runs a bit stronger than my old Sonicare and the flosser has an attachment for everything.</li>
            <li>Aside from those things you can make a huge mess with this, which I know I will just have to learn how to use it properly over time to get the best results, but first few times you are guaranteed to get a few puddles on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the reasons listed, I give this product &amp;#34;its ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You can set the toothbrush on gentle speed (sensitive teeth might like this one) or high speed.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it as Teeth care is highly important,lost my step dad to tooth infection so you can never do enough for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Make sure you press the water flosser button down before you turn it on, it will spray everywhere!</li>
            <li>I love that the brush has a 2-minute timer, so there&#x27;s no excuse to brush less than we are told;).</li>
            <li>So far it works really well.</li>
            <li>but i dont really care, i rather use the old school toothbrush on the tongue</li>
            <li>The product works really well with my adult braces.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely content that my flossing regiment is so much improved.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a complaint, just a comment to give readers and idea of my experience with the pulse jet stream.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a complaint, just a comment to give readers and idea of my experience with the pulse jet stream.</li>
            <li>I have had such success with my waterpik and toothbrush after getting braces, that my step daughter begs me to allow her to waterpik her teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, I was told to leave my mouth slightly open over the sink to let the used water pour out as the flosser shoots fresh water in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do the reviews, but I had to on this one.  </li>
            <li>Not a problem for a normal person setting it up for themselves.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to sustain such a long period of flossing.</li>
            <li>The brush battery has lasted over a long weekend (4 full days) without a recharge, and that&#x27;s with brushing twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the toothbrush goes, the head is pretty soft.  </li>
            <li>As long as it meets the ultimate goal I will learn to love this thing.</li>
            <li>I just wish the toothbrush bristles were more firm.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt fresh as if I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Contacted WaterPic and received a return authorization, but decided not to waste any more time with this company or their products.</li>
            <li>using the pause button, make sure to do two things:  keep the dial set at 3 or below, and press the button firmly.  </li>
            <li>You have to keep the button depressed to keep the water from squirting out and release the button on the water Pik handle to get the water to come out which I believe is CONTRARY, BACKWARD to how things normally work in this world.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Love using it everyday</li>
            <li>Having both in one setup is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>This is a good Product - not a great one.</li>
            <li>Instead, I refill it with a glass of water at the desired temperature (good for one use), and I&#x27;m no longer annoyed.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of starting at the high setting right off the bat and it hurt.  </li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this product for the new design of the waterpik unit.</li>
            <li>And, thanks to a few fillings from a young dentist, many of my teeth are now very sensitive to flossing.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a toothbrush like this in a very long time, and glad to make the switch back.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir is well sized for a complete cleaning, and is easy to fill and empty.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir does not  stay full long!</li>
            <li>I certainly hope this investment pays off at my next check-up; it certainly makes my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>To have the Sonic toothbrush right there at hand is an extra added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Dentist-recommended Sonicare died over the summer, right after a big car and home repair</li>
            <li>After using this for a short time my teeth felt cleaner then right after a dentist visit.</li>
            <li>I can never go back to regular toothbrush and this flosser is perfect since I had such a hard time flossing before.</li>
            <li>I am not Type-A enough to use the different picks, being satisfied with the general purpose pick.</li>
            <li>works great - a little messy to use until  </li>
            <li>I have to drag the entire unit right next to the sink because it doesn&#x27;t stretch out more than a foot or so.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush, my teeth feel like I just left the dentist EVERY single day!</li>
            <li>I needed a new toothbrush since mine died and my dentist has been suggesting a waterpik.</li>
            <li>and you must buy a new tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>This new combo unit is a space saver, and I like the sonic tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>My kids&#x27; orthodontist gives these away to all his new ortho patients.</li>
            <li>and they express mailed me a new one</li>
            <li>I will update with any new insight or information.</li>
            <li>I will update with any new insight or information.</li>
            <li>My brand new toothbrush lasts under 2 weeks, brushing twice, on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After the leak, they sent me out new gaskets and they helped somewhat..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to be without a new one on hand.</li>
            <li>As you might suspect since this is a 3-Waterpik household, I feel like I can&#x27;t live without a Waterpik.</li>
            <li>one thing I don&#x27;t like is the new on / off switch that must be turned rather than toggled as you can not do this one handed....</li>
            <li>How did I ever live without this!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are going to send me a new unit.   </li>
            <li>I want a new unopened item not someone else&#x27;s reject.</li>
            <li>I cant live without this.</li>
            <li>I need a new electric toothbrush as I was having should surgery..</li>
            <li>I would like to return the Toothbrush (without the brush head) of course, and get a new one.</li>
            <li>but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>how did i live without this before?</li>
            <li>A new unit was received and works well.</li>
            <li>I live this system.</li>
            <li>but this product took it to an entirely new level.</li>
            <li>my gums thank me for the new Waterpik.</li>
            <li>It was time to get new ones.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Also, the battery charges wirelessly when you insert it into its little cradle; very cool feature.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is not what I had expected - it has a sonic style movement and my teeth feel as clean as when the dentist has done a cleaning job.  </li>
            <li>So, i expected 2 (am + pm) uses a day will keep it somewhat clean.</li>
            <li>This multi-purpose tool does it all with multiple heads for the waterpik: removes trapped food debris, cleans below the gum line where damaging decay can begin, and the sonic toothbrush finishes with a nice polish.  </li>
            <li>My sonicare brush was slow, this one vibrates FAST, and seems like it will do a better job.  </li>
            <li>After that I simply make sure that the water pick hose is empty when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, especially if your conscious about oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>While the unit is larger than just a toothbrush-only charging unit, it really doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my bathroom counter.   </li>
            <li>Works very well, however, I really think the waterpik flosser start button should have been designed differently.</li>
            <li>The mini gets into all the crevices and behind the teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful compared to other water jets from walmart.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I have limited counter space and only a 2-plug outlet near the bathroom sink so this combination unit seemed ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Superior to all other similar products by a long shot.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, inspite of the &amp;#34;better than sonicare&amp;#34; high and mighty claims on the electric toothbrush, it falls way below par even compared to Oral B Pro-Health Power, hence the product gets a less than 5 star rating (I would still rate the water flosser at 5 stars).</li>
            <li>I have always had problems with flossing using different types of floss; my gums are tightly packed, so there&#x27;s no way I can have a good experience using traditional techniques.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums start the pick on the lowest level as it could take paint of a house on high..  </li>
            <li>I use the high speed and my teeth are sensitive and I have no pain.</li>
            <li>Very professional piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>Works well, but very loud.</li>
            <li>and it is very loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little smaller as a unit which makes it fit better on the limited space of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>My husband and I use the classic jet tip for now, and eventually I will use the pik pocket top once my teeth have been deep cleaned and settle down.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I use the classic jet tip for now, and eventually I will use the pik pocket top once my teeth have been deep cleaned and settle down.  </li>
            <li>Easy to floss quickly on tight teeth.</li>
            <li>Small learning curve to avoid mess, but still gets great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>mouth feels a lot more cleaner using the flosser, although I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep using the electric toothbrush because it hurts my teeth a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wonder, just buy, I am excited to use the other heads as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been the type of person who is regular with brushing and mouth-washing, but struggled to consistently floss.</li>
            <li>the combo of the sonic toothbrush and water flossing is much more thorough than anything I&#x27;ve done in the past.</li>
            <li>It works extremely well, and leaves my mouth feeling much better than it does after a regular use of dental floss.  </li>
            <li>It is small that you are able to travel with.  </li>
            <li>After figuring out the button I wanted to see the thing in action!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Not so sure if power overall is equal to 2 products separately but will purchase for the second home.</li>
            <li>Personally, I would be willing to pay another $25.00 if the product had those upgrades.</li>
            <li>Waterpik&#x27;s sonic toothbrush also comes with two brush heads: a normal one and one for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>the darn thing nearly blew up!</li>
            <li>This product making brushing and flossing an EPIC experience!</li>
            <li>I have never had waterflossers before, and it is possible that i had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li>That was my first venture in powered tooth brushing and not my last.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, you will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time with a water pik, kept putting it off because I didn&#x27;t think it would make any different.  </li>
            <li>I use the first speed setting, which means, to turn the brush off, I need to switch to the second speed.</li>
            <li>After going back to the instructions, it said to work yourself up to the higher settings.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Waterpic and the first one with the tooth brush in the unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i felt the different  the first time i used it  </li>
            <li>but at the beginning i only used it in the first 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All they asked was that I send the first unit back to them using their mailing label.</li>
            <li>It did not work from the first use what to do to get it returned back or change it with another working one?</li>
            <li>At first I feared possible mold build up, but this product is well designed, so mold should not be an issue.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s different tips for different cleanings, different pressure settings, and even a sonic toothbrush because if you&#x27;re going to put this doesn&#x27;t-match-with-most-of-your-bathroom gadget on your sink, it better have a bunch of uses.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not something you should plan on using outside of your sleeping baby&#x27;s or significant others room.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this consistently for the last two months with mouth wash, and let me tell you, the pain is gone.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for that small issue, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>: I figured she&#x27;d be delighted with the gift, especially since it was set to arrive a few weeks before her next cleaning.</li>
            <li>so flossing isn&#x27;t easy and as a result I do it far less than I should.  </li>
            <li>I definitely know that I am getting my teeth and gums as clean as possible from food particles after flossing, brushing and using the waterpik.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, water tank is a little bit small though.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean, other than a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I have bonded retainers on top and bottom following having braces and it&#x27;s tough to clean around them.  </li>
            <li>They said a complete new unit would be shipped and I should receive it within 10 days.</li>
            <li>charges very quickly...and a full brushing of my teeth leaves all three of the green lights still illuminated.  </li>
            <li>Cheap product, mine stopped working after less than eight months.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and takes just a few minutes and your done.</li>
            <li>Some cons: The water pump for the flosser is pretty loud, especially when you turn the pressure up morethan halfway, which is every time for me.</li>
            <li>performs as expected; quick delivery</li>
            <li>The convenience of having the the rechargeable brush and &#x27;power washer&#x27; contained in one unit (with a single plug) is worth the price to me alone.  </li>
            <li>Read a number of reviews prior to purchasing this item; positive &amp; problematic.</li>
            <li>I found that when it&#x27;s at full strength, the water jet can feel a bit sharp and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li>I found that when it&#x27;s at full strength, the water jet can feel a bit sharp and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li>Whats really cool is the toothbrush pauses for a second to let you know its time to move to the next section to complete a 2 min brushing time</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I never actually used a water flosser before and thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be good for me to use</li>
            <li>Why not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new complete unit with the sonic toothbrush is truly COMPLETE.</li>
            <li>Plastic reservoir seems brittle, but has survived several falls; just wish it fit in a place to dry.</li>
            <li>Consider how much you spend each year on the dentist/orthodontist and decide if it&#x27;s worth less visits and cleaner braces to go this route.</li>
            <li>it took longer than i expected to receive my second one, but it worked like a charm and is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is also easier, in general, and in particular it is easier on my hands than wrapping that floss around my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am due for a cleaning after a long period of not being able to afford any, and since getting this system, I have found that my teeth have been looking cleaner and cleaner as I continue to use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If yours is a designer bathroom you perhaps won&#x27;t care for the bright blue and white color scheme, but that&#x27;s the only down side I can see so far.</li>
            <li>water pick reservoir is large enough for my needs...</li>
            <li>The only thing, it is quite large,</li>
            <li>I have always had a lot of dental issues, but my last cleaning at the dentist went great, even though I was past due-</li>
            <li>And no matter how long or thorough I brush, I still don&#x27;t get the same clean feel as with my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but once I got it down I am amazed on how clean my mouth feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>Multiple pressure settings, the highest of which is very strong, to the point that I&#x27;m not sure what it would be used for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As noted, the toothbrush arrives with two different sized heads, but they&#x27;re both standard toothbrush shape and the smaller will work fine for an adult.</li>
            <li>Just be careful using the high settings you can make your gums bleed very quick-like, but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Definitely could wake up a light sleeper in an adjacent room, even with the door closed.</li>
            <li>the lady on the line (or the customer service in general) – she wasn&#x27;t even interested in helping me, and was unapologetic – even my 2 initial emails to their customer service went unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two clear glass parts are detachable for washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The low setting is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>NOTE the brush is loud</li>
            <li>Ill most likely come back to do an update but in the event that I dont you should know that I am very much enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>always feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>It has indicator lights to tell you how charged the battery is, whether 1/3, 2/3 or completely charged, which the Sonicare does not have and which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has indicator lights to tell you how charged the battery is, whether 1/3, 2/3 or completely charged, which the Sonicare does not have and which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is like having a professional cleaning every morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using an antibacterial rinse in the waterpik water for complete dental health program.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s so loud, like a mini jack hammer.</li>
            <li>once again  added  old  fashioned flossing  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 6 months now.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because as an adult I just got braces.  </li>
            <li>I may make it through these two years of adult awkwardness after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care</li>
            <li>2 old items with this all in one,&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>too much stuff, too big on the counter.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who just got braces.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Only real foreseeable issue?</li>
            <li>but by now, a lot of the old Sonicare patents have expired.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve owned the waterpik complete care water flosser and sonic toothbrush for a while now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush is too soft, for me; I&#x27;d like a &#x27;medium&#x27; brush and am trying to find one.</li>
            <li>but once I&#x27;ve seen the complete oral care of course I am going to invest.</li>
            <li>The only setback is that I have to fill the tank after each use, but it lasts the whole time I use it.</li>
            <li>the tips/brushes are soft, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>especially, how much cleaner my mouth feels after I&#x27;ve used the water flosser.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this vs using a regular toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li>It beats flossing the old way 100%.</li>
            <li>But, if you have a wife with a perverse sense of humour who under the guise of being helpful sets up your toothbrush, puts toothpaste on it, but then doesn&#x27;t insert the flosser completely, watch out.</li>
            <li>Real test is next dental appointment.</li>
            <li>Next after a week of using the unit I flossed my teeth to see how much it was removing.  </li>
            <li>A complete dental hygiene unit.</li>
            <li>I called Waterpik and without any problems they are completely taking care of me (and it)</li>
            <li>This far exceeds that old one.</li>
            <li>IS THE WATERPIK COMPLETE CARE SYSTEM LIKE?&lt;br /&gt;(In</li>
            <li>It needs to be near an outlet which should be near the sink that you plan to use this system in.  </li>
            <li>My husband turns his head completely to the side, letting the stream of water run out of the corner of his mouth.  </li>
            <li>so it is ready to go next time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really put up a review sent this back barb</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys this quality double purpose appliance!</li>
            <li>Seems loud when use toothbrush.</li>
            <li>what I know now about teeth I woulda done things a whole lot differently!  </li>
            <li>It is fairly loud.</li>
            <li>enough to travel with whole unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this for myself, but it was commandeered by the 7 year old, who has some issues brushing well.  </li>
            <li>Recently just got braces and the waterprik has been very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a feature where it does 30 second intervals for each four quadrants of the mouth and has two speed settings.</li>
            <li>The reason for knocking out a star is that it is EXTREMELY loud.</li>
            <li>Completely backwards from what it should be.</li>
            <li>I really feel like I need a middle ground.  </li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and never used a waterpik before</li>
            <li>We kept the old one just for a spare water pic.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after using this product vs. a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have had it for about 2 months - no problems so far.</li>
            <li>Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care</li>
            <li>I have been a Waterpik customer for years, and even though by old unit worked well, I decided to replace it with the Waterpik complete care unit.  </li>
            <li>: The toothbrush itself has two settings: one sensitive teeth and non-sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>: The toothbrush can be a bit loud when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but 2nd level seems much stronger for me.</li>
            <li>so much easier than standard tooth brushes....and a quality job.</li>
            <li>this far exceeded my expectations..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Toothbrush: Wow, this toothbrush is fantastic and conveniently times 30 second intervals and shuts off after 2 minutes to ensure you pay proper attention to each area of your mouth and don&#x27;t fall short of your 2 minute brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush is a bit loud</li>
            <li>Complete Care Combination Water Flosser + Sonic Toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;  1 Standard Sonic Toothbrush Head - Gently target hard-to-reach areas</li>
            <li>I am old, the periodontist&#x27;s dental hygienist told me to get on if I wished to save my molars--</li>
            <li>Both work so far</li>
            <li>Really like the double treatment of flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>like I just had them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare had died, so I bought the Waterpik Complete Care.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always struggled with flossing my back teeth that are really close together.</li>
            <li>Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush (WP-900)&lt;br /&gt;I am in awe.</li>
            <li>yes a bit loud but not a jackhammer as described,</li>
            <li>sheesh people are SO sensitive</li>
            <li>I purchased this waterpik complete for myself</li>
            <li>Teeth feel like they were professionally cleaned every day.  </li>
            <li>I have several bridges and it really works well for them.</li>
            <li>Really a complete mouth care system.</li>
            <li>and I told them I am using my Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser .</li>
            <li>My gum health has already improved considerably.</li>
            <li>I replaced a Sonicare toothbrush with the Waterpik Complete care......</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the toothbrush unit on here at all, I prefer regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This will suffice until I get a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their oral care habits, like</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised how this unit worked on plaque, whitened my teeth and cleaned food from between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Her old Waterpik was just the flosser, which she had for years once the pump went out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I cannot emphasize enough how much better/quicker</li>
            <li>I had their old sonic toothbrush and the ultrasonic waterpik...</li>
            <li>I was considering professional teeth whitening before buying.</li>
            <li>I told all of my adult kids they are getting these for Christmas and</li>
            <li>lets start by saying i am 1 22 years old  who decided to give her teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and just had braces put on my teeth.</li>
            <li>CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY.</li>
            <li>I have only had 2 cavities my whole life.</li>
            <li>This has a soft bristle brush and removes all the plaque without the vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found they last very well</li>
            <li>so I ordered the Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Tooth Brush.  </li>
            <li>I just received this item and so far I like the way it works.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for adult daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I recommend it so far.</li>
            <li>And the water flosser , when turned up to &amp;#34;maximum power&amp;#34; becomes obnoxiously loud.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 97 year old father who refused to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>Even my 4 year old loves how it feels on his gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dentist even mentioned to me that my mouth was much healthier than my last visit.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a whole lot of water being sent into your mouth over a short period of time</li>
            <li>Would recommend this complete care to everyone</li>
            <li>It is near imposable to get all of the stuff out between your teeth with floss.  </li>
            <li>is too much money to pay for a device that doesn&#x27;t even last six months.</li>
            <li>, I AM 60 YEARS OLD AND CAN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>It gets under and between very well especially in max setting 9 or 10.  </li>
            <li>Bone loss at extraction made food traps between implants and natural teeth.  </li>
            <li>The one problem I had was that the machine itself is loud.  </li>
            <li>Really loud.  </li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Just wow.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by the toothbrush features.</li>
            <li>It takes a few more minutes because it uses a timer to tell&lt;br /&gt;You when to move to the next quadrant but coffee and tea stains are now gone.</li>
            <li>The product is worth every penny I spent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise on stayed the first few times in lower settings.the first time I use the water</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is nice though the low setting seem a bit too slow.</li>
            <li>The dentist wanted about $7,000 to replace four good teeth with fake ones; this unit solved the problem and I still have my teeth.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush with rechargeable storage base &#x3D;</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered had a missing item (it was from another seller) and was quickly replaced with another one from a different seller.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, heavy duty.</li>
            <li>Now after about 4 months of use i will never go back to a normal tooth brush!</li>
            <li>That, combined with the waterflosser gives you such a complete clean that it becomes quite addictive to use.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to hearing my dentists opinion on the next visit.</li>
            <li>The Sonic Toothbrush is a little too bulky and I&#x27;d have preferred 3 speeds: clean, soft, &amp; Massage, rather than 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>I received the Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care and while the Water Flosser works fine, the Sonic Toothbrush had no charge, so I was not able to try it at all</li>
            <li>Others had less power and were less effective in removing/ preventing plaque.</li>
            <li>The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of my older oral-brush I gave up - but the cleaning action is identical.</li>
            <li>I already have an older model Waterpik (Classique Professional) and recently bought this one for my husband as well as the cordless travel</li>
            <li>The Sonic Toothbrush cannot charge unless we let the light in the bathroom on for a long time, which wastes too much power.</li>
            <li>I dropped by Waterpik and broke it, so  decided to go for this more compact model for my very small bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The change included changing our motors to a high voltage direct current style, reducing the wattage consumption from 34 watts to 14 watts.</li>
            <li>on high it even blasts away old toothpaste left on the sink from six inches away.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get used to using the water flosser if you haven&#x27;t used one before, and honestly, it&#x27;s easy to get the whole bathroom wet with this thing.</li>
            <li>The brush head of the Sonicare also gets really sloppy and the inside of the handle has a well which gets very wet and has to be, with great difficulty, scrubbed out to remove mold buildup.</li>
            <li>I would like to blame it on having messy kids, but even when I use it, there is always a puddle of water on the counter that needs to be wiped clean.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is heavy duty with a lot of vibration and it gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and my mouth has never felt as clean as it does now</li>
            <li>I love the water pick, and the toothbrush is comparable to a Sonicare without being ridiculously pricey.</li>
            <li>I obviously didn&#x27;t look into it enough when I purchased my first electric toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>We are realizing the benefits of thorough dental cleaning, especially now that we are getting older.</li>
            <li>The water flossed removed many small particles of food and debris that were left by brushing.</li>
            <li>it basically does the same thing as the older model--remove whatever food particles are stuck between your teeth.</li>
            <li>My husband and I use this as our main toothbrush and just use different heads</li>
            <li>The other models hold it securely in the middle of the handle, apparently they wanted to save a cent or two in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add  a little mouthwash for a cool tingling was floss.  </li>
            <li>One feature that I like is the little pause as it times the brushing of each quadrant of your mouth and shuts off after a full 2 minute cycle.</li>
            <li>For other buyers just remember to run white vinager through the machine once a month to clean the lines that may cause buildup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only had mine for 35 days and the sonic toothbrush quit on the high gear.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality electric toothbrush, this is definitely not what you want.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to all and especially to those that struggle with gum and peridonist disease.  </li>
            <li>I used the low settingas well as the high setting.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself has two speeds, low and high.</li>
            <li>High power takes some getting used to, perhaps a medium setting for the next model.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>I have found one or two tiny pieces wedged in high up on the tooth, but that is it.  </li>
            <li>I have found one or two tiny pieces wedged in high up on the tooth, but that is it.  </li>
            <li>prefer a mid-speed setting instead of just low and high, but I&#x27;m over</li>
            <li>The toothbrush vibrates and has a high speed or low speed.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this item for those who have difficulty regularly flossing like I do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and wish I had bought one earlier.</li>
            <li>Pressure high enough.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has two settings, a low and a high setting.</li>
            <li>It just fast-streams the water out of the Waterpik regardless of setting, making it a mess to use and emptying the reservoir really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Yes, at first, I will admit getting used to barely on or turbo brush was a little much...</li>
            <li>But, now that i have been using the new toothbrush for about a month i am starting to notice it makes a bit of a different sound, like something is starting to come loose.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t like that, and neither did I because I missed that ultra clean feeling it had given me for the previous 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd unit we purchased is working as advertised, so far no problems with battery life on the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a ton of electronic toothbrushes in the past, and I can comfortably say that this is the finest I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, and the toothbrush holds a charge for a long time, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in all the time.  </li>
            <li>Far worth the extra  money spent.</li>
            <li>I realize now I put it off much too long.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a small separate travel charger  available the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It takes too long and I can never find a floss that I really like.  </li>
            <li>But after giving the water flosser a shot flossing will never be an issue and maybe i can return to normal floss after extensive use of this.</li>
            <li>On the low speed, I would say the power equates to what your normal electric toothbrush would be.</li>
            <li>My sink is tiny and this fits on the corner where soap/lotion normally is.&lt;br /&gt;-Also fits under the mirror/medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Not much setup at all and was ready to go in a minute!</li>
            <li>I only needed the normal dental picks for my cleaning.</li>
            <li>She said I could come back in six months, like a normal person.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at the amount of food particles that came out with water pick after I had brushed and flossed normally.</li>
            <li>But it takes along time to charge 12-24 from dead to full.</li>
            <li>the water flow is not really as strong as i personally expected, and the sound of device is large but acceptable</li>
            <li>The manual and quick-start guides are well written and well illustrated, and in print large enough that it is actually readable.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I put a little Hydrogen Peroxide in the water basin and my teeth are not only smooth but whiter.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think little children could manage it, at least, not without a good deal of help and supervision.</li>
            <li>My main one is that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a medium speed - the low setting is a little too wimpy but the high setting feels like my gums are getting brushed right out of existence</li>
            <li>I finally get a new one not because it broke.</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is quite new to me but it seems to do everything I need and does it well, in as compact a space as possible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what regular floss leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush charges by induction (no contacts to get dirty) and is easily washed clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It was an early birthday present from my Mom, 6 month early.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several weeks now and it has really helped with cleaning my teeth, especially since I just got braces.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik provides you with 4 different irrigation heads and 2 different sizes of toothbrush...there is no place to store the tooth brushes and the whole setup of heads and brushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I paid for a whole set of the water flosser and toothbrush to have the toothbrush be Useless after two weeks of use -</li>
            <li>also the design of the brush touching the base for power is much better as the ring does not get any buildup on the bottom like the Braun did.</li>
            <li>the reservoir is a little small, only good for like 1.5 flossings.</li>
            <li>the instructions say, I close it completely and just open it a little when it gets full of water.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s motor is very loud.</li>
            <li>The water flosser sounds like a very loud machine, and you can hear it throughout the entire house.</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; - if you can call it that - is that the unit is very loud when you are using the water pik part.  </li>
            <li>First off, I cant brush my teeth for any length of time, due to all toothpastes burning my mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month of faithful use, all my numbers showed a 2 to 6 point improvement (if you have gum disease, you know that&#x27;s major).  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is one of the better ones I have used, however the waterflosser is weak.</li>
            <li>No other product is quite like it.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is expected!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely improved from my old Waterpik and electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The price was also a major contributor.  </li>
            <li>I see a lot of customers have this problem; wish I had read the other reviews first.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and no more need to floss.</li>
            <li>I was not able to get this product to clean my teeth as it advertised.</li>
            <li>I wish this were reversed, so that it would normally not spray, and the blue button would make it spray, but unfortunately not.  </li>
            <li>Gum Pockets had decreased down to mostly 1-3 with the six&#x27;s down to mostly fours (a couple of fives).  </li>
            <li>but I had so much food particles in the gum hole that I can never remove with regular tooth brushes, but this waterpik completely removed every single bit of them.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The low speed seems a little &#x27;soft&#x27; to me, but the high speed is a bit much for my teeth to handle.</li>
            <li>It has variable force settings from light to hard.</li>
            <li>I find low to be too low, so I use the high setting.  </li>
            <li>But we generally like it.</li>
            <li>However, the one that I always use is the general cleaning one</li>
            <li>For general cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got 2 general use picks and no tongue piece</li>
            <li>For the first time in history, both my hygienist and my periodontist had absolutely NOTHING negative to say.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to form much of an opinion on its function</li>
            <li>The instructions for use were simple and clear.</li>
            <li>Bought this barely two weeks ago, and the battery already died in the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t even a year old and my husband is the only one to use the toothbrush part and the bottom of the tooth brush just cracked and fell apart.  </li>
            <li>If you should accidentally drop the pick or even loosen your grip, water can go everywhere if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has the two-minute timer function, and ESPECIALLY that it pauses very briefly every 30 seconds to alert you to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>leave you mouth open and near the sink.</li>
            <li>The brush is extremely quiet and soft --making</li>
            <li>The flosser has far exceeded my expectations and rather than flossing only once a day, I now use the waterpik two to three times a day.  </li>
            <li>but I have my husband and 7 year old son using it regularly too!  </li>
            <li>No regrets at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not deviate on the device for the electric power please explain wattage of the device and the second device will ask first&lt;br /&gt;Vaghtkd he was burned because of the increased wattage and I hope the price Mraati Is there a direct shipping to Saudi Arabia</li>
            <li>In effect I am paying shipping and excise duty twice for the same parts which is completely unjustified.</li>
            <li>Apparently there&#x27;s a quality issue.</li>
            <li>I had this on my wish list as my current electric tool brush was over 10 year old</li>
            <li>The cost for this unit complete is on par with a mid line Sonicare and the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Also the water flosser complete the cleaning to show a white smile!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The holder for the waterpik barely grips the bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li>but they just became natural white teeth  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason i am giving it 4 stars not 5  because it claims to be \\&quot;complete care\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a similar Braun product that developed a pinhole leak in the irrigation supply line.    </li>
            <li>I bought this because my dentist recommended it however I barely use it.</li>
            <li>I really love the effect but am tired of this thing not working.  </li>
            <li>but I need it more now than ever because my teeth are in worse shape.  </li>
            <li>I rate their customer service poor and I will not purchase or recommed there products because of their customer service or better lack of.</li>
            <li>all of my life and after a few months of this, everyone keeps telling me that I have the whitest smile they have every seen for someone who wears braces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a longstanding Sonicare user, so I was skeptical whether Waterpik&#x27;s sonic toothbrush was as effective.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>The water pump is noisier than an older one that I also have that is single unit versus one that comes with the Sonic Brush, but it all works</li>
            <li>The pause button on the handle will start sticking in the down position pretty soon.  </li>
            <li>I live in a small apartment where sink space is at a premium -- I think this device is worth it, but be warned prior to making the investment.</li>
            <li>Unfornately, I am from EU, so returning will be more expensive than another new Water Flosser</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed with keeping my teeth clean, so I was a little leery about this combo living up to the hype; but, I have to say, I LOVE both the flosser and the toothbrush</li>
            <li>The less expensive unit with just the toothbrush and a charger stand works great.  </li>
            <li>I put mouthwash in the waterpick side because I struggle with soft enamel, sensitive teeth and dry mouth.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the vibrations tends to tickle, not sure if they can do anything about that, Another great thing about this toothbrush is that it gives 30 sec timer that briefly pauses to let you move on to the next quadrant ensuring you get the whole two minutes of brush</li>
            <li>You still have to move the head up and down left and right</li>
            <li>You still have to move the head up and down left and right</li>
            <li>The only draw back is the waterpik is very loud.</li>
            <li>I had a very old one (no tooth brush, only 4 tips ) and it last for years.</li>
            <li>and I really find that because of the smaller size and reduced back and forth motion I have to do, that it is easier to clean those hard to get parts in the back of my mouth, mostly because I&#x27;m not stabbing those fleshy round parts behind you last molars.</li>
            <li>did we live without one for so long.  </li>
            <li>it requires a 24 hour charge before use (pretty typical for any re-chargeable device these days)</li>
            <li>The first one blew a chip on the motherboard after less than a months use.</li>
            <li>This works so much better than any of the other power tooth brushes I have used in the past</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is hard to understand at first, mainly because it has a 2min timer and shuts off.</li>
            <li>Also there are three bright green LED on the toothbrush and at night they shine bright which I personally find very annoying.  </li>
            <li>The WP-900 was crazy easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I really like this unit.</li>
            <li>Yes, I made a mess the first day shooting water all over the mirror.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to describe the feeling, but the ultrasonic vibration makes my teeth feel as clean as after a dental hygiene cleaning session.  </li>
            <li>Even while using the pause button I first made a mess.</li>
            <li>The design covers the obvious easy-use buttons and controls, but also has the thoughtful additions of vented storage space for the brushes and irrigator tips, and the little flat spot on the back of the toothbrush handle so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the counter to crash on the floor.  </li>
            <li>Other brands are cheaper and you can get replacements for them from Sam&#x27;s Club much cheaper than Waterpik, which I found out after I bought this unit.  </li>
            <li>Functional, but clumsy to clean &amp; dust</li>
            <li>Found the water pik so messy as to not be worth using, but that&#x27;s a personal choice, not an issue with the product.</li>
            <li>the container holds just the right amount of water so that you can get to all of the spaces in your mouth before it runs out and the charge for the toothbrush last for a little over a week.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it has two different speeds, and sometimes I use the lower speed, other times the higher speed.  </li>
            <li>After that major accomplishment, I upgraded from a basic Waterpik to this combo unit with a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is k I n da rough on high setting.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to set the flosser too high because it will hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  </li>
            <li>but the rest seems pointless, it doesn&#x27;t clean anything deep but just a simple wash off.</li>
            <li>I am so OCD about my teeth and will be even more so now but with less trouble!</li>
            <li>The insertion fittings of the Jet Tips of the WP-900 water flosser, compared to those of the Jet Tips for the cheaper WP-60W, are much higher quality, which means that the Jet Tips leak less and last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The insertion fittings of the Jet Tips of the WP-900 water flosser, compared to those of the Jet Tips for the cheaper WP-60W, are much higher quality, which means that the Jet Tips leak less and last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for morning usage if employed, unless you&#x27;re willing to wake up either an hour or half hour earlier to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Had a Phillips brand toothbrush only and my dentist suggested  that I consider a water floss system in general and Waterpik by name.</li>
            <li>The flosser comes with several attachments that range from general cleaning to specialized attachments made for those with braces.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that is it a bit big and doesn&#x27;t quite fit in my bathroom, but I should have guessed that before hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Completely enclosed/waterproof brush - Charges brush with no cables; it charges just being next to the unit (in the holder).&lt;br /&gt;-Rubber feet keep unit in-place and will fit on very small surfaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets clean the hard to reach places deep between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you have braces or hard to clean teeth, then this is your only choice.</li>
            <li>The water flosser was kind of disappointing, maybe I just expected to much?  </li>
            <li>An appliance repairman who kept my old one running as long as he could told me that his customers all try to keep their &amp;#34;little cutie&amp;#34; running:  </li>
            <li>effectively eliminates that  nasty morning breath when used properly the night before,  keeps gums healthy and polishes teeth to their brightest.  </li>
            <li>the first product sent to me stopped charging a few weeks in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a fanatic for keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended using the flosser with LIsterine, but I started with just plain water at first.</li>
            <li>Because my mouth no longer opens very wide, this tool is very helpful in reaching the back teeth vs a traditional or electronic flosser.  </li>
            <li>Takes up less room and is much stronger.  </li>
            <li>Also the tank does empty a little quick</li>
            <li>The handle of the toothbrush gets very slippery when toothpaste inevitably works its way out of your mouth and trickles down the handle.</li>
            <li>The pic works extremely well, dislodging all manner of stuff trapped between the teeth, and the brush makes my teeth feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little large on our counter</li>
            <li>If you live with someone who is a light sleeper, be wary of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent an afternoon whining to my friends about the only excitement in my life being my new Waterpik system.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am actually looking forward to seeing my dental hygeinist to see how much (or hopefully less) scraping</li>
            <li>Waterpic flosser is easy to use and leaves your teeth and gums free of annoying food particles that can get caught between teeth.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tested a single water flosser attachment</li>
            <li>Both do make a little noise, but they certainly are quieter than earlier models.  </li>
            <li>This is also very santitary and takes little space on the counter.</li>
            <li>My last dentist checkup went very well and had little plaque.  </li>
            <li>Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
            <li>When looking at the Amazon reviews I divided the bad reviews by the good ones.</li>

            <li> Just had my dental check up and have been using my pik, brushing and flossing morning and night and the hygienist said my teeth were really good.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Good ，High performance price ratio，Feel good</li>
            <li> i loved this product and my boyfriend gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> The pressure is good.  </li>
            <li> If you looking for good water pick made in good ol US, you will have problem.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago when I purchased this unit , they claimed that this unit pic was made in states with good warrantee.  </li>
            <li> the good.</li>
            <li> Good pressure..</li>
            <li> Really good unit.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> We three have used it for a year and it works good.  </li>
            <li> Again, who knows if it is an improvement over good ol&#x27; flossing.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these units for myself and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, she loved the convenience of having both unit in one.</li>
            <li> However, he did agree my teeth and gums are in good shape.</li>
            <li> i never imagined that it would be so good.</li>
            <li> I figured I was getting a good deal.)</li>
            <li> so I have no idea whether or not the toothbrush is all that good or not.</li>
            <li> The product until it was fully functional was great and effective.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> Good for home use .</li>
            <li> This product looks good.</li>
            <li> Tested and the power of the jet is good and also the speed of the brush.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again with the sonic brush as it does not do a good job of cleaning my teeth, so I use my Philips Soniccare brush to brush with.  </li>
            <li> Good Price.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> so that was good.  </li>
            <li> All good things, but that&#x27;s where it winds down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is quite good.</li>
            <li> Quality wise</li>
            <li> This should NOT replace good flossing habits.</li>
            <li> good product, but it needs stowage for the brushes</li>
            <li> I did not notice that the toothbrush was not as good until about a month after I got it.</li>
            <li> Good 2-in-1 oral care.</li>
            <li> Keeps me focused on getting a good brushing</li>
            <li> This is a really nice unit, and the sonic toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li> I went for a dental check up on Thursday and the dentist did mention I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The merchandise arrived in good shape in a timely fashon.</li>
            <li> We tested it out and it works good.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really good quality too.</li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush works great and completes the cleaning process nicely.</li>

            <li> Works good.  </li>
            <li> It is a good feeling knowing that that this machine works.</li>
            <li> anyway, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Works well and comes with a good selction of tips.  </li>
            <li> Good power.</li>

            <li> loved mine</li>
            <li> Good deal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my unit and depended on it to get my teeth their cleanest.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good at cleaning and now i&#x27;m fond of brushing my teeth..</li>
            <li> its good and multi choice for cleaning tooth</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good to have the tooth brush incorporated.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy</li>
            <li> Good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I believe this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> works good just what we needed</li>
            <li> but I was taken aback by how good this is.</li>
            <li> Does a really good job and everything stores inside the storage compartment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for teeth care!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> cause it doesnt rotate, but that is the good of it because the vibration and manual work takes care of the nastiest stains (ie coffee he drinks by the gallon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause it doesnt rotate, but that is the good of it because the vibration and manual work takes care of the nastiest stains (ie coffee he drinks by the gallon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Shame, I really loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good unit for the money.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> A must-have for good dental care.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This unit looked like a good idea.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The sonic toothbrush that is integrated works good too.</li>
            <li> Since I have implants, it&#x27;s a good idea to use a waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Use this twice a day for just two weeks (with a good baking soda/peroxide toothpaste), and my teeth were shades whiter.</li>
            <li> this is good for a touch up.</li>
            <li> I would say that the tooth brush works just as good as my Sonicare as well.</li>
            <li> it has a lot of good reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Price is good for what you get.</li>
            <li> The sonic brush is as good as the Sonicare I was using.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a sonic toothbrush anf came across the waterpik sonic toothbrush plus water flosser and thought I might as well try it because the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> good customer service and a good product; i have no problems recommending this to anyone scared of the price tag.</li>
            <li> , you are on the road to good gum health.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my impression is that this sonic toothbrush and water flosser pair work fairly well.  </li>
            <li> After the meal is good for removing plaque.</li>
            <li> Dentist told me to stay away from flossing under my bridge and showed me an air cleaner that shoots air through, did not like it and didn&#x27;t  seem to work good</li>
            <li> Wall mounting model might be a good idea too.</li>

            <li> I decided to try this since I wanted a good quality electric toothbrush as well as a water flosser.</li>
            <li> size is fairly compact for the 2 items in one unless you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space</li>
            <li> good pressure with the waterpik as well.</li>
            <li> Compact, good quality, good price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very handy having the water pic and tooth brush in one handy unit.  </li>

            <li> Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been a SonicCare toothbrush user, but I honestly think this toothbrush does just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Got new braces and needed both the toothbrush and water pic, this set is perfect and great value.</li>

            <li> Happy clean teeth!</li>
            <li> The flossing pik is very effective and my teeth feel very clean after using it.</li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> First time using a Waterpik - both my Dentist and myself are very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> And one more thing, also a travel case for the brush!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This was pretty awesome to find both a toothbrush and water pic in one product.</li>
            <li> got it for the wife and daughter, they love it!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never looked or felt better!  </li>
            <li> That is one reason I want to advocate it for others by giving it 5 STARS, but also want to note for Water Pik that they need to design a better handle holder to hold the waterpik apparatus!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush and flossed for about a year now and love it!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this unit!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they ARE working together to improve my dental health!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a week and love it!  </li>
            <li> Also, my dentist mentioned a &amp;#34;water flosser&amp;#34; and I think I thought this might be more pleasant than flossing my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tooth care product was easy to use and it does a great job of cleaning between my implants and crowns.  </li>
            <li> The waterpik is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If I would have known that a waterpik was so easy to use and would make my teeth and gums feel so great</li>
            <li> The Pik is easy to use but a bit noisy but it seems to do a great job of cleaning out the spaces between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
            <li> Great to have both tools in one place and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has strong water pressure that is adjustable, and the toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are strong, but i still feel like it does a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush speaking husband says is great works just fine for him.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush speaking husband says is great works just fine for him.</li>

            <li> I love this unit, my teeth get an awesome clean  with the tooth brush and my gums get a great clean with the water flosser.  </li>

            <li> Amazing pik.</li>
            <li> Amazing tooth brush.</li>

            <li> This waterpik is amazing.  </li>
            <li> OMG this this is amazing ....</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for keeping your teeth free of yesterday&#x27;s meals.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is an Amazing Company as well....  </li>
            <li> It does an amazing job at cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing after using it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, &amp; great value.</li>
            <li> Then you can blast your gums with the handy dandy sprayer which also does an amazing job of cleaning the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective but can&#x27;t complain at this price point.</li>
            <li> so well my wife wanted her own.</li>
            <li> But still worthwhile, as a good transformer is around $40 from China.</li>
            <li> My dentist liked it as well</li>
            <li> Cleans between teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li> Plus now that it is winter, I&#x27;d have to wait for the warm water to come up the tap, which again just feels so wasteful to me.</li>
            <li> After 15 years of using Braun, I&#x27;ve decided this is as good or better.</li>
            <li> Having the toothbrush and water pik together in one device is handy and makes sense.</li>
            <li> Great product, as expected: good quality and excellent for teeth</li>
            <li> A Quality and effective dental products that everyone should have</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m enthusiastic that it will go well.  </li>
            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush seems particularly effective.</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews,thewaterpik WP  </li>
            <li> I had to buy her one of her own.  </li>
            <li> The water container is a nice size for someone who is vegetarian, and eats a lot of seeds, nuts, and greens.</li>
            <li> so nice to have both items in oe unit ...</li>
            <li> It really does an excellent job I use it with the pocketpik attachment  </li>
            <li> I was a sceptic about this kind of thing, but my gums are healthier, my teeth whiter</li>
            <li> It takes up some room on the counter but it looks nice still</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how effective the waterpic is.  </li>
            <li> I really, really liked this toothbrush as it cleaned so well.</li>
            <li> I guess it kind of pricey</li>
            <li> You rinse it and fill it with warm water.  </li>
            <li> We each have our own method of use.  </li>
            <li> I love the water pic and already have a good electric brush.</li>
            <li> And the Waterpik is really nice too.</li>
            <li> We own it for over a year and it still works.</li>
            <li> Nice travel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so adept at handling the waterpik part for flossing.</li>
            <li> Size good for counter top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an effective waterpik and sonic toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t always have time to wait for it to warm up to use it.  </li>
            <li> really nice sonic toothbrush and both</li>
            <li> Such a great buy and works incredibly well!</li>
            <li> I had a waterpik flosser before that I liked.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this combo with both the water pik and the electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of nice because the toothbrush has a two minute timer on it and pauses every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, all-in-one.</li>
            <li> I did not know that  a brush can be that effective in cleansing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The storage area for tips is nice and the water canister holds plenty of water without needing to refill it.</li>
            <li> and it gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> Well, it is quite nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;s nice to have them together</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so nice</li>
            <li> : Is nice to have waterpik and toothbrush in one unit.</li>
            <li> Why will the customer bear the price of this kind of a mistake in shipping?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li> A nice, compact unit.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this years ago, The tooth brush is really nice too.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say this thing has changed my life.</li>
            <li> but I am loving how my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> Nice to have one machine talking up space rather than two.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice combination flosser/toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really nice also - two speeds and a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> Not only does the 2 in 1 design save space, the toothbrush is awesome, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Honestly feel like I have gone through an awakening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik flosser before, but I forgot just how effective they are at removing debris in between teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The results are astounding, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice compact unit.</li>
            <li> I have never had a toothbrush that is so effective.  </li>
            <li> The water spray feature cleans the crevices around the teeth effectively and reduces gum irritation.</li>
            <li> The pulse cleaning pressure is good, and better than competing brands I have tried, in flushing particles at the gum tooth interface.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as sonicare but way better price.</li>
            <li> My dentist is thrilled.</li>
            <li> The water floss function is really effective.</li>
            <li> I also put a capful of mouthwash in the water container, and I also use warm water.</li>
            <li> nice thing.</li>
            <li> and they were so incredibly nice and helpful.  </li>
            <li> I guess if it worked it would be nice.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving this thing</li>
            <li> Nice unit.</li>
            <li> The sonic brush is awesome and more powerful than the Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> And the Water Pik is really nice too.</li>
            <li> The travel case is also nice &amp; sturdy.</li>
            <li> works nicely, but a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have an all in one waterpik and sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Came in nice packaging; items were well protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m over it, and it gets the job done effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have all dental appliances in one to save space and stuff falling off shelf.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping excellent product!</li>
            <li> My dentist has smiled after my routine visits ever since I acquired this Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> If it is as durable as it is effective, it will be a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water flosser is great too, very powerful and effective at reducing gum inflammation.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and is super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Both the flosses and toothbrush are great and it&#x27;s worth it to buy!</li>
            <li> Very good teeth waterline used, and the price is very appropriate, very affordable</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say flossing would be fun!!!</li>
            <li> but my mouth is so FRESH!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever I don&#x27;t usually like to floss so this is great!</li>
            <li> What is great is this one I don&#x27;t have to fill up three times to clean my teeth(one shot)</li>
            <li> My mouth feels really clean after each use and the quadrant timer on the toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li> Feels great to have clean teeth again.</li>
            <li> This is great, my teeth are clean and sparkling.  </li>

            <li> Great clean feeling every morning and night</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on Amazon and took note of the problems people had, but the high ratings were encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;After a month with the product, I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased except the flossing tool should better store on the unit.</li>
            <li> They both keep my teeth so clean!!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Waterpik WP-900 Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to have the combination of brush and waterpik, which reduces clutter on the bathroom sink and is much more cost effective than buying two separate units.</li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 gizmo solved the problem splendidly and economically.</li>
            <li> She actually said &amp;#34;your at home care has done a 360, keep up the good work!&amp;#34; Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Just a great, quick cleaning</li>
            <li> what a wonderful device, after brushing I use the waterpick it leaves your mouth super clean and refreshed</li>

            <li> the more i used it the more i saw good results  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this company or this very excellent product.</li>
            <li> When we called the company with the issues they responded immediately and were very easy to deal with .    </li>
            <li> The waterpik is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use-</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I bought it from Amazon, which made it very easy to return.</li>

            <li> Very affordable and a very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Very good product, fast deliver.</li>
            <li> It is not replaceable, although some handy people (who know how to solder) are able to replace it.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot tell if this brush is any better than the oralB or the philips sonic</li>
            <li> Got this for husband who had Oral B brand previously-He liked this set up better</li>
            <li> This by far is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> she wasn&#x27;t thrilled because I have now fallen in love with brushing my teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and sonic toothbrush, it is nice to have both items in one compact appliance.</li>
            <li> I liked the toothbrush ok, but after I got rid of this thing and bought one from the industry leader</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this system so far.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this system so far.  </li>
            <li> PS- Brushing before the pik seems to be more effective for me as well as filling it after each use</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This produce helps produce a great smile.</li>
            <li> I have to use warm water if I wanna use that part and be able to tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Waterpik Complete.</li>
            <li> Great fresh feeling</li>
            <li> Impressed so far.</li>
            <li> My dentist says my gums &amp; teeth look great which means it was worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Great product; worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best price on Amazon by far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use but it took some practice to not get water all over myself and the bathroom!</li>
            <li> This Waterpik does the job and so easily!</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and works like a charm!  </li>

            <li> Great product, only need to use power setting at 3-4 (out of 10), to get a great cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> the unit is attractive and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> It is by far a great Waterpik and the toothbrush is every bit as good as sonic is for cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this complete care by Sonic, this is the best dental care system I have ever used.</li>
            <li> it is good work to clean the tooth pitch.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combination of a simple yet effective electric toothbrush and water pick.</li>
            <li> Works good never thought my teeth could feel so clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for her to use and I feel better knowing that the brush is doing the work for her rather than her doing it manually.</li>
            <li> My husband has enjoyed using the Waterpik.  Very easy and thoroughly cleans.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with one Major flaw.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and your teeth and gums will love you for purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Use it every day and first time using a water flosser and it is great.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described.</li>

            <li> Fine product - just wish we had ordered sooner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to use, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> so my at-home care is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> It feels like I get a great clean and it is incredible simple.</li>
            <li> NOTE the water does run quickly so you may have to fill it twice for a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Excellent choices of water pik heads, that fit better than an older model</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and good quality</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is easy to use and effective.</li>

            <li> 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> To brush is ok.</li>
            <li> and we love how it works.</li>
            <li> They should come up with a better solution to this issue.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look so much better since using this waterpik.</li>
            <li> I love have the toothbrush and water flosser together in one unit.</li>
            <li> Am hoping to have better luck with a model that has a pause switch instead of a button.</li>
            <li> I order this from amazon for about 100$ and after just about a week of use im in love.  </li>
            <li> AND LOVE</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure my dentist will be pleased</li>
            <li> and so will my gums :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know of any comparable sonic toothbrushes to say if it&#x27;s better than the rest - while it&#x27;s still better and quicker than manual brushes.  </li>
            <li> Love it -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The highest setting is very forceful and of great use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend to everyone who would like healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Waterpik&#x27;s ad copy on their website and on Amazon claims that the Sonic is much better than the Philips Sonicare, which is the brand I have used for over a decade in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love the design of the separate, lidded compartments for the water reservoir and one that holds the water-flosser heads and the head of the Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The pause buttons on the Waterpik water flosser and the Sonic electric toothbrush both work much better than those on the Model WP-60W Waterpik and the Sonicare electric</li>
            <li> could not be more satisfied with this product, and I recommend it without reservation.em with the handle of the Sonic.</li>
            <li> I love the design of the separate, lidded compartments for the water reservoir and one that holds the water-flosser heads and the head of the Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The pause buttons on the Waterpik water flosser and the Sonic electric toothbrush both work much better than those on the Model WP-60W Waterpik and the Sonicare electric</li>
            <li> could not be more satisfied with this product, and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Multiple adjustments for water pressure makes it easier to choose the setting that is best for your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how precise it works with cleaning my mouth.</li>
            <li> I love the built in timer on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 with Diabetes 2 &amp; my dentist recommended investing in a waterpik to keep gums healthy.</li>
            <li> love the built in toothbrush.</li>
            <li> is what I love about this</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush also</li>
            <li> so I thought what better way than to use a Waterpik .</li>
            <li> I find that my gums were not  as  healthy using  the  water pik alone for flossing, so  </li>
            <li> Love having both dental care products together.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> If I would&#x27;ve known better I would have bought just the waterpik without the brush, but</li>
            <li> I love this combo by Waterpick</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> A better deal than buying both separately.  </li>
            <li> There portable one Piks my teeth better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Water Flosser is something coarsely, nut Sonic Toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush alone cost more then buying this combo unit.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love my waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY want to give this five stars as I LOVE the results, teeth feel great</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> The sonic brush works as well or better than my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> Purchased another for my son and grand children.</li>
            <li> Deserves way more.</li>
            <li> Fits on my sink better then having separate items to use.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> The pieces snap on with a satisfying click.</li>
            <li> I love the water pik.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to use manufacturer&#x27;s discounts online yet, but have not called about that either.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always been just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; at brushing their teeth, so they needed to floss more and this thing seems to keep them motivated to do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> I love having tooth brush and water flosser all in one.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS WATERPIK AND THE SONIC TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> It makes you want to brush your teeth more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> and we both  love it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist  for a more thorough flossing/cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Still love it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt better in my life.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare before and this is way better.</li>
            <li> Great product cleans mouth fully but gently</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love my Waterpik.</li>
            <li> While I can feel what/where I&#x27;m flossing, I prefer to be able to see my teeth and gums during it--to ensure I don&#x27;t miss anything.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I love that you get a carrying case</li>
            <li> We have really enjoyed our waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61, and many times over the years, my dentist has recommended a &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; as I have some gum recision.  </li>
            <li> so glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> had firmer bristles and felt like it worked better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> Love the 2 levels of power on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Dentist office recommended that I purchase this..  I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Better than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Vibrates 2x more.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel much better after using.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better than any electric toothbrush I have owned.</li>
            <li> Love the water pik also.</li>
            <li> Glad I  bought this product with both the pick and brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth  feel better after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> OMG, I am so glad I made this investment.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The various floss options are great!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this one after reading the reviews, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I am sure it was because of the water pick.</li>
            <li> His dentist even commented about his healthy oral care during his February visit.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> So leaning into the mirror, I aimed the head every so precisely, released the button on the wand...and....WATER PARK IN THE BATHROOM!  </li>
            <li> it helps:)</li>
            <li> I also find the water pic does a much better job than &#x27;convential&#x27; flossing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> it does better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion:  It&#x27;s a great set up that takes up just as much counter space as it looks like in the picture.  </li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t floss as often as they should this may be even better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the timer effect on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The SC brush is lightyears better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose the brush as well as the flosser in one unit.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> (Hygienist did say that i should floss more...</li>
            <li> Outstanding customer service from Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> But was surprisedly pleased by the sonacare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you first use the flosser, I find that it is best to brush our teeth first.</li>
            <li> sure that the toothbrush is in your mouth before turning it on.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with it and nervous to switch to the Waterpik version.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe what a difference for the better the Waterpik flosser and the sonic toothbrush make.</li>
            <li> Works much better than Phillips Sonic brand</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth really look great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the attachment for braces because it cleans in all of the spaces around the braces and helps me to get the food out of my teeth.</li>

            <li> I love it and would recommend it to any friend.</li>

            <li> I would recommend to WaterPic to put a variable speed control on the toothbrush so you can precisely dial-in your own preference.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works well, and my mouth, teeth and gums definately feel better since using the water-pic and sonic toothbrush combination.</li>
            <li> so make sure you have a place for it.</li>
            <li> I love the water pik.  </li>
            <li> AND MORE..</li>
            <li> Love both the toothbrush and the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I can be anal with dental hygiene and just knowing that I&#x27;m being proactive in my dental care makes me feel a lot more confident that I&#x27;m doing everything I can against tooth decay and gum disease.</li>
            <li> The last dental visit was greatest checkup - no plaque....</li>
            <li> I think there could be a better longer cord design for the water flosser.  </li>
            <li> the famous words of The Doctor... &amp;#34;Water is patient, Adelaide.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is a 2-in-1.</li>
            <li> It beats the flossing with a thread and it is much better for your teeth and gums to brush with this sonic toothbrush vs manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this unit.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I went from gum disease to healthy gums between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My hygienists and I love this combination and recommend it to all of our patients.</li>
            <li> I love it and will tell my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> We love the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone, I feel it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the timer feature on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and love it.  </li>
            <li> The sonic motion of the toothbrush sometimes helps break free congestion in my sinus as I brush and the adjustable rate of the waterpik was nice after periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li> has thanked me more for it than</li>
            <li> , you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> I love it and will be getting one for my husband for Christmas.</li>
            <li> And my teeth look better too.</li>
            <li> I love the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Have one, buying two more for my sons.</li>
            <li> she asked if I had gotten gum contouring done :).  </li>
            <li> (Expect to get water all over you and your bathroom until you get the hang of using the waterpik :))</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I checked my local stores before purchasing here, and this was the best price.</li>
            <li> and I love not having to wait for it to charge.</li>
            <li> Love the combo of irrigater and sonic toothbrush in one.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist and he told me my gums needed to be cared for better and suggested I get a vibrating toothbrush and water pick.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say this, but I&#x27;m actually enjoying flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this water flosser and sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge longer than most.</li>
            <li> I like the brush design on this more</li>
            <li> I love having the toothbrush and waterpick in one.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with portable,  rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My gums are in much better shape than they were three months ago.  </li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> I know for a fact that Braun is better.</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li> And the stains are mostly gone (not even the dentist cleaning was able in one time to get rid of those stains in 2 teeth.</li>

            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> the toothbrush has 2 speed which I like the faster one as it cleans better.  </li>
            <li> Love it  but  takes up  a lot of  room  </li>
            <li> I love my sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Having both the tooth brush and water flosser together makes it more compack.</li>
            <li> I love that there are the two things together, the brush and the waterflosser.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush is different and would have been perfect with a sanitizer package.</li>
            <li> Love brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li> The battery takes 24 hours or more to fully charg .</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC set!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this feature.</li>

            <li> I love having the toothbrush and waterpik together.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy some more product like this one.</li>
            <li> And my family is satisfied too.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me my teeth and gums are so much better with use of this flosser and toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It gets everything out, better then floss.  </li>
            <li> And I love the electric toothbrush....</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love my waterpik and the tooth brush that comes with</li>
            <li> Great product and makes my mouth feel super clean</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for over 5 years and I like the Waterpik much more.</li>
            <li> overall just overwhelmingly great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about keeping the gums healthy so that the teeth will be healthy.</li>
            <li> Even better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Works better than brushing</li>
            <li> Love the poser of brush and water jpic.  </li>

            <li> im going to order my husband one :)</li>

            <li> Many pros, works well, cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave many choices for toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad had a found this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do my best to reply as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This replaced my Hydro Floss and I am so pleased with the performance of the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Love the water flosser and sonic toothbrush combo.</li>
            <li> Love it, won&#x27;t ever switch from Waterpik now that I&#x27;ve tried them.</li>
            <li> This device does all and more than described...</li>
            <li> I would rate this product with the highest rating available!</li>
            <li> So much better than flossing.</li>
            <li> It allows me to better control the tarter I am prone to.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use a water pic for better gum health.</li>
            <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t get a better tool for cleaner, healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> Waterpik makes models with more bells and whistles, but this model contains everything you need in a water flosser.</li>
            <li> I like doing things by hand more.</li>
            <li> hand floss is better.</li>
            <li> I love my Waterpik (plus</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Wife and kids love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t the tubing that attaches the waterpik to the unit be more flexible and/or stretchy?</li>
            <li> ab bit more care  almost 6 months ago&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love it because it can reach my wisdom</li>
            <li> i would love if they offer the attachments&#x27; replacements on stores where they sell there water flosser like walmart n target  </li>
            <li> I am now in the habit of better care of teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Better to use in in pj&#x27;s then get dressed, just to be safe.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better than the rotating brush generation of  tooth brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We loved the Waterpik, it cleaned great, however it only lasted 2 months.  </li>
            <li> More junk from China.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;very safe delivery</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and def recommend for daily dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I love the mechanics of this product...</li>
            <li> AND IT FEELS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> Really love the toothbrush, but the waterpik side broke just after the return date expired.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> my gums do for sure.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> We have not gotten used to the toothbrush and still use manual brushes :)</li>
            <li> l was able to return through Amazon and get a refund.</li>
            <li> love this product, i received 2 by mistake</li>
            <li> so we both love the way our teeth and mouth feel after we finish</li>
            <li> I always was a flosser, but have been pleased to find that Waterpik gets rid of particles which even flossing and brushing don&#x27;t seem to remove.  </li>
            <li> I love the value with this 2-in-1 solution.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the cord (thus the four stars instead of 5)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THS THING</li>
            <li> Overall this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Last checkup went great!</li>
            <li> Better than the one the Dentist asked me to buy.</li>
            <li> She was completely pleased with both the brush and the flossing attachment.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> all is ok.</li>
            <li> I have had this appliance for some time now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Love using it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it if you are looking for something to maintain your oral health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a much better brusher and water flosser than I ever was a thread flosser.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I am sure.  </li>
            <li> would buy another love it</li>
            <li> I love it because it cleanses my gums as well.</li>
            <li> With the water flosser it takes care of both those problems plus I find it to be rather refreshing.</li>
            <li> do wish the toothbrush heads were made of a more &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my teeth feels.  </li>
            <li> I checked electricity and from my side every thing is  ok</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I had an electric toothbrush (LOVE) and a separate Waterpik (Love).  </li>
            <li> Highly satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Love this waterpik because it has both water flosser and sonic brush in one unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to report that it does, and now I&#x27;m going to use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I just love it and also my wife:-)</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> and we love.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it , meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this set.  </li>
            <li> With the proper  attachments this is the best dental product!</li>
            <li> I brush &amp; floss more now than ever.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love the carry case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can also see where the sonic toothbrush will be gentler on the teeth while offering a better cleaning over manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to have the jet tip in your mouth and be over a sink when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because eventually you will be needing to replace many parts, I still would have bought it</li>
            <li> I love it for cleaning around my gumline.</li>
            <li> I love the pick.can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I Love this</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> awesome..it really does a great job on my teeth..</li>
            <li> I have so many dental implants, and it helps a lot clenning all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much of a difference a water flosser and good electric toothbrush can make.</li>
            <li> if you have more than one person using it you must buy additional brushes and tips.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and are now used as well will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> the more you the easier it is to use.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> Man, you better buy it.</li>
            <li> did find the replacement brushes are better though.  </li>
            <li> I literally drive to work in the morning running my tongue over my teeth marveling in how amazingly smooth and polished they feel!</li>
            <li> I love the electric toothbrush, along with the water pik.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WATERPIC</li>
            <li> is even better.</li>
            <li> Love it don&#x27;t know how I lived</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself also seems more sturdy than the SoniCare -</li>
            <li> I got much better force with my sink-attaching one.</li>
            <li> I had many implants done and flossing was not getting food particles out until I used this pik.</li>
            <li> I felt like it was doing an OK job but</li>
            <li> I love the Sonic tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> and it feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great investment, I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> It more than serves the purpose for both of us.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel after I use the water flosser, I have tried almost all the attachments.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this for maintaining healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love it and enjoying it</li>
            <li> My son and daughter love it.</li>
            <li> Also, the water flosser is the most ingenious hygienic invention ever.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just wish toothbrush has more accessories.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggested it and just love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoying this now I am looking for a travel version wit h110 and 220 electrical options</li>
            <li> Works better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> but other wise this is a great deal if you are looking to get a water pix, why not get an amazing toothbrush with it.</li>
            <li> and it is performing beautifully, couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> but now he always wants to use mine because its better!!  </li>
            <li> Also, the LEDs on the toothbrush are very handy to determine how much charge is remaining on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very nice experience, to protect my teeth very well</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has two settings and the higher setting really does an awesome job - the most thorough brushing job I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush and charger built makes this system handy and user friendly.</li>
            <li> I returned this, because it doesn&#x27;t have some of the features I liked about the original.  </li>
            <li> When I needed to replace my Waterpik, I was excited to see this cost effective combination.  </li>
            <li> nice unit,feels dentist clean, ever time.</li>
            <li> Very effective for maintaining clean teeth and fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Great product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The high speed does a great job of  massaging the gums.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and great value for the flosser as well as the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great high powered cleaning of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love using it to clean the sink!</li>
            <li> I feel very clean after I finish using it every morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a portable flosser and toothbrush to use in our RV, but after 10 days my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel very clean.</li>
            <li> This thing gets so much stuff out of my mouth, even after brushing, its amazing!</li>
            <li> Also great for cleaning teeth after eating food that gets stuck between teeth, where you would normally use a toothpick.</li>
            <li> Loved this when we first received it.  </li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good return on investment.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Best investment we have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first got it, but it has two speeds and the fastest one has quit working.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews emphasize, the functionality of this device is just awesome -- the water flosser works great and reliably, the toothbrush and accompanying attachments are top notch, and the battery life is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if they had included two full size tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> No bad breath and my Hygienic gave me an amazing A+ on my cleaning.</li>
            <li> Best purchase i have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I loved it for the first week</li>
            <li> Bought this the end of Nov 2014 and loved it at first.</li>
            <li> Its a useful!!</li>
            <li> Had no idea that the new ones were so well made, attractive and,</li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush seems to be doing a great job as well, certainly better than my old mechanically-rotating electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how easy it will clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve been able to share the unit easily by swapping out attachments.</li>
            <li> I am taking much better care of my teeth because this is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it, so easy to keep your mouth hygiene.  </li>
            <li> This waterpik is easy to use and my gums and teeth are enjoying the experience.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, compact on my counter, use warm water for comfort.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying the brush, but honestly, the flosser alone, is enough to win me</li>
            <li> Almost comical &amp; once I got the hang of it, I actually enjoy flossing more &amp; find myself flossing</li>
            <li> Overall a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> , the spread out bristles do a much better job of getting along the gum line, the sonicare did a really good job on what it reached, but wasn&#x27;t very flexible to get between teeth.  </li>
            <li> This flosser works great, but I must say that this is very rickety and cheap.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I bought 4 more for my children.</li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush is great as well - very quiet but effective.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to others who want overall good health, which always starts with good oral health.</li>
            <li> You can get to places you can&#x27;t with a normal toothbrush and very effectively, and in 99% of cases, it can even replace flossing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fits perfectly on the limited space I have on my sink.</li>
            <li> , you can really maintain the level of &#x27;clean&#x27; that you experience right after a cleaning, between cleanings - my dentist tells me it&#x27;s the greatest improvement between visits that they have ever</li>
            <li> I am so happy that my old WaterPik bit the dust!</li>
            <li> I feel my tooth becoming more strong..</li>
            <li> all is working fine once more</li>
            <li> The brush of the Sonic toothbrush is smaller than the Sonicare, and the feel of the brush, including its size, shape and the vibration of its movement, is exponentially more pleasant and effective to use than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>

            <li> My teeth never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> This leave my mouth feeling sparkly clean!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how clean my mouth felt!</li>

            <li> My  mouth has never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are really clean without this!</li>
            <li> my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel dentist clean after each use!</li>
            <li> The most impressive outcome is that a return visit to the dentist this summer showed that my gum overall health has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Tooth brush is better then the other one I had and the water pick is awesome.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after the first use!</li>
            <li> I t feels  so clean, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Really cleans my teeth after brushing it continues to clean my teeth and is great for my gums  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job of making your teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The wireless charging of the toothbrush is Very cool.  </li>
            <li> The low speed is for the gums and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall very good quality and design, BUT,,,  Would have given it five stars if they offered a travel charger - talked to CS and they don&#x27;t have a solution.  </li>
            <li> So according to my new experience, I really liked the way water clean my teeth, and I loved the brush.</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> It is great to have both in one unit as to not have the whole area full of wires.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> For years I was able to find a reason not to floss, but now I enjoy flossing with the waterpik WP-900.  </li>
            <li> Great so far.  </li>
            <li> You can adjust the flow, so finding the pressure most comfortable for</li>
            <li> It works great so far.  </li>
            <li> BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY</li>
            <li> The brush that came with it seems to do a better job than my cheap OralB.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has great battery life, is very sturdy and quality, and has cool features like the 30-second buzz that divides up your brushing time.</li>
            <li> We do get complete care with this Waterpik device at an attractive price.  </li>
            <li> Best money i have every spent on my mouth</li>
            <li> This thing is actually kind of fun though, flossing with the water instead of flossing with a slimy, stinky piece of string.  </li>
            <li> It works great, makes your teeth feel like you have had a professional cleaning and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The water pick has a good strong stream and you can really feel it getting in all the crevices and spaces.</li>
            <li> While some reviewers said the high was too high, I found it to be perfect-</li>
            <li> So far, a very effective waterpik.</li>
            <li> more fun than flossing!</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric toothbrush or a waterpik, so this is my first unit, but I love it!  </li>
            <li> AND this is my first sonic toothbrush and love it as well!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this waterpik!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I floss and brush and think my teeth are clean, but then I use the Waterpik and still more food particles are flushed out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This was easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> The pieces are easy to put onto the pic-head and to remove.</li>
            <li> easily recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir comes off easily and fits in place easily, with zero leaking from its valve--what a relief!&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>

            <li> Easy to fill the tank, use and store.</li>

            <li> You can’t easily add or take out the heads</li>

            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> So based on good reviews and a decent price for this set I went ahead and purchased it, so let me go ahead and give some impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> watter pic not too strong but the toothbrush</li>
            <li> it plenty strong and has a conveint storage for its tips.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, for those wondering how strong it is, that helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully, for those wondering how strong it is, that helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss pik isnt as strong as i would like it to be</li>
            <li> My hygienist suggested quite a while ago that I get a Waterpik, since flossing wasn&#x27;t my strong suit.</li>
            <li> On speed two, the vibrations of the handle are so strong that once i even got a nerve twitch in my cheek where the toothbrush touched (god knows what it was</li>
            <li> This one is just as good as the older model</li>
            <li> Strong motor on the toothbrush, which was my biggest worry.</li>
            <li> But be warned it is strong.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is great – cleans my teeth like no other brush I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Fantastic clean!  </li>
            <li> I have many caps with some margins that need special attention.  </li>
            <li> The flosser also includes a special attachment for those who have dental bridges, so I can use the unit confidently.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is good on normal setting, the strong setting makes you feel your filings will come out :</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik flosser and sonic brush, my teeth feel very clean and fresh when I am done using it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised; is much more efficient, effective and enjoyable than the old school methods of dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> The hot button stop on the pik is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the first really nice sonic toothbrush and flosser  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I use it on full speed.</li>
            <li> I use the warm warter flossing first and it removes all particulate matter from the smallest crevices and gums; then I use the brush whicht finishes the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can use Listerine in the flosser, but I wish the power could go higher.</li>
            <li> And the toothbrush is pretty nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note to buyers:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with the water tank, it tends to run out either right at a good time (when I&#x27;m done flossing) or right before I finish.</li>
            <li> Amazing machine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this machine and my teeth feels so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Have 3-unit bridge that is kept clean by brushings, but most importantly, the water flosser.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick and cleans better than&lt;br /&gt;a tooth brush and floss.</li>
            <li> It keeps my tooth smooth and clean, and Flosser cleans my gum healthy.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for easier and more effective dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended I purchase a waterpik (specifically this brand) and when I discovered the new flosser and sonic toothbrush combination, I was delighted.  </li>
            <li> Never had a water flosser before and I needed a new electronic toothbrush so this ended up being a good buy for me.</li>
            <li> The product works fine and we would not hestitate buying one again.</li>
            <li> However this product as been great, I have even notice how much more my gums are because they are so extra clean from using the water pik.</li>
            <li> The sizr is fine.</li>
            <li> What I like best is the all in one feature and small footprint on my counter top</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> The best part of it less space an just one plug.  </li>
            <li> We use a cup to fill it now and they works fine.</li>
            <li> Items I rated were all fine..</li>
            <li> I use one cap of Advanced Care Listerine &amp; the rest water in the reservoir (Which detaches for easy</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> and because I wasn&#x27;t in the US, I was not eligible for an exchange or repair, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It is working just fine</li>
            <li> Every component works fine.</li>
            <li> Have used it a month or so and everything is fine.</li>
            <li> The waterpik works just fine.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is fine.</li>
            <li> Waterpik wirks fine.</li>
            <li> We bought this after a suggestion from our dentist when we disclosed our less than perfect flossing habits (non habits).</li>
            <li> I also love the sonic toothbrush, that came with it, 2 minutes go by quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean, gums are healthy and breath is fresh!</li>
            <li> I am in absolute love!</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, as now my teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, and adjusting well to the &amp;#34;power washer&amp;#34; which wife uses to keep the pockets clean.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, comes with everything you need (two different sized brush heads, five closer heads) and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This thing works great, is easy to operate and is quiet.</li>
            <li> The water pic works great with various levels of pressure, easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My teeth showed a huge difference after a week of use.</li>
            <li> The price of the replacement brush heads for the Sonic are about 1/4 the cost of the replacement heads for my Sonicare--which is a huge savings over the life of an electric</li>
            <li> The price of the replacement brush heads for the Sonic are about 1/4 the cost of the replacement heads for my Sonicare--which is a huge savings over the life of an electric</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for people who have braces, dentures, implants, porcelain teeth and need to use a waterpik to avoid hurting their gums, as well as a soft tooth brush to avoid damaging any type of sensitive dental work.</li>
            <li> i was expecting some huge monster</li>
            <li> I enjoy &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;The whole water pressure technique is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I JUST WISH that replacement toothbrush heads were available in brick and mortar stores or that they were available with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> And the water flosser makes a huge difference that you can see which in one use.</li>
            <li> The brush is great pausing every 30 seconds to let you know to change quadrants, but you have to pay attention because its a very brief pause.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> he liked it so much, he considered buying one, but instead i ordered him one as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Its really nice to have waterpik and toothbrush in one unit, but there is no place to store the tooth brushes and the whole setup of heads and brushes in the unit.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought my husband one too.</li>
            <li> My Teeth Feel Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Messy, but it is GREAT!  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having the toothbrush and water pick in one unit.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great product</li>
            <li> Great product, especially the dual speed brush!</li>
            <li> I really only use the waterpik because its great at cleaning between braces.  </li>
            <li> The flosser I feel could be a bit more powerful</li>
            <li> and it took some time to find a setting that I was comfortable cleaning</li>
            <li> It is important to brush with correct techniques to ensure you take care of both sides of your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use it daily with great esults.</li>
            <li> This product is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Having an electric brush with a second head coming with the flosser makes it a great bundle.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s enjoy as.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s attractive but I have three concerns that equaled only four stars.</li>
            <li> The unit is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend that you don&#x27;t use your bathroom outlet if connect to your light</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be charging once the light is off.  </li>
            <li> Great Valentine&#x27;s present for my honey!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for a few years and it worked great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great that it has different levels of water pressure.</li>
            <li> just want to add that now that I&#x27;ve had this a while, I find it almost indispensable.</li>
            <li> The water flosser is fantastic, I have braces</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoy the product.  </li>
            <li> Everything is easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> the downside the plastic construction seems a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li> Thoughtful design.</li>
            <li> I would say buy the water pik part, its great, but get the sonic toothbrush through philips or a different company.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine someone wanting something more powerful than this</li>
            <li> waterpik is great; it got stuff out from between my teeth even after I used regular floss picks.  </li>
            <li> I find that the waterpik is much nicer with warm water and you have to practically put your head in the sink.</li>
            <li> Admittedly that gives it a slightly cheap feel.</li>
            <li> I would have contacted the seller and tried having this issue address, but the option isn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;IT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE MUCH MORE USEFUL</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, it feels like you just left the dentists office each time you use it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the toothbrush and waterpik combination.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush beats the competition, both quality and value, so the Waterpik is....like free.</li>
            <li> Cheap on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> As an RN, I find it really easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I can vary the pressure of the water to easily remove food and clean my gums and mouth.</li>
            <li> We both have gum issues and this is just a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> the site that I was told to use by customer service never figured out how to give me the free item, so I decided to just order what I wanted from someone else at a lower price anyway.</li>
            <li> this thing is fantastic, +</li>
            <li> I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office and had a great teeth cleaning everytime</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it</li>
            <li> Love it mouth fills so fresh</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, clean , easy and nice use.  </li>
            <li> But overall i am happy that I brought this.</li>
            <li> The various attachments are great- there is something for every need.</li>
            <li> There is a great compartment to hold the extra waterpik and toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> It just does not hold the handle in place securely and if you move the unit it falls out .</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to get this unit, with the addition of the toothbrush feature, in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpik: The waterpik flosser is fantastic.</li>
            <li> tongue cleaning attachment (not included) would have been more useful than some of the attachments that were included.</li>
            <li> The cradle for the handle is just a cheap tapered piece of plastic to cup around the body of the waterpik.</li>
            <li> The feel so smooth and whiter.  </li>
            <li> The waterpik has several settings of pressure, which is great for cleaning different areas of your mouth and seems to do a great job at removing built-up plaque.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I invested in this economical and neat gadget.</li>
            <li> available pieces.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth,</li>
            <li> Everything on this feels cheap and  not at all sturdy.</li>
            <li> Start off at light and work your way up.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the pressure to a level comfortable to you and with a variety of heads</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference between this waterpik flosser and the waterpik</li>
            <li> ; I was glad that she said that because it proves to me that this flosser and toothbrush are doing what they claimed to do.</li>
            <li> Combined with the sonic toothbrush, the unit does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> I think the idea is great (having the tooth brush AND the water dispenser in the same unit)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap trash.</li>
            <li> I used the water pic brush and it didn&#x27;t quite make my teeth feel smooth again.</li>
            <li> However I also feel it does a fantastic job and in my opinion, beats out Sonicare in the tooth cleaning</li>
            <li> sound:</li>
            <li> Downsides: loud, requires user dexterity to not blast self in eye, and definitely not the most impressive thing to talk about with women, but neither is gingivitis.</li>
            <li> Recently had a bridge installed so flossing is out and the waterpik is a great option.</li>
            <li> The company replaced it Hassle free.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing how much food the waterpik removes, even after flossing.</li>
            <li> The value is great, I would definitely buy this set again.</li>
            <li> This thing is great, and a much smaller footprint on the counter than two separate dental tools.</li>
            <li> It provides great dental care and leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist office</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the water pik though.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after using the Ultra Flosser and warm water.</li>
            <li> Fantastic unit.</li>
            <li> Overall this was definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> My children have more fun using this</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> There are cheap plastic components, but the product works, and works damned well.  </li>
            <li> Individually, the water flosser and the sonic toothbrush are both great products.</li>
            <li> The difference is the Waterpik is much more powerful than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> did have an incident with a missing piece in my box and contacted Amazon and, as always, they are awesome to deal with.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I purchased 2 1 in Il. &amp; 1 in Fl.</li>
            <li> I went to the web site and filled out their contact form.</li>
            <li> I have had a waterpik for several years but the toothbrush is great</li>
            <li> A great product, I just hope it continues to work for several years.</li>
            <li> I gave the regular one to my son and he says its great.</li>
            <li> but it was a cheap one.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel like my dentist will be happy when she sees me next visit.</li>
            <li> one get one free coupons for replacement parts.</li>
            <li> whe the wate Pik tip is inserted,  it still rotates freely.  </li>
            <li> and is great for daily dental care.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself if fantastic and automatically turns off after about 2.5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have only been using it for a week but every time I use it my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> works fantastic....</li>
            <li> Bought this about 2 months ago, after about a month the charger light indicator stopped working.</li>
            <li> So fantastic 2 months use and now throw it away.</li>
            <li> You have never truly experienced life until you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wish there were denser brush heads available.</li>
            <li> works great when used daily.</li>
            <li> The kids even enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much food the water pik removes.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The result is so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, all is good.  </li>
            <li> So far So good</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Well, maybe your dentist won&#x27;t like you better because he or she won&#x27;t have as much work to do in your mouth, but the hygenist will love you for it.</li>
            <li> Works like it should, so far so good</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this machine for 4 days now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Now my toothbrush tells me when to change quadrants, flossing is no longer a pain (and kind of fun) and my mouth feels super clean every day.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and he said WOW good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Waterpik Complete for about a year and have loved it.  </li>
            <li> havent been able to use it much but its better than a trip to the dentest.add to it</li>
            <li> The ability to finely adjust pressure, as well as the different tip options, are also very nice, and I find the water tank has plenty of capacity.</li>
            <li> When I was shopping for a new electric toothbrush, I settled on this Water Pic model, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It pulses every 30 seconds for two minutes to make sure you brush your teeth for the right about of time, 30 seconds for each quadrant.</li>
            <li> Just the right size &amp; I love the all in one.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush more powerful than my original waterpik brush.  </li>
            <li> THANKS,  WATERPIK!!!  </li>
            <li> Hot bat-smoke!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely met all my expectations!!!</li>
            <li> very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;excellent!!!</li>
            <li> THE extra tips included are a very nice touch.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very powerful with two settings.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> The waterpik is very powerful with a range of settings and attachments&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I noticed this Waterpik combo while browsing on Amazon and made a (very rare) impulse buy</li>
            <li> I have also used the plaque seeker tip and found it to be very useful around the gum</li>
            <li> I have also used the plaque seeker tip and found it to be very useful around the gum</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist was very complimentary when she checked my gums.  </li>
            <li> Me and my wife love it, is nice, practical, does the service is intended for, I have used electric toothbrushes in the past but this system is by far the best one I got.</li>
            <li> The adjustable jet of water can be very powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The cost of replacement brushes is very economical compared to the competition.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush it&#x27;s very powerful and the timer helps you to use it the enought time.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush is very powerful, the replacement heads are affordable, and this unit comes with two of them already.</li>
            <li> It works great, however, it would be nice to have a speed that is between the low and extremely high.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush design makes it easy to clean although you still have to clean the charger area</li>
            <li> Although water flossing is great and feels really clean you should still floss regularly as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and has made a HUGE difference this time on the appearance of his teeth and the tartar build up.</li>
            <li> The water pik is so smooth and the tooth brush makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Between the sonic brush and the water pic, my teeth stay smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The water container is super easy to refill because it lifts out of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water container is super easy to refill because it lifts out of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this is easy to use and quick</li>
            <li> super easy with this Waterpik.</li>
            <li> The older one was more ergonomic and therefore worked better and easier to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> but this makes flossing super easy.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little waterpik station!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if my joy turns south, but I think this will go down as one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly if you have any kind of gum problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Water Pik Toothbrush/Water Flosser on June 6, 2014, from Drugstore.com, and was enjoying the use of it very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a dentist fresh clean every time I use this tooth brush and water pick!</li>
            <li> Now I have one that provides just as powerful a clean and a waterpik.  Score!</li>
            <li> So fresh and so Clean!</li>
            <li> From my standpoint, you can foget the special offer of getting a free accessory is you purchase two . . .</li>
            <li> Product works great and according to my dentist, my gums are healthier, I have less plaque and teeth are looking better.</li>
            <li> Although this product may seem a little bulky for some bathrooms it is completely awesome and really makes your mouth feel more clean then</li>
            <li> I bought a lot of things this past year but without a shadow of a doubt, this was my best purchase of 2014.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic and simple way to floss your teeth without using floss and more effective too.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days my gingivitis improved significantly.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kid&#x27;s tooth cleaning has improved significantly and so has the willingness to brush and floss twice per day.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> WITHOUT the toothbrush is in my local grocery store for $59.99 and the toothbrush on its own will run $89.99 so don&#x27;t pass this deal up!</li>
            <li> what a powerful toothbrush and the water flossing is bomb! ....</li>
            <li> After many years of manual brushing, I took the chance on one of those rotary pulsating brushes, Oral B to B exact.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Supper excited to get it</li>
            <li> Why would the most used part of the system be the first to break?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, this unit is just as good as the Waterpik unit my mother had from the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Waterpik puts out a great product, makes me wonder why we took so long to buy one.</li>
            <li> quick and fine</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference from using this product.</li>
            <li> I originally got this thinking</li>
            <li> Some people might find it to be too powerful, but I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m genuinely excited to brush and floss... like a weirdo...</li>
            <li> The water pick was also an interesting experience the first time...</li>
            <li> the flosser is not hard to do, it just takes some practice to learn your own method.  </li>
            <li> the waterpik is pretty neat it will clean your mouth better then any swishing will, but it doesnt replace flossing or anything.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> This setup works great, I wish the water bowl would hold a little more.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, my  dental problems have been  minimal, I  kept all my own teeth, and , for a 66 year old , that is stellar.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot, however the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Daughter to help clean her expander.  </li>
            <li> Works great and my teeth are in much better shape after just a few months of use.</li>

            <li> Stated her teeth never felt so clean, except when cleaned by dentist.  </li>
            <li> so I have to use a bristle tool to clean it all out.  </li>
            <li> She also recommended for use by my wife to clean under a permanent bridge.</li>
            <li> It effectively gets bits of food out from between my teeth, although I still need to use traditional floss to get rid of the plaque that the Waterpik isn&#x27;t able to get.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.</li>

            <li> but now I make it a point to do this 2-3x a day just to get that clean feeling</li>
            <li> Be prepared to clean water up.</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I can see visible results in the clean of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Why not keep your teeth clean?</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean after use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own many electric toothbrushes but simply put this</li>
            <li> I flossed after using the pik the floss came out clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as my flosser and it makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it to clean your ears though, the thought crossed my mind</li>
            <li> Mouth feels really clean with it.  </li>
            <li> I found that a setting of 9 was needed to really clean my teeth.</li>

            <li> the sonic toothbrush &amp; my mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Just ordered for the Waterpik to replace  old one, but really impressed with tooth-brush, especially high-speed setting.</li>
            <li> I decided on the complete care system and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> High is very strong .</li>
            <li> I think it is more effective at removing particles, while at the same time being more gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Used it and afterwards my teeth felt clean not as good as dentist clean but clean enough that I feel my dental situation will improve.</li>
            <li> the high-speed on the toothbrush is WAY too strong; it will vibrate your teeth right out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> specially the toothbrush it comes with.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone, specially those who have braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decide to try this waterpick tooth brush as the price was much better then the oral b smart scenes.  </li>
            <li> my teeth really feel clean and healthy...</li>
            <li> but overall you get a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The water flosser takes a little to get used to, but works great, I like putting some mouthwash in the water, it cleans better and keeps the water fresh.  </li>
            <li> I admit I rarely return things, but I will hesitate to buy anything through Amazon again if it costs more than I am willing to throw away.</li>
            <li> The Waterpark complete care is amazing.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is pretty good, its brush is almost to soft though</li>
            <li> Works great, just as expected.</li>
            <li> You may have a splatter control problem for the first few flosses :D</li>
            <li> Set up and clean up is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> You WILL give your bathroom a shower the first few times using it, but the product does a WONDERFUL job.</li>
            <li> toothbrush comes with 2 heads, and runs on a timer to help get the full 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> Works well, wish it had 2 full power brush heads though.</li>
            <li> Have gotten so many compliments on how much whiter my teeth are.</li>
            <li> so much I am brushing and flossing a lot more....</li>
            <li> Everything works great only thing to make it perfect is the battery for the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> SO...I had extra money in my FSA, and I figured this was as good a time as any to get braces...</li>
            <li> Brushing and flossing turned into the most cumbersome tasks, so I started shopping for a reasonably priced electric toothbrush and water flosser</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit arrived at my doorstep today, and although I am letting the toothbrush charge the full 24 hours, I couldn&#x27;t help but try the water flosser.</li>
            <li> I had to fill the tank twice, but I&#x27;m sure that is because I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect  </li>
            <li> but the design is cool.</li>
            <li> I really think my teeth look and feel much better since I bought this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about the WaterPik WP 900.</li>
            <li> I am nothing but satisfied with this whole purchase.</li>
            <li> The timer settings makes sure I am very thorough with each quadrant of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I like that much speed because I feel like I am getting a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> Tested the pressure on my hand, nice a soft.</li>
            <li> Mine took overnight to reach full status with three lights on it.  </li>
            <li> The brush is cool too.</li>
            <li> It should be used in addition to good dental care to save you from tooth problems that may occur later along with unwanted dental bills that are never cheep.</li>
            <li> I love the pik/tooth brush combo, it really does save room.</li>
            <li> not it sounds like a jackhammer, with water on full blast</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik ; it has everything I wanted, flosser, sonic toothbrush and more.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted one too, we love it so much.</li>
            <li> Love it, absolute cleanest mouth feeling.  </li>
            <li> After paying way too much money to my dentist, I decided to become more proactive.  </li>
            <li> I had to hunt for a good price on replacement heads and then the price went up the next time I ordered.  </li>
            <li> However, the Sonic Toothbrush is no where near as nice as the Phillips Sonicare brush I replaced with this unit.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I brush and floss, this thing can always find more to root out of the gaps between my teeth and gums, and my dentist says that my oral hygiene has improved a lot since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> Use the low and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> my mouth feels super clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fresh feeling it leaves.  </li>
            <li> Love it and it works very well</li>
            <li> makes my mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> but overall good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> And shipping is so fast that I satisfied.</li>
            <li> Loving this care set so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping the dentist will be able to tell me how much of a difference she sees</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t say enough of how good this product is.</li>
            <li> The price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love it having both is very convenient</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean after using the brush and water floss function.</li>
            <li> HAVE REALLY GOTTEN MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is not holding a full charge anymore</li>
            <li> The dentist good see an improvement in his oral health after only 1 week.</li>
            <li> Very simple to operate and does a good job for which it was designed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the unit.teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Now my wife wants to use it. :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The many heads of the floss really motivates me to try each one.  </li>
            <li> -10 are nice to customize for those with sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On 4-5, it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, going to the dentist has gotten a lot more pleasant since using this little gadget.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful but the toothbrush just vibrates and doesn&#x27;t really move, like circular motion or up and down.  </li>
            <li> if you want a powerful water pik along with a very powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li> If the Waterpik worked, I&#x27;d be happy, even with the less comfortable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> excellent device, much improved over previous models.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is nothing more than a cheap very loud electric brush.</li>
            <li> I put it in my mouth, rotated the head so it was comfortable, and turned it on, almost right away</li>
            <li> My theory was to kick things up a bit and make sure my gums also were as healthy and clean as possible before I had surgery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first one, and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> Other than those two preferences, the brush and pic work great</li>
            <li> ALWAYS FEELS FRESH CLEAN.</li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels to clean and fresh after each use.  </li>
            <li> I put a splash of Listerine in the water tank and get a really clean, fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my mouth so fresh and so clean with almost no effort...</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, rinsed feeling.</li>
            <li> Give you a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth fresh and clean</li>
            <li> it makes your mouth feel clean &amp; fresh.  </li>
            <li> Say their mouths have never felt so fresh and teeth so clean.</li>
            <li> It does run out of water quickly.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik used with a mild solution of mouthwash or, in my case, diluted peroxide, has saved my teeth.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve seen some reviews have mentioned that the reservoir runs out too quickly.</li>
            <li> the spray is a super addition.</li>
            <li> Your gum health will drastically improve, and quickly.</li>
            <li> Compared to dentures or partial plates,  I am thinking $80 is getting off kind of cheap!    </li>
            <li> However, I knew I needed to do something quickly to help my gums and teeth to be stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth seem super fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly and was just what it said it would be.</li>
            <li> Much better than older Waterpik models.  </li>
            <li> Quick service in shipping and would buy from that vendor anytime.</li>
            <li> i went from one of those devices that sprays out a quick burst of air/water, but switching to this waterpik</li>
            <li> it is better than the older model of water pik.</li>
            <li> although I give Waterpik 4 stars (didn&#x27;t like that my unit was faulty), it&#x27;s zero stars for Waterpik&#x27;s customer service, and 5 stars for Amazon&#x27;s quick resolve of my issue.</li>
            <li> I would suggest starting with the setting in 1 and working your way up to what pressure is comfortable for you, I have found that 4 is a nice pressure for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges quickly .  </li>
            <li> The brush is kind of big and the travel case is huge,  </li>
            <li> After using as instructed twice a day for three months with regular flossing and seeing my dentist for a follow up visit, I can say that the report came back excellent.  </li>
            <li> We love that a tooth brush came with this one for slightly more than the one we ordered last year without the brush.  </li>
            <li> As a recent recipient of an All on Four permanent denture the dentist recommended one of these, and at the cost of the teeth I&#x27;ll darn likely take care of them this time as best</li>
            <li> Powerful and gets them looking clean really quick.</li>
            <li> It is super at cleaning between the teeth; makes floss seem a primitive device.</li>
            <li> The battery died super quick and when I tried to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> The waterpik has more tips than I think I&#x27;ll ever use, but I absolutely love it, and I actually consider it</li>
            <li> It does a super job of cleaning the teeth and gum areas.  </li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t take up nearly as much counter space as I thought it would - very compact and everything fits all together nicely.</li>
            <li> The reservoir does go through the water quickly.</li>
            <li> It is more compact than expected and fits nicely on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and you will clearly see that it gets food out</li>
            <li> This was a great black Friday special purchase .</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I find the brushing at high mode more soothing than my Sonicare- almost like massing my gums.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  :)</li>
            <li> Be sure to click the toothbrush button twice to put it in &#x27;high&#x27; mode</li>
            <li> with a lower pressure and then work up go ahead and aim it at an angle right into the gum line because this gentle massage will keep the blood flowing and keep it healthy so you will never ever have gingivitis.</li>
            <li> The fact that it comes with an electric toothbrush makes it even more of a good buy, and it&#x27;s the same kind of toothbrush that I previously bought for $110; this one lets you know when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants of my teeth.</li>
            <li> You r teeth feel so clean right after you brush and floss.</li>
            <li> ..is just the right product to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> There was at most 1/10th of what I would normally find.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, because it&#x27;s more than just the normal Waterpik flosser.  </li>
            <li> The waterpik works great but the toothbrush is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Dentist was very pleased at last check up.</li>
            <li> This results in a sound that ran my cat out of the bathroom the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Much easier than dental floss and much more effective in overall cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> in all a good product for as long as it lasts and the cost associated with a healthier oral life</li>
            <li> The cord is long which is good for my bathroom since</li>
            <li> I was not gifted with naturally perfect snow white teeth, but they are healthy, clean and polished.  </li>
            <li> The brush works really well to get my teeth feeling clean and smooth though</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel extremely clean and refreshed, actually better than a professional cleaning..  </li>
            <li> The flossing action is superior to the older models.  </li>
            <li> I love it, my teeth and entire mouth feels clean, clean, clean.</li>
            <li> it better than most other electric toothbrushes -- which sometimes sound like you are sticking a helicopter inside your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush and water pik.  </li>
            <li> This new device is even better and easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
            <li> I have teeth very close together and flossing with string was not working and taking me a long time without great results.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another Waterpik to get a good powerful toothbrush with 2 speeds and a long battery life.</li>
            <li> It is possible, but the way that the teeth are cleaned is so good, I am willing to put up with it.  </li>
            <li> It is possible, but the way that the teeth are cleaned is so good, I am willing to put up with it.  </li>
            <li> overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Waterpick is super powerful (will spray across the room).</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really cleans your teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li> very efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty good report at the dentist after using this for several months.  </li>
            <li> This unit is well made, easy to use, takes up little counter space, has good power on the flosser.</li>
            <li> It has what I wanted in a single package at a good price.</li>
            <li> I had a recent bridge placed, and this method is much better than using floss under it!</li>
            <li> Ladies, tie your hair at first or you will be soaked!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not small, so make sure you have space on your sink counter.</li>
            <li> I love this complete gum cleaning machine!</li>
            <li> No cavities for the first time in 10 years!</li>
            <li> My new dentist also was surprised by how good the accompanying sonic tooth brush performed.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, works better than the previous two waterpik&#x27;s I have had.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective the toothbrush was going to be because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used it and it&#x27;s easy to use and does a good job taking all the excess waste from your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and oral hygiene is very important to me and I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Clean, easy to set up, easy to use, all around terrific buy.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, complete clean after meals.</li>
            <li> better than just a sonic care, battery last a full week or more brushing twice daily, space saving, love the water pick.</li>
            <li> thank you for creating this, though you could use a little more pressure that&#x27;s probably the only problem ( the sonic toothbrush also does very good. )</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t necessarily anything phenomenal, granted is does its job just fine.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that many bathroom outlets on older homes are switched so the unit wont charge.</li>
            <li> but I have had a very easy time with it thus far, aside from the first time I turned it on and realized it should already be in your mouth when you hit on.</li>
            <li> It has everything I want in an electric toothbrush and water flosser in a nice small footprint that fits easily on my counter and is easy to store when company is coming over</li>
            <li> Nice having both things combined but the toothbrush I think could be a little more aggressive.</li>
            <li> Amazing tiny pressure washer for your mouth.</li>
            <li> Customer Service was absolutely great, and they replaced both parts within a few days with the 2-year warranty.</li>
            <li> Really like it - fantastic having 2 products in.  </li>
            <li> The water flosser is very stronger and smooth level to adjust for the pressure.</li>
            <li> is that it is a bit loud, a bit more than most electric toothbrushes (the flosser part is loud)</li>
            <li> The waterpik itself is sooooooo(I can&#x27;t add enough o&#x27;s) amazing.</li>
            <li> I didnt know waterpik was so powerful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember seeing this in the instructions, but it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li> it is well worth it</li>
            <li> Any time it includes a built in timer is a nice feature but short of that</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don&#x27;t replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won&#x27;t stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love and and actually look forward to using it because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> Hmmmm ... why don&#x27;t I have a warm and cozy feeling about that? :-)  </li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Affordable and useful</li>
            <li> powerful water flosser; and I like the dual speed of toothbrush</li>
            <li> Wife wants to use it, and when she does, I know she&#x27;ll love it and want to use it as much as me.  </li>
            <li> That alone is worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Powerful and convient.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice product and works well except for problems noted.</li>
            <li> Definetely well worth the money.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The travel case is nice and the battery will last a coupe of weeks.</li>
            <li> The water pick dose a good job as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Love the complete system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 68 year old surgeon and have had many water type flossers over the years.</li>
            <li> It worked okay with a fresh set of batteries but as time went on they seemed to drain faster requiring frequent changes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush was a nice extra.</li>
            <li> Lots of extra tools to try out, and a nice carrying case for the brush on the road.</li>
            <li> Six more words required to complete.</li>
            <li> My dentist said never go over 4 as it can irritate and hurt your gums since it&#x27;s so powerful over that.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> But, as far as the way it works, I love it.</li>
            <li> It works much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> This sure beats our old electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you want that fresh out of the dentist feeling every day then this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Really powerful but</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is not as powerful as the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Currently own this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This unit is well made and powerful.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have both as standard sized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Great pressure and not as loud as my last water pik.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is far better than any Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Easier than flossing and fun to use.</li>
            <li> But still worth it</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> A powerful sonic brush without the jackhammer feel that some have.  </li>
            <li> So I moved it to the kitchen because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of electric toothbrushes and water flossers with varying success.</li>
            <li> honestly feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist after each use.</li>
            <li> Overall, kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about this product.</li>
            <li> Great product it does make a mess with the water but other than that it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> This product has so many different kinds of interchangeable heads to fit whatever gum/tooth cleanup need you have.</li>
            <li> Sonicare was the best brush experience I had to date in my middle aged life.  </li>
            <li> I decided that since the producer offers such great warranty it was worth the risk to get a defective piece.</li>
            <li> totally worth</li>
            <li> I used the sonic and oral b. i personally liked the oral b but on a trip, I left the charger.</li>
            <li> worth the money, I think.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The ease of working through my mouth with the Waterpik has definitely gotten me to improve my own dental health.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> husband loves it, the extra accessories are quite nice</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The water flosser, complete with adjustable pressure setting and multiple tips, is great.</li>
            <li> Water flossing is a fun and pleasurable activity.</li>
            <li> rarely flossed  </li>
            <li> i cannot get a fresh breath without using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it totally worth your money&lt;</li>
            <li> but it really worth it</li>
            <li> What a snazzy upgrade to an old favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient and compact and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My teeth feels fresh every time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> If I had had this Waterpik Complete Care Flosser and Toothbrush, I most like would not have had this problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing a quick,easy and fun thing to do.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price</li>
            <li> Looks nice but the only thing working is the flosser.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this thing, having had it about a month or so.</li>
            <li> *fun*</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ &amp;#34;Feels fresh after every Brush&amp;#34; I give 7 Star</li>
            <li> It makes brushing/flossing so much fun.</li>
            <li> A DEAL,THE TOOTHBRUSH ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and it just makes my mouth feel so fresh.  </li>
            <li> It kind of sounds like a tiny pressure washer.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the old toothrush and waterpick.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that means, but she was excited about it and my gums and teeth feel much better and way more clean than ever before.  </li>
            <li> and it does not dry out very easily.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a jet of water could be that strong and effective in cleaning down below the gum line.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of waterpik water flossers and love using them, so I was excited to get this and also have a waterpik brand toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This works so easy and takes no time away from my normal routine, I should have bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> Item delivered quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I had an older waterpik for many many years but it finally started leaking and needed replacement.</li>
            <li> It comes with several items that really clean teeth and promote healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the different types, but the sensation is so refreshing and clean</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to make use of the button which stops the water from flowing out; You can easily turn a dry bathroom into a water park if you don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the clean feeling-just like a professional cleaning- that this unit provides.</li>
            <li> Some times I mix in some mouthwash (just male sure to run clean water through the system afterwards).</li>
            <li> Overall, however, my teeth are clean and my gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush makes my teeth feel very clean, but the waterpik is obnoxiously loud.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they work good</li>
            <li> one daughter is so excited she is really looking forward to Santa</li>
            <li> Other than that it is good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for super clean teeth and moufh.</li>
            <li> The dentist was right</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
            <li> Water water everywhere is right...</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> It did not leak right away</li>
            <li> and they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> He was right on.</li>
            <li> right ~~~~~~&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m worried a little.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The capacity of the water container is just right.</li>
            <li> so you brush each quadrant the right amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is now right there</li>
            <li> As I  am left-handed and my outlet  is on the right side of the sink.</li>
            <li> , I feel the difference right away</li>
            <li> I can see and feel the difference right away after using this product.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get the right angles so as not to splash out over things, but be patient.  </li>
            <li> they were right on.</li>
            <li> First of all, the toothbrush is a much slimmer profile and is comfortable</li>
            <li> Electric than manual brush clean, coordination with the cleaning is very practical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun in the past and I liked this toothbrush better, besides now</li>
            <li> and it really does CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush really shines up your teeth and creates an all-day clean feeling on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Really gets my teeth dentist clean.</li>
            <li> after I use it, my mouth really feels clean</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth clean and ready to talk up close to people.</li>
            <li> In 3 or four minutes my mouth feels completely clean, so much so that I don&#x27;t even get morning breath.</li>
            <li> I also use dental floss as well, but the combination really makes my teeth feel clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> It does however clean really well.</li>
            <li> The WP-900 really gets our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> A great little machine!</li>
            <li> When you use it, fill it with whatever temp water is comfortable for your teeth and wipe it all down after your done to keep it nice and to prevent mildew.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the wait and the price is very reasonable for a sonic toothbrush and the water-flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waterflossing makes flossing all that more enjoyable and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Now i floss everyday because it&#x27;s easy and effective.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to apply anywhere near the pressure you would use with a normal brush as it vibrates any stuff off the teeth easily leaving you with that fresh smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this amazing flosser and toothbrush a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the two-speed toothbrush - the higher speed setting seems to help in areas that occasionally have a higher buildup of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have to refill it twice each use to increase my cleaning time because of the small reservoir but the electric toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is great for getting rid of the small seeds.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this long ago, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> But I had the process down fairly well within a week.</li>
            <li> and I am a little bit upset , but I still give it a 5 star as it is very well made and great values included.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and instructions, I used it with no spills right from the first try.</li>
            <li> Sonic Tooth brush is easy to use and makes a complete dental care team.&lt;br /&gt;-Sonic</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use so the kids use it frequently.</li>
            <li> Brush is good, but product as a whole did not work as expected</li>
            <li> Does a super job thanks</li>
            <li> Just ok, not crazy about the toothbrush, next time I&#x27;d purchase each separately and go with oral b.  </li>
            <li> Works great and dislodges any tiny particles left in teeth after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> The Two speed tooth brush is as good as my SonicCare that I keep in the downstairs half Bath.</li>
            <li> Five minutes a day with this toothbrush and flosser to reduce the frequency of 90 minute professional deep cleanings is a good trade.</li>
            <li> I am happy enough with the product overall.  </li>
            <li> Our power outlet in the bathroom is connected with the light, meaning it has only power when the light is on.</li>
            <li> You get that wonderful fresh feeling without the scary dentist part.</li>
            <li> Good unit &amp; easier to use than the previous model.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take that much time to do a quick pass.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik and sonic tooth brush give you the super clean feeling of a professional cleaning without the bleeding gums--get one.</li>
            <li> Great product , I have been using it daily for the last 3 months.</li>
            <li> If you do not enjoy flossing with string then the waterpik is excellent as it does the same job using water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several levels so this is a good product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I prefer this toothbrush to my old Philips Sonicare since the brush part pulls off easily.</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare years ago and this is just as good for way less cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having three crowns replaced soon at a total cost of $2,475 which I could have likely prevented or greatly delayed</li>
            <li> great product though larger than my last one.</li>
            <li> The pause button is particularly useful unless you enjoy an unexpected bast of streaming water shooting up your nostril.</li>
            <li> AND WORKS LIKE NEW!!!</li>
            <li> very soft, comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and compact and has a limited 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel just out of the dental office clean everyday,  I love it!</li>
            <li> The waterpik is good too, but less than 5 minutes during the first use, the pause button quit working.</li>
            <li> works great better than regular flossing never will go back to regular flossing again</li>
            <li> my braces).&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush is very gentle on my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The convenience of having one plug for both your toothbrush and your water flosser leaves your precious bathroom outlets free for other things.</li>
            <li> She said my pockets were significantly reduced and there was only light tartar build-up.</li>
            <li> I have now adapted to placing a space-age toothbrush in my mouth that creates abnormal brain waves if allowed to rattle against my epiglottis, but removes all matter of plaque, uncleanness, and has brightened my teeth while still offering the tried and true water flossing and tonsil cleaning of a classic Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> This setup does not always hold the one on the right in the picture (2014) and that can be frustrating from such an important and awesome device otherwise.  </li>
            <li> She really likes it and it really helps! !</li>
            <li> That made me feel very good because I was not a great flosser otherwise.</li>
            <li> The flosser works great but the button has begun to stick and make it hard to start and stop.  </li>
            <li> decided I would very much like to try the Sonic, but I noted that the price for the Sonic and a Waterpik higher quality water flosser model, when sold separately, would amount to about $170--a pretty steep cost and out of my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works so much more effectively than what I&#x27;ve been struggling with previously, that I am able to do my dental care in literally half the time it took me with my Sonicare and Model</li>
            <li> It works so much more effectively than what I&#x27;ve been struggling with previously, that I am able to do my dental care in literally half the time it took me with my Sonicare and Model</li>
            <li> This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This is my first waterpik.  </li>
            <li> the bottom (where the battery is) was quite hot.</li>
            <li> however the waterflosser can be used while the toothbrush is charging for the first day.</li>
            <li> It really has helped my gums and my teeth a lot!  </li>
            <li> will need replace the handle with the tube pretty soon.  </li>
            <li> That first one was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love that it has two speeds on the toothbrush and that there are multiple waterpik heads.</li>
            <li> Diabetics more likely to develop gum disease than others.</li>
            <li> I found that the water pick combination  was exactly as I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the toothbrush has a timer to let you know when to move to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; in your mouth and shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> The handle vibrates quite a bit more than either of those did, but thats not really a big issue.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty meticulous about flossing,  so what would&#x27;ve taken me 30+ min with waxed floss and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will gladly review the brush later.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I enjoy the toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do NOT expect a $99 item (what I paid for this in 2015) to last forever, but geesh, I should get a couple of years or more off of it...  </li>
            <li> Waterpik has recently elected to make a change to our Water Flosser products to be more compliant with energy efficiency.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to a long and happy future with waterpik- WP-900</li>
            <li> My first dental checkup after purchasing this device is coming soon</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first water flosser my family has ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been contemplating buying Waterpik, and I&#x27;m glad I have finally opted to order it.</li>
            <li> Finally I haven&#x27;t been able to find ANY brush refills at Target or Walmart which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush stopped recharging in August 2016 exactly 15 months after I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a water pik.</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;flosses&amp;#34; much better than actually using dental floss.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, last time I better understood an issue with a gap between the bottoms of two teeth</li>
            <li> first time buying water flosser.</li>
            <li> Exactly as hoped.</li>
            <li> would probably still be using my first one</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get lectured for not flossing ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> it is pretty well constructed and sensibly designed.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I decided to get a rechargeable system and at first was just looking at a sonic brush but then noticed this combo.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased the Waterpic brand</li>
            <li> It came with several different accessories so that I could try the different ones out and then order the replacements that worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> first thing that you do is set up the area that you plan to put the unit.  </li>
            <li> More than 4 would actually result in damaging my gums.</li>
            <li> Sonic does such a better job.</li>
            <li> i love the 2 in one package and that waterpik comes with various heads replacements soft/sprays etc.  </li>
            <li> i love the multiple spray settings too.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare brushes had a much longer useful life.</li>
            <li> - Better by a mile than traditional flossing</li>
            <li> I bought it, use it twice daily and love it.</li>
            <li> It really cleans your teeth!</li>
            <li> This was my first &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it has a toothbrush and a waterpik flosser and spots to store the extra flosser heads, as well as the bonus travel case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I also like that the flosser comes with so many different heads, including an orthodontic tip.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer covers everything for the first year.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used something like this</li>
            <li> and I have flossed more time  with this in the last year then</li>
            <li> Take time and read the directions as you go about doing this for the first time step by step.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like using regular floss, you will love this.  </li>
            <li> First time I ever had one of these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his first Waterpik</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time I used mine.</li>
            <li> I love this, especially for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> received the package on the exact date it was estimated.</li>
            <li> It really eliminates plaque!</li>
            <li> It appears to be healthier because I was able to wash away the gunk deep in the gum line.  </li>
            <li> (Okay, maybe not a water park but definitely an aquatic mess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many attachments for the waterpik for whatever your needs are as well as two tooth brush heads that are different sizes.</li>
            <li> It does make noise but NOT annoying or too loud.</li>
            <li> OR contrary to expectation was more than the standard 15 amp outlet.  </li>
            <li> This means I&#x27;ll now have two toothbrushes, but will need extra counter space and another electrical outlet if I want to be able to charge the toothbrush and keep using the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Wish I used it the first 50 years, I might have saved a tooth and the pain that went with that loss.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik  I purchased was recommended by my dentist this the first one for me</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li> (this was my first experience with a waterpik).  </li>
            <li> Please be aware that it does not replace flossing.</li>
            <li> My teeth were cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li> All these feelings were gone after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Although the replacement brush heads were much more costly than the Oral B ones, and ultamitly the replacement cost of the brush heads is what drove me back to purchase another Oral B rotary type tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> The first time i used it i spit blood all over.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it i spit blood all over.</li>
            <li> My dentist always comments about how the health of the teeth and gums of his patients who use a Waterpik, on a regular basis, is significantly better than those who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The first time we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing</li>
            <li> The first one the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after just 15 days.</li>
            <li> would it really do a better job than a standard toothbrush and dental floss?  </li>
            <li> My first automatic toothbrush--love it.  </li>
            <li> So she finally recommended a water pic, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not random, so this may be a feature, but  I&#x27;m not a fan of</li>
            <li> There are several attachments, most of which I haven&#x27;t tried.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush &amp; water flosser are gentle but powerful.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely use this item well after my braces treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> The button turns the brush on at the first, slower speed setting.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than dentures!</li>
            <li> This is also my first electric / sonic toothbrush as well as a water floss / pick thing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t consistent when it came to flossing</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first time using a Waterpik</li>
            <li> It sprayed my bathroom walls and floor the first couple of times I tried it.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s a lot more convenient than using regular floss.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush &amp; water flosser are gentle but powerful.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve used a water flosser</li>
            <li> /more enjoyable water flossing is relative to manual flossing.  </li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush before with all the bells and whistles, and the Waterpik Total Care product is much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Over 6 months later I still love the product.  </li>
            <li> This Pik requires TWO (2) hands to operate it when you first start.</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference from the first use.  </li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s a timer on the toothbrush that systematically does 30 second increments on 4 quadrants of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Second, the waterpik is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I took me exactly one use before I was sold on the Waterpik model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpik has combined their proven water flosser with a powerful sonic toothbrush in one very well executed unit.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is my first water flosser and WOWW</li>
            <li> Having the toothbrush and flosser in the same unit also makes me more likely to use both of them more often.</li>
            <li> Compare around like I did, but I am sure you will come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Not many more are going to be able to offer everything this one has and does.</li>
            <li> n found it better than regular flosser  just because it doesnt hurt my gum&lt;</li>
            <li> but it definitely cleans better than the 1st one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has been working fantastic.</li>
            <li> At age 62 and having braces for the first time it makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li> The first unit I received had a problem.</li>
            <li> This is my first WaterPik.</li>
            <li> my wife and I have been using this on a regular basis we really love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first sonic brush, and I can&#x27;t believe the speed the brush moves.</li>
            <li> We love it, it was open box</li>
            <li> She also feels like her gums actually feel better.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was on the charger for days when it first arrived and never charged.</li>
            <li> Much better than an Intellisonic toothbrush that I recently purchased from my dentist.</li>
            <li> First one, the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> Will not ever be able to use a regular toothbrush or floss again.</li>
            <li> The Water Flosser portion was heaven sent and my mouth feels so much better with this total cleaning program.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a waterpik</li>
            <li> the toothbrush would just be a convenient add-on to the waterpik, but I love them both equally!</li>
            <li> Does a much better job than  regular floss.  </li>
            <li> Chinese customers are satisfied</li>
            <li> Although I like it, be aware, the water pic flow cut off button</li>
            <li> The Waterpik take several times to learn to use, more use the easier it is to use.</li>
            <li> My only problem is after two weeks the brush can&#x27;t hold a charge, but that&#x27;s ok cause with the two year warranty that comes with the unit Waterpik</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in the first use.</li>
            <li> Love the double Pik.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are several water pik attachments and water dispensing options.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s better than just brushing your teeth alone.  </li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a product that is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> entirely however I find it much easier to be on top of oral health when its fun /enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The first one I got had a toothbrush that lost its charge after I traveled with it, and would regain charge.  </li>
            <li> Ten times better than using dental floss.</li>
            <li> I can see difference on first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different electric toothbrushes, but this one has worked</li>
            <li> I love this because of the different attachments included with the water flosse; as well as being to adjust the speed of the flossing.</li>
            <li> I thought it to be a good investment, we started using it Christmas day, and today we went to use it and the toothbrush is dead..  </li>
            <li> good product, I hope I can ues it everyday.</li>
            <li> toothbrush has two settings, but the high setting is way too powerful for me; the lower setting is just right.  </li>
            <li> Works better than I expecte, the cord on the water pick could be a little longer but other than that it&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li> I love the the clear plastic reservoir which makes it easy to track how much water is left.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE my new Waterpik (R) ultra flosser complete with toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The water flosser is great; no more floss fingers for me!  </li>
            <li> The price is ridiculously low compared to the other popular sonic brush and I like this brush much better.</li>
            <li> A brand new full unit is on its way to me.  </li>
            <li> No other way to get a mouth feeling as fresh and clean than to use a Waterpark and their sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am concerned, no one wants to lose their teeth, right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the reservoir to be just the right size for a cleaning of the whole mouth without needing refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an oral b floss action brush before and it did such a better job of keeping my teeth plaque free for the whole day.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old and 6 year old are also big fans which is great, getting kids to properly and thoroughly brush and floss isn&#x27;t always easy.</li>
            <li> Add a little mouthwash to flosser water &amp; enjoy clean teeth, gums &amp; fresh breath!  </li>
            <li> I could see where it could be too large for some spaces, especially if you have more than one.  </li>
            <li> Product works great, flosser makes a splash,a little loud.  </li>
            <li> a little loud but works great</li>
            <li> The technology is really great, and the footprint is very small.  </li>
            <li> As a couple other reviewers have mentioned, it would be nice if there were three speed settings for the toothbrush instead of two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard use the word \\&quot;love\\&quot; when referring to such a product but after having it a week I can say I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Extremely functional, and much easier and more effective than regular flossing.</li>
            <li> Had a power surge which fried the unit and Waterpik sent me a brand new unit quickly.</li>
            <li> While this product is a bit loud and messy it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Sonic Toothbrush leaves my mouth and teeth clean however the water pik does not do a complete job of removing food between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to use, but I feel like it&#x27;s doing a much better job than regular flossing ever did.  </li>
            <li> The best part, it didn&#x27;t take as long as usual and the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I got it with a low price so fair enough.</li>
            <li> Not only no bleeding, but no swollen hurt gums, and my mouth feels super clean.  </li>
            <li> It might feel funny or even hurt in the beginning, but it gets better as long as you proceed using it.</li>
            <li> So that is my only issue with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is big and holds a good amount of water.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you will find a better toothbrush for the deal- especially considering all it comes with.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is loud, too but the flosser is top notch loud.</li>
            <li> : I haven&#x27;t had the super clean, just-got-out-of-a-professional-dental-cleaning feeling outside of my visits to my dentist until I purchased the flosser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not convinced the water flosser actually does much for me, but the toothbrush is okay.</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is, I wish that the tip holding area was a bit larger, I really had to cram to get all of mine to go in, but they are safely inside now.</li>
            <li> Overall really like it, much better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Good product a bit expensive for what it is ,the information on usage is not up to spec as i need to know more.</li>
            <li> Very helpful and better than the regular flossing by the threat</li>
            <li> She described them as gentle, but I showed her the softest settings first and told her once she got used to them, then we could go to a higher setting.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll know better about how much I like it after my next dental check-up in march.</li>
            <li> I was  expecting to be able to use the water pick straight out of the box  but had to go purchase brush and floss attachments at a local store.  </li>
            <li> It sounds too loud when it works but overall a nice thing to have.</li>
            <li> So back to the old fashion dental floss, which is a shame I liked the waterpik when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Tracy</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, and it&#x27;s loud both with the pik and toothbrush, but it works and glad I got it!!</li>
            <li> the toothbrush has 2 settings, the high power setting is really powerful.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely feel the clean difference!</li>
            <li> the on/off switch could be a little more one-handed friendly.  </li>
            <li> The water flosser is actually very easy and quick to use, however the first few times you might make a mess, so keep a towel handy.  </li>
            <li> Very Good, It&#x27;s only fault is the water reservoir should be larger especially when using it</li>
            <li> Anyway, my old electric toothbrush kicked it recently, and when I went on amazon to research a replacement, I found this amazingly reviewed and very competitively-priced sonic toothbrush/water-flossing combo.</li>
            <li> I do have to point out that the first use is a real shocker with water spraying all over the place--just always use to staring at my face and opened mouth when flossing.  </li>
            <li> For all the skeptics out there, this product really works and does exactly what it says on the box.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a few weeks I am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love that the toothbrush pauses, indicating to me how long to brush each section.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long, but it sure works.</li>
            <li> The sound that the flosser emits is very similar to one of a more quiet jackhammer once its on.</li>
            <li> Works very well, toothbrush has two speeds and the higher speed is a bit noisy</li>
            <li> The waterpik has 10 settings, and once again, get used to the lower settings first, do not jump straight to the highest setting.</li>
            <li> Only been using this a few days but very happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is as good as any sonic type toothbrush (if not better), and the waterpik holds plenty of water..  </li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush is good, nothing our of the ordinary, just does its job.</li>
            <li> I hesitated upon reading others comments about the high speed being too high and that maybe an intermediate speed would be helpful but, upon buying it, I find the high speed setting to be just fine...</li>
            <li> gentle mode, the toothbrush is nowhere near as strong as the SoniCare, but on high, it&#x27;s stronger.</li>
            <li> I had been fairly satisfied with the Sonicare, but mainly because it was the only brand I have ever used, so I hadn&#x27;t compared it with anything</li>
            <li> Also, it would be nice if the toothbrush had a pause button so you could spit before toothpaste goes running down your chin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to just set the tooth brush down in the slot and see it charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to find myself feeling very self conscious about my breath by the end of the work day because I could feel a funny taste in my mouth and knew I needed to brush, now my breath stays fresh so much longer!</li>
            <li> No more bleeding from the gums (unless I put the water pressure too high) and a nice clean feeling every morning.</li>
            <li> The product is well packed, such that the flosser and toothbrush are well protected, but everything was easily opened--</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is super loud.  </li>
            <li> this was fixed with some super glue on the colored metal ring.</li>
            <li> The flosser is easily knocked off its holder which was not a problem with the earlier model.</li>
            <li> The same hygienist as before concluded that a normal cleaning was appropriate this time.  </li>
            <li> Easy controls for starting and intensity and</li>
            <li> Also, it has such easy to use force control switch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts about the quality at first - I had seen mixed reviews and it felt so light weight.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up, and she was using it the next day.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I got my first cavity filled last month</li>
            <li> Machine is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> It has multiple pics for caring for your gums, fighting plaque and just feeling really orally fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and I am able to switch up and use Periodex with the water, or my mouthwash for Dry Mouth.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this because my long time electronic toothbrush finally died and saw this combo which seemed like a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be smart guy and put a suit on then complain you have stuff all over you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am certain this will make a difference in oral health with timed brushing cycles &amp;  stimulation of gums.  </li>
            <li> It buzes at certain time intervals to tell you it has been 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> For travelers, you may want to purchase the water pick and tooth brush separately, since the combined unit is rather large.  </li>
            <li> i dont have a large space in my sink to buy 2 products separately  </li>
            <li> You can still use your favorite toothpaste and mouthwash, and its only slightly more expensive than just a plain ole waterpic.&lt;br /&gt;Update: definitely happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The product is good and looks very well made, I have 3 other waterpiks in house , every one works very well, the only easy broken part is the on/off push button on the handle, I already replaced two handles because of this ,but overall this product is very good</li>
            <li> Price is right and beats going to a dentist only for cleaning every 6 months when u can clean ur mouth as much u want anytime.</li>
            <li> I mean, it seemed good in the first place.</li>
            <li> After many decades I am not about to turn over a new leaf and start flossing daily.    </li>
            <li> Personally experienced less gum bleeding versus flossing with regular floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously had a Phillips sonicare that was much smaller and worked great for five years until the battery died.  </li>
            <li> Take it from a guy who loathes flossing, I also have a permanent brace on my bottom row of teeth, so the water pik makes cleaning down there so much easier and a lot more fun than threading a piece of string through my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it with the casual elegance of the guy in the waterpik ads, but it&#x27;s easy and fairly mess-free.    </li>
            <li> It worked fine  for only 2 weeks, after this time it started to clatter and now  it almost doesnt work........</li>
            <li> Wish I had this as a teen - so got one for my teen to set her on a path to super healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I actually use the Waterpik and regular floss, as well, to make sure my teeth are super</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product very highly.</li>
            <li> Recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> Can you say amazing little product?</li>
            <li> After using and loving this water pik for a little over a year, the battery in the toothbrush stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little gum massage too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Use on the lowest setting and work your way up, gums will bleed if its too high at first.</li>
            <li> I typically will buy things on Amazon (even if its a couple of dollars more) versus other unknown companies - even if the other company provides free shipping, because I know that I will get my item in perfect shape and in two days or less (Prime Member), and if I am less than happy with the product they will send me a packing slip to return it at no cost to me!!!  </li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, my oral hygiene has always been very good.</li>
            <li> The entire unit fits comfortably on the counter and it does not take up much.</li>
            <li> There has been a huge improvement in the overall health of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter&#x27;s mouth hardware has been fabulously cleaned and she really loves the different heads.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter&#x27;s mouth hardware has been fabulously cleaned and she really loves the different heads.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected, water pic and electric tooth brush in one and both high quality!</li>
            <li> Brushes wear out fast .</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works well.</li>
            <li> To me the brush was a bonus I really came for the Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li> but if it doesnt bother you it serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> I really feel and see the difference after using the Waterpik toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brush speeds up that process and Ive never flossed (mouth burned too much by then),</li>
            <li> I would highly recommendoubt this product!</li>
            <li> It also re-charges much faster than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It also re-charges much faster than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> only one light battery when i received</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Really gets everything out from between your teeth fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> For the rave reviews I expected it to be better, but it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The waterpic Sonic care tooth brush combo works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Too much hassle to try and return it.  </li>
            <li> Put it straight to work.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it came</li>
            <li> my teeth feel so much cleaner and easier to floss.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product combo.</li>
            <li> The Hygienist said that it was &amp;#34;excellent home care&amp;#34; that accomplished that...</li>
            <li> This waterpik is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was bummed out the brush had to charge, because I wanted to try out the whole package.</li>
            <li> Basically everyone wants it so no one gets it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> WILL REALLY VIBRATE THEM.</li>
            <li> The distal jet they had inserted in her mouth kept getting food stuck inside (as did the braces) leaving her with really obnoxious breath and a very sore mouth.</li>
            <li> Really like the all in one flosser and toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The whole package seems well thought out, with attention to the details.  </li>
            <li> The rubbery grips on it don&#x27;t seem to function very well as... rubbery grips.</li>
            <li> I REALLY want to spend another $65 to keep it alive?&amp;#34; At the end of the day, the answer to that question is a begrudging yes...</li>
            <li> so when my teeth are more sensitive I&#x27;m thankful the low setting is so gentle.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This order came fast.</li>
            <li> Really can tell a difference in how my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> so we don&#x27;t have to share) and they are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> If you have gum problems, then you really need to get this.</li>
            <li> Water pic works very well.</li>
            <li> Gentle pulsing...</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels really refreshed when done using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The water flosser makes a lot of noise, and the whole thing is plastic.</li>
            <li> of just brush 2 times I day, I really need to step up my gum and tooth regime.  </li>
            <li> but it really delivers.  </li>
            <li> The water floss works very well.</li>
            <li> recommend you start on gentle-</li>
            <li> family rarely agrees completely on anything.  </li>
            <li> Between the things that this comes with, my family (with the addition of another brush head) has found this to be really revolutionary for our tooth and gum care.  </li>
            <li> Between the things that this comes with, my family (with the addition of another brush head) has found this to be really revolutionary for our tooth and gum care.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums look and feel so much cleaner that I&#x27;m embarrassed to say how  ineffective  </li>
            <li> and you are ready to kill any plaque that dares to stand in its way.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always ready to go.</li>
            <li> It comes with a travel case that is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and am now a reformed Sonicare user!</li>
            <li> Ease of use &amp; it really does work well as a flosser.</li>
            <li> Very good!I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Pik/brush combo since the combined price made the brush very inexpensive when compared to the price of the Pik price alone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it is very  well designed with practical storage for everything.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn’t need to move the whole thing.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So much easier than flossing.</li>
            <li> teeth much whiter.</li>
            <li> After a month of proper use, I saw the dentist again, and he declared me free of gum problems, instructing me to continue using it.</li>
            <li> a big bottle of Listerine fits, this will fit.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> it really helpfull.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> My sister wants one.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well but is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush</li>
            <li> so I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a flosser, but ever since visiting my dental for my checkup and being told my gum health is borderline and that I should invest in a waterpik,  I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she likes it so much</li>
            <li> Practical and very efficient to use</li>
            <li> the feeling you get after using the waterpick is a much cleaner feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She likes it so much</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> is so much easier than flossing.</li>
            <li> But once you use the waterpik........no so much.  </li>
            <li> Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> And the waterpik really couldn&#x27;t be easier.  </li>
            <li> The whole of the world.</li>
            <li> While bulky on the bathroom counter, it performs very well.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased it for the Waterpik flosser since I didn&#x27;t really have much faith in the sonic toothbrush (my last sonic toothbrush was a Sonicare), but was I</li>
            <li> I told you how much</li>
            <li> I really like the power process for the toothbrush that is very nifty.</li>
            <li> Consolidated both functions in the WP-900.  Works very well.  </li>
            <li> my dentist checked out and I  doing very well</li>
            <li> so much  </li>
            <li> waterpik works very well.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> its quite different than those cheap ones you buy...</li>
            <li> Cleans between teeth very well .</li>
            <li> You will be amazed at how much stuff comes out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Was worried about counter space but did not take up much.</li>
            <li> The waterpik leaks out the whole water bin if the handle pops out of its cradle.</li>
            <li> For gentle, low-pressure delivery of antimicrobial rinses</li>
            <li> The tooth brush really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> Because tooth care affects my whole health I decided to stop with the piecemeal gadgets</li>
            <li> if you had brace, buy this  work very well for my wife</li>
            <li> much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it since it arrived I really like it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone who values their teeth!</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush was ready immediately</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It really cleans in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Both utensils have been upgraded and are much improved.  </li>
            <li> You would be amazed how much stuff stays between your teeth after brushing (and you see it all in the sink when you spit out the water).</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that the whole setup is in one place which makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much room on my sink either, but I don&#x27;t think that it takes up that much room.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this, it was listed as being made in USA, it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s made in China</li>
            <li> but I really like that it has one.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are being cleaned, and the fast is so jarring</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> Customer service was very polite and accommodating.</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I then switched to Braun and it worked much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But having said that I do think that this product will increase your dental health, if it holds up and doesn&#x27;t leak too much, that is.</li>
            <li> but it is quite compact and will fit in any standard shelf (NOT the med cabinet</li>
            <li> i can tell is i am really in awe from this machine.</li>
            <li> i can tell is i am really in awe from this machine.</li>
            <li> wish I had bought one years ago, probably wouldn&#x27;t be having dental surgery very soon...</li>
            <li> You never know how much stuff gets into your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It amazes me how much the flosser rinses out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well for me if I brush for the 1.5 to 2 min.....  </li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t travel with it really.  </li>
            <li> after using a sense of purity for the whole day, I recommend)))</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is kept on charger so it is always ready.</li>
            <li> really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It seems that they&#x27;re only available on line.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the difference from the cheap Spinbrush I purchased from the local store while my toothbrush was out of commission.  </li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.   </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I just purchased another one for another family member who got braces and he is using it very well.</li>
            <li> They replaced the whole thing under warranty.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how much cleaner my teeth would look and feel after using the toothbrush and water flosser.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and I was really noticing stains and buildup of plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> As my dentist says, I have a very &amp;#34;crowded&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I take the tooth brush with me when I travel, but not the whole flosser -</li>
            <li> This unit works well but the water flosser does not do a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the teeth and gums, you can see the results in the sink.  </li>
            <li> All what I expected, even the hygienist is pleased with the results of the product.</li>
            <li> and I am really sold.</li>
            <li> The irrigator is just a  straight line of water.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely blown away with the performance (but not the structural integrity) of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up too much real estate, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t travel with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner since purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> If a person has only one hand available to use it would be tricky.</li>
            <li> Do you really want the kids grubby hands rooting around trying to do this every morning?  </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in your gums after a month using it.</li>
            <li> I really like having the brush and the water in one.</li>
            <li> The item is straight forward and the instruction tell you how to use the waterpik.</li>
            <li> fast shiped&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much cleaner my mouth feels, and I was a diligent brusher before.</li>
            <li> Even better then I expected.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is always charged and ready to go</li>
            <li> and my husband absolutely loves the waterpik.</li>
            <li> MY TEETH AND GUMS FEEL SO MUCH HEALTHER AND CLEANER.</li>
            <li> i called waterpik; their customer service was very polite and helpful.</li>
            <li> an really cleans</li>
            <li> but at much lower cost.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This machine does it all very well.</li>
            <li> I feel as though the spaces between my teeth and my gums are much cleaner after using this product.  </li>
            <li> And, though the product feels very flimsy, it is very functional.  </li>
            <li> As an experiment for this brush, my cleaning habits will not change much.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans all the stuff out.</li>
            <li> That holds it real</li>
            <li> Like it so much that it is what my kids are getting for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Waterpik should really consider improving that</li>
            <li> there is no way of recharging without taking the whole unit with you.&lt;br /&gt;Other than online, no one sells the flossers.</li>
            <li> really cleans underneath the rings on my braces like floss could not.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much counter space and having the sonic toothbrush as part of it</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> problem I have seen is that it uses water fast so you might have to refill the cup often.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really like the power of the water pic and the 2 speeds of the brush.  </li>
            <li> The product is built really well.</li>
            <li> And being in one unit, it is a very convenient reminder to use both sides in my dental health care program.  </li>
            <li> and i knew i really needed to with them</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush as much as the water flosser.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of weeks to get used to, but eventually you&#x27;ll crank it up to 10 and be amazed at how much stuff this device will take out of your gums.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve really got to try this.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all one unit that doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I also like the quad timer - it keeps me from focusing too much on one area of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I find the toothbrush okay, but I feel the bristles are too widely spaced; I still feel roughness on my tooth surfaces after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because I expected that most of them were going to leak in some form or another.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me.</li>
            <li> and the bristles really clearing out between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The floss water does get in-between my teeth really well</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it really does give you the feeling of going to your dentist...</li>
            <li> Works great and at only a fraction of the cost from such stores  stores such as Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product has improved my teeth and gum health so much.</li>
            <li> The whole family can use by trading out brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have two crowns and this really gets all the yuck out.</li>
            <li> was surprised how powerful the water flosser is.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat compact and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to mind much, but then I&#x27;ve been doing their teeth since they were babies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big to fit on the landing in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like doing negative reviews and tend to have a bit of mercy with companies if they&#x27;ve supplied good customer service when there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> The pick also has a pause button which is nice and keeps things from getting messy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I have sensitive problem gums and the sonic brush with its soft bristles is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this after get adult braces and only this and went to my latest dental exam</li>
            <li> Surprised to see how many particles regular flossing doesn&#x27;t  get out of teeth.  </li>
            <li> This replaces my old Waterpik unit I used for many years, but the plastic has finally met</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few months ago and liked it however now it does not work and</li>
            <li> On the face of it, this seems like good value, but the quality is too poor to make it worth buying.</li>
            <li> At first the high speed feels very intense, but in the long run, if you work up to it, it really does clean the teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> So easy to use, can&#x27;t believe how much debris is left over after normal brushing.</li>
            <li> Beats the toothbrush by far!!!</li>
            <li> the battery pack is soldered directly into the board!!!</li>
            <li> When I went to the dentist last week for a cleaning the hygienist commented &amp;#34;you certainly don&#x27;t leave much for me to clean, do you?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it is a quick and easy way to remove all those little pieces of spinach or not or whatever straight after meals.&lt;br /&gt;start</li>
            <li> low and super high!!</li>
            <li> I know this because I took our 1st one apart, we don&#x27;t live in the States and my wife fried our first one by plugging it into a 220v socket...</li>
            <li> First one did not work at all water pic sent me new one</li>
            <li> system comes with 2 classic tips, 1 plaque seeker tip, and pik pocket tip, a large toothbrush head and a compact toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> system comes with 2 classic tips, 1 plaque seeker tip, and pik pocket tip, a large toothbrush head and a compact toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> The little one also (very surprisingly) loves to use the water flosser, wants to do it even longer than the typical 90 seconds, and is eager to try all the attachments.</li>
            <li> I really like the deep clean feeling after using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So I came across this package, which was only a few bucks more and got me a very cool Cordless, rechargeable sonic toothbrush,</li>
            <li> excited I fired up the pick head and did front and back.</li>
            <li> sonic toothbrush is better than the other leading brand.  </li>
            <li> Last August I got braces and it quickly became apparent that keeping my teeth clean would be a challenge.  </li>
            <li> Once the brush is done, we remove the top and stand it up in the unit or other storage</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is better than the other ultrasonic one.  </li>
            <li> Once the on button is pressed, you get the sensitive setting first and then the normal setting (something I wasn&#x27;t aware of until I tried turning off the toothbrush).</li>
            <li> This combination toothbrush/water pick unit is space saving and works just as well as the original individual units.</li>
            <li> After first use feels like professional teeth cleaning from dentist!</li>
            <li> The Waterpik model, especially compared with many of the Sonicare models, is pretty basic.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially pointing a small, high-powered hose at your face, but after the first use, I&#x27;ve successfully used it without covering myself/</li>
            <li> I bought it for the Waterpik feature to try to prevent losing more teeth due to ill-fitting implants.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660) on Prime Day but ended up returning it because it didn&#x27;t seem to produce enough pressure.  </li>
            <li> My gums do look a bit healthier and I am only using original Listerine and Hydrogen Peroxide as my cleaning material.</li>
            <li> The waterpik feature always makes me feel that I am getting my mouth so much cleaner, particularly coupled with flossing and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it to clean my electric razor next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently thinking of getting one for my wife,she likes the way mine clean s my teeth</li>
            <li> Holds 20oz of water, which isn&#x27;t much when you &#x27;prime&#x27; the unit, but refill after that and 20oz lasts a decent while.</li>
            <li> The water flosser is plenty powerful and I didn&#x27;t know at first if what I was feeling was actually doing anything.  </li>
            <li> I have recently gotten braces, and this makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth only feels this clean after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> It cleans, flosses, and messages the gums in such a way that your teeth feel as clean as they do after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Two months of using the system and my teeth still feel as clean as the last time I had them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is solid and gets everything squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Initially there will be clean up while you get used to flooding your mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth feel so clean after using this its almost like the same feeling as if I just had my teeth polished!</li>
            <li> The clear plastic reservoir  makes it easy to track how much water is left during your cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the amount of food that the water pic removed from between my teeth, I found using the mid range on the jet dial worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> Fill the reservoir of half mouthwash and half luke warm water, and your teeth will reach a whole new level of clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Shipper was fast and efficient would highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> My dentist HIGHLY recommended that I buy an electronic toothbrush so after much reviewing</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are looking to have the absolute cleanest teeth on the block for the price of 1x dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the high is a bit too fast.  </li>
            <li> Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.</li>
            <li> Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.</li>
            <li> is sending me a entire new unit to keep for free.</li>
            <li> I said above, this unit has the ability to change the strength of the stream from soft to strong, with settings ranging from 1 to 10.</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and they were the reason I purchased this unit, it is gentle enough for the braces to be safe but it also has enough water pressure to clean throughly.</li>
            <li> Also the waterpik device is a little fussy as to placement in its holder, and can fall out easily if you don&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li> Mine has 10 jet pulse options, which is why I clearly put the exact item description in my title...</li>
            <li> We all have our own preferences and usually there are things we disagree on even if we agree.  </li>
            <li> Far better than my old standard electric that always felt like it was assaulting my gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor surprised me the first time I turned it on.</li>
            <li> I travel 17 days a month and a full charge only lasts about two weeks</li>
            <li> My mouth feels like I just had a deep cleaning done at the dentists and not a painful one either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product but definitely not a 5-star one either.</li>
            <li> The high is every powerful, get used to the low setting first before trying the high one.</li>
            <li> Works great- be sure to clean between the brush head &amp; base regularly.</li>
            <li> Make sure you seat the water container all the way down or else it may leak.</li>
            <li> The waterpik is forceful but can be turned down, which I love.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars.</li>
            <li> But I can live with it!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> Slightly less powerful than my original 1999 waterpik</li>
            <li> I really like my new Waterpic, does everything that I want it to do.</li>
            <li> So now I have to buy a whole new unit since the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer was easy to work with, but I am surprised they would rather send a new (different) replacement product than fix the one with the problem.</li>
            <li> The product worked much better than the previous flosser</li>
            <li> Love that this takes up so much less space.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the previous model</li>
            <li> The bonus of a sufficiently sized reservoir that allows me to do my entire mouth without refill and a toothbrush that has easily sensed signally at 30 second intervals while brushing only confirmed my satisfaction with this unit.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I cannot believe what was being missed during my previous brushing processes.</li>
            <li> I was told that I had slight gum disease and that I need to do better at flossing.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is powerful but gentle at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t particularly find anything that differentiates it from a $20 electric brush.  </li>
            <li> and so is the pick, but you have train yourself to turn it off and on at the main control, because the push button quit working almost immediately.</li>
            <li> the 2 week battery life is most likely on low setting .the</li>
            <li> When the Orthodontist recommended this particular waterpik for our teenager, we had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I made her open the box when it arrived and received only an &amp;#34;Oh, OK...</li>
            <li> love that it has several different tips depending on what needs to be flossed</li>
            <li> (although I am lucky I just need to use the standard tip).</li>
            <li> I have noticed now that beyond the routine morning/night use, I find myself constantly using this for a quick but thorough rinse after meals, snacks or coffee.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve gotten better about not spraying the whole bathroom, You do have a pause button on the handle, but you need to press it firmly to suppress the water flow, otherwise, it will leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love the different heads that come with the waterflosser and the especially the fact that we don&#x27;t have to use wax floss!!</li>
            <li> The tank runs through the water in about 30 seconds, which is more than enough time to go between all of your teeth and go back and hit any areas</li>
            <li> First of all, the first time, the blue basin comes out of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I seen the same pic at costco for more and I purchased here with a combo sonic brush and water pic for the same price.</li>
            <li> Love the different water pressure settings and various brushes included.</li>
            <li> I really like this product,very enjoying everyday to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always brushed my teeth simply out of obligation to keeping a healthy mouth....</li>
            <li> I replaced a sonicare toothbrush and older waterpik with this model which is all I need.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the adjustment of water pressure, and the two speeds of the brush.</li>
            <li> Classic Jet Tip -</li>
            <li> Far better than i expected it to.</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily and see my teeth brightening quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had the older model for years until it broke</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has a redesigned handle...not as fat as the older one.  </li>
            <li> the toothbrush is an extra plus) and so does my husband since we share the waterpik - although we do use different toothbrush attachments :)  My mouth feels cleaner</li>
            <li> The most recent was purchased in August 2014 and it blew a hole in the waterpik hose this week (2 months later).  </li>
            <li> The cord is a decent length.</li>
            <li> i got my return label in the mail quickly and mailed it back to them.</li>
            <li> The simple way it&#x27;s constructed will make it much easier to keep clean than my old one.</li>
            <li> Maybe you will get lucky, I personally did&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> And it comes with many different attachments (which all have a dedicated storage area next to the water</li>
            <li> Love it and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Includes a carrying case for two brush heads and the main brush itself.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that both the toothbrush and waterpik are combined.</li>
            <li> be careful strong water</li>
            <li> I love the larger toothbrush area and high speed setting, some newer toothbrushes are smaller with one speed</li>
            <li> /&gt;The floss pressure gets pretty high actually and the pressure works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I found the 1st setting to be too soft and the 2nd setting to be too high, no mid-range available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive he will continue using it even after his jaw is fixed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this combo for adults, older children, and teens.</li>
            <li> This cheap little thing cannot keep your teeth as clean as the traditional flosser, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the whole build quality is rather</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t very consistent with traditional floss, but loves using this 100%!</li>
            <li> The water glosser is easy although messy at first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I am sure these are normally recmmended for anyone with braces (which I had previously, and this IS a must-have)</li>
            <li> It was great until then but the failure means the total cost was about twenty five dollars a week to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> (at first I felt like I was being electrocuted when I turned on the brush), as it&#x27;s not a conventional motor that drives the brush...</li>
            <li> and i would highly recommend to a friend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doreen</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this unit.</li>
            <li> oh high.</li>
            <li> I now use the high setting and both brush heads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> the machine (sonic brush) had a problem on high speed while still under warranty.  </li>
            <li> , I have used the waterpik flosser on medium after brushing my teeth on high speed.  </li>
            <li> , I have used the waterpik flosser on medium after brushing my teeth on high speed.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Both are high quality</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t start on high speed....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> item was highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> End price is kinda high for the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective the water flosser is as my hygenist said you really need the mechanical action of  normal floss to remove plaque.</li>
            <li> ;  ,this is high praise indeed.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me on high at all.  </li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> though the high setting on both of these tools are Rambo-eque.</li>
            <li> It has two speeds, which I use the high speed.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend the investment.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik does its job and the brush on high speed</li>
            <li> The waterpik handle is too high in the holder.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> irritate the sensitive part of my gums - neither the brush nor the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;-Small brush head and a large brush head.  </li>
            <li> The new motor is lighter and may be louder than the previous motor making it more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife loves the brush and plans to use it as her travel brush since it is a little more compact than the one she has been using.</li>
            <li> A little noisy, but works fantastic!</li>
            <li> takes up little space on the counter top</li>
            <li> and it works to get the mouthwash into your teeth / gum areas a little better than just swishing the stuff in your mouth.</li>
            <li> however anyone wanting a little more focus on their teeth-health care should invest in this.</li>
            <li> As an adult who recently got braces I was looking for something to help keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> exactly the same cost as a whole new WP-900!</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to believe</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very high quality, I like that it runs a bit stronger than my old Sonicare and the flosser has an attachment for everything.</li>
            <li> Aside from those things you can make a huge mess with this, which I know I will just have to learn how to use it properly over time to get the best results, but first few times you are guaranteed to get a few puddles on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the reasons listed, I give this product &amp;#34;its ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You can set the toothbrush on gentle speed (sensitive teeth might like this one) or high speed.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it as Teeth care is highly important,lost my step dad to tooth infection so you can never do enough for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Make sure you press the water flosser button down before you turn it on, it will spray everywhere!</li>
            <li> I love that the brush has a 2-minute timer, so there&#x27;s no excuse to brush less than we are told;).</li>
            <li> So far it works really well.</li>
            <li> but i dont really care, i rather use the old school toothbrush on the tongue</li>
            <li> The product works really well with my adult braces.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely content that my flossing regiment is so much improved.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a complaint, just a comment to give readers and idea of my experience with the pulse jet stream.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a complaint, just a comment to give readers and idea of my experience with the pulse jet stream.</li>
            <li> I have had such success with my waterpik and toothbrush after getting braces, that my step daughter begs me to allow her to waterpik her teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, I was told to leave my mouth slightly open over the sink to let the used water pour out as the flosser shoots fresh water in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do the reviews, but I had to on this one.  </li>
            <li> Not a problem for a normal person setting it up for themselves.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to sustain such a long period of flossing.</li>
            <li> The brush battery has lasted over a long weekend (4 full days) without a recharge, and that&#x27;s with brushing twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the toothbrush goes, the head is pretty soft.  </li>
            <li> As long as it meets the ultimate goal I will learn to love this thing.</li>
            <li> I just wish the toothbrush bristles were more firm.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt fresh as if I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Contacted WaterPic and received a return authorization, but decided not to waste any more time with this company or their products.</li>
            <li> using the pause button, make sure to do two things:  keep the dial set at 3 or below, and press the button firmly.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep the button depressed to keep the water from squirting out and release the button on the water Pik handle to get the water to come out which I believe is CONTRARY, BACKWARD to how things normally work in this world.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Love using it everyday</li>
            <li> Having both in one setup is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> This is a good Product - not a great one.</li>
            <li> Instead, I refill it with a glass of water at the desired temperature (good for one use), and I&#x27;m no longer annoyed.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of starting at the high setting right off the bat and it hurt.  </li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this product for the new design of the waterpik unit.</li>
            <li> And, thanks to a few fillings from a young dentist, many of my teeth are now very sensitive to flossing.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a toothbrush like this in a very long time, and glad to make the switch back.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is well sized for a complete cleaning, and is easy to fill and empty.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir does not  stay full long!</li>
            <li> I certainly hope this investment pays off at my next check-up; it certainly makes my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> To have the Sonic toothbrush right there at hand is an extra added bonus.  </li>
            <li> Dentist-recommended Sonicare died over the summer, right after a big car and home repair</li>
            <li> After using this for a short time my teeth felt cleaner then right after a dentist visit.</li>
            <li> I can never go back to regular toothbrush and this flosser is perfect since I had such a hard time flossing before.</li>
            <li> I am not Type-A enough to use the different picks, being satisfied with the general purpose pick.</li>
            <li> works great - a little messy to use until  </li>
            <li> I have to drag the entire unit right next to the sink because it doesn&#x27;t stretch out more than a foot or so.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush, my teeth feel like I just left the dentist EVERY single day!</li>
            <li> I needed a new toothbrush since mine died and my dentist has been suggesting a waterpik.</li>
            <li> and you must buy a new tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> This new combo unit is a space saver, and I like the sonic tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; orthodontist gives these away to all his new ortho patients.</li>
            <li> and they express mailed me a new one</li>
            <li> I will update with any new insight or information.</li>
            <li> I will update with any new insight or information.</li>
            <li> My brand new toothbrush lasts under 2 weeks, brushing twice, on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> and I have to buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After the leak, they sent me out new gaskets and they helped somewhat..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to be without a new one on hand.</li>
            <li> As you might suspect since this is a 3-Waterpik household, I feel like I can&#x27;t live without a Waterpik.</li>
            <li> one thing I don&#x27;t like is the new on / off switch that must be turned rather than toggled as you can not do this one handed....</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are going to send me a new unit.   </li>
            <li> I want a new unopened item not someone else&#x27;s reject.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this.</li>
            <li> I need a new electric toothbrush as I was having should surgery..</li>
            <li> I would like to return the Toothbrush (without the brush head) of course, and get a new one.</li>
            <li> but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> how did i live without this before?</li>
            <li> A new unit was received and works well.</li>
            <li> I live this system.</li>
            <li> but this product took it to an entirely new level.</li>
            <li> my gums thank me for the new Waterpik.</li>
            <li> It was time to get new ones.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, the battery charges wirelessly when you insert it into its little cradle; very cool feature.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is not what I had expected - it has a sonic style movement and my teeth feel as clean as when the dentist has done a cleaning job.  </li>
            <li> So, i expected 2 (am + pm) uses a day will keep it somewhat clean.</li>
            <li> This multi-purpose tool does it all with multiple heads for the waterpik: removes trapped food debris, cleans below the gum line where damaging decay can begin, and the sonic toothbrush finishes with a nice polish.  </li>
            <li> My sonicare brush was slow, this one vibrates FAST, and seems like it will do a better job.  </li>
            <li> After that I simply make sure that the water pick hose is empty when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, especially if your conscious about oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> While the unit is larger than just a toothbrush-only charging unit, it really doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my bathroom counter.   </li>
            <li> Works very well, however, I really think the waterpik flosser start button should have been designed differently.</li>
            <li> The mini gets into all the crevices and behind the teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful compared to other water jets from walmart.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I have limited counter space and only a 2-plug outlet near the bathroom sink so this combination unit seemed ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Superior to all other similar products by a long shot.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, inspite of the &amp;#34;better than sonicare&amp;#34; high and mighty claims on the electric toothbrush, it falls way below par even compared to Oral B Pro-Health Power, hence the product gets a less than 5 star rating (I would still rate the water flosser at 5 stars).</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with flossing using different types of floss; my gums are tightly packed, so there&#x27;s no way I can have a good experience using traditional techniques.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums start the pick on the lowest level as it could take paint of a house on high..  </li>
            <li> I use the high speed and my teeth are sensitive and I have no pain.</li>
            <li> Very professional piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> Works well, but very loud.</li>
            <li> and it is very loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little smaller as a unit which makes it fit better on the limited space of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use the classic jet tip for now, and eventually I will use the pik pocket top once my teeth have been deep cleaned and settle down.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use the classic jet tip for now, and eventually I will use the pik pocket top once my teeth have been deep cleaned and settle down.  </li>
            <li> Easy to floss quickly on tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Small learning curve to avoid mess, but still gets great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> mouth feels a lot more cleaner using the flosser, although I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep using the electric toothbrush because it hurts my teeth a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wonder, just buy, I am excited to use the other heads as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been the type of person who is regular with brushing and mouth-washing, but struggled to consistently floss.</li>
            <li> the combo of the sonic toothbrush and water flossing is much more thorough than anything I&#x27;ve done in the past.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well, and leaves my mouth feeling much better than it does after a regular use of dental floss.  </li>
            <li> It is small that you are able to travel with.  </li>
            <li> After figuring out the button I wanted to see the thing in action!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Not so sure if power overall is equal to 2 products separately but will purchase for the second home.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would be willing to pay another $25.00 if the product had those upgrades.</li>
            <li> Waterpik&#x27;s sonic toothbrush also comes with two brush heads: a normal one and one for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> the darn thing nearly blew up!</li>
            <li> This product making brushing and flossing an EPIC experience!</li>
            <li> I have never had waterflossers before, and it is possible that i had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li> That was my first venture in powered tooth brushing and not my last.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, you will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time with a water pik, kept putting it off because I didn&#x27;t think it would make any different.  </li>
            <li> I use the first speed setting, which means, to turn the brush off, I need to switch to the second speed.</li>
            <li> After going back to the instructions, it said to work yourself up to the higher settings.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Waterpic and the first one with the tooth brush in the unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i felt the different  the first time i used it  </li>
            <li> but at the beginning i only used it in the first 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All they asked was that I send the first unit back to them using their mailing label.</li>
            <li> It did not work from the first use what to do to get it returned back or change it with another working one?</li>
            <li> At first I feared possible mold build up, but this product is well designed, so mold should not be an issue.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s different tips for different cleanings, different pressure settings, and even a sonic toothbrush because if you&#x27;re going to put this doesn&#x27;t-match-with-most-of-your-bathroom gadget on your sink, it better have a bunch of uses.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not something you should plan on using outside of your sleeping baby&#x27;s or significant others room.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this consistently for the last two months with mouth wash, and let me tell you, the pain is gone.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for that small issue, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> : I figured she&#x27;d be delighted with the gift, especially since it was set to arrive a few weeks before her next cleaning.</li>
            <li> so flossing isn&#x27;t easy and as a result I do it far less than I should.  </li>
            <li> I definitely know that I am getting my teeth and gums as clean as possible from food particles after flossing, brushing and using the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, water tank is a little bit small though.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean, other than a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have bonded retainers on top and bottom following having braces and it&#x27;s tough to clean around them.  </li>
            <li> They said a complete new unit would be shipped and I should receive it within 10 days.</li>
            <li> charges very quickly...and a full brushing of my teeth leaves all three of the green lights still illuminated.  </li>
            <li> Cheap product, mine stopped working after less than eight months.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and takes just a few minutes and your done.</li>
            <li> Some cons: The water pump for the flosser is pretty loud, especially when you turn the pressure up morethan halfway, which is every time for me.</li>
            <li> performs as expected; quick delivery</li>
            <li> The convenience of having the the rechargeable brush and &#x27;power washer&#x27; contained in one unit (with a single plug) is worth the price to me alone.  </li>
            <li> Read a number of reviews prior to purchasing this item; positive &amp; problematic.</li>
            <li> I found that when it&#x27;s at full strength, the water jet can feel a bit sharp and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> I found that when it&#x27;s at full strength, the water jet can feel a bit sharp and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> Whats really cool is the toothbrush pauses for a second to let you know its time to move to the next section to complete a 2 min brushing time</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I never actually used a water flosser before and thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be good for me to use</li>
            <li> Why not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new complete unit with the sonic toothbrush is truly COMPLETE.</li>
            <li> Plastic reservoir seems brittle, but has survived several falls; just wish it fit in a place to dry.</li>
            <li> Consider how much you spend each year on the dentist/orthodontist and decide if it&#x27;s worth less visits and cleaner braces to go this route.</li>
            <li> it took longer than i expected to receive my second one, but it worked like a charm and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is also easier, in general, and in particular it is easier on my hands than wrapping that floss around my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am due for a cleaning after a long period of not being able to afford any, and since getting this system, I have found that my teeth have been looking cleaner and cleaner as I continue to use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If yours is a designer bathroom you perhaps won&#x27;t care for the bright blue and white color scheme, but that&#x27;s the only down side I can see so far.</li>
            <li> water pick reservoir is large enough for my needs...</li>
            <li> The only thing, it is quite large,</li>
            <li> I have always had a lot of dental issues, but my last cleaning at the dentist went great, even though I was past due-</li>
            <li> And no matter how long or thorough I brush, I still don&#x27;t get the same clean feel as with my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but once I got it down I am amazed on how clean my mouth feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> Multiple pressure settings, the highest of which is very strong, to the point that I&#x27;m not sure what it would be used for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As noted, the toothbrush arrives with two different sized heads, but they&#x27;re both standard toothbrush shape and the smaller will work fine for an adult.</li>
            <li> Just be careful using the high settings you can make your gums bleed very quick-like, but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Definitely could wake up a light sleeper in an adjacent room, even with the door closed.</li>
            <li> the lady on the line (or the customer service in general) – she wasn&#x27;t even interested in helping me, and was unapologetic – even my 2 initial emails to their customer service went unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two clear glass parts are detachable for washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The low setting is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> NOTE the brush is loud</li>
            <li> Ill most likely come back to do an update but in the event that I dont you should know that I am very much enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> always feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> It has indicator lights to tell you how charged the battery is, whether 1/3, 2/3 or completely charged, which the Sonicare does not have and which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has indicator lights to tell you how charged the battery is, whether 1/3, 2/3 or completely charged, which the Sonicare does not have and which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is like having a professional cleaning every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an antibacterial rinse in the waterpik water for complete dental health program.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s so loud, like a mini jack hammer.</li>
            <li> once again  added  old  fashioned flossing  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 6 months now.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because as an adult I just got braces.  </li>
            <li> I may make it through these two years of adult awkwardness after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care</li>
            <li> 2 old items with this all in one,&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> too much stuff, too big on the counter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who just got braces.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Only real foreseeable issue?</li>
            <li> but by now, a lot of the old Sonicare patents have expired.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned the waterpik complete care water flosser and sonic toothbrush for a while now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush is too soft, for me; I&#x27;d like a &#x27;medium&#x27; brush and am trying to find one.</li>
            <li> but once I&#x27;ve seen the complete oral care of course I am going to invest.</li>
            <li> The only setback is that I have to fill the tank after each use, but it lasts the whole time I use it.</li>
            <li> the tips/brushes are soft, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> No problems so far.</li>
            <li> especially, how much cleaner my mouth feels after I&#x27;ve used the water flosser.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this vs using a regular toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li> It beats flossing the old way 100%.</li>
            <li> But, if you have a wife with a perverse sense of humour who under the guise of being helpful sets up your toothbrush, puts toothpaste on it, but then doesn&#x27;t insert the flosser completely, watch out.</li>
            <li> Real test is next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> Next after a week of using the unit I flossed my teeth to see how much it was removing.  </li>
            <li> A complete dental hygiene unit.</li>
            <li> I called Waterpik and without any problems they are completely taking care of me (and it)</li>
            <li> This far exceeds that old one.</li>
            <li> IS THE WATERPIK COMPLETE CARE SYSTEM LIKE?&lt;br /&gt;(In</li>
            <li> It needs to be near an outlet which should be near the sink that you plan to use this system in.  </li>
            <li> My husband turns his head completely to the side, letting the stream of water run out of the corner of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> so it is ready to go next time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really put up a review sent this back barb</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys this quality double purpose appliance!</li>
            <li> Seems loud when use toothbrush.</li>
            <li> what I know now about teeth I woulda done things a whole lot differently!  </li>
            <li> It is fairly loud.</li>
            <li> enough to travel with whole unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself, but it was commandeered by the 7 year old, who has some issues brushing well.  </li>
            <li> Recently just got braces and the waterprik has been very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a feature where it does 30 second intervals for each four quadrants of the mouth and has two speed settings.</li>
            <li> The reason for knocking out a star is that it is EXTREMELY loud.</li>
            <li> Completely backwards from what it should be.</li>
            <li> I really feel like I need a middle ground.  </li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and never used a waterpik before</li>
            <li> We kept the old one just for a spare water pic.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after using this product vs. a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about 2 months - no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care</li>
            <li> I have been a Waterpik customer for years, and even though by old unit worked well, I decided to replace it with the Waterpik complete care unit.  </li>
            <li> : The toothbrush itself has two settings: one sensitive teeth and non-sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> : The toothbrush can be a bit loud when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but 2nd level seems much stronger for me.</li>
            <li> so much easier than standard tooth brushes....and a quality job.</li>
            <li> this far exceeded my expectations..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothbrush: Wow, this toothbrush is fantastic and conveniently times 30 second intervals and shuts off after 2 minutes to ensure you pay proper attention to each area of your mouth and don&#x27;t fall short of your 2 minute brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush is a bit loud</li>
            <li> Complete Care Combination Water Flosser + Sonic Toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;  1 Standard Sonic Toothbrush Head - Gently target hard-to-reach areas</li>
            <li> I am old, the periodontist&#x27;s dental hygienist told me to get on if I wished to save my molars--</li>
            <li> Both work so far</li>
            <li> Really like the double treatment of flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> like I just had them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare had died, so I bought the Waterpik Complete Care.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always struggled with flossing my back teeth that are really close together.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush (WP-900)&lt;br /&gt;I am in awe.</li>
            <li> yes a bit loud but not a jackhammer as described,</li>
            <li> sheesh people are SO sensitive</li>
            <li> I purchased this waterpik complete for myself</li>
            <li> Teeth feel like they were professionally cleaned every day.  </li>
            <li> I have several bridges and it really works well for them.</li>
            <li> Really a complete mouth care system.</li>
            <li> and I told them I am using my Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser .</li>
            <li> My gum health has already improved considerably.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Sonicare toothbrush with the Waterpik Complete care......</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the toothbrush unit on here at all, I prefer regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This will suffice until I get a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their oral care habits, like</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised how this unit worked on plaque, whitened my teeth and cleaned food from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Her old Waterpik was just the flosser, which she had for years once the pump went out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I cannot emphasize enough how much better/quicker</li>
            <li> I had their old sonic toothbrush and the ultrasonic waterpik...</li>
            <li> I was considering professional teeth whitening before buying.</li>
            <li> I told all of my adult kids they are getting these for Christmas and</li>
            <li> lets start by saying i am 1 22 years old  who decided to give her teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and just had braces put on my teeth.</li>
            <li> CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY.</li>
            <li> I have only had 2 cavities my whole life.</li>
            <li> This has a soft bristle brush and removes all the plaque without the vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found they last very well</li>
            <li> so I ordered the Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Tooth Brush.  </li>
            <li> I just received this item and so far I like the way it works.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for adult daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I recommend it so far.</li>
            <li> And the water flosser , when turned up to &amp;#34;maximum power&amp;#34; becomes obnoxiously loud.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 97 year old father who refused to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> Even my 4 year old loves how it feels on his gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dentist even mentioned to me that my mouth was much healthier than my last visit.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a whole lot of water being sent into your mouth over a short period of time</li>
            <li> Would recommend this complete care to everyone</li>
            <li> It is near imposable to get all of the stuff out between your teeth with floss.  </li>
            <li> is too much money to pay for a device that doesn&#x27;t even last six months.</li>
            <li> , I AM 60 YEARS OLD AND CAN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> It gets under and between very well especially in max setting 9 or 10.  </li>
            <li> Bone loss at extraction made food traps between implants and natural teeth.  </li>
            <li> The one problem I had was that the machine itself is loud.  </li>
            <li> Really loud.  </li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Just wow.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the toothbrush features.</li>
            <li> It takes a few more minutes because it uses a timer to tell&lt;br /&gt;You when to move to the next quadrant but coffee and tea stains are now gone.</li>
            <li> The product is worth every penny I spent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise on stayed the first few times in lower settings.the first time I use the water</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is nice though the low setting seem a bit too slow.</li>
            <li> The dentist wanted about $7,000 to replace four good teeth with fake ones; this unit solved the problem and I still have my teeth.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush with rechargeable storage base &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered had a missing item (it was from another seller) and was quickly replaced with another one from a different seller.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Now after about 4 months of use i will never go back to a normal tooth brush!</li>
            <li> That, combined with the waterflosser gives you such a complete clean that it becomes quite addictive to use.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to hearing my dentists opinion on the next visit.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Toothbrush is a little too bulky and I&#x27;d have preferred 3 speeds: clean, soft, &amp; Massage, rather than 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> I received the Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care and while the Water Flosser works fine, the Sonic Toothbrush had no charge, so I was not able to try it at all</li>
            <li> Others had less power and were less effective in removing/ preventing plaque.</li>
            <li> The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of my older oral-brush I gave up - but the cleaning action is identical.</li>
            <li> I already have an older model Waterpik (Classique Professional) and recently bought this one for my husband as well as the cordless travel</li>
            <li> The Sonic Toothbrush cannot charge unless we let the light in the bathroom on for a long time, which wastes too much power.</li>
            <li> I dropped by Waterpik and broke it, so  decided to go for this more compact model for my very small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The change included changing our motors to a high voltage direct current style, reducing the wattage consumption from 34 watts to 14 watts.</li>
            <li> on high it even blasts away old toothpaste left on the sink from six inches away.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get used to using the water flosser if you haven&#x27;t used one before, and honestly, it&#x27;s easy to get the whole bathroom wet with this thing.</li>
            <li> The brush head of the Sonicare also gets really sloppy and the inside of the handle has a well which gets very wet and has to be, with great difficulty, scrubbed out to remove mold buildup.</li>
            <li> I would like to blame it on having messy kids, but even when I use it, there is always a puddle of water on the counter that needs to be wiped clean.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is heavy duty with a lot of vibration and it gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and my mouth has never felt as clean as it does now</li>
            <li> I love the water pick, and the toothbrush is comparable to a Sonicare without being ridiculously pricey.</li>
            <li> I obviously didn&#x27;t look into it enough when I purchased my first electric toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> We are realizing the benefits of thorough dental cleaning, especially now that we are getting older.</li>
            <li> The water flossed removed many small particles of food and debris that were left by brushing.</li>
            <li> it basically does the same thing as the older model--remove whatever food particles are stuck between your teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this as our main toothbrush and just use different heads</li>
            <li> The other models hold it securely in the middle of the handle, apparently they wanted to save a cent or two in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add  a little mouthwash for a cool tingling was floss.  </li>
            <li> One feature that I like is the little pause as it times the brushing of each quadrant of your mouth and shuts off after a full 2 minute cycle.</li>
            <li> For other buyers just remember to run white vinager through the machine once a month to clean the lines that may cause buildup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only had mine for 35 days and the sonic toothbrush quit on the high gear.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality electric toothbrush, this is definitely not what you want.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to all and especially to those that struggle with gum and peridonist disease.  </li>
            <li> I used the low settingas well as the high setting.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself has two speeds, low and high.</li>
            <li> High power takes some getting used to, perhaps a medium setting for the next model.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I have found one or two tiny pieces wedged in high up on the tooth, but that is it.  </li>
            <li> I have found one or two tiny pieces wedged in high up on the tooth, but that is it.  </li>
            <li> prefer a mid-speed setting instead of just low and high, but I&#x27;m over</li>
            <li> The toothbrush vibrates and has a high speed or low speed.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this item for those who have difficulty regularly flossing like I do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and wish I had bought one earlier.</li>
            <li> Pressure high enough.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has two settings, a low and a high setting.</li>
            <li> It just fast-streams the water out of the Waterpik regardless of setting, making it a mess to use and emptying the reservoir really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Yes, at first, I will admit getting used to barely on or turbo brush was a little much...</li>
            <li> But, now that i have been using the new toothbrush for about a month i am starting to notice it makes a bit of a different sound, like something is starting to come loose.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t like that, and neither did I because I missed that ultra clean feeling it had given me for the previous 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd unit we purchased is working as advertised, so far no problems with battery life on the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of electronic toothbrushes in the past, and I can comfortably say that this is the finest I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, and the toothbrush holds a charge for a long time, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in all the time.  </li>
            <li> Far worth the extra  money spent.</li>
            <li> I realize now I put it off much too long.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a small separate travel charger  available the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It takes too long and I can never find a floss that I really like.  </li>
            <li> But after giving the water flosser a shot flossing will never be an issue and maybe i can return to normal floss after extensive use of this.</li>
            <li> On the low speed, I would say the power equates to what your normal electric toothbrush would be.</li>
            <li> My sink is tiny and this fits on the corner where soap/lotion normally is.&lt;br /&gt;-Also fits under the mirror/medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much setup at all and was ready to go in a minute!</li>
            <li> I only needed the normal dental picks for my cleaning.</li>
            <li> She said I could come back in six months, like a normal person.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at the amount of food particles that came out with water pick after I had brushed and flossed normally.</li>
            <li> But it takes along time to charge 12-24 from dead to full.</li>
            <li> the water flow is not really as strong as i personally expected, and the sound of device is large but acceptable</li>
            <li> The manual and quick-start guides are well written and well illustrated, and in print large enough that it is actually readable.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I put a little Hydrogen Peroxide in the water basin and my teeth are not only smooth but whiter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think little children could manage it, at least, not without a good deal of help and supervision.</li>
            <li> My main one is that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a medium speed - the low setting is a little too wimpy but the high setting feels like my gums are getting brushed right out of existence</li>
            <li> I finally get a new one not because it broke.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is quite new to me but it seems to do everything I need and does it well, in as compact a space as possible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what regular floss leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush charges by induction (no contacts to get dirty) and is easily washed clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It was an early birthday present from my Mom, 6 month early.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and it has really helped with cleaning my teeth, especially since I just got braces.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik provides you with 4 different irrigation heads and 2 different sizes of toothbrush...there is no place to store the tooth brushes and the whole setup of heads and brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I paid for a whole set of the water flosser and toothbrush to have the toothbrush be Useless after two weeks of use -</li>
            <li> also the design of the brush touching the base for power is much better as the ring does not get any buildup on the bottom like the Braun did.</li>
            <li> the reservoir is a little small, only good for like 1.5 flossings.</li>
            <li> the instructions say, I close it completely and just open it a little when it gets full of water.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s motor is very loud.</li>
            <li> The water flosser sounds like a very loud machine, and you can hear it throughout the entire house.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; - if you can call it that - is that the unit is very loud when you are using the water pik part.  </li>
            <li> First off, I cant brush my teeth for any length of time, due to all toothpastes burning my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of faithful use, all my numbers showed a 2 to 6 point improvement (if you have gum disease, you know that&#x27;s major).  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is one of the better ones I have used, however the waterflosser is weak.</li>
            <li> No other product is quite like it.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is expected!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely improved from my old Waterpik and electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The price was also a major contributor.  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of customers have this problem; wish I had read the other reviews first.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and no more need to floss.</li>
            <li> I was not able to get this product to clean my teeth as it advertised.</li>
            <li> I wish this were reversed, so that it would normally not spray, and the blue button would make it spray, but unfortunately not.  </li>
            <li> Gum Pockets had decreased down to mostly 1-3 with the six&#x27;s down to mostly fours (a couple of fives).  </li>
            <li> but I had so much food particles in the gum hole that I can never remove with regular tooth brushes, but this waterpik completely removed every single bit of them.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The low speed seems a little &#x27;soft&#x27; to me, but the high speed is a bit much for my teeth to handle.</li>
            <li> It has variable force settings from light to hard.</li>
            <li> I find low to be too low, so I use the high setting.  </li>
            <li> But we generally like it.</li>
            <li> However, the one that I always use is the general cleaning one</li>
            <li> For general cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got 2 general use picks and no tongue piece</li>
            <li> For the first time in history, both my hygienist and my periodontist had absolutely NOTHING negative to say.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to form much of an opinion on its function</li>
            <li> The instructions for use were simple and clear.</li>
            <li> Bought this barely two weeks ago, and the battery already died in the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t even a year old and my husband is the only one to use the toothbrush part and the bottom of the tooth brush just cracked and fell apart.  </li>
            <li> If you should accidentally drop the pick or even loosen your grip, water can go everywhere if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has the two-minute timer function, and ESPECIALLY that it pauses very briefly every 30 seconds to alert you to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> leave you mouth open and near the sink.</li>
            <li> The brush is extremely quiet and soft --making</li>
            <li> The flosser has far exceeded my expectations and rather than flossing only once a day, I now use the waterpik two to three times a day.  </li>
            <li> but I have my husband and 7 year old son using it regularly too!  </li>
            <li> No regrets at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not deviate on the device for the electric power please explain wattage of the device and the second device will ask first&lt;br /&gt;Vaghtkd he was burned because of the increased wattage and I hope the price Mraati Is there a direct shipping to Saudi Arabia</li>
            <li> In effect I am paying shipping and excise duty twice for the same parts which is completely unjustified.</li>
            <li> Apparently there&#x27;s a quality issue.</li>
            <li> I had this on my wish list as my current electric tool brush was over 10 year old</li>
            <li> The cost for this unit complete is on par with a mid line Sonicare and the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Also the water flosser complete the cleaning to show a white smile!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The holder for the waterpik barely grips the bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li> but they just became natural white teeth  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason i am giving it 4 stars not 5  because it claims to be \\&quot;complete care\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a similar Braun product that developed a pinhole leak in the irrigation supply line.    </li>
            <li> I bought this because my dentist recommended it however I barely use it.</li>
            <li> I really love the effect but am tired of this thing not working.  </li>
            <li> but I need it more now than ever because my teeth are in worse shape.  </li>
            <li> I rate their customer service poor and I will not purchase or recommed there products because of their customer service or better lack of.</li>
            <li> all of my life and after a few months of this, everyone keeps telling me that I have the whitest smile they have every seen for someone who wears braces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longstanding Sonicare user, so I was skeptical whether Waterpik&#x27;s sonic toothbrush was as effective.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> The water pump is noisier than an older one that I also have that is single unit versus one that comes with the Sonic Brush, but it all works</li>
            <li> The pause button on the handle will start sticking in the down position pretty soon.  </li>
            <li> I live in a small apartment where sink space is at a premium -- I think this device is worth it, but be warned prior to making the investment.</li>
            <li> Unfornately, I am from EU, so returning will be more expensive than another new Water Flosser</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed with keeping my teeth clean, so I was a little leery about this combo living up to the hype; but, I have to say, I LOVE both the flosser and the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The less expensive unit with just the toothbrush and a charger stand works great.  </li>
            <li> I put mouthwash in the waterpick side because I struggle with soft enamel, sensitive teeth and dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the vibrations tends to tickle, not sure if they can do anything about that, Another great thing about this toothbrush is that it gives 30 sec timer that briefly pauses to let you move on to the next quadrant ensuring you get the whole two minutes of brush</li>
            <li> You still have to move the head up and down left and right</li>
            <li> You still have to move the head up and down left and right</li>
            <li> The only draw back is the waterpik is very loud.</li>
            <li> I had a very old one (no tooth brush, only 4 tips ) and it last for years.</li>
            <li> and I really find that because of the smaller size and reduced back and forth motion I have to do, that it is easier to clean those hard to get parts in the back of my mouth, mostly because I&#x27;m not stabbing those fleshy round parts behind you last molars.</li>
            <li> did we live without one for so long.  </li>
            <li> it requires a 24 hour charge before use (pretty typical for any re-chargeable device these days)</li>
            <li> The first one blew a chip on the motherboard after less than a months use.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than any of the other power tooth brushes I have used in the past</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is hard to understand at first, mainly because it has a 2min timer and shuts off.</li>
            <li> Also there are three bright green LED on the toothbrush and at night they shine bright which I personally find very annoying.  </li>
            <li> The WP-900 was crazy easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I really like this unit.</li>
            <li> Yes, I made a mess the first day shooting water all over the mirror.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to describe the feeling, but the ultrasonic vibration makes my teeth feel as clean as after a dental hygiene cleaning session.  </li>
            <li> Even while using the pause button I first made a mess.</li>
            <li> The design covers the obvious easy-use buttons and controls, but also has the thoughtful additions of vented storage space for the brushes and irrigator tips, and the little flat spot on the back of the toothbrush handle so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the counter to crash on the floor.  </li>
            <li> Other brands are cheaper and you can get replacements for them from Sam&#x27;s Club much cheaper than Waterpik, which I found out after I bought this unit.  </li>
            <li> Functional, but clumsy to clean &amp; dust</li>
            <li> Found the water pik so messy as to not be worth using, but that&#x27;s a personal choice, not an issue with the product.</li>
            <li> the container holds just the right amount of water so that you can get to all of the spaces in your mouth before it runs out and the charge for the toothbrush last for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it has two different speeds, and sometimes I use the lower speed, other times the higher speed.  </li>
            <li> After that major accomplishment, I upgraded from a basic Waterpik to this combo unit with a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is k I n da rough on high setting.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to set the flosser too high because it will hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  </li>
            <li> but the rest seems pointless, it doesn&#x27;t clean anything deep but just a simple wash off.</li>
            <li> I am so OCD about my teeth and will be even more so now but with less trouble!</li>
            <li> The insertion fittings of the Jet Tips of the WP-900 water flosser, compared to those of the Jet Tips for the cheaper WP-60W, are much higher quality, which means that the Jet Tips leak less and last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The insertion fittings of the Jet Tips of the WP-900 water flosser, compared to those of the Jet Tips for the cheaper WP-60W, are much higher quality, which means that the Jet Tips leak less and last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for morning usage if employed, unless you&#x27;re willing to wake up either an hour or half hour earlier to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Had a Phillips brand toothbrush only and my dentist suggested  that I consider a water floss system in general and Waterpik by name.</li>
            <li> The flosser comes with several attachments that range from general cleaning to specialized attachments made for those with braces.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that is it a bit big and doesn&#x27;t quite fit in my bathroom, but I should have guessed that before hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Completely enclosed/waterproof brush - Charges brush with no cables; it charges just being next to the unit (in the holder).&lt;br /&gt;-Rubber feet keep unit in-place and will fit on very small surfaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets clean the hard to reach places deep between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you have braces or hard to clean teeth, then this is your only choice.</li>
            <li> The water flosser was kind of disappointing, maybe I just expected to much?  </li>
            <li> An appliance repairman who kept my old one running as long as he could told me that his customers all try to keep their &amp;#34;little cutie&amp;#34; running:  </li>
            <li> effectively eliminates that  nasty morning breath when used properly the night before,  keeps gums healthy and polishes teeth to their brightest.  </li>
            <li> the first product sent to me stopped charging a few weeks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fanatic for keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended using the flosser with LIsterine, but I started with just plain water at first.</li>
            <li> Because my mouth no longer opens very wide, this tool is very helpful in reaching the back teeth vs a traditional or electronic flosser.  </li>
            <li> Takes up less room and is much stronger.  </li>
            <li> Also the tank does empty a little quick</li>
            <li> The handle of the toothbrush gets very slippery when toothpaste inevitably works its way out of your mouth and trickles down the handle.</li>
            <li> The pic works extremely well, dislodging all manner of stuff trapped between the teeth, and the brush makes my teeth feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little large on our counter</li>
            <li> If you live with someone who is a light sleeper, be wary of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent an afternoon whining to my friends about the only excitement in my life being my new Waterpik system.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am actually looking forward to seeing my dental hygeinist to see how much (or hopefully less) scraping</li>
            <li> Waterpic flosser is easy to use and leaves your teeth and gums free of annoying food particles that can get caught between teeth.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tested a single water flosser attachment</li>
            <li> Both do make a little noise, but they certainly are quieter than earlier models.  </li>
            <li> This is also very santitary and takes little space on the counter.</li>
            <li> My last dentist checkup went very well and had little plaque.  </li>
            <li> Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
            <li> When looking at the Amazon reviews I divided the bad reviews by the good ones.</li>
            <li> Even on the high setting, this brush has less gum bleeding than when I use my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Month and a half of using it and the high speed in the toothbrush quit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I used this product for two days trying to give it a chance, but it is not good for me)&lt;br /&gt;first, the toothbrush head is very soft and i does not vibrate much.</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth much cleaner than plain toothbrush.</li>
            <li> About a week and a half later, I received a new unit without any further questions asked.  </li>
            <li> One could argue that I \\&quot;got my money&#x27;s worth\\&quot;, but for the price it would be like tossing out a vacuum cleaner every 10 months.</li>
            <li> The flosser is exceedingly convenient and makes the flossing experience quick and less messy, especially when you have braces - just fill up the water tank and floss away.</li>
            <li> As for the toothbrush, the high is a little too high and the low a little too low, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It is very effective in giving you a thorough cleaning and knocks out any annoying pieces of food still lodged between teeth with ease.</li>
            <li> The main machine has the floss attached and a little brush/tip container that allows air flow to enhance drying.  </li>
            <li> The high setting is a little faster than the Sonic.</li>
            <li> Just a note is that the water pick unit is not held very tightly onto the main body of the machine and if there is water left in the water reservoir and the waterpick nozzle is knocked off its stand, the water left in the reservoir drains out through the waterpick.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> the brush won&#x27;t light up to take a charge, not sure if its the charging system or the brush that is dead.  </li>
            <li> I thought that it might be messy, but after getting the hang of it (which doesn&#x27;t take long), it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have a small area for my bathroom appliances, and this combo with 2 appliances and only one cord is really appreciated.  </li>
            <li> seriously.. risk totally worth it</li>
            <li> I had the WP900 at another time and that didn&#x27;t last but the toothbrush last a long time.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush part feels very solid like something that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> While the waterpik is a bit messy to use and will take practice to not spray myself, I think it is going to be very helpful and save on dentist costs in the long run.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to \\&quot;just let the water flow freely out of your mouth,\\&quot; but when I try that, some water tends to stream down the handle and onto my hand and then down my arm and often down my leg.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a small and large brush for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (it comes with a small and large head).  </li>
            <li> The low speed is completely pointless - I could do better with a manual toothbrush and the high speed is a bit scary.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it was not hard to set up or use mine came with a sonic tooth brush a little weared but&lt;</li>
            <li> This machine takes a little over a minute to clean out everything especially the back that&#x27;s hard to reach.</li>
            <li> , I wrongly assumed when I bought the Model WP-60W that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon, I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how much junk comes out after brushing when you use the Water Flosser part.  </li>
            <li> I am usually rushing to get ready to get my toddler to bed</li>
            <li> Waterpik as usual is working very well.</li>
            <li> Waterpik products have never broken on me in the past</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time as if one breaks you are stuck with one big machine.</li>
            <li> it doesnt last as long as id</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaints about the unit, and they are minor, is that on the pick, you press the handle button to turn water off.</li>
            <li> So I checked them out on Amazon, long story short, I got one.</li>
            <li> Sonic toothbrushes have come a long way since I last owned a Sonicare!</li>
            <li> The included replaceable heads last a long time.</li>
            <li> I only have two complaints and they&#x27;re relatively minor.  </li>
            <li> Anything left on a charger for too long when the battery is charged will fuse the battery.</li>
            <li> Only wish I had not waited so long to purchase.</li>
            <li> Let see how long this last.</li>
            <li> As you may know, there have been marketing wars between the Braun rotary brush and the Sonic Care up and down action brush,such as the water pick has.</li>
            <li> The only thing I ding, it is a little loud when using the water pic.</li>
            <li> I agree with others who have reviewed this product about the 2 speeds, low being too slow and high being slightly too high</li>
            <li> The low setting is very tame, but the high setting is definitely aggressive, to the point where it could be a turn-off for some people.</li>
            <li> My old one was retired even though it still worked just that I felt it was to old to have to work so hard.</li>
            <li> I see the value but the toothbrush head had no other features other than vibrate.</li>
            <li> This will vastly improve your oral hygiene, saving you a lot of money in the long run!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better way for getting pieces of a salad, or nuts or other little items that get easily wedged in your mouth.</li>
            <li> They both work well, and take up MUCH less counter space than my old pair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t really travel-friendly.</li>
            <li> So I aimed it at my dirty sink in need of cleaning and sure enough it removed stuff running water wouldn&#x27;t from one foot away.  </li>
            <li> No messy buildup of toothpaste on the bottom of the brush handle as with previous models.</li>
            <li> I just spent 800.00 for a Deep Cleaning at the dentist, and I have a couple of deep pockets.</li>
            <li> My husband has neuropathy in his hands and was not really getting his teeth cleaned properly with a traditional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Will last a long long time.  </li>
            <li> The first incident was failure of the valve controlling the water from the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cord is short, because my outlet is high up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, I mean really really really sensitive gums, like I bleed after every flossing, literally every flossing.</li>
            <li> especially as you turn up the power, to which actually reaches a point where its pretty unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> The water pik has a good size reservoir and long enough tube so that I don&#x27;t feel too restricted in distance from the base unit.  </li>
            <li> Looks like some of them work fine, but a lot of them fail to charge after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the pik automatically squirts water and only stops when you press the button, I think it should work the other way around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer it had a power brick like a laptop, so I could just change it with a 220v version, but this is a very small complaint and won&#x27;t apply to most people.&lt;br /&gt;-Some</li>
            <li> Other than that I have been using it daily and like the convenience of the toothbrush being charged by the same device.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I bought this because my dentist said I needed expensive scaling.</li>
            <li> .  It is about the same level of cleaning power at low as what I was doing but at high it&#x27;s ridiculously powered.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little loud when flossing.</li>
            <li> A little loud though....</li>
            <li> A little loud and pricy.</li>
            <li> A little loud for the water pik</li>
            <li> A little messy at first</li>
            <li> really gets into those hard to get places</li>
            <li> I have very tender gums and also havea hard time flossing with Floss</li>
            <li> Flosser takes a little time to get used to it, but I managed to find a technique that works for me after squirting water all over the first few times.</li>
            <li> Only had system for a couple of weeks, I wish I( had done this a long time ago!!!</li>
            <li> I just had a large amount of perio maintenance done within the past months and this is a godsend!</li>
            <li> how long it may be stuck this time</li>
            <li> dentist encouraged me to buy, and I have wanted one for a long time.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works similarly to the Sonicare, minus the beep on the quadtimer.    </li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush got my teeth cleaner than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> Only one thing to be careful of.</li>
            <li> I look forward to a long relationship.</li>
            <li> The anti-biotic nature of mouthwash helps to kill any bacteria inside your gumline, and the water pick obviously helps you reach the harder areas to get to when you floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> made a bigger difference to me than expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired of using actual floss ( the pain to my gums with regular floss is too much. )</li>
            <li> It looked a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This thing is so loud, messy and still makes the water like plastic after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this item.  </li>
            <li> and she told me that Waterpiks are beneficial to oral health, but should be used in conjunction with floss, not completely replacing floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish we would have gotten it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> having just spent a vast sum for a tooth implant I heeded her warning.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this item for a long time.</li>
            <li> so you know how long you should brush on each side.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk, and in my opinion, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> There is a 2 year warranty on this unit, guess how long the toothbrush lasted until it stopped holding a charge?</li>
            <li> Battery life is long.</li>
            <li> should have purchase this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this long ago.  </li>
            <li> My brother has been trying to get me to buy one of these for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how I lived without this for so long.</li>
            <li> -LOUD, messy, and kinda leaks a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The WaterPik healed a long term tooth root infection by using the flosser with colloidal silver.  </li>
            <li> my oral health is NOT complete  </li>
            <li> Hope I have it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This routine has been failing for a long time considering</li>
            <li> It has a timer on it so that I know how long I&#x27;ve been on each section of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> My gums are not nearly as sensitive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get one</li>
            <li> BELIEVE I WAITED THIS LONG TO TRY ONE</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe I have gone so long without one of these.  </li>
            <li> We are looking for a long term relationship with our Dentist and our Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Thanks to another reviewer, I started slow with the water flow, so I didn&#x27;t have water splashed all over the mirror.</li>
            <li> It goes from really slow to really fast.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve certainly never said about regular flossing.</li>
            <li> It is compact enough to take up less space on a small bathroom sink, everything is attached and at hand and ready to use at all times.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would be a mess but just run it with your mouth closed around it and spit frequently.  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush is fine.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The unite is very light, leaking water from bottom, the tube is short, the handle also leaks  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button is a physical stop as oppose to an electrical and due to this water will continue to pump through and squirt out just at a reduced speed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After getting the hang of things (and trust me, it won&#x27;t take long to figure out when there&#x27;s water flying everywhere!)</li>
            <li> which makes my life easier due to the permanent retainer that makes regular flossing a pain.</li>
            <li> Other than perhaps when I travel, I will never go back to dental floss and manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Using it everyother day and then use standard toothbrush on the other days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 8 months now and while in the beginning it was working properly, the button on the flosser now gets stuck and (as some other reviewers mentioned) water reservoir leaks when you try to refill it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is all due to using this unit religiously.</li>
            <li> without the gross gloves smell and sharp objects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleaners actually loosened my crowns.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using it my dentist has stopped lecturing me as much about daily flossing and has toned it down to &amp;#34;just floss at least twice a week while you use the waterpik&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have a lifelong habit of brushing too hard, and wish that the toothbrush had a sensor type of apparatus to either let you know when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, some very minor &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; (not that they even rise to the level of being an issue).  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a very long time allowing you to keep out of the charger for days on end if needed.</li>
            <li> It is neat and compact in my bathroom taking up very minimal space on the counter and using only one cord and one plug slot.  </li>
            <li> The left side of the top is a badly designed tank to hold the tooth brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference in the condition of  my gums and teeth after only a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> me say neither of my first two electronic tooth brushes ever quit, or even slow down.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use in the early morning hours, it rattles a little loud (brrrrrrrrrrr).</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a well-designed, single unit, the products are unbeatable.</li>
            <li> i was a skeptical at the beginning specially that i am a student</li>
            <li> And flossed every single day with the flosser.</li>
            <li> an email has been sent to amazon,explaining that the the the product is not able to be used in australia as my address clearly</li>
            <li> My gums used to be sensitive and bleed quite a bit, but voila- no more.</li>
            <li> You can buy a spare brush device, but it is almost as expensive as a new unit, so we opted for the new unit.</li>
            <li> As soon as you turn unit on if you do not have blue button held down water starts shooting out.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall is the noise.</li>
            <li> and last time I walked in - he got out his tools, and then put them down.</li>
            <li> only down side  </li>
            <li> Not necessarily a big deal to me but found it odd that what is suppose to be here is</li>
            <li> Hygenist said that the plaque and tartar buildup were less when I came in for the deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The cover over the water container is attached to the unit so it does not constantly fall off as in previous piks.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Double the protection at half the price of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> There are multiple heads for the pick, though I typically just stick with one I like.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush pauses in 30 second increments and shuts off after 2 minutes (I usually run it an extra increment).</li>
            <li> Then it suddenly lost about half</li>
            <li> /&gt;Water flossing takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s almost therapeutic after you get the hang of it - and it feels much less invasive than regular flossing.</li>
            <li> not super white  </li>
            <li> Enormous improvement on previous Waterpiks.</li>
            <li> I was developing gingivitis, and my gums were super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The water flosser does not make a big mess, but like any others, you do have to lean over the sink.</li>
            <li> I noticed my loose teeth get stronger, gums are pink and the Waterpik gets all the gunk stuck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the water flosser since my teeth are too tight to get regular floss through.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a person with very limited counter space.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go beyond 6, which stings a little even if I don&#x27;t bleed</li>
            <li> , i cN only give this little wonder 5 stars.</li>
            <li> you think may need a little extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> The reservoir for the water pik is a little smaller than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> not giving it a 5 star only for the price which needs to be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how little its and bits of debris are flushed out by the water flosser even after regular flossing and brushing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that instead of keeping my mouth open a little like</li>
            <li> Went with this choice due to limited counter/plug space.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik might be a bit too noisy, but I have a bathroom fan going on most of the times, so it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so close together that flossing is just painful but with the WaterPik, I can use the water pik flosser to take care of most of the flossing hassle.  </li>
            <li> Excellent but replacement brush heads are stupid expensive.  </li>
            <li> Attribute it to laziness, or whatever, but my teeth are very crowded and the space (or lack thereof) between my teeth made traditional flossing difficult.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the water container doesn&#x27;t hold nearly enough water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also not fair to compare the waterpick to normal flossing,</li>
            <li> Its extremely loud which loses a star.</li>
            <li> , water flosser pump is too loud to use late at night if the wife is sleeping nearby, but otherwise performs well.  </li>
            <li> I always fill the reservoir with tepid water and spray until it is empty.</li>
            <li> anyone wondering, the toothbrush is waterproof, so you can use it in the shower without any worries of the battery getting wet and corroding.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush totally stooped to work after few month of use</li>
            <li> Everything worked just as expected no compaints.  </li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s too expensive for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give it 5-Stars because it does take up some counter-space and outlet space, which is a bit of a drag.</li>
            <li> Only thing missing is adapter plug to use when traveling</li>
            <li> I was looking at a few different ones</li>
            <li> tries to use the water pic</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that water flossers can sometimes exacerbate gum issues, so be careful about your technique and style.</li>
            <li> It was not working (at all) as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat messy to use, but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> , i saved the money spent on this machine.  </li>
            <li> We have had this for approximately six months and are finding it very convenient and dependable.</li>
            <li> Once it is firmly placed in there, you put in the tip that you want and with the tip IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE STARTING</li>
            <li> You will get wet using this-</li>
            <li> You will get wet using this-</li>
            <li> It is adjustable and comes with a few different tips.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> I pressure washed a few fragile hobby items with it - worked</li>
            <li> Therefore, the toothbrush sits in a closed, unventilated container with germs always on it</li>
            <li> the last few combined.</li>
            <li> I have owned a few of these over the years same water pic  brand.</li>
            <li> but I imagine that&#x27;s to be expected for a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does have a few different tips to use, but all in all to me</li>
            <li> Harder to brush with a post op shoulder in oct...</li>
            <li> The Water Flosser Button is stuck, I&#x27;ve had it just under 5 weeks and can&#x27;t return it because the window for return (1 month) has closed...</li>
            <li> It is only messy if you turn it on without it being in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on second round of braces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I expected the toothbrush to be an afterthought thrown in, but it works, and it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything we expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This comes with a replacement tooth brush tip and a few different flosser tips as well to give varying levels of stream.</li>
            <li> be careful.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of years using a manual toothbrush, so, this has been quite the adjustment.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> But that is to be expected of water pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like, keep your mouth closed</li>
            <li> I spent 2 years using the sonicare.</li>
            <li> One guy was saying he gets the bathroom wet</li>
            <li> Yes, you need to empty the reservoir ever time you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Got a sonicare toothbrush from a friend a few years back and the toothbrush that comes with this kit, BLOWS my sonicare out of the water.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, and is expected to help maintain our dental</li>
            <li> The cord to the waterpik does not wrap up nicely back into the base, most times.</li>
            <li> My old Waterpik was getting slow</li>
            <li> I hate how big it is, but it works 100x better than the battery powered waterpiks.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i used to only brush my teeth with those battery brushes  twice a day for probably less than 2 mins or even 1!  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller on my vanity than other models, but delivers the power.</li>
            <li> My fiancé is sick of me talking about how much I love this...</li>
            <li> The toothbrush tells you when you need to change quadrants (stops vibrating temporarily) and the waterpik has a rubber tool to get into the deep pockets as well as a ton of other attachments for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Other then poor or lack of instructions, seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as previous WaterPik-30 yrs.</li>
            <li> : The flosser can get really loud which makes it really annoying to significant others/roommates.</li>
            <li> A little getting used to at first but this thing sure knocks the crap out of your teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vast improvement over my previous efforts with less effort.  </li>
            <li> For $82.00 and only to last 2 months is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> to avoid calcium deposits after every use i pull out the tank, rinse it and set it down on a microfiber cloth to air dry.</li>
            <li> Anteriorly had a minor hand the same mark that lasted very little, less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> The low setting does feel a little weak, but I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect, but the one disappointment is that while I am using this item, the water keeps accumulating in my mouth and I have to keep turning the power off to spit out the water, then keep turning it back on.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve been using the spinbrush that you can pick up for $10 nearly anywhere.  </li>
            <li> The Flosser is a little louder and slightly less pressure then the WP100W model (Flosser only unit)</li>
            <li> Working well, although the charging time for the tooth brush is a little long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is a very minor one.</li>
            <li> Very little placque with my last cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Wore my other Waterpik out, had it almost five years.</li>
            <li> I keep the unit plugged in all the time, and I went to use the toothbrush the other night and</li>
            <li> was also due to replace my electric toothbrush, and I was fascinated by the information I read about the Waterpik Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Small footprint and numerous attachments for the waterpik</li>
            <li> If anything, we have extreme praise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough so that it doesn&#x27;t get in the way in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am going to try other products because of</li>
            <li> MIRROR OTHER</li>
            <li> other note</li>
            <li> He says he can feel the difference over his other battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also on other models I owned, the tubing eventually split and could not be repaired meaning I needed to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> Once you have figured it out, then higher speeds are not as difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> As a notice to future Waterpik flossers, I don&#x27;t know if this pertains to just me, but my dentist recommended that I don&#x27;t exceed past 4 on the pressure setting.</li>
            <li> Between the ultrasonic toothbrush and the water pik, the bleeding gums and other issues are gone.</li>
            <li> Bought one for our daughter and going to purchase another for our other daughter as well.</li>
            <li> it is still heard on the other end of the apartment.</li>
            <li> Never enjoyed flossing, brushing and doing extensive oral care until I started using this.</li>
            <li> Due to some chips in my crowns, I was advised by my dentist to get a Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended using a flosser, and I decided to purchase the Waterpik WP-900 based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> And a separate storage area to store your piks (not stored in lid, like  my other unit</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have is a too small of a bathroom to house the unit.</li>
            <li> : Be careful where you point the thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how in the 21st century this product has not yet</li>
            <li> However, the reason I chose this model(Over WP-660) was also due to the convenient rechargeable brush that comes along with the device.</li>
            <li> so I could use it without waking other up.</li>
            <li> Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  </li>
            <li> not funny</li>
            <li> Needless to say after his visit to the dentist after getting his wires off the first time he introduced us to the waterpik and told us to get one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first:  </li>
            <li> Product works extremely well and would suggest to anyone.</li>
            <li> the&lt;br /&gt;outlet is on the other wall and a distance from the sink.</li>
            <li> We bought and returned two other electric toothbrushes before I found this.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Forget the other companies.</li>
            <li> i used the floss usually at nights only</li>
            <li> and I know this is partially due to the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> and i gave the other one to my daughter who has braces</li>
            <li> And I bought it cheaper than other sites in amazon.</li>
            <li> since brought another one for the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> Due to my problems I brush &amp; floss vigorously</li>
            <li> Lastly, on the toothbrush, after use, the water drains down the handle of the toothbrush and settles on the holder and the holder gets pretty dirty but it can be cleaned using the waterpick.  </li>
            <li> No real clear precise instructions on use this tip and how to adjust water-flow....very disappointed in the purchase.</li>
            <li> Really bummed and hard to recommend as I hardly used it</li>
            <li> Although I do like to turn it on 1 facing down into the sink for a few seconds prior to use so that it clears all of the water that may have been sitting in the tubes from the previous use.</li>
            <li> I used the waterpik initially for quite some time, but its messy and feels like a waste of water.</li>
            <li> Also, the toothbrush has strong vibration and it felt like I was being shocked until I got use to it.  </li>
            <li> Then carefully replace the basin in the unit lining up the plug with the black seal on the unit.  </li>
            <li> Also, they only offer soft bristle tooth brush replacements, which are outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed I brushed twice a day for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks haven&#x27;t had a single problem.</li>
            <li> My own negative thoughts are that I wish the water reservoir were a little larger (just hate refilling it so often).  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- to avoid some of the river flooding crazy out of your month, when doing the front part, push from behind your tongue gently on the back of the teeth, that will avoid drowning and the water is less likely to sprinkle against the mirror if you open a bit your mouth to see what you are doing in the mirror</li>

            <li> If there is one minor negative thing that I could say about it, it is that the button that you have to depress for keeping the water to come out of the nozzle, is that it gets stuck sometimes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that additional brushes must be purchased separately for other family members.</li>
            <li> Within a week or so of replacing it with this Water Pik sonic toothbrush, I realized how sad I was that I had waited so long to ditch the old toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The only down side for me is that flosser is sort of hard to handle due to the coiled tubing.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of filling up the basin with cold water the first time I used it - OUCH!</li>
            <li> The flosser is a little noisy, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Also, running it on the 10 setting is a little noisy, but is to be expected for a pump.  </li>
            <li> With my regular brush I push to hard and over brush.</li>
            <li> both in front and the hard to reach teeth no one ever sees but the dentist in the back of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the extra piks seem a little pointless in my opinion, but they work fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flossing is hard enough as is, but waterpik makes it easier to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought the Waterpik based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation after his hygienist noticed I was getting some deep pockets in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I have one area of receding gums from brushing too hard, and this seems to be getting it cleaner than regular floss, and it&#x27;s not causing any sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> Very cheep and cheesy  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the noise.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush refills can be expensive but seem very durable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the battery will last a week ish at least.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun unit like this one, used by two adults, for at least ten years without any service needed.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how long Waterpik has been around</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that it is noisy when in use.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I lived so long without it.  </li>
            <li> biggest negative, however, is the sheer size of the unit.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, lately when I eat steak or similar food</li>
            <li> Not worth buying another one every 90 days.</li>
            <li> I love this because I hate to floss.</li>
            <li> I have always had good teeth and want to keep it that way, but am HORRIBLE at flossing.</li>
            <li> On July 3, 2014 a few days after the Amazon return window closed, the Sonic toothbrush stopped working.  </li>
            <li> feel the low is too slow and</li>
            <li> Brush itself is skimpy and action is poor.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is when you are flossing (where the water shoots out), even at the lowest setting, I have to keep my head down to prevent splashing from the floss.</li>
            <li> For less than the cost of replacing a severely broken Sonicare brush handle, I got a complete water flossing and sonic toothbrush kit.</li>
            <li> It used to take me at least twenty minutes to brush and floss and the Waterpik w/ the sonic toothbrush just totally cut that time in half.</li>
            <li> Water pick works but in order to stop water from coming out you need to hold button down.</li>
            <li> This beats both hands down.</li>
            <li> However, the price of this should be knocked down a bit</li>
            <li> I put it upside down on a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> The button on the wand allows you to stop water flow while you are holding it down.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, unless you hold the button down BEFORE AND AS you turn it on...water everywhere.</li>
            <li> I turned it down to the lowest setting (as directions state).</li>
            <li> the water running down my chin.</li>
            <li> If flosser head is not inserted fully into the handle before turning it on, water squirts all over and runs down your arm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just went on sale down from $89.99 to $72.52 and just called and they gave me the difference.</li>
            <li> And hold down while spitting.</li>
            <li> Wears down the cliff tops, the mountains.</li>
            <li> Had to dial the pressure setting down.</li>
            <li> Had to bump this down from 5 stars to 3.</li>
            <li> Broke down an got one using amazon gift cards from Christmas.</li>
            <li> However, when I use the floss attachment, no matter how I stand the water flows down my arm.  </li>
            <li> but I would like to lock it down if tbere was a way.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwize,  it does the job and it does it well</li>
            <li> should you keep the brush on charge and fully charged or run it down.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush lasts about 2 weeks on a single charge for brief morning and evening brushings (each approximately 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> only things that I can say that we have not been crazy about has been trying to find the right manner to get the stream running out of the mouth with the least amount of mess.</li>
            <li> only things that I can say that we have not been crazy about has been trying to find the right manner to get the stream running out of the mouth with the least amount of mess.</li>
            <li> tips leak a black substance down by where it meets the handel from the paint rubbing off.</li>
            <li> Have used WaterPik products for years as well as other brands when WaterPik was not available.  </li>
            <li> Not very strong at all.</li>
            <li> It takes up less counter space than having both a rechargeable toothbrush and flosser on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> I owned previously.  </li>
            <li> All of my numbers were lowered by half and ZERO bleeding or sign of gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> However in less than a year the toothbush stopped working, would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of having one less thing on my counter.</li>
            <li> Well, after 20ish months, the battery stopped holding a charge after a brush and a half without charging.</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m just updating a previous post?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such a pleasure, that I am using it without fail every night (I probably used regular floss about five days/week).  </li>
            <li> I found it odd</li>
            <li> The water pick system works very well however the toothbrush failed to charge after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; in my gums have literally been cut in half.</li>
            <li> I tend to lean my head over the sink tilted slightly to the side.  </li>
            <li> All previous reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> The  previous waterpik  device  </li>
            <li> I like the water flosser part fine, but I am definitely disappointed in the tootbrush.  </li>
            <li> I saw this on sale for Black Friday and had to scoop it since it also came with a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my previous model was...</li>
            <li> The price was $20 less than I could find it in the store.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the transportable unit we had previously.</li>
            <li> Previously had water pic and sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> takes up a lot less room than having a separate waterpik and rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It takes up less on the sink</li>
            <li> My previous Waterpik died after years of use</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheep electric toothbrush and a travel sized</li>
            <li> The all-in one system is convenient and one less item to plug into the outlet with the Sonic Toothbrush charger attached.</li>
            <li> that has never happened to me before in my 4 year history of using electronic toothbrushes (previous was braun and lasted me for 3,5 years).</li>
            <li> Well, the water pump stopped working after less than a year.</li>
            <li> My gums are less tender.</li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper than the sonicare and the standalone waterpik.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super fancy</li>
            <li> an I have felt a cleaner less inflamed gums mouth.</li>
            <li> Though, do not get me wrong, my teeth are not yellow and decaying - I just am not sitting at home enough to follow the recommended &amp;#34;3 times a day&amp;#34; routine.  </li>
            <li> Said she can see the difference in the appearance of her teeth in just two and one half months she has been using it.  </li>
            <li> Takes up much less space on the counter.</li>
            <li> well, getting older, but has not yet failed.</li>
            <li> Less mess than &amp;#34;just letting it</li>
            <li> the previous versions except the amount of water in the container seems a little less than previous models.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it lasts at least that long.</li>
            <li> after mastering, one may still make a water mess with water flossing.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushing</li>
            <li> Another thing I don&#x27;t like is the mess.</li>
            <li> That this machine is not a full substitute.).</li>
            <li> It has taken some time to use it without creating a mess around the sink.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to mess around with floss anymore.</li>
            <li> You get used to it after a while and learn how to use it without making a mess.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it was a mess and wires and brushes and water piks were all over my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it makes a mess if you remove the water reservoir each time...</li>
            <li> and I have started developing sensitivities to cold and hot.</li>
            <li> I do when I don&#x27;t want to mess around</li>
            <li> It is less noisy, less messy, easier to fill and use and the switch to turn it off and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little awkward to get used to at first.  </li>
            <li> A little bit awkward to use at first but does the job.</li>
            <li> plastic because if you are using the higher powered mode and your teeth touch the hard plastic it can be quite uncomfortable or even painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This takes a little practice to not make a mess.  </li>
            <li> It does take some a little time to get use to pressure of the water flow and learn how not to create a mess.  </li>
            <li> And replacing the electric tooth brush alone is so expensive you may as well buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing, but this makes it easy.  </li>
            <li> This one does not clean my teeth as well.</li>
            <li> It might be less messy.</li>
            <li> Now the replacement pump is about dead after less than a year.</li>
            <li> It reaches the areas that we do not clean often.</li>
            <li> but the Water Flosser just a little bit big to my little room space  !!!</li>
            <li> I believe we have had it for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not excited about it at this point either.</li>
            <li> However,It does take a little while to get used to using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little getting used to having never had either</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes up quite a bit of space as well, which can be a problem for those with little cabinet</li>
            <li> and I stumbled upon this little beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never tried anything to compare it to other than your ordinary tooth brush.</li>
            <li> So whether I floss a lot or a little, bleeding sore hurt gums and mouth.  </li>
            <li> Compact size, toothbrush with Waterpik takes little room on sink counter.</li>
            <li> This was more expensive (but not much more expensive) because it also included the electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little trial and error until you figure out how to keep the water from splattering out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine the little on/or and speed knobs holding up as they seem flimsy.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> The hygienist commented about how little plaque I had on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The motion of the brush took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> that way you will have little to no splash.</li>
            <li> I use a little mouthwash added in after filling with water  (to prevent a bubble bath).</li>
            <li> a little mouthwash in it while you rinse.  </li>
            <li> It has a little signal every 30 seconds which helps time the brushing.  </li>
            <li> ( so complicated early in the morning!</li>
            <li> I even put a little mouth wash in the reservoir and</li>
            <li> The quality is a little below what it was twenty years ago but the added brush heads have made the difference.</li>
            <li> a little bit too noisy when it works..</li>
            <li> I add a little mouthwash to the water when using it</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> is convenient ad takes up little space on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik takes up little room on the counter which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> I know - such weak will power...   </li>
            <li> This just takes a little practice.)  </li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month ago, with recommendations from a friend.</li>
            <li> This little machine solves all those issues.  </li>
            <li> I took another reviewers advice and have been adding a little bit of mouthwash to the water</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it takes little counter space wirh</li>
            <li> the Waterpik complete makes the process much less tedious.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t like to stretch out and is very hard to put back into place.</li>
            <li> I tested my toothbrush on a friend&#x27;s waterpik charger and my toothbrush still charges up fine, so I know it is the charging base that is faulty.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy to use but what can you expect with squirting water...</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Sonic tooth brush is a little messy.</li>
            <li> i can clarify few little things:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A little messy but does the job.  </li>
            <li> it broke down on me twice!</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush beats Sonic Care hands down!</li>
            <li> I am thinking of getting one for my other home!!</li>
            <li> My hands are very arthritic--it has become very difficult to use conventional floss</li>
            <li> Water pick removes trapped food that the toothbrush and flossing do not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using it my gums are 100% healthier, and I use the waterpik approximately 6 times a week, and I definitely regret when I don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> As of 5/4/15: I believe I figured out why there are a few reviews about toothbrushes that stopped working.</li>
            <li> I just  wanted  to  add after  a few  weeks  </li>
            <li> The wife and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Despite the few cons, it all functions well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and you learn to work with it.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday, once in the morning and once after dinner.</li>
            <li> It is messy but the solution just requires some thinking.  </li>
            <li> The lights will stay lit to let you know what the charge is after you use it for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although messy at times, our teeth have never been cleaner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although messy at times, our teeth have never been cleaner.  </li>
            <li> We use it everyday.</li>
            <li> You need need a glass or measuring cup for the water everyday.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy, but with practice I should master it.  </li>
            <li> After using the item for a few weeks, the pause button on the flosser started sticking and it would take me a few minutes to getting it to work again . . .</li>
            <li> pik itself isn&#x27;t too messy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this water flosser for a few years</li>
            <li> Works as described, was missing a part when I received it....</li>
            <li> (water flosser is lightly messy.</li>
            <li> I sprayed myself a few times before I figured out how to utilize the pause button.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this thing everyday though.</li>
            <li> need to see if there is a round replacement brush for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> use the flosser everyday and I like the toothbrush also.</li>
            <li> so I can say: YES, I do floss everyday.</li>
            <li> And the biggest of companies have been heavily fined for hiring an army of “reviewers” to review their products.</li>
            <li> Works well but messy</li>
            <li> I am giving this product one star for a few reasons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> the toothbrush has two speeds, on speed one i feel the vibrations of the handle, but still have to perform round movements to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> Cannot believe the results after a few days of using the waterpik</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t press the pause button firmly, you&#x27;ll spray water</li>
            <li> Took me a few days to get used to the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> i had a gum infection, i used the water flosser twice a day, and then rinsed with listerine, my infection cleared up in a few days with no antibiotics.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with gingivitis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a few water messes so now</li>
            <li> My wife and I use both the toothbrushes and the waterpik everyday.</li>
            <li> will destroy the toothbrush&#x27;s battery.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong except you may want to hold on to the floss button frequently</li>
            <li> and I vowed to brush and floss everyday now.</li>
            <li> Using this everyday now.</li>
            <li> ,I LOOK FOWARD TO USING IT EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it can be messy.</li>
            <li> be a bit messy with water spraying</li>
            <li> I like to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Took a few times to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I realized after a week that I hate flossing because I dont like having to stick my whole hand in my mouth and seeing the debris is kinda gross.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough time flossing, as I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I am now done with my routine in less than 5 minutes and no more manual flossing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it without my braces on in a year and a half!</li>
            <li> , I already have significantly less bleeding!</li>
            <li> When I received the box, it plainly states Made in China, Designed in the USA.</li>
            <li> Since the water hose is stiff, it will pop off the handle a lot just when you try to put it into the holder.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of crazy and very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I was a little anxious, as I have crown throughout my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They are sending me a new toothbrush with a charging base and are not asking me to send anything back to them.</li>
            <li> This is my first bad experience with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Hygienist checked for gum pockets with millimeter tool and i ranged from three to six mm gaps (which is pretty bad  indicating beginning gum disease).  </li>
            <li> My gums were also bleeding pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> When I began to have some dental issues, I was frustrated because I brushed and flossed my teeth daily.  </li>
            <li> heck; no more mess!</li>
            <li> I used a Braun  electric toothbrush with a small round head befor the Waterpik, so getting used to the larger head on the Waterpik is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush also works well, although sometimes it just speeds up and not sure why.  </li>
            <li> FIVE days past the return date</li>
            <li> I usually cant floss because my gums bleed and</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hate flossing, and i rarely ever do it, but this method of flossing has increased my semi-annual flossing to bi-weekely.  </li>
            <li> The brush sits in a small circle on the side of the unit and im not sure</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> (my teeth are small if that</li>
            <li> Not sure if the motor burned out or what.  </li>
            <li> Only weird thing i noticed it toothbrush</li>
            <li> The battery pack doesn&#x27;t even look especially proprietary or complicated.. just looks like a couple of AAA batteries bundled together and then hard-wired to the board.  </li>
            <li> I will not purchase another entire unit just to replace the failed toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Her dental hygienist has suggested multiple times that she upgrade to a sonic toothbrush, but they always seemed so expensive.</li>
            <li> as usually you push the button to apply or use something then let go of it to stop.</li>
            <li> I usually keep it in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My teeth usually hold a lot of debris, so this is quite impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> My teeth usually hold a lot of debris, so this is quite impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> my oral care must have been in the past...</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Waterpik you are missing out!</li>
            <li> Check YouTube before throwing out your dead toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Small con</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it is making a difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve soaked my bathroom numerous times.</li>
            <li> all you have used before are $5 electronic toothbrushes from Oral B or Crest; this sonic toothbrush will be a game changer, there really is no comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is a small price to pay for a system that works as well as it does.</li>
            <li> Not sure where to go from here.  </li>
            <li> so not sure if they&#x27;re all like that.</li>
            <li> No more getting water and mouth wash all over everything, as I can control when it&#x27;s coming out</li>
            <li> I love water picks and this is the worst I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed initially and wondered what I&#x27;m going to do with such a bulky toothbrushing set.</li>
            <li> No more dealing with dent floss or floss</li>
            <li> No more leaking problems.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I fail to brush my teeth often enough, for example, if I am traveling.</li>
            <li> i think ill have to go with a rotating head toothbrush and a simple floss.</li>
            <li> It is careless and obvious.</li>
            <li> Having a permanent retainer, it makes flossing between those teeth a breeze, no longer having to thread through those impossibly small gaps.  </li>
            <li> My unit failed after 15-months....  Might have been related to a storm.   </li>
            <li> Small learning curve to keep water flow from mouth into sink.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonic Care products in the past and this one lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Sufficiently small.  </li>
            <li> Just add a small amount of Listerine to the water tanks and it disinfects too.</li>
            <li> The water tank is too small because of the brush</li>
            <li> because  i wanted a water flosser  (i am just too lazy to floss by the end of the day)&lt;br /&gt;n</li>
            <li> i use it usually on the 7th speed  </li>
            <li> I was wrong, it has made a big difference in my dental health and the cleanliness of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime Sonicare user and tried this after my third Sonicare failed.</li>
            <li> AT 72 I JUST GOT LAZY, WITH NO SPOUCE TO PROD ME ON, I JUST LET MYSELF GO.</li>
            <li> I have not gone one year in the past decade without having a cavity show up on an x-ray.  </li>
            <li> However, I used the water flosser about once a month and brushed once a night every night without fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small, but it does take countertop space.</li>
            <li> Im Not happy for the money i spent.</li>
            <li> As usual, it arrived ahead of the estimated date of delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend money on myself</li>
            <li> I usually use manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is like going to the dentist everyday!</li>
            <li> It is compact and fits perfectly on my small vanity.  </li>
            <li> It seems to get my teeth clean, but I don&#x27;t know if I can keep this due to the horrible noise.</li>
            <li> When I say annoying, I mean you really have to be careful when using it otherwise</li>
            <li> After I accidentally left my expensive Phillips Sonicare toothbrush at a relative&#x27;s house, the base was stolen in the mail (I know, some things are beyond belief, they actually left me with the head).</li>
            <li> Bought back by the time a problem arises, the quality is very poor, but the machine has returned to Hong Kong so that the herd</li>
            <li> Unlike the Sonicare that sits on top of the charging platform, the Waterpik charger has an open bottom with a ring around the base to charge so the unit is never sitting in water (the latter results in a horrible build-up of mold and debris).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does all it promises to do and after 3 or 4 months of use I have very few complaints.</li>
            <li> Waterpik is very messy, and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I spent a couple hundred $ on a deep (and painful) cleaning and then bought this machine that week.  </li>
            <li> Going from a Braun electric round to this sonic tooth brush is such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> not so cheap mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Overall....totally disappointed!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the reservoir is a little inconvenient to refill</li>
            <li> Poorly made item compared to other Waterpik products, switch and handled both were broken less than 50 days in use.</li>
            <li> and I started on 4 which produced a bit of a bloody waterfall the first use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the base is larger</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless now.</li>
            <li> It has been impossible for me to find a way to contact Waterpik to report the problem or have it fixed before the warranty ended.</li>
            <li> but after a few months the flosser wont spray very hard.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time flossing but since I&#x27;ve been using the water pik flosser</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend I buy a water pick for bridge work that&#x27;s hard to reach with floss.</li>
            <li> to those hard to reach spots with the water pick.&lt;br /&gt;Drastically improves gum health.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> doing my research, I found that I had a hard time figuring out how this system would work.  </li>
            <li> I have a bridge that is hard to reach</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about people having a hard time with getting the hang of using it without getting water everywhere</li>
            <li> And I no longer  feel that tartar buildup in those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Just went to the dentist and hardly had any plaque to remove.  </li>
            <li> and I have always had a hard time flossing.  </li>
            <li> My dentist said that I have been brushing to hard and that has contributed to loss of enamel.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find  them both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a sonic toothbrush but was having a hard time justifying the cost.  </li>
            <li> Even though there are negative reviews on both Waterpik had a far lower percentage of bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately almost everything has been made in China and quality sucks.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;d never heard of a water flosser before, but the thought of pressure washing my mouth intrigued me.</li>
            <li> That SUCKS in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use at least once a day and sometimes put mouthwash in it.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only negative:  </li>
            <li> I was told it was too late.</li>
            <li> I read all negative reviews before i bought this water flosser.</li>
            <li> People complained their toothbrush died after a month or 2 but come on use common sense.</li>
            <li> My mouth has honestly never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> You can not replace the battery, you must replace the toothbrush unit, at a cost of at least $50.00</li>
            <li> I will never not own a water flosser from here on out.</li>
            <li> Read the negative reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> Smh at least the flosser works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find the combination of both appliances in one, and my bathroom has minimal counter space which dictates what I can place there.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day and each time I eat.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is for the Sonic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They advised me to start slowly if I did get a waterpik.</li>
            <li> after 3 months of use, it started to slowly lose it&#x27;s power.</li>
            <li> I have slowly been building up to stronger pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go slowly till you are accustomed to irrigation force &amp; learn to position yourself over basin.  </li>
            <li> The motor vibrates the whole kit violently.</li>
            <li> The water pik flosser portion is essentially a pressure washer for your teeth and destroys that annoying plaque build up on the gumline and other debris in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> No more costly batteries!</li>
            <li> I have had other flossers and the tank was always difficult to get off to fill.  </li>
            <li> The main issue being I&#x27;m crazy CRAZY LAZY.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is unbelievable that in the 21st century the manufacturer of this product does not consider the limitations of the sick and elderly people:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more excuses for poor home care.</li>
            <li> After years of neglect (hate going to the dentist and hate flossing more!)</li>
            <li> the reservoir is very small.  </li>
            <li> This is a very messy item!</li>
            <li> it held four brush heads, four water pik tips, plus the handle for them and a reservoir - all with a very small footprint.  </li>
            <li> I will be contacting Waterpik to get a new body for the brush, but it&#x27;s a piece of crap with no way to recharge or replace batteries.</li>
            <li> I even feel guilty on those odd nights</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> seriously.. risk</li>
            <li> Seems ridiculous to shell out 80-100 bucks every two years for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears the waterpik company is on a downward quality slide, they don’t have any serious competitors so they are just going to milk the customers while they can.</li>
            <li> I was told to buy a waterpik by my dentist  because I have tight teeth that are difficult to floss.</li>
            <li> within the week I started using it my gums were a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried, I continue to get worse with each check up.  </li>
            <li> not a good match for me</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is not good as Oral-B&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It will keep a charge for awhile but for longer trips, it not good.  </li>
            <li> I was never good at brushing and flossing well</li>
            <li> Toothbrush head no good</li>
            <li> but it is loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The long power cord can be crammed into the bottom of the base to hide and then run through a small cut out at the bottom</li>
            <li> but they are tough to floss and brush.</li>
            <li> At the very least, you will knock it off every time you try to fill the tank by removing it.  </li>
            <li> They are expensive and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy that the sellers try to hide the country of origin.</li>
            <li> The inside of the toothbrush spring has broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Just confused as to why they never recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> truth be told (dentists will hate me for this) - if you follow my formula - you can actually reverse cavities with this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle hose was broken soon after use.</li>
            <li> I am almost addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this water flosser.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the tooth brush was broken, I had to call the Manufacturer to get it replaced.</li>
            <li> It works.... but its annoying, hence only 3 starts.</li>
            <li> Decreased bleeding gums</li>
            <li> I ordered the Waterpik to replace my broken sonic toohbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it can be taken on short trips without the base.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a game changer in my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Broken wiring means broken brush .</li>
            <li> Not happy until I get this sort it out.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I recently saw the lcd lights flicker( on the toothbrush), indicating that it was charging but as soon as I lifted the toothbrush from the charging base it stopped working.</li>
            <li> No help in getting it serviced is frustrating.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;a game changer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This product equals, less time in dentist chair!!!!</li>
            <li> A small gripe for the Piks mount is a little annoying as is hose.  </li>
            <li> The problem was, I did return it to Walgreens and exchanged it for another WP-60W, but that one leaked, too, and I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of another return, so I kept the replacement Model WP-60W and have been unhappy with its leaking for the past 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> storage space for brushes and flosser, long cord but excess can be stored in the base.</li>
            <li> Using it on the highest setting can be a little painful, but if that&#x27;s your kinda thing, then crank it up to 10.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised and disgusted by the food particles it washed out from between my teeth</li>
            <li> I previously used a battery operated water flosser and was disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Other than the mildly annoying pump noise it makes while you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes are very weak.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush when stored in the charging base gets very hot at the base!</li>
            <li> Ill look into find a solution soon.  </li>
            <li> This model of the Waterpik is like an expensive sports car beside a jalopy in comparison to the bottom-of-the-line Model WP-60W, and the WP-100 is like a mid-priced sedan in compared to the WP-900.</li>

            <li> If something goes wrong, I&#x27;ll post an update.and plaque out from between the teeth and gums, without hurting.</li>
            <li> If something goes wrong, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> So now I have an expensive dust collector sitting on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> So given that, the reviews, and the price, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be buying expensive sonicare again.</li>
            <li> and I think I clicked on the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I got one for my son this year for Christmas.</li>
            <li> know, I know, close your d*mn mouth and use the thing blindly,</li>
            <li> I am a random brusher and go all over for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands and find it difficult to floss correctly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with water leaking, but you will get water around your sink if you spray the Waterpik at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> The rubber gasket fails to seal the hole.</li>
            <li> Wtf?  </li>
            <li> just shy of my two year warranty the battery on the toothbrush dies</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer!</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical about these water flossers.when my dentist recommended getting one.  </li>
            <li> About day 3 to day 4 I noticed that my troubled tooth that I wanted to have extracted did not swell anymore around the gum.  </li>
            <li> anyone would send me an appliance which cannot work here as it has the wrong voltage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As one can imagine the product is useless without these.</li>
            <li> here I thought it was the lame gift, but it&#x27;s been his favorite!&lt;br /&gt;he</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m unable to remove the cap.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In September 2014 the toothbrush unit stopped charging and failed to work.</li>
            <li> It is useless.  </li>
            <li> the vibration get a bit uncomfortable  </li>
            <li> The compressor/motor in this toothbrush failed to function after five weeks of use.</li>
            <li> the tooth brush broke my tooth that was fake.</li>
            <li> Makes this portion of the unit useless.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush failed to charge after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> was wrong--</li>
            <li> /&gt;So sad</li>
            <li> we bought this for my husband who was having lots of expensive dental issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be sorry</li>
            <li> Flawed product will never buy another</li>
            <li> Difficult to do when you have this thing in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Will update if anything goes wrong.  </li>
            <li> Skeptical that the toothbrush wasn&#x27;t &#x27;Sonicare&#x27; branded, but  would buy again.  </li>
            <li> it was a weird sensation...</li>
            <li> Flossing was always awkward and difficult which meant i would skip doing it often.</li>
            <li> Wayyyy easier than fumbling and sawing away with nasty lengths of sharp ribbon.  </li>
            <li> Im afraid of it.  </li>
            <li> (ice cold water through the pik is rather excruciating on the teeth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am continually amazed (also amused) at the amount of stuck food that ends up in the sink after being blasted out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It works but leaks like crazy through the pick area.</li>
            <li> but the water is so cold when I use the water pic part.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to get your fingers dirty and covered in saliva trying to floss, and don&#x27;t have to deal with bleeding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my husband was skeptical, now he is the one who uses it every day!  </li>
            <li> It was always difficult to remember to floss every day but with this, I have used it 1-2 times a day and have seen an improvement in my gums!</li>
            <li> I also have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth ( very difficult to floss with string)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m was very wrong about it.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before using this</li>
            <li> Too bad Waterpik does not sell a stand-alone replacement toothbrush instead of just the heads.</li>
            <li> I notice that using this in conjunction with salt water has eliminated my bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Bad quality control.</li>
            <li> This is bad because the toothbrush should be rechargeable instead of just sitting on the thing.</li>
            <li> I dont have anything bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> bad : With my wife and I using it needs to be recharged every two max 2.5</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Cold water shooting between teeth hurts!</li>
            <li> Up until now, I was a devoted Sonicare user, though disappointed with their air floss product.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing because besides bleeding gums after the floss, I have swollen painful gums.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Everything works as advertised, but I&#x27;m disappointed that this combo isn&#x27;t Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the vibration of this brand, as it compares to my son&#x27;s Sonicare (sp?)</li>
            <li> It was not advertised correctly and I was disappointed by lack of some of the &amp;#34;assumed features.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> am disappointed that the battery in the Sonic toothbrush did not fully charge.</li>
            <li> Disappointed but stuck.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , however I was a bit disappointed in the design for storing irrigation heads and toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> is to expenses ,I am really disappointed .</li>
            <li> Scary!!</li>
            <li> So bad every brush was a blood bath, flossing a terrible painful chore, i couldnt eat an apple without bleeding.</li>
            <li> how we can  charge the toothbrush there is no charge base?</li>
            <li> The tooth brush charges in the stand attached to the base.</li>
            <li> I literally hate to do it.  </li>
            <li> My dentist was upset because I hate flossing my teeth and don&#x27;t do it as often as I should.  </li>
            <li> It is well designed and does not leave an accumulation of paste build up on the handle or base.</li>
            <li> toothbrush base has to be charged up.  </li>
            <li> For people who really hate messiness in any form, this might not work out well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I hate flossing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Had the charger base not stopped working, I would have given this item 5 stars, even though it does take up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> --cleaner teeth, I hate flossing--and this gets everything&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I hate to floss.</li>
            <li> They said without seeing the unit they could not determine if it was the toothbrush unit or the base unit which was malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> Purchased the WP-900 and after 2 weeks the toothbrush base plastic cracked.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing and this works</li>
            <li> I used to hate flossing</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize that the base had to be plugged in for it to recharge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just to bad that I didn&#x27;t have money for this along time ago because it would&#x27;ve saved me tons of money at the dentist!</li>
            <li> I always hated dental floss, sometimes going extended periods of time between flossing.  </li>
            <li> I am someone who has always hated flossing.  </li>
            <li> Plus no longer do I suffer from cold sensitivity!!</li>

            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts, all state they love it.</li>
            <li> Great product so far. The water flosser does not make a big mess, but like any others, you do have to lean over the sink. The toothbrush is excellent, I like it much better than my SonicCare.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective but can&#x27;t complain at this price point. Update: if you recently pulled out a wisdom tooth or will do so soon, BUY this one!!! I didnt even realize but I had so much food particles in the gum hole that I can never remove with regular tooth brushes, but this waterpik completely removed every single bit of them. I didnt know waterpik was so powerful. 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> Excellent for oral hygiene . Brushes wear out fast . Water pick removes trapped food that the toothbrush and flossing do not.Also stimulates gums</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It works great - does everything it promises. Great quality.  Easy to use. Nothing negative to say about this product.  I plan to buy another as a gift.  Very pleased I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Ordering one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Water pick works but in order to stop water from coming out you need to hold button down. As soon as you turn unit on if you do not have blue button held down water starts shooting out.  Purchased for my Daughter to help clean her expander.  She ends up shooting water all over the place.  Wish the button would dispense the water instead of stopping it.  To brush is ok.</li>
            <li> I received this system hoping it would be great. I needed a new toothbrush since mine died and my dentist has been suggesting a waterpik. They advised me to start slowly if I did get a waterpik. The brush is great pausing every 30 seconds to let you know to change quadrants, but you have to pay attention because its a very brief pause. It&#x27;s not as fancy as the latest and greatest out there, but considering you get both its an awesome price. I put mouthwash in the waterpick side because I struggle with soft enamel, sensitive teeth and dry mouth. I&#x27;m hoping by using my Biotene mouthwash in there I can improve my issues.  The low setting is extremely gentle. My only complait is its not smaller so I can take it to work.</li>
            <li> excellant performance</li>
            <li> Great quality machine and we love how it works.</li>
            <li> I got one of these and it works so well my wife wanted her own. Now we have two!</li>
            <li> Electric than manual brush clean, coordination with the cleaning is very practical</li>
            <li> To keep it brief, this is a very simple setup. The toothbrush lasts about 2 weeks on a single charge for brief morning and evening brushings (each approximately 2 minutes). I always fill the reservoir with tepid water and spray until it is empty. For those who do not floss regularly, I recommend starting on a low setting (2, maybe 3) to gauge how your gums will react. I was flossing regularly with the tiny piks and I started on 4 which produced a bit of a bloody waterfall the first use. I dialed it back to 3 for the second and I have worked my way up to 6 now. I personally don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go beyond 6, which stings a little even if I don&#x27;t bleed anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone wondering, the toothbrush is waterproof, so you can use it in the shower without any worries of the battery getting wet and corroding. Also, the battery charges wirelessly when you insert it into its little cradle; very cool feature.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush totally stooped to work after few month of use</li>
            <li> Great price on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using it my gums are 100% healthier, and I use the waterpik approximately 6 times a week, and I definitely regret when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little awkward to get used to at first.  At this point I can use it on 8 out of 10 without any problems, and don&#x27;t feel its necessary to go any higher.&lt;br /&gt;Can accommodate the use of water, or mouthwash/water combo and comes with numerous attachments.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with 2 heads, and runs on a timer to help get the full 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great and my teeth are in much better shape after just a few months of use. It&#x27;s already payed for itself in the money I am no longer spending for extensive cleanings. My dentist says my teeth have never been healthier so I call this a great deal.</li>
            <li> Wore my other Waterpik out, had it almost five years. I floss and brush and think my teeth are clean, but then I use the Waterpik and still more food particles are flushed out of my teeth.  Didn&#x27;t have the toothbrush with the pik before, but this is a one minute timing for all four surfaces of the teeth. Just had my dental check up and have been using my pik, brushing and flossing morning and night and the hygienist said my teeth were really good.  The best part, it didn&#x27;t take as long as usual and the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very good device.  Water Flosser works well but you have to get used to it or water goes everywhere.  Teeth feel cleaner.  Toothbrush also works well, although sometimes it just speeds up and not sure why.  Good product and it is great that both items come as one unit.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I use this product. I believe we have had it for a little over a year. Recently we experienced water leaking from the reservoir bottom when filling it and then transferring it to the unit. We contacted Waterpik and described our problem. They provided us with a seal (and one extra) for the water reservoir (no charge) which I replaced and the reservoir no longer leaks. The product works fine and we would not hestitate buying one again.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised. A unit with everything in it. I hope it lasts a long time as if one breaks you are stuck with one big machine. I have noted that the hose on the waterpik tends to break over usage and will need to be replaced. They should come up with a better solution to this issue.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied this product.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me!</li>
            <li> Good ，High performance price ratio，Feel good</li>
            <li> Everything worked just as expected no compaints.  My teeth feel and look so much better since using this waterpik.</li>
            <li> I love have the toothbrush and water flosser together in one unit. I have always like Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works well.</li>
            <li> This has changed my ferkin LIFE. My teeth showed a huge difference after a week of use. Let my husband try it and it took away some stains he had on his teeth from smoking in one use. Lets just say he&#x27;s jelly that he doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> Pause button is stuck.. AGAIN.  This is my first waterpik.  I really love the effect but am tired of this thing not working.  Several times the  pause button on the handle has been stuck for days.  I have no idea how long it may be stuck this time but it&#x27;s time to toss this thing out.  Am hoping to have better luck with a model that has a pause switch instead of a button.</li>
            <li> Very nice combination ultrasonic tooth brush with the flossing jet.  Compact and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only had mine for 35 days and the sonic toothbrush quit on the high gear.  FIVE days past the return date</li>
            <li> Makes your mouthful clean and</li>
            <li> Works great! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when the toothbrush is on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, it vibrates in my head, so I keep it on low. Waterpik does the job with 4 different heads. I&#x27;d buy again.  As of 5/4/15: I believe I figured out why there are a few reviews about toothbrushes that stopped working. I keep the unit plugged in all the time, and I went to use the toothbrush the other night and the bottom (where the battery is) was quite hot. I think that the unit is supposed to stay unplugged until the toothbrush needs charging again, plug in and charge, then unplug it as soon as it&#x27;s charged. I don&#x27;t remember seeing this in the instructions, but it&#x27;s worth noting. I may not be correct in this assumption, but we&#x27;ll see if mine keeps going or not by leaving it unplugged until it needs charging.</li>
            <li> Works well, wish it had 2 full power brush heads though. It is a little messy to use but what can you expect with squirting water...</li>
            <li> I order this from amazon for about 100$ and after just about a week of use im in love.  The toothbrush is powerful but gentle at the same time.  I can feel it scraping the junk off my teeth and can see a difference as well. To me the brush was a bonus I really came for the Water Flosser.  I usually cant floss because my gums bleed and Im afraid of it.  But after giving the water flosser a shot flossing will never be an issue and maybe i can return to normal floss after extensive use of this. NOTE the water does run quickly so you may have to fill it twice for a good cleaning.  THE extra tips included are a very nice touch.  FOR the price i payed it is well worth it and i would highly recommend to a friend.  It also comes with a travel case for the tooth brush although it makes no sense to travel seeing as how the charger is built in.  Ill look into find a solution soon.  NOTE the brush is loud but if it doesnt bother you it serves its purpose very well. Ill most likely come back to do an update but in the event that I dont you should know that I am very much enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> STILL HAVE IT AND LOVE IT GOT EM WHEN I GOT MY BRACES A YEAR AGO AND WORKS LIKE NEW!!!</li>
            <li> Ora Hygiene at it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> So based on good reviews and a decent price for this set I went ahead and purchased it, so let me go ahead and give some impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) instructions state should have a tongue cleaner, isn&#x27;t one in the box.  Not necessarily a big deal to me but found it odd that what is suppose to be here is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t necessarily anything phenomenal, granted is does its job just fine.  Any time it includes a built in timer is a nice feature but short of that I doesn&#x27;t particularly find anything that differentiates it from a $20 electric brush.  Maybe with time my feelings will change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  The water flosser was kind of disappointing, maybe I just expected to much?  The unit vibrates... a lot... especially as you turn up the power, to which actually reaches a point where its pretty unnecessary.  Playing with the power I actually got to a point where I could make my gums bleed, granted everyone&#x27;s mouth is different and that&#x27;s why the adjustment exists, but between the vibration and the noise from it I don&#x27;t know if anyone is going to be using &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; on the power settings.  The &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button is a physical stop as oppose to an electrical and due to this water will continue to pump through and squirt out just at a reduced speed.  Aside from those things you can make a huge mess with this, which I know I will just have to learn how to use it properly over time to get the best results, but first few times you are guaranteed to get a few puddles on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the reasons listed, I give this product &amp;#34;its ok&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m not necessarily regretting my purchase but I can tell you I&#x27;m not excited about it at this point either.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! Have gotten so many compliments on how much whiter my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Loved this when we first received it.  after 3 months of use, it started to slowly lose it&#x27;s power.When we called the company with the issues they responded immediately and were very easy to deal with .    all is working fine once more</li>
            <li> It is a great product. Satisfaction.</li>
            <li> i loved this product and my boyfriend gave it a try.  he liked it so much, he considered buying one, but instead i ordered him one as a gift.  shipping got delayed for some reason, but no big deal - it&#x27;s worth the wait and the price is very reasonable for a sonic toothbrush and the water-flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hate flossing, and i rarely ever do it, but this method of flossing has increased my semi-annual flossing to bi-weekely.  i&#x27;m sure my dentist will be pleased and so will my gums :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the sonic toothbrush is great but i don&#x27;t know of any comparable sonic toothbrushes to say if it&#x27;s better than the rest - while it&#x27;s still better and quicker than manual brushes.  it requires a 24 hour charge before use (pretty typical for any re-chargeable device these days) however the waterflosser can be used while the toothbrush is charging for the first day.</li>
            <li> This was easy to set up and use. However,It does take a little while to get used to using this. The pieces are easy to put onto the pic-head and to remove. I love the the clear plastic reservoir which makes it easy to track how much water is left. It does run out of water quickly. Its really nice to have waterpik and toothbrush in one unit, but there is no place to store the tooth brushes and the whole setup of heads and brushes in the unit. The entire unit fits comfortably on the counter and it does not take up much.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is not what I had expected - it has a sonic style movement and my teeth feel as clean as when the dentist has done a cleaning job.  I liked it so much that I bought my husband one too.</li>
            <li> Great combo package deal!</li>
            <li> It works fine and looks good setting in my bath. I feel very clean after I finish using it every morning.</li>
            <li> Awesome machine.  Needs a transformer if used in countries with 230v.  But still worthwhile, as a good transformer is around $40 from China.</li>
            <li> I will encouraging everybody to purchase this product it is very good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Delivered perfect and this duo works awesome.  Was also recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> Love it - My Teeth Feel Fantastic.  I decided to buy this one after reading the reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I really feel and see the difference after using the Waterpik toothbrush.  I agree with others who have reviewed this product about the 2 speeds, low being too slow and high being slightly too high (it takes some getting used to the feeling on your teeth) but I like the results and that&#x27;s what matters.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doreen</li>
            <li> excellent product.  was recommended by my dentist, and have used it since.  works great.</li>
            <li> First off, I cant brush my teeth for any length of time, due to all toothpastes burning my mouth.  So I did the best I could until I got this time.  The brush speeds up that process and Ive never flossed (mouth burned too much by then), but with this I do.  The pressure is good.  The highest setting is very forceful and of great use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id easily recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I obtain one of these after receiving a recent implant..  I have had perio issues since I was 19 and now 60.  This thing is amazing.  I have had it now for well over a month.  Talk about receiving a power wash of your mouth!  And there is an electric toothbrush to boot!  I wish I would have purchased this amazing flosser and toothbrush a long time ago.  It really has helped my gums and my teeth a lot!  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;d recommend to everyone who would like healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great and so is the pick, but you have train yourself to turn it off and on at the main control, because the push button quit working almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Messy, but it is GREAT!  There has been a huge improvement in the overall health of my mouth.  Very little placque with my last cleaning.  I would highly recommendoubt this product!</li>
            <li> I bought a lot of things this past year but without a shadow of a doubt, this was my best purchase of 2014.  I do have to point out that the first use is a real shocker with water spraying all over the place--just always use to staring at my face and opened mouth when flossing.  By the second use I had become a pro and now my teeth and gums always feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> I love this because I hate to floss. I like to look in the mirror while doing this and you can&#x27;t do this without getting water all over the place. It&#x27;s also a little loud when flossing.</li>
            <li> Hi. If you looking for good water pick made in good ol US, you will have problem. About 2 months ago when I purchased this unit , they claimed that this unit pic was made in states with good warrantee.  That&#x27;s the reason I bought it. Big surprise [ha ha] it  has been made in china.&lt;br /&gt;Now the good. After 2 months it still working.  Good pressure..The tooth brush is fine.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The unite is very light, leaking water from bottom, the tube is short, the handle also leaks  and it&#x27;s MADE IN CHINA.&lt;br /&gt;I will need replace the handle with the tube pretty soon.  Very cheep and cheesy  looking unit.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately almost everything has been made in China and quality sucks. I&#x27;m not happy that the sellers try to hide the country of origin.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Great deal!</li>
            <li> Amazing deal to get both a great toothbrush and the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Forget the voltage here is 220V, bang, burst</li>
            <li> Really good unit.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I like it so much I am brushing and flossing a lot more....</li>
            <li> Love it great product</li>
            <li> I was in for an initial exam at dental office to have fillings fixed&lt;br /&gt;. Was told I have peridontitis. Hygenist said that the plaque and tartar buildup were less when I came in for the deep cleaning.  That was after a month of use.  We will see what 6 months brings</li>
            <li> This is the greatest oral hygiene device EVER!  I feel as though I&#x27;ve visited the dentist each time I use it.  My teeth feel so awesome after I use this I find myself making excuses to brush or waterpik.  You will not be disappointed.  Have had for ~6weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik water flosser since 2006. I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars. That first one was a [[ASIN:B006HG5A5G Model WP-100]], and it lasted six years. It worked quite well until it finally wore out, and I only had to purchase 2-3 replacement [[ASIN:B0062N5AZO Jet Tips]] for it in all that time. The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don&#x27;t replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won&#x27;t stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second Waterpik I purchased in 2012 was a [[ASIN:B000063SLR Model WP-60W]]. I got it at a local Walgreens drugstore. This model was a problem from the start, because the reservoir was constantly leaking water. I know now, from reading today the excellent manual that comes with this Model WP-900, that my Model WP-60W had a defective reservoir valve and the warranty would have covered replacing it. The problem was, I did return it to Walgreens and exchanged it for another WP-60W, but that one leaked, too, and I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of another return, so I kept the replacement Model WP-60W and have been unhappy with its leaking for the past 2.5 years. Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so, I wrongly assumed when I bought the Model WP-60W that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon, I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and I learned the different model numbers by looking at the pictures of the various models sold by Waterpik on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also due to replace my electric toothbrush, and I was fascinated by the information I read about the Waterpik Sonic toothbrush. Waterpik&#x27;s ad copy on their website and on Amazon claims that the Sonic is much better than the Philips Sonicare, which is the brand I have used for over a decade in the [[ASIN:B009TZRQE0 Essence series]]. I had been fairly satisfied with the Sonicare, but mainly because it was the only brand I have ever used, so I hadn&#x27;t compared it with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would very much like to try the Sonic, but I noted that the price for the Sonic and a Waterpik higher quality water flosser model, when sold separately, would amount to about $170--a pretty steep cost and out of my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran across this model, the WP-900, at a terrific two-for-one price, offering a top-of-the-line Waterpik water flosser plus the Sonic electric toothbrush, and sold by a merchant here on Amazon for a price below retail. I snapped it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today, and I am extremely impressed. Here are the things I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The product is well packed, such that the flosser and toothbrush are well protected, but everything was easily opened--no clamshell horror packing.&lt;br /&gt;2. The manual and quick-start guides are well written and well illustrated, and in print large enough that it is actually readable.&lt;br /&gt;3. The product is simple to assemble, and the head of the Sonic toothbrush pops off (just pull it off, like taking a cork out of bottle, in an upward motion), compared to having to screw on and off the head of the Sonicare electric toothbrush. The brush head of the Sonicare also gets really sloppy and the inside of the handle has a well which gets very wet and has to be, with great difficulty, scrubbed out to remove mold buildup. There is no such problem with the handle of the Sonic. There is no well in the handle for water to get into.&lt;br /&gt;4. The Sonic toothbrush&#x27;s rechargeable battery arrived 1/3 charged, which was enough to immediately use it. It also re-charges much faster than the Sonicare. It has indicator lights to tell you how charged the battery is, whether 1/3, 2/3 or completely charged, which the Sonicare does not have and which I love.&lt;br /&gt;5. The Sonic toothbrush has two speeds, which the Sonicare does not have. This is a terrific perk.&lt;br /&gt;6. The brush of the Sonic toothbrush is smaller than the Sonicare, and the feel of the brush, including its size, shape and the vibration of its movement, is exponentially more pleasant and effective to use than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;7. This model of the Waterpik is like an expensive sports car beside a jalopy in comparison to the bottom-of-the-line Model WP-60W, and the WP-100 is like a mid-priced sedan in compared to the WP-900. I love the design of the separate, lidded compartments for the water reservoir and one that holds the water-flosser heads and the head of the Sonic toothbrush. The water reservoir comes off easily and fits in place easily, with zero leaking from its valve--what a relief!&lt;br /&gt;8. The pause buttons on the Waterpik water flosser and the Sonic electric toothbrush both work much better than those on the Model WP-60W Waterpik and the Sonicare electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;9. The price of the replacement brush heads for the Sonic are about 1/4 the cost of the replacement heads for my Sonicare--which is a huge savings over the life of an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;10. The insertion fittings of the Jet Tips of the WP-900 water flosser, compared to those of the Jet Tips for the cheaper WP-60W, are much higher quality, which means that the Jet Tips leak less and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;11. This product has a two-year warranty for defects in its construction, and a problem like a defective reservoir valve can be solved at home, by getting a replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am in heaven with the great quality of this product. It works so much more effectively than what I&#x27;ve been struggling with previously, that I am able to do my dental care in literally half the time it took me with my Sonicare and Model WP-60W Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more satisfied with this product, and I recommend it without reservation.em with the handle of the Sonic.

            <li> Item delivered quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> great product. love it</li>
            <li> Great product! Multiple adjustments for water pressure makes it easier to choose the setting that is best for your mouth. Unit doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room. Easy to fill and clean. I really enjoy having the toothbrush and water pick in one unit.</li>
            <li> watter pic not too strong but the toothbrush it&#x27;s awesome first time I ever used one</li>
            <li> Seem like a very nice set-up. Purchased for my daughter, she seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Great. got this for my wife and she loves it. She got braces and this helped with the cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great &#x3D;&#x3D; dentist encouraged me to buy, and I have wanted one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did without this machine before, the instant I start using it my sink had food in it. It&#x27;s amazing how precise it works with cleaning my mouth. I actually bought my machine from QVC because I couldn&#x27;t tell if this machine came with all the extra pieces such as the tongue cleaner. However this product as been great, I have even notice how much more my gums are because they are so extra clean from using the water pik.</li>
            <li> everybody needs one of these.</li>
            <li> Best flossing and electronic brush array of attachments.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great product and I would highly recommend.  WaterPik has the best customer service I have experienced.</li>
            <li> Nice having both things combined but the toothbrush I think could be a little more aggressive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t leave without this machine.  It is like having a professional cleaning every morning.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt so clean!  I love that it has two speeds on the toothbrush and that there are multiple waterpik heads.</li>
            <li> I love the built in timer on the toothbrush.  It allows one to brush each quadrant of the mouth for 30 seconds.  The waterpik feature always makes me feel that I am getting my mouth so much cleaner, particularly coupled with flossing and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> only one light battery when i received</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 with Diabetes 2 &amp; my dentist recommended investing in a waterpik to keep gums healthy. Diabetics more likely to develop gum disease than others. This multi-purpose tool does it all with multiple heads for the waterpik: removes trapped food debris, cleans below the gum line where damaging decay can begin, and the sonic toothbrush finishes with a nice polish.  I&#x27;m using an antibacterial rinse in the waterpik water for complete dental health program.  I have Amazon Prime so received order in 2 days. Easy to clean, compact on my counter, use warm water for comfort.  Highly recommend.  Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush but the rest seems pointless, it doesn&#x27;t clean anything deep but just a simple wash off. I got it with a low price so fair enough.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  I am very satisfied with it.  I recommend it highly if you have any kind of gum problem.</li>
            <li> Only one word....WOW! For all the skeptics out there, this product really works and does exactly what it says on the box. This is so far the best buy for my money throughout the whole year. This review is coming from someone who has used all the big name brands of electric toothbrushes and more expensive than the Waterpik. Get one now. Your mouth, teeth and gum will thank you.</li>
            <li> works great. love the built in toothbrush. My dentist liked it as well</li>
            <li> if you want a powerful water pik along with a very powerful toothbrush this is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I love about this product.&lt;br /&gt;1) It is great to have both in one unit as to not have the whole area full of wires.&lt;br /&gt;2) The toothbrush is very powerful with two settings.&lt;br /&gt;3) The waterpik is very powerful with a range of settings and attachments&lt;br /&gt;4) The toothbrush design makes it easy to clean although you still have to clean the charger area it is easier than with an individual brush.&lt;br /&gt;5) The cover over the water container is attached to the unit so it does not constantly fall off as in previous piks.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative&lt;br /&gt;1) You cannot travel with just your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent all-in-one product. I&#x27;ve used Braun in the past and I liked this toothbrush better, besides now I have a waterpik as well.</li>
            <li> Best of the best.  Works great.  We three have used it for a year and it works good.  Cheaper than the dentist.  I mix  about 10% hydrogen peroxide and 10% listerine  in the the water to help kill germs below the gum line.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot, however the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work like it did when it was new. Whenever I use the highspeed setting it does nothing but make noise.</li>
            <li> A gift for me!! My old one was retired even though it still worked just that I felt it was to old to have to work so hard.</li>
            <li> Everything works great only thing to make it perfect is the battery for the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t last too long. Fully charged should last 4-6 days brushing twice a day for 5-10min each time. Besides that awesome product.</li>
            <li> I found that the water pick combination  was exactly as I hoped for.  You r teeth feel so clean right after you brush and floss. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for super clean teeth and moufh.</li>
            <li> Amazing tiny pressure washer for your mouth. Really gets everything out from between your teeth fast.I&#x27;m going to use it to clean my electric razor next. Maybe.</li>
            <li> This product works wonder.  My hygienist recommended this product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is not compatible with AUS usage.&lt;br /&gt;Even with a universal convertor, it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get it on ebay.com.au for similar price (including postage)</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I tried Philips Soniccare and a 2 others after my Waterpik died after 4 years of regular use, none had the power or brush head that the Waterpik toothbrush have.  I had to buy another Waterpik to get a good powerful toothbrush with 2 speeds and a long battery life.</li>
            <li> Cleans between teeth effectively.  Love the toothbrush also</li>
            <li> After a recent visit to the dentist I decided that I dont floss enough so I thought what better way than to use a Waterpik . So I came across this package, which was only a few bucks more and got me a very cool Cordless, rechargeable sonic toothbrush, A No Brainer .&lt;br /&gt;It took a little getting used to having never had either but once I got it down I am amazed on how clean my mouth feels afterwards. The brush sits in a small circle on the side of the unit and im not sure how but it charges with no contacts. It also has a built in timer that pulses every 30 secs until 2 mins. And I can absolutely notice that my teeth are already whiter after only a few weeks use. It also comes with a carrying case for the brush and multiple extra pik attachments...I highly reccommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Double the protection at half the price of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Very Good, It&#x27;s only fault is the water reservoir should be larger especially when using it oh high.</li>
            <li> Having both the water pick and the sonic brush is a bargain. I do feel it helps me clean my teeth well. The sizr is fine. My only complaint is the noise. I think it&#x27;s so loud, like a mini jack hammer. When I get home from work at 3 am somrtimes, I don&#x27;t use it so that I won&#x27;t awaken my husband.    Update:  I just  wanted  to  add after  a few  weeks  I find that my gums were not  as  healthy using  the  water pik alone for flossing, so  I have  once again  added  old  fashioned flossing  followed  by the water pik and  brushing.  Still like the product in aiding to keep mouth healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Best system I have used.  Have 3-unit bridge that is kept clean by brushings, but most importantly, the water flosser.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my husband.  He loves this!</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of comparing between the Waterpik and the Sonicare brands. Here is how Waterpik tipped the scales. #1 When looking at the Amazon reviews I divided the bad reviews by the good ones. Even though there are negative reviews on both Waterpik had a far lower percentage of bad reviews. #2 Waterpik is made in the US.  After using the product for a few weeks I am very, very pleased.  (UPDATE) After using and loving this water pik for a little over a year, the battery in the toothbrush stopped taking a charge. It is not replaceable, although some handy people (who know how to solder) are able to replace it. The battery pak does come out for proper disposal, but Waterpik does not sell a replacement. And replacing the electric tooth brush alone is so expensive you may as well buy a new unit.  I am replacing my Waterpik but I will be choosing another brand, because Screw You Waterpik, you suck!</li>
            <li> Love having both dental care products together.  They both work well, and take up MUCH less counter space than my old pair.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially the dual speed brush!</li>
            <li> My dentist informed me that I was in the beginning stages of gum disease and that I needed to start using a sonic toothbrush and a water pik. I was so happy to find this on Amazon - both things I needed in one! I love the way the toothbrush has a timer to let you know when to move to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; in your mouth and shuts off after 2 minutes. The additional tips for the water pik are awesome too. I made the mistake of filling up the basin with cold water the first time I used it - OUCH! Cold water shooting between teeth hurts! Always fill up with warm water! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this barely two weeks ago, and the battery already died in the toothbrush. I&#x27;m really glad I paid for a whole set of the water flosser and toothbrush to have the toothbrush be Useless after two weeks of use - not. Can&#x27;t even replace the batteries if you wanted to. I havnt even set up the water flosser yet... If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality electric toothbrush, this is definitely not what you want. It worked great for the two weeks it had power. I will be contacting Waterpik to get a new body for the brush, but it&#x27;s a piece of crap with no way to recharge or replace batteries. Sort of a key feature of the electric toothbrushes - I obviously didn&#x27;t look into it enough when I purchased my first electric toothbrush ever. Don&#x27;t bother getting this model if all you&#x27;re after is the water flosser, save the money on a simpler model</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 6 months now. It functions well but I think overall its just too fussy of an arrangement for me. I honestly cannot tell if this brush is any better than the oralB or the philips sonic i&#x27;ve had in the past. The handle vibrates quite a bit more than either of those did, but thats not really a big issue. I used the waterpik initially for quite some time, but its messy and feels like a waste of water. Again, who knows if it is an improvement over good ol&#x27; flossing. That portion is a bit rickety. Plus now that it is winter, I&#x27;d have to wait for the warm water to come up the tap, which again just feels so wasteful to me. (ice cold water through the pik is rather excruciating on the teeth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes up quite a bit of space as well, which can be a problem for those with little cabinet surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not a good match for me, I think. I&#x27;m going back to OralB.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s very handy having the water pic and tooth brush in one handy unit.  It works great, both the water pic and the sonic tooth brush.  My teeth feel wonderfully clean.  I&#x27;m sure my dentist will be impressed. I&#x27;m 71 years old and oral hygiene is very important to me and I would recommend this product.  I can&#x27;t overstate how great it is and it&#x27;s fits perfectly on the limited space I have on my sink.</li>
            <li> Although this product may seem a little bulky for some bathrooms it is completely awesome and really makes your mouth feel more clean then any product I have tried. I have had it for about a month now and wouldn&#x27;t go without it ever again.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because as an adult I just got braces.  This is perfect in the cleaning process!  Love it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. Loves the product.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t discovered the joys of waterpik your teeth definitely have food debris between them.  This unit works great and paired with a very good electric toothbrush is a bargain.</li>
            <li> As someone with braces, this is a must have when it comes to oral hygiene.  If I would&#x27;ve known better I would have bought just the waterpik without the brush, but oh well.  I really only use the waterpik because its great at cleaning between braces.  You get a clean feeling after using this.</li>
            <li> I love this combo by Waterpick</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these units for myself and loved it.  It takes up less counter space than having both a rechargeable toothbrush and flosser on the countertop.  So I ordered another thru Amazon for my daughter.  The unit that came was defective and would not charge the toothbrush.  The seller will not allow a return or replacement.  So I am stuck with an $88 product that does not work!  This is my first bad experience with Amazon.  I admit I rarely return things, but I will hesitate to buy anything through Amazon again if it costs more than I am willing to throw away.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  I got an A-plus from my dentist. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! Two products in one saves tons!</li>
            <li> Up until now, I was a devoted Sonicare user, though disappointed with their air floss product.  This beats both hands down.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this water pic!!</li>
            <li> My dentist says the flosser has helped my gums, so when I got a replacement unit, I decided to try the one with the toothbrush. After 15 years of using Braun, I&#x27;ve decided this is as good or better. It&#x27;s convenient to only need one electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> I thought it to be a good investment, we started using it Christmas day, and today we went to use it and the toothbrush is dead..  For some reason it is not recharging the toothbrush.  The waterpik works great.  But not brushing, so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. I recently went to the dentist for a cleaning and she was asking me if a already had my teeth cleaned somewhere else. I love and and actually look forward to using it because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. After reading reviews and instructions, I used it with no spills right from the first try. I see food remains go into the sink with EVERY use, and AFTER brushing. This is now an essential part of my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> The flosser I feel could be a bit more powerful but I guess that&#x27;s personal taste. For the rave reviews I expected it to be better, but it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels a lot more cleaner using the flosser, although I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep using the electric toothbrush because it hurts my teeth a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;cleaner feeling&lt;br /&gt;Saw bits of food come out, so I&#x27;m assuming the flosser is working&lt;br /&gt;easy to use as oppose to traditional flossing&lt;br /&gt;variety of tools to choose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;LOUD! If you have roommates and don&#x27;t want to wake them, not for you.&lt;br /&gt;water everywhere, even with correct use there&#x27;s a lot of water&lt;br /&gt;Hurts, specially the toothbrush it comes with. Maybe it&#x27;s just my teeth (my teeth are small if that helps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ll keep using the flosser because of how it makes my teeth feel. However, the price of this should be knocked down a bit I feel it&#x27;s too expensive for what it&#x27;s worth. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the water tank, it tends to run out either right at a good time (when I&#x27;m done flossing) or right before I finish.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that performs as promised. Saves buying 2 more expensive devices. Small footprint and numerous attachments for the waterpik</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like doing negative reviews and tend to have a bit of mercy with companies if they&#x27;ve supplied good customer service when there&#x27;s a problem. Such is not the case with Waterpik after my 5th phone call to them.     I purchased a Water Pik Toothbrush/Water Flosser on June 6, 2014, from Drugstore.com, and was enjoying the use of it very much. In December, the button on the handle of the flosser began sticking. To keep the water from spraying all over the place until you get it where you want it in your mouth and then turn the dial to \\&quot;on,\\&quot; you can use the button to \\&quot;pause\\&quot; where there is no water that sprays out of the tip. A couple weeks later it was not working at all - just stayed stuck. Even when I pulled it out with a tweezers, it wouldn&#x27;t allow any water to flow through.    On Dec. 23 I called Water Pik since it was under warranty. They were very nice and said they would send out the assembly and explained how it was to be replaced. On Dec. 30 I received a box from them and in it was the water reservoir part of the unit. Obviously not what I was expecting, so I called on Dec. 31 to report the problem. They apologized and said they would send out the correct part and 2-day Express it.     I waited until Jan. 6 (6 days later) and called again. Kelly said she would check on it and call me back with the tracking #. No call back.     On Jan. 9 I called again and spoke to Kelly who informed me that the part had been on backorder and she didn&#x27;t know why \\&quot;they\\&quot; hadn&#x27;t told me that, but that it looked like it would ship today and I&#x27;d receive it in 3-5 business days. I asked about the 2-day Express and she said she didn&#x27;t know anything about that since they weren&#x27;t allowed to make those decisions. She said it would arrive in 3-5 business days so I&#x27;d have it \\&quot;next week.\\&quot;    On Jan. 16, the end of \\&quot;next week,\\&quot; 7 days later, I called after the mail came and spoke to Lee who looked up tracking info to inform me that it was in Durham, NC (I&#x27;m in Central Virginia) and isscheduled to arrive on Jan. 20th. Hmmmm ... why don&#x27;t I have a warm and cozy feeling about that? :-)  I&#x27;m not feeling real good about customer service, warranty or reliability of Water Pik products.</li>
            <li> not what I&#x27;m expecting</li>
            <li> This was a great black Friday special purchase . The waterpic Sonic care tooth brush combo works better than expected. I wish I would have purchased it sooner.</li>
            <li> SO...I had extra money in my FSA, and I figured this was as good a time as any to get braces...boy was I not prepared for THAT life changer. Brushing and flossing turned into the most cumbersome tasks, so I started shopping for a reasonably priced electric toothbrush and water flosser....and I stumbled upon this little beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit arrived at my doorstep today, and although I am letting the toothbrush charge the full 24 hours, I couldn&#x27;t help but try the water flosser. What a time saver! I am pretty meticulous about flossing,  so what would&#x27;ve taken me 30+ min with waxed floss and a floss threader was completed in about 3 minutes. I had to fill the tank twice, but I&#x27;m sure that is because I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect  and it took some time to find a setting that I was comfortable cleaning with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting the hang of things (and trust me, it won&#x27;t take long to figure out when there&#x27;s water flying everywhere!), I felt like my braces amd teeth were as clean as I could get them. I may make it through these two years of adult awkwardness after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a combination unit, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one. It&#x27;s nice and compact and has a limited 2 year warranty.  Hopefully it lasts at least that long. I am looking forward to trying the brush, but honestly, the flosser alone, is enough to win me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly review the brush later.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is super loud.  Water pik works great though.  Toothbrush went out on ours after about a couple of months.  Not sure if the motor burned out or what.  I use a manual toothbrush now and we keep it for the water pik only.  Too much hassle to try and return it.  It&#x27;s a little large on our counter but the design is cool.</li>
            <li> Given as gift to my brother as suggested by his dentist.  He likes using it &amp; am sure it will be beneficial!</li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made in a long time.  Your teeth feel like you have just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Put it straight to work. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I really think my teeth look and feel much better since I bought this. I love it and highly recommended. Great gift for Father&#x27;s Day! I bought one for my dad.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great!!!!  Price is right and beats going to a dentist only for cleaning every 6 months when u can clean ur mouth as much u want anytime.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it came and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Like the two together!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever I don&#x27;t usually like to floss so this is great! Also the toothbrush is pretty small so it allows me to get to the back areas ! I told my doctor about this and he said it was a great and heal their choice because the water floaser works better than regular flossing. My teeth feels amazing after using this and it has even gotten rid of some stains</li>
            <li> Happy with the product</li>
            <li> When I purchased this was the best price out there.  Product delivers as it states.  If you have sensitive gums start the pick on the lowest level as it could take paint of a house on high..  I use daily</li>
            <li> A better deal than buying both separately.  I hesitated upon reading others comments about the high speed being too high and that maybe an intermediate speed would be helpful but, upon buying it, I find the high speed setting to be just fine...and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Having the toothbrush and water pik together in one device is handy and makes sense. Plastic reservoir seems brittle, but has survived several falls; just wish it fit in a place to dry.</li>
            <li> Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care&lt;br /&gt;replaced 2 old items with this all in one,&lt;br /&gt;love it...&lt;br /&gt;RC &amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> like the toothbrush better than the sonicare!  A small gripe for the Piks mount is a little annoying as is hose.  There portable one Piks my teeth better.  What is great is this one I don&#x27;t have to fill up three times to clean my teeth(one shot)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time flossing but since I&#x27;ve been using the water pik flosser my teeth feel so much cleaner and easier to floss.</li>
            <li> The inside of the toothbrush spring has broken</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Better than expected.  Awesome buy</li>
            <li> Great product, as expected: good quality and excellent for teeth health.&lt;br /&gt;A must have!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, she loved the convenience of having both unit in one.</li>
            <li> Button likes to stick in on the flosser.</li>
            <li> Great product, only need to use power setting at 3-4 (out of 10), to get a great cleaning between the teeth.  Goodbye, dental floss!</li>
            <li> Affordable and useful</li>
            <li> It would be perfect, if the power adapter could be 100-240 globly adaptive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect, but the one disappointment is that while I am using this item, the water keeps accumulating in my mouth and I have to keep turning the power off to spit out the water, then keep turning it back on.</li>
            <li> The item is great, just as it described.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on Amazon and took note of the problems people had, but the high ratings were encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;After a month with the product, I am very happy with the purchase. The equipment is made of plastic and the internal components seem very basic...I know this because I took our 1st one apart, we don&#x27;t live in the States and my wife fried our first one by plugging it into a 220v socket...it didn&#x27;t like that, and neither did I because I missed that ultra clean feeling it had given me for the previous 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd unit we purchased is working as advertised, so far no problems with battery life on the toothbrushes. We do find that we don&#x27;t use any of the extra extensions provided, just the toothbrush and waterflosser. The toothbrush refills can be expensive but seem very durable and you don&#x27;t have to apply anywhere near the pressure you would use with a normal brush as it vibrates any stuff off the teeth easily leaving you with that fresh smooth feeling. That, combined with the waterflosser gives you such a complete clean that it becomes quite addictive to use.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to hearing my dentists opinion on the next visit.</li>
            <li> best way to clean and floss!</li>
            <li> returned. too much stuff, too big on the counter.</li>
            <li> The wife and I use it everyday. I works great.</li>
            <li> It even whitened my teeth ! I love it</li>
            <li> A Quality and effective dental products that everyone should have</li>
            <li> Water Flosser is something coarsely, nut Sonic Toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who just got braces. The water flosser has been a life saver and the toothbrush is great too. We&#x27;ve only had it for a month so I can&#x27;t say how great the quality is. But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product combo. Tooth brush works well and holds a charge for several days.  Even comes with travel case. The Flosser is a little louder and slightly less pressure then the WP100W model (Flosser only unit) I owned previously.  Update:  Lowering my star rating to three stars. Had this unit for two years and the rechargeable battery in the tooth brush now only holds about a two minute charge.  Unfortunately WaterPic does not replace or repair the worn batteries and you must buy a new tooth brush.  Tooth brush alone cost more then buying this combo unit.</li>
            <li> My dentist office has been after me to get one and when I saw this with the Sonic toothbrush thought I needed to get it.  I love it.  I was surprised at how much I enjoy the toothbrush as well.  Having the unit keeps everything in one place.  Just don&#x27;t forget to start with the water pik or the toothbrush in your mouth.  Lesson already learned!</li>
            <li> Its Great toothbrush and pik . But it takes along time to charge 12-24 from dead to full. The Water pik it plenty strong and has a conveint storage for its tips. Only weird thing i noticed it toothbrush tips leak a black substance down by where it meets the handel from the paint rubbing off. this was fixed with some super glue on the colored metal ring. but other wise this is a great deal if you are looking to get a water pix, why not get an amazing toothbrush with it. it doesnt last as long as id like but i get a week out of it the 2 week battery life is most likely on low setting .the two year warranty on the toothbrush and water pik is a great touch since they decided to soder in the battery pack and not let it be user replaceable.</li>
            <li> Love my waterpik.  Easy to use and makes my mouth feel like I just came from the dentist.....every day!</li>
            <li> Love it. Just what my dentist suggested.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My teeth feel so clean and no more need to floss. I love it!</li>
            <li> The glosser works perfect but the toothbrush stops working in 2 months</li>
            <li> It is the first time that I am using an electric tooth brush and I must say that I am impressed. The result is so far so good. The flosser is excellent and the brush as well.</li>
            <li> I REALLY want to give this five stars as I LOVE the results, teeth feel great and I&#x27;m thrilled/horrified at how well the waterpik part works (what just came out from in-between my teeth-OMG). BUT, I am on my second one and BOTH quit holding a charge after about a year. Now, I do NOT expect a $99 item (what I paid for this in 2015) to last forever, but geesh, I should get a couple of years or more off of it...  That all said, I am going to buy another one...maybe the newer model is improved.</li>
            <li> The Waterpark complete care is amazing.  My teeth sparkle white as it removes stains and plaque;  My gums are thoroughly massaged;  and the water pik thoroughly removes plaque and food particles between my teeth.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this type of product.  I highly recommend to all and especially to those that struggle with gum and peridonist disease.  It is perfect!!</li>
            <li> It works well, my dentist is happy and I am happy.  Take a bit to get used to but I love it.</li>
            <li> Great power!! Love all the tools!!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easier flossing. Personally experienced less gum bleeding versus flossing with regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;-The Sonic Tooth brush is easy to use and makes a complete dental care team.&lt;br /&gt;-Sonic tooth brush&#x27;s built-in time is a wonderful reminder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes time to learn/adjust to using a waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;-Even after mastering, one may still make a water mess with water flossing.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushing the interior side of the front teeth may cause toothpaste splash on your medicine cabinet. However, this happens with all electric toothbrush. It is important to brush with correct techniques to ensure you take care of both sides of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments:&lt;br /&gt;Had a dentist appointment, and he personally does not recommend waterpik over regular flossing. However, he did agree my teeth and gums are in good shape.</li>
            <li> A must have when you have braces! Works great cleaning them out under the wires! I have never tried anything to compare it to other than your ordinary tooth brush. Beats the toothbrush by far!!!</li>
            <li> Just went back to dentist for 60 day checkup after a &amp;#34;Deep Cleaning&amp;#34;...All of my numbers were lowered by half and ZERO bleeding or sign of gingivitis.  The Hygienist said that it was &amp;#34;excellent home care&amp;#34; that accomplished that...I say it was this machine.</li>
            <li> great product but how we can  charge the toothbrush there is no charge base?</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik flosser and sonic brush, my teeth feel very clean and fresh when I am done using it. The only draw back is the waterpik is very loud. I have it sitting level on the counter and also tried putting a towel under it which didn&#x27;t help with the noise.I did email the company and was given this response: Thank you for contacting the Water Pik, Inc. product support team. Waterpik has recently elected to make a change to our Water Flosser products to be more compliant with energy efficiency. The change included changing our motors to a high voltage direct current style, reducing the wattage consumption from 34 watts to 14 watts. The new motor is lighter and may be louder than the previous motor making it more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So rather than this being a defect it appears it is part of the design.</li>
            <li> i never imagined that it would be so good. i use it daily with great esults. i would recommendit to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was great at the beginning. It isn&#x27;t even a year old and my husband is the only one to use the toothbrush part and the bottom of the tooth brush just cracked and fell apart.  This was a lot of money and very disappointed ad angry about it!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Our family dental health is of no problem for water pick . Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush and a Waterpik for years.  This is great as it combines both into 1 unit.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be one of those people who uses a sonic toothbrush but my fiance swears by his. I chose this one because of the water flosser and don&#x27;t regret it at all! My teeth feel cleaner and I don&#x27;t have to deal with dental floss anymore which makes my life easier due to the permanent retainer that makes regular flossing a pain. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for easier and more effective dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is better than I expected. It is the perfect oral care product. The water flosser has an adjustable flow control. The electric toothbrush is great for brushing as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and simple way to floss your teeth without using floss and more effective too.  I used a water pik 30 years ago but I need it more now than ever because my teeth are in worse shape.  The sonic brush works as well or better than my Sonicare.  Best purchase this year!</li>
            <li> I was leery of investing nearly $100 in this product, however, it works perfectly and has greatly improved my oral hygiene.  My dental hygienist was delighted with the results!  Once you start using a water flosser, you&#x27;ll  never go back!</li>
            <li> powerful water flosser; and I like the dual speed of toothbrush</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Bought two for our home.  Purchased another for my son and grand children.</li>
            <li> works as you think it should and my dentist says  it has made a difference</li>
            <li> I did not understand what a difference this system could make.  It has helped me a great deal.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> Just received my unit yesterday but have already flossed my teeth and also utilized the toothbrush this morning after an overnight charge. I am looking forward to a long and happy future with waterpik- WP-900</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, excellent packaging. The WP-900 was crazy easy to use right out of the box. All I needed? An outlet and lukewarm water. I was bummed out the brush had to charge, because I wanted to try out the whole package. I did try the Waterpik...  WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!! Can you say amazing little product? I have sensitive gums, I mean really really really sensitive gums, like I bleed after every flossing, literally every flossing. I hate flossing because besides bleeding gums after the floss, I have swollen painful gums. So whether I floss a lot or a little, bleeding sore hurt gums and mouth.  Enter the Waterpik. I put it in my mouth, rotated the head so it was comfortable, and turned it on, almost right away I turned up the pressure, and I get this sensation of water shooting between my teeth! Best part, after it was all over, almost no blood, and no visible bleeding!  I was so dang excited I fired up the pick head and did front and back. And no bleeding. Not only no bleeding, but no swollen hurt gums, and my mouth feels super clean.  I will have to do an update on the toothbrush later, but I think it is a shame, SHAME, i cN only give this little wonder 5 stars. Deserves way more. And you can&#x27;t beat the price either! And I have Amazon Prime, so the 2 day free shipping was great.  I was always hesitant and worried about killing my gums by using a Waterpik, no I&#x27;m never looking back! Don&#x27;t wonder, just buy, I am excited to use the other heads as well. Clean, easy to set up, easy to use, all around terrific buy. Only real foreseeable issue? Wife wants to use it, and when she does, I know she&#x27;ll love it and want to use it as much as me.  Update: 05/26/2015 So I have been using the pik and brush now for a bit, and I love it! This product is just fantastic. Mouth feels fisher and cleaner. Can&#x27;t say enough good about the WaterPik WP 900. I would buy another and not think twice about it. This would make a great gift as well.  On the toothbrush. I used the low settingas well as the high setting. I now use the high setting and both brush heads. Even on the high setting, this brush has less gum bleeding than when I use my regular brush. With my regular brush I push to hard and over brush. With the WaterPik brush, you just move it tooth yo toth. No force needed. And my mouth feels cleaner.  I highly recommend this product to anyone. I am nothing but satisfied with this whole purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing! After 3 days my gingivitis improved significantly. I hate flossing but will have no problem using this everyday. I love that the toothbrush pauses, indicating to me how long to brush each section.</li>
            <li> everything went great</li>
            <li> Item meets all my expectations</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and compact. Fits on my sink better then having separate items to use. Now to return the Water Flosser I purchased from another store.</li>
            <li> Our Sonicare died after over seven years of faithful service. I put off replacing it as I did not like the redesigned head and the \\&quot;enhanced\\&quot; pricing for replacement heads.    I had thought of Waterpik as strictly a water pick company, but by now, a lot of the old Sonicare patents have expired. The reviews on Amazon encouraged me to give the Waterpik a try. I am glad I did. I am happy to replace my manual flossing with it. The toothbrush works similarly to the Sonicare, minus the beep on the quadtimer.    The pieces snap on with a satisfying click. The unit is well-built. Mine came with multiple brushes. I am not Type-A enough to use the different picks, being satisfied with the general purpose pick. If multiple family members are considering use, you might want to consider buying extra picks.    My ONLY complaints about the unit, and they are minor, is that on the pick, you press the handle button to turn water off. If you should accidentally drop the pick or even loosen your grip, water can go everywhere if you are not careful. Also the waterpik device is a little fussy as to placement in its holder, and can fall out easily if you don&#x27;t do it right. Otherwise, this would be a solid five stars.</li>
            <li> Convenient to have both toothbrush and pik in one spot to grab. Makes me look forward to my dental routine!</li>
            <li> My first dental checkup after purchasing this device is coming soon and I&#x27;m enthusiastic that it will go well.  I love the water pik.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product. Easy to assemble and use. No more excuses for poor home care.</li>
            <li> Got this for husband who had Oral B brand previously-He liked this set up better and I got the Oral B for my bathroom</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended additional dental measures.  I love the toothbrush, as now my teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, and adjusting well to the &amp;#34;power washer&amp;#34; which wife uses to keep the pockets clean.  So far, all is good.  Have not been able to use manufacturer&#x27;s discounts online yet, but have not called about that either.</li>
            <li> Exellent poduct. Easy to use. Effective.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I buy a Waterpik flosser for my family because it is the best way to get kids (mine are teenagers, 15 and 17, a boy and a girl) to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say that I bought the Flosser/Toothbrush combo because it was $69.99 and the non-combo was just $10 cheaper here on Amazon. (This retails for $99.99 on waterpik.com, so I figured I was getting a good deal.) I have not used the toothbrush because my kids will fight over it. Basically everyone wants it so no one gets it. That being said, I&#x27;m saving it for travel so I have no idea whether or not the toothbrush is all that good or not. Keep in mind, there is a cheaper 2-in-1 $49.99 version out there with only 3 jet pulse options. This is not the cheaper model. Mine has 10 jet pulse options, which is why I clearly put the exact item description in my title...so there should be no confusion about which model I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first water flosser my family has ever used. But we generally like it. The dentist was right, it&#x27;s easy to use so the kids use it frequently. They&#x27;ve actually become so accustomed to the way it gets food out of their teeth, they use it after every meal now. That alone is worth the money, in my opinion. They&#x27;ve always been just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; at brushing their teeth, so they needed to floss more and this thing seems to keep them motivated to do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5-Stars because it does take up some counter-space and outlet space, which is a bit of a drag. Another thing I don&#x27;t like is the mess. I would like to blame it on having messy kids, but even when I use it, there is always a puddle of water on the counter that needs to be wiped clean. I guess that&#x27;s just what happens when you use a tool that squirts water. *Shrug*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said above, this unit has the ability to change the strength of the stream from soft to strong, with settings ranging from 1 to 10. We use it at a medium (6) setting because it shoots the food and plaque out from between the teeth and gums, without hurting. I found that when it&#x27;s at full strength, the water jet can feel a bit sharp and cause bleeding. That&#x27;s not a complaint, just a comment to give readers and idea of my experience with the pulse jet stream. Hopefully, for those wondering how strong it is, that helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came with 2 water tips, 2 brush tips and a rubbery pointed tip. The water container is super easy to refill because it lifts out of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve only had our unit for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to durability. If something goes wrong, I&#x27;ll post an update.and plaque out from between the teeth and gums, without hurting.

            <li> Waterpik button gets stuck after one week of use.. Brush is good, but product as a whole did not work as expected</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to setup and use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love it....</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with flossing using different types of floss; my gums are tightly packed, so there&#x27;s no way I can have a good experience using traditional techniques. I have been contemplating buying Waterpik, and I&#x27;m glad I have finally opted to order it. I appreciate having an array of different flossing heads and settings to regulate the water pressure. It might feel funny or even hurt in the beginning, but it gets better as long as you proceed using it. Waterpik might be a bit too noisy, but I have a bathroom fan going on most of the times, so it&#x27;s not that bad. Having an electric brush with a second head coming with the flosser makes it a great bundle. I love that the brush has a 2-minute timer, so there&#x27;s no excuse to brush less than we are told;).</li>
            <li> Happy with my waterpik/electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Have used WaterPik products for years as well as other brands when WaterPik was not available.  This by far is the best I have ever used.  sonic toothbrush is better than the other leading brand.  Great choice</li>
            <li> I love having tooth brush and water flosser all in one.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Waterpik always give you the help in my teeth health.&lt;br /&gt;Too convenient, I always have with this product. How is it? Let&#x27;s enjoy as.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is excellent and the water pik met all expectations</li>
            <li> good product amazon did a great job of sending it</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever, and if you hate flossing this is the ticket!!!</li>
            <li> very good product&lt;br /&gt;space for improvement: chargeable brush</li>
            <li> A very nice product and I am glad to bought it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was worried about water spraying all over every where. It was not a problem. Easy to use, quick and cleans better than&lt;br /&gt;a tooth brush and floss. Wish I had purchased it years ago.</li>
            <li> Fantastic clean!  Dentist says making a definite difference using Plax rinse, then sonic toothbrush then water flosser. Brush heads last longer than Braun ever did. Wish I had this as a teen - so got one for my teen to set her on a path to super healthy teeth and gums. She wasn&#x27;t very consistent with traditional floss, but loves using this 100%!</li>
            <li> The product until it was fully functional was great and effective. However in less than a year the toothbush stopped working, would no longer hold a charge. It has been impossible for me to find a way to contact Waterpik to report the problem or have it fixed before the warranty ended. So now I have an expensive dust collector sitting on my bathroom vanity. I rate their customer service poor and I will not purchase or recommed there products because of their customer service or better lack of.</li>
            <li> Because the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t charge after one month.</li>
            <li> Love it. Powerful and convient.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS WATERPIK AND THE SONIC TOOTHBRUSH. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH THOUGH BEWARE THE SONIC TOOTHBRUSH WILL REALLY VIBRATE THEM.</li>
            <li> When the Orthodontist recommended this particular waterpik for our teenager, we had to buy it. The distal jet they had inserted in her mouth kept getting food stuck inside (as did the braces) leaving her with really obnoxious breath and a very sore mouth. We&#x27;ve owned the waterpik complete care water flosser and sonic toothbrush for a while now and have no complaints. If anything, we have extreme praise. I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Consider how much you spend each year on the dentist/orthodontist and decide if it&#x27;s worth less visits and cleaner braces to go this route.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year now and I am still very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used waterpik for years.  I have many caps with some margins that need special attention.  The Waterpik used with a mild solution of mouthwash or, in my case, diluted peroxide, has saved my teeth.  This new combo unit is a space saver, and I like the sonic tooth brush.  My sonicare brush was slow, this one vibrates FAST, and seems like it will do a better job.  It comes with a travel case for the brush.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model that did not include the toothbrush. I like the convenience of having one less thing on my counter. It&#x27;s attractive but I have three concerns that equaled only four stars. The flosser is easily knocked off its holder which was not a problem with the earlier model. Also, the brush is too soft, for me; I&#x27;d like a &#x27;medium&#x27; brush and am trying to find one. Finally I haven&#x27;t been able to find ANY brush refills at Target or Walmart which I don&#x27;t like. Guess I&#x27;ll have to try online. Overall it&#x27;s a nice product and works well except for problems noted.</li>
            <li> Last August I got braces and it quickly became apparent that keeping my teeth clean would be a challenge.  This 2 in 1 gizmo solved the problem splendidly and economically. The toothbrush seems particularly effective.</li>
            <li> Really like the all in one flosser and toothbrush.  Cleans up my bathroom area.</li>
            <li> the best toothbrush and water pick ever.</li>
            <li> Does a super job thanks</li>
            <li> Works great. Teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> Been using Waterpik for years and this is the best. Compact size, toothbrush with Waterpik takes little room on sink counter. Covered section for storing all tooth brush heads &amp; picks is excellent sanitary design feature. Only thing missing is adapter plug to use when traveling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been the type of person who is regular with brushing and mouth-washing, but struggled to consistently floss. Attribute it to laziness, or whatever, but my teeth are very crowded and the space (or lack thereof) between my teeth made traditional flossing difficult.  Anyway, my old electric toothbrush kicked it recently, and when I went on amazon to research a replacement, I found this amazingly reviewed and very competitively-priced sonic toothbrush/water-flossing combo. Honestly, I&#x27;d never heard of a water flosser before, but the thought of pressure washing my mouth intrigued me. So given that, the reviews, and the price, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. After two weeks of using it, I would say the unit has exceeded my expectations in terms of mouth-cleanliness. I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dentist appointment to see if the expert inspection concludes what I feel: the combo of the sonic toothbrush and water flossing is much more thorough than anything I&#x27;ve done in the past. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the unit five stars is a couple of operational nit-picks, noted below.  Some pros: Water flossing WORKS. I am continually amazed (also amused) at the amount of stuck food that ends up in the sink after being blasted out from between my teeth. The ability to finely adjust pressure, as well as the different tip options, are also very nice, and I find the water tank has plenty of capacity. The sonic toothbrush seems to be doing a great job as well, certainly better than my old mechanically-rotating electric toothbrush. I really like that it has the two-minute timer function, and ESPECIALLY that it pauses very briefly every 30 seconds to alert you to move to the next quadrant of your mouth. The storage section for the tips is very handy, and the travel case for the toothbrush is great. The whole package seems well thought out, with attention to the details.  Some cons: The water pump for the flosser is pretty loud, especially when you turn the pressure up morethan halfway, which is every time for me. Definitely could wake up a light sleeper in an adjacent room, even with the door closed. As a couple other reviewers have mentioned, it would be nice if there were three speed settings for the toothbrush instead of two. The low setting is very tame, but the high setting is definitely aggressive, to the point where it could be a turn-off for some people. Where&#x27;s the Goldilocks speed? The handle of the toothbrush gets very slippery when toothpaste inevitably works its way out of your mouth and trickles down the handle. The rubbery grips on it don&#x27;t seem to function very well as... rubbery grips. Some contour to the body, rather than just a cylinder, would have helped here.  All in all though, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. Despite the few cons, it all functions well and I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s doing a great job keeping my teeth clean.  UPDATE 12/5/2016 Well, after 20ish months, the battery stopped holding a charge after a brush and a half without charging. Popped open the bottom of the toothbrush to learn that... the battery pack is soldered directly into the board!!! Go on amazon to find out that a replacement toothbrush is.... exactly the same cost as a whole new WP-900! That&#x27;s kind of crazy and very unfortunate. The battery pack doesn&#x27;t even look especially proprietary or complicated.. just looks like a couple of AAA batteries bundled together and then hard-wired to the board.  It&#x27;s maintained my satisfaction with level of cleanliness, but now I&#x27;m stuck with the decision of &amp;#34;do I REALLY want to spend another $65 to keep it alive?&amp;#34; At the end of the day, the answer to that question is a begrudging yes... but not till I can&#x27;t get through an entire brush on a charge.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  The unit is fantastic.  The toothbrush is amazing.  The flosser is a little noisy, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews,thewaterpik WP  /900 waterFlosser works great.I&#x27;m currently thinking of getting one for my wife,she likes the way mine clean s my teeth</li>
            <li> highly recommended. won&#x27;t be buying expensive sonicare again. great product and price.</li>
            <li> How did I ever think that my teeth and gums were clean until I started using this? My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t really travel-friendly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and I love it. The low setting does feel a little weak, but I have sensitive teeth so when my teeth are more sensitive I&#x27;m thankful the low setting is so gentle. All in all it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the first really nice sonic toothbrush and flosser  that I have ever owned. It is easy to use and cleans my teeth with out hurting my gums. the unit is attractive and easy to keep clean.The Waterpik WP- 900 is the best.</li>
            <li> This is a must for all people that strive for a Clean, Heathy Mouth Hygiene.  It comes with several items that really clean teeth and promote healthy gums.  You can purchase tooth brushes and rinse wands for ALL members of your family.&lt;br /&gt;Emily</li>
            <li> Use it every day great product</li>
            <li> I got this set at a great price. It keeps my teeth healthy and clean. It&#x27;s small enough so that it doesn&#x27;t get in the way in my bathroom. What more can I say? Why pay double to triple the price for similar items when this gets the job done?</li>
            <li> the water pik not working and the tooth brush not even charging</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful but the toothbrush just vibrates and doesn&#x27;t really move, like circular motion or up and down.  I don&#x27;t recommend for morning usage if employed, unless you&#x27;re willing to wake up either an hour or half hour earlier to brush your teeth.  I am going to try other products because of the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t move.  The flosser portion is definitely a must have product that&#x27;s why I bought it was for the flosser but once I&#x27;ve seen the complete oral care of course I am going to invest. Also I suggest you&#x27;re nude because you&#x27;re going to have a sprinkle session on your hands.  You are definitely at the dentist office with this product.  It makes you want to brush your teeth more thoroughly.  I also recommend that you don&#x27;t use your bathroom outlet if connect to your light switch your toothbrush won&#x27;t be charging once the light is off.  I recommend the flosser but I don&#x27;t recommend the toothbrush.  I want waterpik to improve the motion of the toothbrush.  Also, the toothbrush has strong vibration and it felt like I was being shocked until I got use to it.  It just needs improvement but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> Update: The toothbrush died and cannot be replaced nor can it&#x27;s batteries.  I will not purchase another entire unit just to replace the failed toothbrush.  This toothbrush stopped recharging in August 2016 exactly 15 months after I purchased it.  My next toothbrush will be one that has replaceable batteries that do not depend on recharging.  Too bad Waterpik does not sell a stand-alone replacement toothbrush instead of just the heads.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share this and we both  love it. It came with 2 tooth brush heads also perfect for us.Great product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This has made such a difference in my teeth! It&#x27;s very comfortable to use, even on the lowest setting. The only setback is that I have to fill the tank after each use, but it lasts the whole time I use it. The fact that it comes with an electric toothbrush makes it even more of a good buy, and it&#x27;s the same kind of toothbrush that I previously bought for $110; this one lets you know when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist  for a more thorough flossing/cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had such success with my waterpik and toothbrush after getting braces, that my step daughter begs me to allow her to waterpik her teeth.  I had to buy her one of her own.  Definetely well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is by far a great Waterpik and the toothbrush is every bit as good as sonic is for cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Great Valentine&#x27;s present for my honey! He loves it! I&#x27;ve had one for a few years and it worked great! Fells great after every use. :)</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m just updating a previous post?  I&#x27;ve had it 9 months.  Still love it.  It&#x27;s messy and you learn to work with it.  Rinse the toothbrush well after each use, and dump the water out of the tank each use.  I put it upside down on a paper towel.  If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m allowed to take to the nursing home when that day comes... This will be it.</li>
            <li> I JUST PURSED THIS PRODUCT AND EVERY SINCE I STARTED USING IT MY MOUTH ALWAYS FEELS FRESH CLEAN. YOU JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO THE WATER-PIC SO YOU DON&#x27;T GET WATER ALL OVER YOUR BATHROOM MIRROR OTHER THEN THAT I&#x27;M 100% HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED IT. IT&#x27;S WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush and water flosser are amazing! My teeth and gums have never felt better in my life. This product is definitely worth the investment. My fiancé is sick of me talking about how much I love this...because hello, it&#x27;s a toothbrush. I had a Sonicare before and this is way better. Make sure you press the water flosser button down before you turn it on, it will spray everywhere! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a water pik. I must say that I do like the way it &amp;#34;flosses&amp;#34; much better than actually using dental floss. I had a recent bridge placed, and this method is much better than using floss under it! The toothbrush is also great.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t attest to how well this works as a replacement for flossing. but i do find myself using it every day, twice a day. something can never remember to do with regular floss.</li>
            <li> Great product cleans mouth fully but gently</li>
            <li> I feel like I have just left the dentist&#x27;s office every morning and night! Love it.</li>
            <li> love my Waterpik. this is my 2nd one, the 1st one lasted about 5 years, this is my replacement. What I like best is the all in one feature and small footprint on my counter top</li>
            <li> This product works great for &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; and brushing with braces. It has 5 different changeable flosser tips and 2 toothbrush tips. My only complaint is when you are flossing (where the water shoots out), even at the lowest setting, I have to keep my head down to prevent splashing from the floss. While I can feel what/where I&#x27;m flossing, I prefer to be able to see my teeth and gums during it--to ensure I don&#x27;t miss anything.  It&#x27;s a great tool &amp; the tips/brushes are soft, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Works good. Not sturdy. Flimsy. I would prefer separate rather then combo. Good for home use . Need to buy something else for travel.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after the first use!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my partner who is fighting gum issues in one section of her mouth. Her dental hygienist has suggested multiple times that she upgrade to a sonic toothbrush, but they always seemed so expensive. I noticed this Waterpik combo while browsing on Amazon and made a (very rare) impulse buy: I figured she&#x27;d be delighted with the gift, especially since it was set to arrive a few weeks before her next cleaning. I made her open the box when it arrived and received only an &amp;#34;Oh, OK...&amp;#34; Ummm, not what I was expecting! She seemed hesitant to try the water flosser so I tested it out myself. As it turns out it&#x27;s OK she wasn&#x27;t thrilled because I have now fallen in love with brushing my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been several weeks since the Waterpik arrived and we&#x27;ve been able to share the unit easily by swapping out attachments. As noted, the toothbrush arrives with two different sized heads, but they&#x27;re both standard toothbrush shape and the smaller will work fine for an adult. So far I&#x27;ve only tested a single water flosser attachment so I can&#x27;t comment on the different types, but the sensation is so refreshing and clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I was told to leave my mouth slightly open over the sink to let the used water pour out as the flosser shoots fresh water in. I assumed I was going to end up covered in my own drool, but the process is perfectly neat and tidy. Give it a try and you&#x27;ll immediately have a sense of when you need to let water flow out of your mouth. No biggie.</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and sonic toothbrush, it is nice to have both items in one compact appliance. Shipper was fast and efficient would highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> Its a useful!! For good teeth !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  I love that you get a carrying case and you can take the brush on vacation. I&#x27;d say the battery will last a week ish at least.</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use and dos a great job.</li>
            <li> We have really enjoyed our waterpik.  No problems so far.</li>
            <li> I love this Waterpik! I have a very tough time flossing, as I have sensitive gums. However, I don&#x27;t worry about that ever since I received this water flosser!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has several different tips depending on what needs to be flossed (although I am lucky I just need to use the standard tip). It allows my boyfriend to also use the water flosser for his dental issues. It&#x27;s also great that it has different levels of water pressure. I have slowly been building up to stronger pressure.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is awesome! The battery lasts forever, it came with a travel case, and two different brush heads. The timer settings makes sure I am very thorough with each quadrant of my mouth. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer and would recommend this to every person I know!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61, and many times over the years, my dentist has recommended a &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; as I have some gum recision.  For whatever reason, last time I better understood an issue with a gap between the bottoms of two teeth and I thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl.  Also, my dentist mentioned a &amp;#34;water flosser&amp;#34; and I think I thought this might be more pleasant than flossing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this unit by mistake.  I was looking at a few different ones and I think I clicked on the wrong one.  This was more expensive (but not much more expensive) because it also included the electric toothbrush.  Since it was only an extra $10, if I recall correctly, I decided not to cancel the order and just see what happened when it got here.  I already had a Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrush that I never used, but what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I got this.  First of all, the toothbrush is a much slimmer profile and is comfortable and I like using it.  I especially like the fact that it has two different speeds, and sometimes I use the lower speed, other times the higher speed.  This is working out well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the water flosser -- I wish I had gotten this years ago.  It works extremely well, and leaves my mouth feeling much better than it does after a regular use of dental floss.  I think it is more effective at removing particles, while at the same time being more gentle on my gums.  It is also easier, in general, and in particular it is easier on my hands than wrapping that floss around my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a pleasure, that I am using it without fail every night (I probably used regular floss about five days/week).  I can&#x27;t get over, especially, how much cleaner my mouth feels after I&#x27;ve used the water flosser.</li>
            <li> Just ok, not crazy about the toothbrush, next time I&#x27;d purchase each separately and go with oral b.  Didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I am in absolute love! Works awesome and good quality! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!!! Works great and toothbrush js awesome! Easy set up and instructions are easy to follow</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and more. Very solid and quality product that I plan on using for years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this water pik for my daughter who is about to get braces. We all get our own color coded brushes and tops! It works gets and keeps her appliance clean :)  Update: I just got back from the dentist and my hygienist said I had no plaque. She kept asking how I did it and I said using this product! She actually said &amp;#34;your at home care has done a 360, keep up the good work!&amp;#34; Very happy!!! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> My teeth feel just out of the dental office clean everyday,  I love it!</li>
            <li> No complaints. This was easy to set up and start using. It does take a little while to get used to using the water flosser if you haven&#x27;t used one before, and honestly, it&#x27;s easy to get the whole bathroom wet with this thing. The instructions say to \\&quot;just let the water flow freely out of your mouth,\\&quot; but when I try that, some water tends to stream down the handle and onto my hand and then down my arm and often down my leg. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right. In any case, it will get your teeth and gums clean and the brush is excellent, too. The travel case is nice and the battery will last a coupe of weeks. Great for all but the longest trips away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to add that now that I&#x27;ve had this a while, I find it almost indispensable. I have noticed now that beyond the routine morning/night use, I find myself constantly using this for a quick but thorough rinse after meals, snacks or coffee. There&#x27;s no better way for getting pieces of a salad, or nuts or other little items that get easily wedged in your mouth. Just a great, quick cleaning feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve gotten better about not spraying the whole bathroom, You do have a pause button on the handle, but you need to press it firmly to suppress the water flow, otherwise, it will leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note, I&#x27;ve seen some reviews have mentioned that the reservoir runs out too quickly. I have not noticed that issue at all, for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product and I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes are very weak.  Sonicare I owned prior to this had firmer bristles and felt like it worked better.</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth much cleaner than plain toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> Excellent choices of water pik heads, that fit better than an older model I through out. The water container is a nice size for someone who is vegetarian, and eats a lot of seeds, nuts, and greens. I will use this to travel as I like its compact And organized storage design.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun unit like this one, used by two adults, for at least ten years without any service needed.  When it needed replacement, Braun no longer made that product.  I bought this  Waterpik unit, and within a year it needed replacement parts twice.  The first incident was failure of the valve controlling the water from the reservoir.  The second was that the control button on the handle of the water flosser kept sticking, preventing water flow.  Customer Service was absolutely great, and they replaced both parts within a few days with the 2-year warranty.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great, in my opinion it works just as well as the sonicare or oral b brand.  The water flosser is fantastic, I have braces so it&#x27;s a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try this product for a cleaner mouth. I bought two, one for me and one for my husband. We love the different heads that come with the waterflosser and the especially the fact that we don&#x27;t have to use wax floss!! The tooth brush is hard to understand at first, mainly because it has a 2min timer and shuts off. Read the instructions on how to properly brush teeth with tooth brush before use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  Toothbrush works  awesome and the water flosser is perfect for cleaning between teeth and gums.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My son recently got braces. The orthodontist recommended using something like this over flossing. I ordered it for my son&#x27;s 14th birthday. He absolutely loves it. A little messy at first but he is faithfully using it at night and before school. He also, loves the toothbrush. He says he can feel the difference over his other battery operated toothbrush. The combo is a hit and I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> This product looks good. Tested and the power of the jet is good and also the speed of the brush. Anteriorly had a minor hand the same mark that lasted very little, less than 6 months. I did not give 5 stars because it is still in testing.</li>
            <li> The water pick dose a good job as I expected.  I would not buy again with the sonic brush as it does not do a good job of cleaning my teeth, so I use my Philips Soniccare brush to brush with.  The water pick sonic brush was a wast of money.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, once in the morning and once after dinner. The toothbrush is heavy duty with a lot of vibration and it gets your teeth clean. The waterpik is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. It takes a little trial and error until you figure out how to keep the water from splattering out of your mouth. The tank runs through the water in about 30 seconds, which is more than enough time to go between all of your teeth and go back and hit any areas you think may need a little extra cleaning. My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this vs using a regular toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li> first time buying water flosser. So according to my new experience, I really liked the way water clean my teeth, and I loved the brush. it has two speed, the thing that i missed with my Philips brush . So far So good</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoy the product.  Leaves mouth feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con I have for item is I wish the plug was longer than it is.</li>
            <li> This leave my mouth feeling sparkly clean! I just had a large amount of perio maintenance done within the past months and this is a godsend!</li>
            <li> more fun than flossing!</li>
            <li> This order came fast. Simple directions. Love the 2 levels of power on the toothbrush. Also all the extra nossles for the water pik, NY only concern is why does the water just come out when you turn on the water pik. THE ONLY Way To Stop It Is TO Push THE Button . I found it odd it is backwards as usually you push the button to apply or use something then let go of it to stop. So that is my only issue with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is big and holds a good amount of water. It is bulky but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> Really can tell a difference in how my mouth feels. I like the toothbrush / water flosser combination. Exactly as hoped.</li>
            <li> Dentist office recommended that I purchase this..  I absolutely love it.  After using this, I feel like I just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Excellent results. My hygienist was impressed.</li>
            <li> Product works great, flosser makes a splash,a little loud.  leave you mouth open and near the sink.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is great, comes with everything you need (two different sized brush heads, five closer heads) and is really easy to use. My mouth feels really clean after each use and the quadrant timer on the toothbrush is great. Everything is easy to clean as well. Overall very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product, it is helping me with my dental hygiene. Much easier than dental floss and much more effective in overall cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Better than Sonicare. Vibrates 2x more. Wouldn&#x27;t leave home with out it.</li>
            <li> Love the complete system.</li>
            <li> It works fine. My fault. Thanks</li>
            <li> so nice to have both items in oe unit ... saves space...</li>
            <li> I love my water pik!!!!  My dentist  will be happy, too.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. A little loud though.... But it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone, specially those who have braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my braces on and rushed order this just so I could avoid having to floss. I was amazed at how clean my mouth felt! I will continue using this even after my braces come off. I has truly become a holy grail product for me.</li>
            <li> Works great for cleaning teeth and gums. I&#x27;d had electric toothbrushes, but never the water flosser spray - the spray is a super addition. From a jaw shattered in a mountain climbing accident, I have several bridges. The spray does an excellent job of cleaning the area between the bridges and gums. My teeth and gums feel much better after using. Another nice feature is the two-speed toothbrush - the higher speed setting seems to help in areas that occasionally have a higher buildup of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No, I did not purchase this myself. It was an early birthday present from my Mom, 6 month early. I am so impressed with this product, I just had to write a review, my first. I have been using this waterpik for 5 days now. I love it, my teeth and entire mouth feels clean, clean, clean. I just spent 800.00 for a Deep Cleaning at the dentist, and I have a couple of deep pockets. I am concerned, no one wants to lose their teeth, right. A patient overheard my concerns, and told me to get a Waterpik. She said that is all I will need, she loves using hers and has for years. So I checked them out on Amazon, long story short, I got one. As I said it is a wonderful product and I wish I had gotten one sooner. It really does an excellent job I use it with the pocketpik attachment  It beats flossing the old way 100%. I have  follow a up in 3 months, and I am looking forward to hearing the results. I would recommend this to product anyone. It is easy to use and takes just a few minutes and your done. I also love the sonic toothbrush, that came with it, 2 minutes go by quick. My mouth has never been happier.  PS my Mom purchased from Amazon.  Of course. they had the best price with Prime 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 68 year old surgeon and have had many water type flossers over the years. Most were quite good but none as good as this. Others had less power and were less effective in removing/ preventing plaque. On my last scheduled 6 month cleaning I was told that there was nothing for the hygienist to do and I should go to once a year. Also on other models I owned, the tubing eventually split and could not be repaired meaning I needed to buy a replacement. I now have 2 of these ( one for my wife so we don&#x27;t have to share) and they are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long Waterpik has been around but I have been using one since 1972.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably still be using my first one but the hose severed into when it vibrated buy a steak knife I had on the kitchen counter.  I usually keep it in the bathroom but it was during a remodel.&lt;br /&gt;I have a second piece of property so I am buying this all in one electric toothbrush and Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;in no way does this replace flossing&lt;br /&gt;but it is a quick and easy way to remove all those little pieces of spinach or not or whatever straight after meals.&lt;br /&gt;start with a lower pressure and then work up go ahead and aim it at an angle right into the gum line because this gentle massage will keep the blood flowing and keep it healthy so you will never ever have gingivitis.</li>
            <li> Only all in one unit I can find.  The wireless charging of the toothbrush is Very cool.  The reservoir for the water pik is a little smaller than I&#x27;d like.  it comes with several attachments so you can figure out what you like.  Now when I go to the dentist I won&#x27;t get lectured for not flossing ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside the plastic construction seems a bit cheap.  I cannot imagine the little on/or and speed knobs holding up as they seem flimsy.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better than any electric toothbrush I have owned. Love the water pik also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a dentist fresh clean every time I use this tooth brush and water pick! Happy clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Glad I  bought this product with both the pick and brush. My dentist recommend I buy a water pick for bridge work that&#x27;s hard to reach with floss. Very good idea...love all the features.  Thoughtful design.</li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; orthodontist gives these away to all his new ortho patients. They each have one and they are GREAT with braces!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this because my long time electronic toothbrush finally died and saw this combo which seemed like a good idea.  Unbelievable how much junk comes out after brushing when you use the Water Flosser part.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a little noisy. Hard to use in the early morning hours, it rattles a little loud (brrrrrrrrrrr). We (family) have different work schedules.It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My teeth and mouth  feel better after 3 weeks of use. Anyway hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Works great.  It has been great for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> It is perfect Water Flosser and Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Work Great. Good Price.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. I gave this to my husband for Christmas last year and my son stole it after graduation&lt;br /&gt;when he moved out!  Needless to say, I got one for my son this year for Christmas. They both love how they work and how clean their teeth feel. Perfect for every day use!</li>
            <li> OMG, I am so glad I made this investment. My teeth look and feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Durable, effective, pleasant. Love it.</li>
            <li> great product! nice water pressure, my teeth never felt any cleaner!</li>
            <li> my father presents. good.</li>
            <li> It does a great job with both tools. The flosser has 10 easy to set power levels. The tootbrush has two speeds.  The best part of it less space an just one plug.  My mouth has never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do the reviews, but I had to on this one.  The water pick system works very well however the toothbrush failed to charge after a few weeks of use.  No matter what I do the brush won&#x27;t light up to take a charge, not sure if its the charging system or the brush that is dead.  Was an awesome toothbrush while it worked.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Best one made.</li>
            <li> Works great. I like the that it&#x27;s compartmentalized. The various floss options are great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a great deal.</li>
            <li> After I accidentally left my expensive Phillips Sonicare toothbrush at a relative&#x27;s house, the base was stolen in the mail (I know, some things are beyond belief, they actually left me with the head). I started looking for another one, but didn&#x27;t want to fork out that sum of money again. I took a chance on this one after reading the reviews, and am glad I did. The toothbrush itself has two speeds, low and high. While some reviewers said the high was too high, I found it to be perfect- I like that much speed because I feel like I am getting a better cleaning. On the low speed, I would say the power equates to what your normal electric toothbrush would be. The water pick itself is awesome. I thought that it might be messy, but after getting the hang of it (which doesn&#x27;t take long), it really isn&#x27;t. Most of the time I use it on full speed. I have always had a lot of dental issues, but my last cleaning at the dentist went great, even though I was past due- and I am sure it was because of the water pick. The hygienist commented about how little plaque I had on my teeth. If you have gum problems, then you really need to get this. My gums used to be sensitive and bleed quite a bit, but voila- no more. Your gum health will drastically improve, and quickly. You can get to places you can&#x27;t with a normal toothbrush and very effectively, and in 99% of cases, it can even replace flossing. It is very easy to use- all you have to do is fill up the canister with water and turn it on. The pick also has a pause button which is nice and keeps things from getting messy. I really don&#x27;t think you will find a better toothbrush for the deal- especially considering all it comes with. There are multiple heads for the pick, though I typically just stick with one I like. The only negative I can think of is that it is noisy when in use. If you are trying not to wake up your partner, you might want to wait until later for the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Get to those hard to reach spots with the water pick.&lt;br /&gt;Drastically improves gum health.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Great power on the water pick and toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Tons of heads for the water pick.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit noisy.water pick.&lt;br /&gt;Drastically improves gum health.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Great power on the water pick and toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Tons of heads for the water pick.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit noisy.</li>
            <li> Works great and dislodges any tiny particles left in teeth after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> great product ! my husband was skeptical, now he is the one who uses it every day!  the tooth brush has 2 speeds the fastest is awesome, clean everything.. The flost water is great too, it doesn&#x27;t leave anything between your teeth and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gum. I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I gave this to my fiancé for Christmas and he loves it. His dentist even commented about his healthy oral care during his February visit.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long, but it sure works. The sonic toothbrush got my teeth cleaner than they have been in a long time. Water pic works very well. Now for the test of time.</li>
            <li> My teeth jump up for joy when I use this product,  it is amazing.  I notice that using this in conjunction with salt water has eliminated my bad breath.  It is small that you are able to travel with.  The best prevention care starts at home.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicate by Phillip for 2 years.  Love it.  My dentist recommended the water pik because i was having a problem with inflammation of my gums in one area.  The water pik took care of problem.  After about 2-3 weeks all issues were resolved.  I love this thing.  This one has a sonic toothbrush as part of the set.  After about 2 weeks my tooth brush broke.  I think he spring inside snapped.  I called the company and they express mailed me a new one so that was good.  But, now that i have been using the new toothbrush for about a month i am starting to notice it makes a bit of a different sound, like something is starting to come loose.  I never had these problems with the Philips toothbrush. I would say buy the water pik part, its great, but get the sonic toothbrush through philips or a different company.</li>
            <li> Water water everywhere is right... But that&#x27;s not all of it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with 6+ heads for the water flosser. Easy to switch out. Holds 20oz of water, which isn&#x27;t much when you &#x27;prime&#x27; the unit, but refill after that and 20oz lasts a decent while. I&#x27;d say 3-4 flossings. The tooth brush charges in the stand attached to the base. All good things, but that&#x27;s where it winds down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 10 pressure settings for the water pick. The button on the wand allows you to stop water flow while you are holding it down. With that in mind, unless you hold the button down BEFORE AND AS you turn it on...water everywhere. After figuring out the button I wanted to see the thing in action! I turned it down to the lowest setting (as directions state). Tested the pressure on my hand, nice a soft. Gentle pulsing... on high it even blasts away old toothpaste left on the sink from six inches away. So leaning into the mirror, I aimed the head every so precisely, released the button on the wand...and....WATER PARK IN THE BATHROOM!  My mirror went from just being cleaned from chores an hour before my package arrived to looking like the kids just got done filling water balloons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, I know, close your d*mn mouth and use the thing blindly, right? Don&#x27;t get to see it work, but heck; no more mess! That SUCKS in my opinion. Not my style. I am trying to figure a way to maybe use it in the shower if I can figure out how not to electrocute myself trying to improve my hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps:) Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Very nice product , this is the best toothbrush ever!!!!!!!!!!!  You have to have one at home !!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Read a number of reviews prior to purchasing this item; positive &amp; problematic. Yes, it did take aa couple ooooof tries to use the water pic&lt;br /&gt;without the water running down my chin. Almost comical &amp; once I got the hang of it, I actually enjoy flossing more &amp; find myself flossing&lt;br /&gt;more often. I also find the water pic does a much better job than &#x27;convential&#x27; flossing. Adding a bit of flavored mouthwash also adds a sense of&lt;br /&gt;refreshment to my mouth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  The combination of the toothbrush and water pik are great together.  My dentist had recommended this product so I&#x27;ll have to thank her.</li>
            <li> went to dentist. wife was told she needed a sonic toothbrush. I was told I needed a water flosser. Both technician and dentist recommended waterpik. this unit meets both needs. it is pretty well constructed and sensibly designed. storage space for brushes and flosser, long cord but excess can be stored in the base. simple to operate. Only one thing to be careful of. If flosser head is not inserted fully into the handle before turning it on, water squirts all over and runs down your arm. Not a problem for a normal person setting it up for themselves. But, if you have a wife with a perverse sense of humour who under the guise of being helpful sets up your toothbrush, puts toothpaste on it, but then doesn&#x27;t insert the flosser completely, watch out. I was a sceptic about this kind of thing, but my gums are healthier, my teeth whiter and my mouth feels really refreshed when done using it.</li>
            <li> Very good..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well.</li>
            <li> so far so good. one caution. unit may have to be charged for an hour or so. This is explained in the instruction booklet. Real test is next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> the water flow is not really as strong as i personally expected, and the sound of device is large but acceptable</li>
            <li> My teeth are crowded/tight so flossing isn&#x27;t easy and as a result I do it far less than I should.  For the past few years I&#x27;ve been using the spinbrush that you can pick up for $10 nearly anywhere.  It worked okay with a fresh set of batteries but as time went on they seemed to drain faster requiring frequent changes.  Therefore, I decided to get a rechargeable system and at first was just looking at a sonic brush but then noticed this combo.  Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is about the same level of cleaning power at low as what I was doing but at high it&#x27;s ridiculously powered.  Can&#x27;t imagine someone wanting something more powerful than this offers.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The water flosser is plenty powerful and I didn&#x27;t know at first if what I was feeling was actually doing anything.  So I aimed it at my dirty sink in need of cleaning and sure enough it removed stuff running water wouldn&#x27;t from one foot away.  No doubt up close it does better.  Next after a week of using the unit I flossed my teeth to see how much it was removing.  There was at most 1/10th of what I would normally find.  Thus it works, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1.  High power takes some getting used to, perhaps a medium setting for the next model.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is messy but the solution just requires some thinking.  Use the water flosser before a shower, etc.  Don&#x27;t be smart guy and put a suit on then complain you have stuff all over you.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  It&#x27;s a great set up that takes up just as much counter space as it looks like in the picture.  For those that don&#x27;t floss as often as they should this may be even better.  It&#x27;s a vast improvement over my previous efforts with less effort.  Just fill with water and blast away.  :)  At this price very happy.  Almost paid twice this cost for a sonicare toothbrush alone.  Now I have one that provides just as powerful a clean and a waterpik.  Score!</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have found that Waterpik makes the best water flosser.  I&#x27;ve used them for years.  I love the timer effect on the toothbrush.  2 minutes and your are done.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that water flossers can sometimes exacerbate gum issues, so be careful about your technique and style. I liked the toothbrush ok, but after I got rid of this thing and bought one from the industry leader it was night and day. The SC brush is lightyears better.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I&#x27;m glad I chose the brush as well as the flosser in one unit. My husband has neuropathy in his hands and was not really getting his teeth cleaned properly with a traditional tooth brush. We are realizing the benefits of thorough dental cleaning, especially now that we are getting older. The flosser also includes a special attachment for those who have dental bridges, so I can use the unit confidently.</li>
            <li> I shoulda listen to my hygienist years ago about this.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I am so happy my dentist and hygienist recommend it.  The combination of the sonic toothbrush and water flosser makes my teeth feel so clean!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a brighter smile.  It takes up some room on the counter but it looks nice still and I like that it holds and charges the toothbrush.  I also like that there is a storage compartment for the attachments.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love it. Slightly less powerful than my original 1999 waterpik</li>
            <li> Helps with teeth health and hopefully will satisfy my dental technician when I next go for a cleaning</li>
            <li> I had to return this machine the same week I received it. It was not working (at all) as expected. I tried all types of adjustments, to no avail. Thankfully, I bought it from Amazon, which made it very easy to return.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to care for my bridge.  It has helped a lot and is easy to use. My gums around my bridge are no longer swollen.  Yay!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily. I feel like I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job at a reasonable price. My only complaint is a very minor one. The waterpik is noisy.</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference in the condition of  my gums and teeth after only a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you like pain.  And if you like pain, then you need one of these!  In all seriousness, this is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has two settings, but the high setting is way too powerful for me; the lower setting is just right.  I also like that it pulses every 30 seconds so you know when to move the next quadrant of your mouth.  I think it also uses inductive charging, as there are also no charging pins visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik is great; it got stuff out from between my teeth even after I used regular floss picks.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next visit to  see my dentist notices anything.  Using it on the highest setting can be a little painful, but if that&#x27;s your kinda thing, then crank it up to 10.  However, on 4-5 is quite tolerable.  Also, running it on the 10 setting is a little noisy, but is to be expected for a pump.  On 4-5, it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected. The Two speed tooth brush is as good as my SonicCare that I keep in the downstairs half Bath. Very Pleased</li>
            <li> i bought this upon recommendation from my dentist. I am very happy with the mechanics of this product. I have had no problems and my gums feel healthier because of it!!</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> The dentist kept saying I needed to floss.  I literally hate to do it.  So, I bought this both for the tooth brush and for the Waterpik.  I can&#x27;t say how effective the waterpic is.  It does remove particles from between the teeth.  How well it stimulates the gum and cuts plack, I can&#x27;t say.  Maybe after my  next dentist visit, I&#x27;ll know.  It is easy to use and I think it might be working</li>
            <li> Could not be without it.  Especially great for my two bridges.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this appliance.  Replacing item used for many years.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten this product 20 years ago!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it is still running great! I love the quality of the product as well as the clean feel it gives my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped with my flossing routine in making it quicker and easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts for awhile so I don&#x27;t need to charge it that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> I love both the water pic and the toothbrush.  This is the first time I purchased the Waterpic brand and I am very happy that I did.  It came with several different accessories so that I could try the different ones out and then order the replacements that worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> My dentist was upset because I hate flossing my teeth and don&#x27;t do it as often as I should.  This unit is so easy to use that I now do it every day.  Wayyyy easier than fumbling and sawing away with nasty lengths of sharp ribbon.  The electric toothbrush was a nice extra.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, but this makes it easy.  The food particles don&#x27;t stand a chance; I can see them on the bottom of the sink.  This takes a little practice to not make a mess.  Also the tank does empty a little quick but there&#x27;s enough time to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my water pik  Also with Amazon merchandise. I look forward to a long relationship. I can find my needs with out leaving home.  Thank you. Barbara</li>
            <li> Great combo for my son who just got braces.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at this product.</li>
            <li> It is what I needed and perfect for keeping me teeth clean while wearing braces.  If you hate going to the dentist you need a Waterpik!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist suggested this and at the age of 75 I decided &amp;#34;Why Not?&amp;#34;  It has improved my dental habits quite a lot and now I think that I can probably avoid the gum procedure that I  was dreading.</li>
            <li> I love it. I took awhile to get used to. It&#x27;s somewhat messy to use, but it definitely does the job. I find that the waterpik is much nicer with warm water and you have to practically put your head in the sink. I am able to shoot my teeth from both sides. The proof will be in my next visit to the dentist, but I think that that will be a slam dunk. Sonic toothbrush works well too.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. The water flosser makes a lot of noise, and the whole thing is plastic. Admittedly that gives it a slightly cheap feel. Then again, look at the price. But boy does it work! Love that clean feeling after a sonic brushing and water flossing.</li>
            <li> A complete dental hygiene unit. It has it all.</li>
            <li> This is quite good. Just that I need to refill the water reservoir ever 30 seconds. It works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really, really liked this toothbrush as it cleaned so well. I purchased this April 11th, and as of May 30th, the battery will no longer hold a charge for anything longer than a 20 second brush. Unbelievable. I would have contacted the seller and tried having this issue address, but the option isn&#x27;t available. For the price of the brush, and the assumption of quality, a battery life should last longer than two months.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it. My teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard use the word \\&quot;love\\&quot; when referring to such a product but after having it a week I can say I am very happy with it.  After years of neglect (hate going to the dentist and hate flossing more!) of just brush 2 times I day, I really need to step up my gum and tooth regime.  After many decades I am not about to turn over a new leaf and start flossing daily.    While this product is a bit loud and messy it does a great job. The water pick does a great job of getting between the teeth and around the toothline  of the gums.  I use at least once a day and sometimes put mouthwash in it.    The Sonic toothbrush is awesome, I truly use the 30 second signal of each quadrant of my mouth. I can feel the difference it does on the my teeth and gums.    I only wish I had gotten this earlier.  I guess it kind of pricey but it really delivers.  Compared to dentures or partial plates,  I am thinking $80 is getting off kind of cheap!    09/15/2014: Update    Just wanted to update the review now that I have had this product for Six months.  I am still using it virtually every night. I have never been able to sustain such a long period of flossing. I even feel guilty on those odd nights I just brush and don&#x27;t use the water pik.    Quality wise I have had No issues with either the Water Pik or Tootbrush.    The most impressive outcome is that a return visit to the dentist this summer showed that my gum overall health has improved tremendously.  The \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; in my gums have literally been cut in half. 6 MMs have become 3 mms, 4 have become 2mm.  My Dental Hygenist could not have been more happy.    I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Before i bought this, i went for a cleaning.  Hygienist checked for gum pockets with millimeter tool and i ranged from three to six mm gaps (which is pretty bad  indicating beginning gum disease).  My gums were also bleeding pretty bad.  I spent a couple hundred $ on a deep (and painful) cleaning and then bought this machine that week.  I have been using it (both waterpik and sonic brush) once a day ever since with only a couple of gaps.  Went to the dentist again yesterday.  Gum Pockets had decreased down to mostly 1-3 with the six&#x27;s down to mostly fours (a couple of fives).  The same hygienist as before concluded that a normal cleaning was appropriate this time.  So, in one (the next) visit to the dentist, i saved the money spent on this machine.  Pretty good return on investment.  (Hygienist did say that i should floss more... That this machine is not a full substitute.). Hope that helps.  UPDATE: the machine (sonic brush) had a problem on high speed while still under warranty.  I called Waterpik and without any problems they are completely taking care of me (and it) WAY beyond my expectations.  Outstanding customer service from Waterpik.  I would buy from them again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;IT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE MUCH MORE USEFUL BY HAVING WARMING WATER IF NEEDED AS IN WINTER&lt;br /&gt;WOULD NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Another case of a product that does not meet the promise. I&#x27;m going back to my sonicare toothbrush and regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;Each time I use the waterpik, I feel like I still need to floss. Not at all happy with this not so cheap mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Overall....totally disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is helping me to improve my dental health! It makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush and a water pik for at-home care of gum problems.  Like most people, I have limited counter space and only a 2-plug outlet near the bathroom sink so this combination unit seemed ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of faithful use, all my numbers showed a 2 to 6 point improvement (if you have gum disease, you know that&#x27;s major).  Five minutes a day with this toothbrush and flosser to reduce the frequency of 90 minute professional deep cleanings is a good trade.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, water tank is a little bit small though. I will recommend friend to buy one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the Waterpik. Not very strong at all. But was surprisedly pleased by the sonacare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these items, one for each member of my family.  They work wonderfully with one exception:  Within 6 weeks  to 2 month the water reservoir leaks.  We use a cup to fill it now and they works fine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Ive been needing it for awhile and was finally able to get it!! so happy with it.</li>
            <li> We have had this for approximately six months and are finding it very convenient and dependable. I have Invisaligners which require a lot of brushing and flossing and the Waterpik complete makes the process much less tedious.</li>
            <li> Works great, exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  The water pump is noisier than an older one that I also have that is single unit versus one that comes with the Sonic Brush, but it all works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of electronic toothbrushes in the past, and I can comfortably say that this is the finest I&#x27;ve used.  The motion of the brush took a little getting used to (at first I felt like I was being electrocuted when I turned on the brush), as it&#x27;s not a conventional motor that drives the brush...I&#x27;m no rocket scientist, but I believe it uses sonic waves to power the motion of the brush against the teeth.  Well, however it does it, this brush does an exceptional job cleaning my teeth...both in front and the hard to reach teeth no one ever sees but the dentist in the back of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges very quickly...and a full brushing of my teeth leaves all three of the green lights still illuminated.  The brush battery has lasted over a long weekend (4 full days) without a recharge, and that&#x27;s with brushing twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing toothbrush heads is very simple...as is the water pick tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pick reservoir is large enough for my needs...I never run out of water in the tank while still needing to cover an area in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A helpful tip my dentist gave me:  Fill the reservoir of half mouthwash and half luke warm water, and your teeth will reach a whole new level of clean and fresh.  The anti-biotic nature of mouthwash helps to kill any bacteria inside your gumline, and the water pick obviously helps you reach the harder areas to get to when you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a state of the art powered toothbrush and water pick.</li>
            <li> performs as expected; quick delivery</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I have sensitive problem gums and the sonic brush with its soft bristles is just what I needed. This works so much better than any of the other power tooth brushes I have used in the past it is like night and day. I enjoy using it. It has a minute timer, it does not spray tooth paste in every direction when it leaves your mouth while in operation. It is well designed and does not leave an accumulation of paste build up on the handle or base. The water floss works very well. I had an entry level version that was only marginal. This far exceeds that old one. Everything fits well in its holder and stays in place. Very Happy with this.</li>
            <li> When I began to have some dental issues, I was frustrated because I brushed and flossed my teeth daily.  However, I knew I needed to do something quickly to help my gums and teeth to be stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS THE WATERPIK COMPLETE CARE SYSTEM LIKE?&lt;br /&gt;(In doing my research, I found that I had a hard time figuring out how this system would work.  It is for people in similar mindsets that I am writing this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO DO FIRST&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that you do is set up the area that you plan to put the unit.  The footprint is similar to a women&#x27;s size 5 shoe.  It needs to be near an outlet which should be near the sink that you plan to use this system in.  The unit has to be set up so that the water bin is closer to you.  The tops of the unti all go in the opposite side of the unit where there are holes for them to stand up in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush base has to be charged up.  Mine took overnight to reach full status with three lights on it.  The lights will stay lit to let you know what the charge is after you use it for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE THIS UNIT&lt;br /&gt;My family has a toothbrush head for each of us.  I prefer the smaller head which comes in the unit.  My daughter and husband each have a larger head that they use.  They all have different colored rings on them so they can be told apart.  You can also each have different reguiar tips for each of you if you prefer- this kit comes with two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOOTHBRUSH&lt;br /&gt;When you first use the flosser, I find that it is best to brush our teeth first. You can set the toothbrush on gentle speed (sensitive teeth might like this one) or high speed.  At first the high speed feels very intense, but in the long run, if you work up to it, it really does clean the teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that the toothbrush is in your mouth before turning it on.  That will spare you splatters everywhere.  Every 30 seconds the brush will pause briefly to let you know it is time to move to the next quadrant.  I don&#x27;t listen- I am a random brusher and go all over for 2 minutes.  Once the brush is done, we remove the top and stand it up in the unit or other storage space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FLOSSER&lt;br /&gt;Using the flosser is not hard to do, it just takes some practice to learn your own method.  First of all, the first time, the blue basin comes out of the unit.  You rinse it and fill it with warm water.  Then carefully replace the basin in the unit lining up the plug with the black seal on the unit.  Once it is firmly placed in there, you put in the tip that you want and with the tip IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE STARTING, you start the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you start on gentle- the lowest of 10 settings- so that you can take some time to develop the method of use that works best for you.  Once you have figured it out, then higher speeds are not as difficult to work with.  We each have our own method of use.  I tend to lean my head over the sink tilted slightly to the side.  My husband turns his head completely to the side, letting the stream of water run out of the corner of his mouth.  My daughter prefers to use it in private so I don&#x27;t know what method she has worked out yet.  She has used this with braces and now retainer and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a button on the flosser which pauses the stream so you can take it out of your mouth, rearrange it or turn it off without water spewing everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW WELL DOES THIS UNIT PERFORM?&lt;br /&gt;My family rarely agrees completely on anything.  We all have our own preferences and usually there are things we disagree on even if we agree.  This system, however, has made us all rave as we all have seen a big change in our tooth and gum health.  I am due for a cleaning after a long period of not being able to afford any, and since getting this system, I have found that my teeth have been looking cleaner and cleaner as I continue to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gum bleeding has been reduced to almost nothing for all of us.Our daughter&#x27;s mouth hardware has been fabulously cleaned and she really loves the different heads.  She uses the orthodontic tip for her teeth.  My husband and I use the classic jet tip for now, and eventually I will use the pik pocket top once my teeth have been deep cleaned and settle down.  I have also used the plaque seeker tip and found it to be very useful around the gum area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test this, I have used the waterpik flosser on medium after brushing my teeth on high speed.  Then I floss with floss to test and see if anything was left.  I have found one or two tiny pieces wedged in high up on the tooth, but that is it.  My teeth usually hold a lot of debris, so this is quite impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANY DISLIKES?&lt;br /&gt;The only things that I can say that we have not been crazy about has been trying to find the right manner to get the stream running out of the mouth with the least amount of mess. It is possible, but the way that the teeth are cleaned is so good, I am willing to put up with it.  You will get wet using this- but it is not overwhelming.  For people who really hate messiness in any form, this might not work out well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;This system comes with 2 classic tips, 1 plaque seeker tip, and pik pocket tip, a large toothbrush head and a compact toothbrush head.  Between the things that this comes with, my family (with the addition of another brush head) has found this to be really revolutionary for our tooth and gum care.  After use of both the brush and flosser, I have flossed with tooth floss and found almost nothing left every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not had any problems with the toothbrush not holding a charge, but we have had this under a month.  I will update if we have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although messy at times, our teeth have never been cleaner.  I am very happy with this system so far.  I will update with any new insight or information.Our daughter&#x27;s mouth hardware has been fabulously cleaned and she really loves the different heads.

            <li> Hoping for a priceless smile with the help of the WaterPik and $6,000 braces.</li>
            <li> best brush ever love the water pic</li>
            <li> Does a great job, it feels like you just left the dentists office each time you use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I had a Philips Sonicare Toothbrush for 9 years before it finally died. I was pleased with it and nervous to switch to the Waterpik version.  I am glad that I did!  It is fantastic!  My mouth feels to clean and fresh after each use.  I enjoy the toothbrush and waterpik combination.  The toothbrush is not as great as my Sonicare but it works well.  I find low to be too low, so I use the high setting.  It is easy to use and keeps everything organized.  Great job Waterpik!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. Toothbrush beats the competition, both quality and value, so the Waterpik is....like free.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, water pic and electric tooth brush in one and both high quality!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe what a difference for the better the Waterpik flosser and the sonic toothbrush make. Other than perhaps when I travel, I will never go back to dental floss and manual brushing. My teeth and gums look and feel so much cleaner that I&#x27;m embarrassed to say how  ineffective  my oral care must have been in the past...and I didn&#x27;t even realize it. I highly recommend this combo for adults, older children, and teens. I don&#x27;t think little children could manage it, at least, not without a good deal of help and supervision.</li>
            <li> Works much better than Phillips Sonic brand</li>
            <li> as advertised . I am not yet used to the water pick but works well. The toothbrush when stored in the charging base gets very hot at the base!</li>
            <li> Items I rated were all fine..thank you</li>
            <li> For years I was able to find a reason not to floss, but now I enjoy flossing with the waterpik WP-900.  My gums and teeth really look great.</li>
            <li> i love the clean feel of the water after i finish using it. its so easy to use and i do it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> This works really great. All previous reviews are correct. Your teeth feel like you just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Waterpik you are missing out!</li>
            <li> I feel like I go to the dentist every day. I love it. It works perfectly and is super easy to maintain. Just fill it with water and you are ready to kill any plaque that dares to stand in its way. It is adjustable and comes with a few different tips. The brush is cool too. It feels like I get a great clean and it is incredible simple. Just set it in the container and it&#x27;s always ready to go. It comes with a travel case that is very convenient.</li>
            <li> as advertised. great product.</li>
            <li> Flosser + sonic brush at a great price! I&#x27;ve been waiting to buy a sonic toothbrush and I am not disappointed. I was planning on buying a Philips Sonicare but I decided on getting this Waterpik combo. Everything works as advertised, but I&#x27;m disappointed that this combo isn&#x27;t Made in the USA. When I received the box, it plainly states Made in China, Designed in the USA. As a notice to future Waterpik flossers, I don&#x27;t know if this pertains to just me, but my dentist recommended that I don&#x27;t exceed past 4 on the pressure setting. More than 4 would actually result in damaging my gums. I haven&#x27;t found any YouTube videos of it yet, but you can actually change the battery in the brush. You just need to buy the battery from eBay or another online supplier, and solder the battery onto the board. Check YouTube before throwing out your dead toothbrush! My brand new toothbrush lasts under 2 weeks, brushing twice, on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and good quality</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE my new Waterpik (R) ultra flosser complete with toothbrush. The toothbrush tells you when you need to change quadrants (stops vibrating temporarily) and the waterpik has a rubber tool to get into the deep pockets as well as a ton of other attachments for everyday use. I use one cap of Advanced Care Listerine &amp; the rest water in the reservoir (Which detaches for easy cleaning)and I have to say it is the best!! Wish I started using this years ago. Sonic toothbrushes have come a long way since I last owned a Sonicare! Cheap on Amazon too. Trust me $100 is nothing compared to what the dentist charges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just went on sale down from $89.99 to $72.52 and just called and they gave me the difference. Telling you this thing is the best mouth care item I ever purchased. I went over the gum line with a rubber pik after my brush &amp; waterpik and there was nothing that came off. FABULOUS!!! I am so OCD about my teeth and will be even more so now but with less trouble! I am now done with my routine in less than 5 minutes and no more manual flossing. I highly recommend the product and am now a reformed Sonicare user! It even got particles out of the back molars that flossing used to take multiple passes to get out. My dentist even noticed the difference after 2 weeks of using it when I got my crown put in post root canal. A helpful hint is not to follow the directions my keeping your mouth open and letting the fluid drain. I recommend flossing each quad with your lips pursed, press the pause button on the handle, spit and resume. that way you will have little to no splash. As an RN, I find it really easy to clean too. PS- Brushing before the pik seems to be more effective for me as well as filling it after each use so it is ready to go next time.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expecte, the cord on the water pick could be a little longer but other than that it&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li> This is the best ever ..... Makes me feel like a million bucks</li>
            <li> It works but leaks like crazy through the pick area. It did not leak right away but once it started I have not been able to get it to stop. I wpuld not buy this brand again and I do plan to buy another unit, just not this brand.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised; is much more efficient, effective and enjoyable than the old school methods of dental hygiene. Will probably only use floss and toothbrush when traveling now.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have used so far. Use it every day and first time using a water flosser and it is great.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ive been using oral b for 20 years and just switched to this brand.  All the difference in the world.  Sonic does such a better job.</li>
            <li> This unit is very effective for its intended use. Brushing after every meal and using  the water pic once a day gave my teeth and gums a cleaning like they have never had. And I have been a constant flosser and used toothpics forever. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik WP-900 works as advertised and I am very pleased with the operation of the brush and flosser.  The only down side for me is that flosser is sort of hard to handle due to the coiled tubing.  Maybe I should have gone with the self-contained reservoir model.  Over all, I am happy with the resultsof this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ease of use &amp; it really does work well as a flosser. It was always difficult to remember to floss every day but with this, I have used it 1-2 times a day and have seen an improvement in my gums!</li>
            <li> Thought these were overrated until I used it. It is a little smaller on my vanity than other models, but delivers the power. Ladies, tie your hair at first or you will be soaked! I use a little mouthwash added in after filling with water  (to prevent a bubble bath). The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of my older oral-brush I gave up - but the cleaning action is identical. Lots of extra tools to try out, and a nice carrying case for the brush on the road. I  may have to get a travelling water pik now - I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the vibration of this brand, as it compares to my son&#x27;s Sonicare (sp?) Found the water pik so messy as to not be worth using, but that&#x27;s a personal choice, not an issue with the product. It works well enough that I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but when this one goes, I&#x27;ll consider another brand.</li>
            <li> I needed a sonic care type toothbrush and my husband&#x27;s dentist told him he needed a waterpick so this was a perfect solution for us.</li>
            <li> WOW! Where has this been all my life??!!! My dentist HIGHLY recommended that I buy an electronic toothbrush so after much reviewing I decided on the Waterpik sonic toothbrush and flosser and boy am I glad I did! I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush, my teeth feel like I just left the dentist EVERY single day! AMAZING! I can&#x27;t wait to hear what my dentist has to say after my next check up. To top it all off its an EXCELLENT value!</li>
            <li> So I never used to floss and my gums would bleed all the time. However after using it for a month, my mouth feels so much better. Make sure you seat the water container all the way down or else it may leak. The toothbrush is great too. I use the low setting for the toothbrush and a 4 for the flosser, even with an implant I&#x27;ve had no pain with either.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> i love the 2 in one package and that waterpik comes with various heads replacements soft/sprays etc.  i love the multiple spray settings too.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I am happy that this came with the toothbrush separate.  It makes brushing and cleaning so easy.</li>
            <li> Very good!I can&#x27;t wait to use it.If cheaper,I will buy another for my parents.I think everyone is deserved to get it.</li>
            <li> I was ordered to buy these two items, and I was happy to find an all-in-one set.It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, and the toothbrush holds a charge for a long time, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in all the time.  Easy to use, and I like the built in timer. After about a month of use, my dental hygienist said my gums were improving.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to reduce bathroom clutter and electric cords.  I am happy enough with the product overall.  I recently took a trip.  Before going, I tried to locate a charger for the brush....they don&#x27;t have one.  So, if you want to take and charge your brush, you have to take the entire unit.  Kind of hard to believe but there it is.&lt;br /&gt;October 2015 the toothbrush quit charging.  The company replaced it promptly.&lt;br /&gt;August 2017 the replacement is no longer holding a charge.  My Sonicare brushes had a much longer useful life.</li>
            <li> I received the Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care and while the Water Flosser works fine, the Sonic Toothbrush had no charge, so I was not able to try it at all and I have to buy a new toothbrush. Not what I expected since I paid for the complete package including the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this item. I had an issue with halitosis and gingivitis prior to buying this. Between the ultrasonic toothbrush and the water pik, the bleeding gums and other issues are gone. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This great make your mouth refresshing</li>
            <li> Tooth brush more powerful than my original waterpik brush.  Water flosser work great too. Six more words required to complete.</li>
            <li> I bought one as it was recommended by my dentist. After using it for 3 weeks I can say everyone should have one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Better by a mile than traditional flossing&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is good on normal setting, the strong setting makes you feel your filings will come out :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder who would dare use the waterpik on setting 10.. even 6+. My dentist said never go over 4 as it can irritate and hurt your gums since it&#x27;s so powerful over that. So I wonder why those settings exist..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Small con but it&#x27;s 120V only. So should you want to move to a country with 240V power you&#x27;ll need a converter (plenty can be found online)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, buy the model without the toothbrush if you do not need one obviously</li>
            <li> I love the water pic and already have a good electric brush. My wife loves the brush and plans to use it as her travel brush since it is a little more compact than the one she has been using. I purchased this Pik/brush combo since the combined price made the brush very inexpensive when compared to the price of the Pik price alone.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the pik and used it regularly for about a month prior to knee replacement surgery. I was told by my surgeon that regular brushing of teeth prior to surgery has been found to reduce the chance of developing a post op infection. My theory was to kick things up a bit and make sure my gums also were as healthy and clean as possible before I had surgery.</li>
            <li> This tooth care product was easy to use and it does a great job of cleaning between my implants and crowns.  I can vary the pressure of the water to easily remove food and clean my gums and mouth. This product can give you a better dental check up if it used as directed along with flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> Great product, its like having a dentist at home with you. This produce helps produce a great smile. Thank you waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is a good Product - not a great one. The toothbrush is one of the better ones I have used, however the waterflosser is weak.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist suggested that I get a Waterpik and it has been very good.  My gums feel a lot better and I can see it is removing a lot of food particles from my mouth.  I recommend it !</li>
            <li> I bought it for my parents. It works well and they love it. Worth the money. Will buy one for myself too.</li>
            <li> The waterpik design and storage are the best waterpik ever. The toothbrush is nothing more than a cheap very loud electric brush. Not a sonic brush. Nothing more. But I highly recommend this product for the new design of the waterpik unit. Very pleased but you will need to keep your sonic toothbrush. If you are using a manual brush this brush I&#x27;d certainly better.&lt;br /&gt;Th</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really put up a review sent this back barb</li>
            <li> We use it everyday. It fits in a space by a sink in our master bath. You need need a glass or measuring cup for the water everyday. We purchased a decorative one since it will always be on the vanity. Our dentist suggested we upgrade our flossing my using this machine. I have arthritic hands and find it difficult to floss correctly. The Waterpik is easy for me to use. To keep from leaning over, I sit on a stool.</li>
            <li> effectively eliminates that  nasty morning breath when used properly the night before,  keeps gums healthy and polishes teeth to their brightest.  The  previous waterpik  device  I  had used  regularly for  15 years had finally  worn out.  I was not gifted with naturally perfect snow white teeth, but they are healthy, clean and polished.  Best of all, my  dental problems have been  minimal, I  kept all my own teeth, and , for a 66 year old , that is stellar.  THANKS,  WATERPIK!!!  Delila</li>
            <li> This should NOT replace good flossing habits. It should be used in addition to good dental care to save you from tooth problems that may occur later along with unwanted dental bills that are never cheep.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally splurge on an electric toothbrush, and I settled on this Waterpik because you get the brush and a Waterpik all in one. Both are high quality and I really find that because of the smaller size and reduced back and forth motion I have to do, that it is easier to clean those hard to get parts in the back of my mouth, mostly because I&#x27;m not stabbing those fleshy round parts behind you last molars. And the Waterpik is really nice too. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with water leaking, but you will get water around your sink if you spray the Waterpik at the wrong angle. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is better than the other ultrasonic one.  the waterpik  is essentially the same as all waterpiks. it is very handy to have them both in one appliance</li>
            <li> I love that this unit is a combo of the water flosser and the toothbrush.  My own negative thoughts are that I wish the water reservoir were a little larger (just hate refilling it so often).  I could see where it could be too large for some spaces, especially if you have more than one.  But, as far as the way it works, I love it.</li>
            <li> The brush &amp; water pic work great, it is very  well designed with practical storage for everything. I love it.</li>
            <li> good product, but it needs stowage for the brushes</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys this quality double purpose appliance!</li>
            <li> what a wonderful device, after brushing I use the waterpick it leaves your mouth super clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> The unit is well built. The toothbrush is k I n da rough on high setting. Water pic works great.</li>
            <li> OMG, the BEST purchase I have made for myself and my son this year!!!  We both have gum issues and this is just a fantastic purchase.  If you want to stay away from the dentist .... BUY THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and its habit forming!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to. I see the value but the toothbrush head had no other features other than vibrate. It&#x27;s as if you buy this set for the flossing unit more than anything.</li>
            <li> Seems loud when use toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product thank you</li>
            <li> My Dentist wanted me to use both a flosser and an electric brush.  He said, &#x27;If you use both, you won&#x27;t have to see me.&amp;#34; this is great cuz it has both.  Been using for a week and it&#x27;s been great.  I like the different brushes and cleaners.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have recently gotten braces, and this makes my teeth feel clean. I love the attachment for braces because it cleans in all of the spaces around the braces and helps me to get the food out of my teeth. I bought the tong cleaner attachment and I love that too. the container holds just the right amount of water so that you can get to all of the spaces in your mouth before it runs out and the charge for the toothbrush last for a little over a week. I just love this</li>
            <li> I love the pik/tooth brush combo, it really does save room. My only issue is that the pik automatically squirts water and only stops when you press the button, I think it should work the other way around.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days and I am not sure if it is making a difference in my oral health.  I guess I won&#x27;t truly know until my next dental appt. in 6 months.  It is a bit messy, but with practice I should master it.  As far as the toothbrush goes, the head is pretty soft.  I would rather have a medium bristle situation, but perhaps it isn&#x27;t necessary.  Like I said, time will tell.  I am optimistic and would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I like my sonocare toothbrush much better. I did not notice that the toothbrush was not as good until about a month after I got it. I started feeling like my teeth were filmy. This one does not clean my teeth as well. I like the water flosser part fine, but I am definitely disappointed in the tootbrush.  I immediately noticed a difference when I switched back to sonicare. This toothbrush does not even come close.</li>
            <li> If I knew when I was younger what I know now about teeth I woulda done things a whole lot differently!  Buy it. It will save you money in the end</li>
            <li> Love having BOTH units with just one plug in.  As it says - it helps keep the vanity neater looking with just one cord to plug in.</li>
            <li> I seen the same pic at costco for more and I purchased here with a combo sonic brush and water pic for the same price.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Good 2-in-1 oral care.</li>
            <li> I just got this and could not wait to use it. How awesome! I would highly recommend. I feel like I just left the dentist!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a week now. Really enjoy it. Gets the crud out from between my teeth and gums. Mouth feels refreshed after each use. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Our power outlet in the bathroom is connected with the light, meaning it has only power when the light is on. The waterpik does not make any problems at all. The Sonic Toothbrush cannot charge unless we let the light in the bathroom on for a long time, which wastes too much power. For charging I need to bring the waterpik with the sonic toothbrush in the bedroom, which is bothersome. I wish they would sell a separate charger for the toothbrush so I wouldn’t need to move the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loved it! Works well, does the job... We own it for over a year and it still works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;And easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Bought one for our daughter and going to purchase another for our other daughter as well.</li>
            <li> I love it. So much easier than flossing. The only down fall is the noise. It is fairly loud. However, going to the dentist has gotten a lot more pleasant since using this little gadget.</li>
            <li> It did take me a couple of weeks to not make a mistake and spray water on my mirror, across the bathroom, or up my nose, but have got that problem taken care of now that I&#x27;ve gotten more use to it. From my standpoint, you can foget the special offer of getting a free accessory is you purchase two . . . the link they provided me was for something else all together and the site that I was told to use by customer service never figured out how to give me the free item, so I decided to just order what I wanted from someone else at a lower price anyway. After using the item for a few weeks, the pause button on the flosser started sticking and it would take me a few minutes to getting it to work again . . . always when I was in a rush. I wrote customer service about it and they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  it is two in one a water pick and flosser.  Great tool for people that don&#x27;t like to floss.  Water pik gets teeth cleaner that a tooth brush would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a water pic and this one is great. The electric toothbrush has made&lt;br /&gt;My teeth much whiter. It takes a few more minutes because it uses a timer to tell&lt;br /&gt;You when to move to the next quadrant but coffee and tea stains are now gone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to step-up my home dental hygiene routine and the Waterpik is just what I needed! It can be a little messy until you get the hang of it. Have had no problem with leaky seal as some have mentioned. I love it and would recommend it to any friend.</li>
            <li> great. Teeth feel so much better after using this about a month,</li>
            <li> very good for the price</li>
            <li> A little loud and pricy.</li>
            <li> this is a great machine. it deserves every one of the 5 stars I gave it. the water flosser is like having a dentist at home.</li>
            <li> A great, space saving device! I have a lifelong habit of brushing too hard, and wish that the toothbrush had a sensor type of apparatus to either let you know when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure. If Waterpick ever comes up with a compact two in one model with a toothbrush sensor, I&#x27;ll buy one. This is great for now, however! A great little machine!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product and with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months.  The Waterpik is a must have. Seriously.  And the Sonic toothbrush with it is awesome. There&#x27;s a place to hold your extra tips and replacement toothbrush heads next to the Waterpik reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative:  the reservoir is a little small, only good for like 1.5 flossings.</li>
            <li> The floss pik isnt as strong as i would like it to be but it gets the job done....since using it my teeth have never felt better</li>
            <li> Love it. Would never make it through having braces without it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a water pik before you are in for a surprise! I floss regularly so I could not believe the amount of food coming from between my teeth. I love this system. I will probably never go back to traditional brushing</li>
            <li> Dentist said I needed an electric toothbrush and I needed to floss more.  Boom, done.  I hate flossing.  If it were up to me, I would never, ever do it.  This thing is actually kind of fun though, flossing with the water instead of flossing with a slimy, stinky piece of string.  The included replaceable heads last a long time.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get one, so I did. He noticed improvement after two weeks even though, as it turned out, I wasn&#x27;t using it properly. After a month of proper use, I saw the dentist again, and he declared me free of gum problems, instructing me to continue using it. He said he and his entire family uses it, as does his staff.</li>
            <li> this thing is fantastic, ++++++</li>
            <li> Small learning curve to avoid mess, but still gets great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive part of my gums - neither the brush nor the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;-Small brush head and a large brush head.  Easy to remove.  Nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;-Timer made a bigger difference to me than expected.  Keeps me focused on getting a good brushing in.&lt;br /&gt;-I can feel the bristles getting in between my teeth where my last electric brush did not.&lt;br /&gt;-High-speed setting means business.&lt;br /&gt;-Completely enclosed/waterproof brush - Charges brush with no cables; it charges just being next to the unit (in the holder).&lt;br /&gt;-Rubber feet keep unit in-place and will fit on very small surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;-If a big bottle of Listerine fits, this will fit.  My sink is tiny and this fits on the corner where soap/lotion normally is.&lt;br /&gt;-Also fits under the mirror/medicine cabinet.  I can open it fully without moving it.&lt;br /&gt;-Water pik itself isn&#x27;t too messy.  I don&#x27;t let water &amp;#34;just drain&amp;#34; from my mouth.  I pause it, spit, and resume.  Works fine.  Less mess than &amp;#34;just letting it drain.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-Put a little mouthwash in it while you rinse.  Gets Listerine under the gums.&lt;br /&gt;-Pik head compartment/holder is removable.  This means wife and I can share one unit when we travel, but bring our own sets of pik heads.&lt;br /&gt;-Price is awesome.  I probably would have paid this price for just the toothbrush.  I almost did, in fact.  Instead, bought two of these.  Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;-Small enough to travel with whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s essentially a mini pressure washer.  I pressure washed a few fragile hobby items with it - worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;d prefer a mid-speed setting instead of just low and high, but I&#x27;m over it.&lt;br /&gt;-Only works with 110v (USA).  When I travel in Europe, I have to bring a kick-down transformer to use it.  I&#x27;d prefer it had a power brick like a laptop, so I could just change it with a 220v version, but this is a very small complaint and won&#x27;t apply to most people.&lt;br /&gt;-Some of the extra piks seem a little pointless in my opinion, but they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t make breakfast or shave my face too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this water flosser for a few years so I decided to buy one for my granddaughter. After using this water flosser iit makes your teeth and gums feel so clean. I use it everyday and can really feel the difference after using it. I highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this closer and toothbrush.  It makes your mouth seem super fresh and clean.  There is a two minute timer on brush which takes the guesswork out of timing your brushing.  The water glosser is easy although messy at first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The sonic toothbrush is terrific (I had an Oral B circular motion toothbrush before, and this one feels like it cleans and massages the gums much better.  The water pik has a good size reservoir and long enough tube so that I don&#x27;t feel too restricted in distance from the base unit.  Easy controls for starting and intensity and also I like the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button located on the hand unit.  I definitely know that I am getting my teeth and gums as clean as possible from food particles after flossing, brushing and using the waterpik.</li>
            <li> This thing works wonders. I LOVE the toothbrush. I&#x27;m not so adept at handling the waterpik part for flossing. I tend to get that all over. Be forewarned to definitely plan ahead--It shoots a lot of water into your mouth and without some experience it can be tricky. After using this, it feels just like going to the dentist and having your teeth cleaned. You get that wonderful fresh feeling without the scary dentist part.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasant surprise for me to receive an electric toothbrush along with my Waterpik.  It works much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> I like it, but just wish it held more water.  It does a good job and is a nice combo with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> on time arrival, excellent brush  the flosser  works  very good easy to use and maintain ,keep my teeth clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Better than expected. The brush is awesome and the way the water glosser works is amazing. Excellent quality also.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush makes my teeth feel very clean, but the waterpik is obnoxiously loud. I kid you not it sounds like a jackhammer, with water on full blast it is still heard on the other end of the apartment. It seems to get my teeth clean, but I don&#x27;t know if I can keep this due to the horrible noise.</li>
            <li> Love the Waterpik electric toothbrush and&lt;br /&gt;flosser! Teeth and gums feel and look&lt;br /&gt;healthy. Love the toothbrush timing of&lt;br /&gt;the quadrants by hesitating when it was&lt;br /&gt;time to move on to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> I already owned a Sonic toothbrush but had never tried the Waterpik before.  The combination is wonderful!  My teeth and gums have never felt so healthy!  My dental hygienist is impressed.</li>
            <li> Love the cleaning job this does!</li>
            <li> works great, very happy with the purchase, will order another one for family members!</li>
            <li> Every time I lift the reservoir, water leaks out of the bottom. The rubber gasket fails to seal the hole. HORRIBLE DESIGN!!!! I&#x27;ve been meaning to write this review for some time!! Eff this company.. Wtf?  UPDATE: 2/4/17 - just shy of my two year warranty the battery on the toothbrush dies and I&#x27;m calling them Monday to get a replacement. This should not happen and the battery should be removable! After the leak, they sent me out new gaskets and they helped somewhat..</li>
            <li> This sure beats our old electric toothbrush.  The sonic vibration feels good on the teeth and gums and does a great job cleaning the teeth and massaging the gums, which means better oral hygiene.  It&#x27;s also nice to have the combination of brush and waterpik, which reduces clutter on the bathroom sink and is much more cost effective than buying two separate units.</li>
            <li> nice unit,feels dentist clean, ever time.</li>
            <li> Had a Phillips brand toothbrush only and my dentist suggested  that I consider a water floss system in general and Waterpik by name. He said I recommend them; I don&#x27;t sell them so I feel that I&#x27;m recommending the best for your home care. He was right on. I bought it, use it twice daily and love it. I now recommend the product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great deal shipped fast</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product.  No other way to get a mouth feeling as fresh and clean than to use a Waterpark and their sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this! Sonic toothbrush is awesome and the water pic works great.</li>
            <li> it really helpfull.  Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Works great! Love the different water pressure settings and various brushes included.</li>
            <li> I really like this product,very enjoying everyday to use it.Very nice quality and it does what is suppose to do.For this price everybody should have it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li> If  you can&#x27;t / won&#x27;t floss, this is a great substitute. You use the water jet on, in and around each tooth, massaging the gum lines at the same time.  The electric toot brush has two speeds and a timer to let you know to go to the next quadrant.  The high speed does a great job of  massaging the gums.  My hygienist said it was as good or better than flossing and excellent for the gums.</li>
            <li> We have both products we wanted in one unit. Works for us. Especially like the water pik feature. Size good for counter top.</li>
            <li> wourks great! My dentist noticed a diffrence!</li>
            <li> works great better than regular flossing never will go back to regular flossing again toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself, but it was commandeered by the 7 year old, who has some issues brushing well.  The brush is extremely quiet and soft --making it better than most other electric toothbrushes -- which sometimes sound like you are sticking a helicopter inside your mouth.  The little one also (very surprisingly) loves to use the water flosser, wants to do it even longer than the typical 90 seconds, and is eager to try all the attachments. Kid&#x27;s tooth cleaning has improved significantly and so has the willingness to brush and floss twice per day. So, a very good purchase for us.</li>
            <li> I never owned a Waterpik before and even mentioned the product to my dentist.  He just mentioned to floss daily.  I do floss, brush my teeth and now use the Waterpik as well as my daily regimen.  Since using the Waterpik I noticed my loose teeth get stronger, gums are pink and the Waterpik gets all the gunk stuck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about the Waterpik before as I believe my teeth and gums would be in much better shape than they are now.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice unit, and the sonic toothbrush is great.  What I love best is the pause it does after 30 seconds, to let you know to move on to another quadrant.</li>
            <li> Easy to use out of the box.Great results!</li>
            <li> This combo Irrigator / Sonic Tooth Brush is the best I have ever used on both levels. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the best price I have seen anywhere as well. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 3 times a day and it&#x27;s just great, you can really maintain the level of &#x27;clean&#x27; that you experience right after a cleaning, between cleanings - my dentist tells me it&#x27;s the greatest improvement between visits that they have ever seen!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> This might be the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Recently just got braces and the waterprik has been very helpful. I love how i could use this instead of flossing.</li>
            <li> delivers as advertised</li>
            <li> Works great.  My teeth and gums are cleaner than ever!</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I move to a Waterpik for flossing.  I like that this has the toothbrush in the same plug--less space needed on the counter.  It&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve to use the Waterpik, but I&#x27;m getting the hang of it and it is a lot easier than flossing.  Because my mouth no longer opens very wide, this tool is very helpful in reaching the back teeth vs a traditional or electronic flosser.  I&#x27;m hoping I get a &amp;#34;gold star&amp;#34; at my next dental visit.  However, regardless I think this flosser has improved the ease of my daily ritual tooth care.  The toothbrush is also very nice.  It has a little signal every 30 seconds which helps time the brushing.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver!! For the first time in history, both my hygienist and my periodontist had absolutely NOTHING negative to say. No tips, no lessons, son speeches. Finally!! I&#x27;m Just confused as to why they never recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I started it at level 1~2 yesterday. in the box, something said &amp;#34; 2012 @ right ~~~~~~&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m worried a little.&lt;br /&gt;It works well.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office and had a great teeth cleaning everytime I use it!</li>
            <li> This was for my son, who just got braces and it works great.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with my AMAZON purchase.  I find this waterpick/sonic brush duo just what the Dentist would probably order.&lt;br /&gt;I made the purchase based on the info from friends who had them and their Dentists commented on how clean their teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;It was a Great purchase!!&lt;br /&gt;WAJ</li>
            <li> Seems to do a great job with cleaning between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This product serves almost all people and we all need to keep our teeth well, but also saves time and is more efficient when cleaning teeth</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush.  Not too impressed witht he water Pick</li>
            <li> Love it!!  My sister wants one.  Getting it for her birthday.</li>
            <li> The waterpik is great and easy to use. I already had an electric toothbrush but his one does a much better job. Quality product.</li>
            <li> My  mouth has never felt so clean!  the only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; to this system is that the storage area doesn&#x27;t store everything they send you with this!&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush:  two speeds, automatically times 2 minutes in 30 second intervals.  Real easy recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water flosser:  don&#x27;t start on high speed....power blast!  Nothing wimpy about this thing.  It&#x27;s amazing what regular floss leaves behind.  Try it.....floss with the waxed string stuff after dinner.....then use the water flosser and look at what else pops out.....Amazing!</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME!!! I was never one to try an electronic toothbrush until my dentist recommended a waterpik. I saw this on sale for Black Friday and had to scoop it since it also came with a tooth brush. Now after about 4 months of use i will never go back to a normal tooth brush! After brushing ad flossing, it feels like i just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> So far, a very effective waterpik. It&#x27;s affordable and works as specified. Using it everyother day and then use standard toothbrush on the other days. I take sonic toothbrush when I travel.</li>
            <li> Takes about 24 hours to fully charge the toothbrush, and the water pik has every type of water flossing you can think of.  Very easy to use and the battery on the toothbrush lasted over a week without having to be charged again.</li>
            <li> Love it. It really cleans your teeth! I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and my mouth has never felt as clean as it does now that I use this system</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good flossed and toothbrush. Teeth feel really clean after each use. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s motor is very loud.</li>
            <li> I have always used the interdent/braun.  This was my first &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush.  It does a good job and the water pik is just great.</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer! If you want that fresh out of the dentist feeling every day then this is the way to go. Don&#x27;t wait get it now!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my mom.I use a water pic and suggested  that she try it out, so I bought her one. She really likes it and it really helps! !</li>
            <li> It works really great and I love that it has a toothbrush and a waterpik flosser and spots to store the extra flosser heads, as well as the bonus travel case for the toothbrush. I am a big fan of waterpik water flossers and love using them, so I was excited to get this and also have a waterpik brand toothbrush. I really like that it has a feature where it does 30 second intervals for each four quadrants of the mouth and has two speed settings. I also like that the flosser comes with so many different heads, including an orthodontic tip. The reason for knocking out a star is that it is EXTREMELY loud. Now, I have a cordless portable waterpik glossed, as well and that one is very quiet compared this. The water flosser sounds like a very loud machine, and you can hear it throughout the entire house. The toothbrush is loud, too but the flosser is top notch loud. Other than that, they work good and well, it works... so aside from noise, I still like it a lot and it&#x27;s not enough to make me dislike the product altogether because I do love the brand and how great they work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Had a power surge which fried the unit and Waterpik sent me a brand new unit quickly. Don&#x27;t get the canopy protection plan. The manufacturer covers everything for the first year. Save the $5.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with one Major flaw. This product does an amazing job cleaning. Even after flossing and brushing it still gets more gunk. BUT.....The flaw? You have to press the button to STOP the flow of water. Completely backwards from what it should be. I SHOULD need to press the button to have the water flow. The way it is now I have to remember to be pressing the button while reaching around the cord to shut the waterpik off. And hold down while spitting. ( so complicated early in the morning! Ha!)  Needless to say I&#x27;ve soaked my bathroom numerous times.</li>
            <li> It was just what we needed!  We had forgotten to order it when we purchased the piano, it is just what we needed.</li>
            <li> My boss suggested I get this and I absolutely love it!!! Can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist says at my next appointment</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten this when I had more teeth! Its the best..  I use it before I brush to remove particles of food debris and again afterwards to rinse. I absolutely love the compact design. It comes with a case to store the accessories, a removable reservoir that you can fill with warm, cold water,&lt;br /&gt;or rinse aids and with the pressure settings you feel the pulsating water getting to places a brush couldn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> I love it. Gum massages are the best!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired of using actual floss ( the pain to my gums with regular floss is too much. ) My teeth have never felt cleaner and breath never fresher. thank you for creating this, though you could use a little more pressure that&#x27;s probably the only problem ( the sonic toothbrush also does very good. )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an effective waterpik and sonic toothbrush system. It gets the job done. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Works great , keeps my teeth very clean</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product, thank you.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I lived so long without it.  I use it twice a day and love it.  Got one for my wife too.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for 2 months now. It does take some a little time to get use to pressure of the water flow and learn how not to create a mess.  I went for a dental check up on Thursday and the dentist did mention I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my teeth. I&#x27;m currently working on an international assignment so the unit use 110 volt so l needed to buy a convert to convert it to 220 volt.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended I purchase a waterpik (specifically this brand) and when I discovered the new flosser and sonic toothbrush combination, I was delighted.  The flosser has far exceeded my expectations and rather than flossing only once a day, I now use the waterpik two to three times a day.  My gums have improved and my mouth feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> It was not advertised correctly and I was disappointed by lack of some of the &amp;#34;assumed features.&amp;#34;  I was told it had a sterilizer for the toothbrush which it does not.  Therefore, the toothbrush sits in a closed, unventilated container with germs always on it</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was just what it said it would be. Helps my son with braces keep his teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Works as described, was missing a part when I received it....Waterpik replaced the part immediately no questions asked.Excellent customer service!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item to have for my son to use with his braces. It cleans well but is very noisy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used something like this and I love it, I have to admit that I do not floss on a regular basis and sometimes not at all. So this is easy to use and quick and I have flossed more time  with this in the last year then the last few combined. I also love the 2 speeds on the the toothbrush, it makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist office :)</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this package deal. It has what I wanted in a single package at a good price. The merchandise arrived in good shape in a timely fashon.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist was very complimentary when she checked my gums.  &amp;#34;This back side went from a 4 to a 3,&amp;#34; she exclaimed.  Not sure what that means, but she was excited about it and my gums and teeth feel much better and way more clean than ever before.  This combination is a marvelous idea.  It will make you and your dentist better frineds.  Well, maybe your dentist won&#x27;t like you better because he or she won&#x27;t have as much work to do in your mouth, but the hygenist will love you for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for electric toothbrush and water flosser for my mom for mother&#x27;s day. It looked a bit smaller than I expected. We tested it out and it works good.</li>
            <li> I bought the waterpik 900 on the recomendation of my dental hyginest to ward off visits to an orthodontist. It has taken some time to use it without creating a mess around the sink. As long as it meets the ultimate goal I will learn to love this thing.</li>
            <li> I am 72 and wish I had purchased this 10 years ago when the hygienist told me to get it. I just bought it many root canals and bridges later and find that it is the most wonderful painless method of cleaning teeth that prevents and removes tarter. The hygienist will have nothing to do when I go back.  I use the warm warter flossing first and it removes all particulate matter from the smallest crevices and gums; then I use the brush whicht finishes the job. It is perfect...I believe I would have saved my molars with this product. Take time and read the directions as you go about doing this for the first time step by step. After you do it one time, you will not need to look at the directions again. If I can do this at 72, anyone who can read can do it. A great gift for anyone capable of using the product. AK</li>
            <li> I love this! Now I can&#x27;t go without it! I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are really clean without this! Very happy and smiling!:D</li>
            <li> Really powerful but the reservoir is very small.  I have to refill it twice each use to increase my cleaning time because of the small reservoir but the electric toothbrush works great. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Never enjoyed flossing, brushing and doing extensive oral care until I started using this. So easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush but the water is so cold when I use the water pic part.  I have to use warm water if I wanna use that part and be able to tolerate it.  I am usually rushing to get ready to get my toddler to bed so I don&#x27;t always have time to wait for it to warm up to use it.  The brush works really well to get my teeth feeling clean and smooth though so I really like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and she likes it alot.</li>
            <li> Much better than older Waterpik models.  Water tank is easier to remove, fill and mount.  Toothbrush charges by induction (no contacts to get dirty) and is easily washed clean after brushing.  No messy buildup of toothpaste on the bottom of the brush handle as with previous models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a flosser, but ever since visiting my dental for my checkup and being told my gum health is borderline and that I should invest in a waterpik,  I decided to give it a try.  I decided on the complete care system and I LOVE IT! Now I can&#x27;t wait to brush, floss and waterpik my mouth each night.  My mouth feels like I just left the dentist.  I can&#x27;t wait to return to see how my gums have improved.</li>
            <li> This thing is so loud, messy and still makes the water like plastic after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she likes it so much Im planning to get one for myself! It was shipped on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> had one similar but tooth brush and flosser were separate and took up space. This is more compact and easier to use. The price was the best  I compared it to local stores</li>
            <li> Me and my wife love it, is nice, practical, does the service is intended for, I have used electric toothbrushes in the past but this system is by far the best one I got.</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical about these water flossers.when my dentist recommended getting one.  If you don&#x27;t like using regular floss, you will love this.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and you will clearly see that it gets food out you didn&#x27;t know you had in your mouth.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good products. First time I ever had one of these and I luv it. Quick service in shipping and would buy from that vendor anytime.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that the battery in the Sonic toothbrush did not fully charge.</li>
            <li> item was highly recommended by my dentist. Noticeable difference in my teeth since started using product. (water flosser is lightly messy. gets better with prctice)</li>
            <li> Love it mouth fills so fresh</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations. Fast, efficient, clean , easy and nice use.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a better way to clean mouth/teeth/gums/tongue/.</li>
            <li> No other product is quite like it. Great for routine dental hygiene. I bought this because my previous model was...well, getting older, but has not yet failed. Durable product. Didn&#x27;t want to be without a new one on hand.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is not as powerful as the sonicare. I like the waterpik for getting between teeth. The adjustable jet of water can be very powerful.</li>
            <li> excellent, that was recomended by my odonthologist</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik.  I use it more than flossing! Great!!!!</li>
            <li> It works great!  It gets clean the hard to reach places deep between your teeth.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this duo.  My teeth and gums look great.  My gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this product when you finish rising you mouth it  feels just great. My Dentis love this product also</li>
            <li> I had a waterpik YEARS ago because it was recommended to me by my Dentist.  For some reason, when I moved, I did not start using it again.  I love this and the toothbrush is great.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great! Practical and very efficient to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well. I only have two complaints and they&#x27;re relatively minor.  I do wish the toothbrush had three speeds.  The low speed seems a little &#x27;soft&#x27; to me, but the high speed is a bit much for my teeth to handle. I really feel like I need a middle ground.  Second thing is that the water pic has a button on the handle to turn the water OFF.  I would prefer that the button turned the water ON.  But I can live with it!  Other than those two preferences, the brush and pic work great and I know they will help keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I&#x27;ve always brushed my teeth simply out of obligation to keeping a healthy mouth....now I do it because I love how my teeth feel after brushing!  My teeth are so close together that flossing is just painful but with the WaterPik, I can use the water pik flosser to take care of most of the flossing hassle.  I ordered this for myself but I have my husband and 7 year old son using it regularly too!  The only negative is that the water container doesn&#x27;t hold nearly enough water.  It&#x27;s not enough to effect my opinion though.....buy one!</li>
            <li> really nice sonic toothbrush and both have overall helped my dental health a ton</li>
            <li> I bought this Waterpik for my husband. It&#x27;s his first Waterpik and he loves it!  I already have an older model Waterpik (Classique Professional) and recently bought this one for my husband as well as the cordless travel sized one for myself. I&#x27;d say this model is the best of the three. I like the fact that this one includes the cordless electric toothbrush. I also appreciate that the water basin has a cover over it and that there is a covered compartment for the heads to the Waterpik and toothbrush. I feel it is more sanitary. As you might suspect since this is a 3-Waterpik household, I feel like I can&#x27;t live without a Waterpik. I still remember the first time I used mine. My mouth felt as good as it does after having my teeth cleaned by a hygienist!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Such a great buy and works incredibly well!</li>
            <li> I have owned a few of these over the years same water pic  brand. I love the larger toothbrush area and high speed setting, some newer toothbrushes are smaller with one speed ax nd don&#x27;t seem to clean well.&lt;br /&gt;the one thing I don&#x27;t like is the new on / off switch that must be turned rather than toggled as you can not do this one handed....&lt;br /&gt;the water cord on these will last about 3 years before they fail.&lt;br /&gt;all in all a good product for as long as it lasts and the cost associated with a healthier oral life</li>
            <li> Cheap product, mine stopped working after less than eight months. Water pressure was adequet I wouldn&#x27;t by another product from this company. I&#x27;ve got soe extra tips, do you think they would sell for $5 each??</li>
            <li> I love love love mine. My dentist said I had no plaque and I hadn&#x27;t seen her for a year!  She wanted to know what I had been doing. My experience matches the reported research. Yippee!</li>
            <li> I had a waterpik flosser before that I liked. I bought this because it has the sonic toothbrush too. They both work great. I especially like the timer on the toothbrush, 30 seconds brushing each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> If I had known years ago that this is all it would take to get my kids to brush regularly, I would have bought it sooner. The price was $20 less than I could find it in the store. My kids use the water pik daily. It comes with multiple heads for both the tooth brush and water pik. My dentist recommended it. My son goes back later this month to the dentist and I am hoping for a better checkup.</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik ; it has everything I wanted, flosser, sonic toothbrush and more. The capacity of the water container is just right.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. The sonic brush works great and the water pick finishes up the job... Buy one.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my teeth have become cleaner since using this. I like that it comes with a toothbrush and pik. My only complaint is the cord is short, because my outlet is high up. I need to use an extension cord. Other than that I have been using it daily and like the convenience of the toothbrush being charged by the same device. It&#x27;s not small, so make sure you have space on your sink counter.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the transportable unit we had previously. Good unit &amp; easier to use than the previous model.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all you have used before are $5 electronic toothbrushes from Oral B or Crest; this sonic toothbrush will be a game changer, there really is no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not fair to compare the waterpick to normal flossing, the feeling you get after using the waterpick is a much cleaner feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if my joy turns south, but I think this will go down as one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for people who have braces, dentures, implants, porcelain teeth and need to use a waterpik to avoid hurting their gums, as well as a soft tooth brush to avoid damaging any type of sensitive dental work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product i recommend if you have braces</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my son&#x27;s mother-in-law &amp; she loves it.  She likes it so much she says she uses 5 or 6 times a day &amp; would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> used this product for 2 months and it saved me 400.00$ at the dentist.the water pick works great and the sonic brush really cleans great.would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend it. An item that the entire family can take advantage of. No regrets at all. C</li>
            <li> Really like it - fantastic having 2 products in.  Previously had water pic and sonic toothbrush.  Not so sure if power overall is equal to 2 products separately but will purchase for the second home.</li>
            <li> i went from one of those devices that sprays out a quick burst of air/water, but switching to this waterpik (or maybe an waterpik for me) was a great move. It works better. The toothbrush is really good quality too.</li>
            <li> Currently own this product and use it daily. Wanted to get a back-up.</li>
            <li> Working well, although the charging time for the tooth brush is a little long. from 2 bars to three needs a 12 hour charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is better than the older model of water pik.</li>
            <li> I love this, especially for my daughter. She has an expander then braces, food gets caught in it all the time and she is able to get it out easier.</li>
            <li> A little noisy, but works fantastic! It has wireless charging so you can charge it without plugging the actual toothbrush in.</li>
            <li> I literally feel 200% when using this for brushing my teeth. The additional Water Pik tools were a great add-on (see my review for those) and the replacement brushes (50% of retail prices). I highly recommend this if you are looking to have the absolute cleanest teeth on the block for the price of 1x dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And truth be told (dentists will hate me for this) - if you follow my formula - you can actually reverse cavities with this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 min Waterpik WP-900, 2 min with water pik head, 2 min flossing, 1 min rinse with 3% Hydrogen Peroxide EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have whiter teeth in 3 months rather than 5 years with my (now defunct) dentist and &amp;#34;teeth whitening formulas&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t even go to the dentist - what&#x27;s the point. I do everything they tell me - brush, floss, rinse, etc. and last time I walked in - he got out his tools, and then put them down. He said - o, it looks as clean as I can get it today...</li>
            <li> This unit is well made and powerful.  Just the thing for keeping healthy teeth and gums.  I like the power and versatility of the flosser.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I purchased. My husband wanted one too, we love it so much.</li>
            <li> If I would have known that a waterpik was so easy to use and would make my teeth and gums feel so great I would have bought one years ago!!! I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Due to some chips in my crowns, I was advised by my dentist to get a Water Pik.  I was thrilled to find this combo with both the water pik and the electric toothbrush.  It works very well.  It&#x27;s kind of nice because the toothbrush has a two minute timer on it and pauses every 30 seconds so you brush each quadrant the right amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pik works well, too, but it takes a bit of getting used to.  I sprayed myself a few times before I figured out how to utilize the pause button.  I started out on a lower pressure setting and have been working my way up.  My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; - if you can call it that - is that the unit is very loud when you are using the water pik part.  Also, it would be nice if the toothbrush had a pause button so you could spit before toothpaste goes running down your chin.  But other than that, I really like this unit.</li>
            <li> Excellent. This was a gift and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints as of yet. I suppose they like it.Don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I replaced a sonicare toothbrush and older waterpik with this model which is all I need. Toothbrush works as well and waterpik is so much easier than flossing.</li>
            <li> The water pik is so smooth and the tooth brush makes my mouth feel so clean. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a Great combination! This is a very powerful toothbrush. The cost of replacement brushes is very economical compared to the competition. The waterpik has many attachments. It would have been nice to have both as standard sized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, all-in-one. Only gripes are the hose on the water-pic could use another 8-12 inches in length, and the high-speed on the toothbrush is WAY too strong; it will vibrate your teeth right out of your mouth. I would recommend to WaterPic to put a variable speed control on the toothbrush so you can precisely dial-in your own preference. But for the price, I think they have probably done the best they could. Personally, I would be willing to pay another $25.00 if the product had those upgrades. Otherwise it works well, and my mouth, teeth and gums definately feel better since using the water-pic and sonic toothbrush combination. In any case, if you are on the fence about dumping your manual toothbrush for a sonic toothbrush it&#x27;s not even close..GET A SONIC TOOTHBRUSH. Same goes for getting a water-pic device..it really makes your teeth and gums feel WONDERFUL and CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Love it, absolute cleanest mouth feeling.  Should have bought it years ago.</li>
            <li> It is just perfect and what I was looking for. My dentist always used to complain about the brushing style I had with manual brushes. But now its very easy. The flosser is also perfect. It might take couple of days to get used to the water flosser. But overall i am happy that I brought this.</li>
            <li> I previously used a battery operated water flosser and was disappointed with the results. My dentist recommended using a flosser, and I decided to purchase the Waterpik WP-900 based on other reviews. The product worked much better than the previous flosser I tried.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use but it took some practice to not get water all over myself and the bathroom! But I had the process down fairly well within a week. My dentist recommended using the flosser with LIsterine, but I started with just plain water at first. Now I use diluted Listerine and don&#x27;t have any problems. The sonic toothbrush works great and completes the cleaning process nicely.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare Whitening toothbrush I&#x27;ve had maybe 3 years suddenly died, and I was looking to replace it. To purchase another was about equivalent in price as this package was, so I looked into going with the Waterpik instead. I do not regret it at all. I find the brushing at high mode more soothing than my Sonicare- almost like massing my gums. The various attachments are great- there is something for every need. Getting used to the Waterpik part took about 4-5 times to get the hang of how to hold it without getting water splashed out of my mouth, but the feeling after is wonderful. I put a splash of Listerine in the water tank and get a really clean, fresh mouth.  Very happy about this change to my brushing regiment!</li>
            <li> Awesome price and just what we needed.  Bought one for me and one for my husband.  The dentist said he could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Have had a Water Pik for years and decided to update with this model. So very glad I have. It is less noisy, less messy, easier to fill and use and the switch to turn it off and on is in the front, not way in the back. Also, it has such easy to use force control switch.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works great and I alternate it with my Oral B, so I think I&#x27;m getting the benefit of various cleaning methods. I love this unit and am very happy that I have made the change.</li>
            <li> Love this complete care by Sonic, this is the best dental care system I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like my new Waterpic, does everything that I want it to do. The only thing, it is quite large, so make sure you have a place for it.</li>
            <li> the waterpik is pretty neat it will clean your mouth better then any swishing will, but it doesnt replace flossing or anything.&lt;br /&gt;the toothbrush is pretty good, its brush is almost to soft though but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> This gadget is wonderful, does not take up a lotta space.  Very easy to  use.  You think you&#x27;ve done a great job with the brushing. But once you use the waterpik........no so much.  I love the water pik.  I use it at home when I just wanna raise food away!</li>
            <li> Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> IT WAS AN EXELLENT SERVICE AND AN EXELLENT MACHINE.. IT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT AND MORE.. IT WAS JUST AMAZING</li>
            <li> Love both the toothbrush and the waterpik.  My husband has an Oral B electronic toothbrush that was recommended by his dentist but now he always wants to use mine because its better!!  So there you go.  And the waterpik really couldn&#x27;t be easier.  My husband who never flosses and can&#x27;t be persuaded to will use the waterpik every night because its &amp;#34;so easy&amp;#34;.  For the quality and the price, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package on the exact date it was estimated.</li>
            <li> Great product!  After paying way too much money to my dentist, I decided to become more proactive.  This waterpik and toothbrush are perfect.  I have a bridge that is hard to reach and there is a pick specifically for bridges and it really does CLEAN.  I won&#x27;t get graphic.  The product is worth every penny I spent.  Morning and night, when I use the Waterpik, it feels as if I just had my teeth cleaned.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i respect my dentist&#x27;s opinion for WP900&lt;br /&gt;I find it meets my expectation fully</li>
            <li> Does what it should. Carry case seems to be a waste.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one for the spouse.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is great – cleans my teeth like no other brush I&#x27;ve used before. The sonic toothbrush really shines up your teeth and creates an all-day clean feeling on teeth and gums. The flosser is efficient and is really great with warm water + salt solution. I&#x27;ve noticed that my breath feels fresher too and lasts throughout the day. I can be anal with dental hygiene and just knowing that I&#x27;m being proactive in my dental care makes me feel a lot more confident that I&#x27;m doing everything I can against tooth decay and gum disease. I wish I had found this earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Waterpik for 2 weeks before the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button on the flosser stopped working. When I pressed it, it wouldn&#x27;t spring back up and I had to manually pry it out before I could continue to use it. I called Waterpik, but they said that there&#x27;s nothing they could (or would) do because I had bought it off Amazon and because I wasn&#x27;t in the US, I was not eligible for an exchange or repair, and that&#x27;s fine. However I didn&#x27;t like the tone the lady on the line (or the customer service in general) – she wasn&#x27;t even interested in helping me, and was unapologetic – even my 2 initial emails to their customer service went unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I brought my grievances to Amazon, and they immediately sent me a replacement unit – plus apologized for the inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although I give Waterpik 4 stars (didn&#x27;t like that my unit was faulty), it&#x27;s zero stars for Waterpik&#x27;s customer service, and 5 stars for Amazon&#x27;s quick resolve of my issue.</li>
            <li> very good product is as described. I recommend</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  The Waterpik and flosser work excellent together.  The last dental visit was greatest checkup - no plaque.... yeah!!!!!</li>
            <li> We have had ours for almost a year!!! It is amazing. My teeth and gums are so healthy and clean feeling. Ours came with a travel case as well. My dentist is actually proud of me!!! Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and never used a waterpik before but I am  here to tell you I like my mouth now . I t feels  so clean, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Works good.  I think there could be a better longer cord design for the water flosser.  I also think the instructions should include when to use the various brush heads and not just print on outside of box.  People through the box away and then unsure what brush tip to use.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. I have always had good teeth and want to keep it that way, but am HORRIBLE at flossing. I have been using this thing everyday though. No more bleeding from the gums (unless I put the water pressure too high) and a nice clean feeling every morning. Doesn&#x27;t take that much time to do a quick pass. You can feel the water pushing through between the teeth and gums. It&#x27;s a nice little gum massage too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the famous words of The Doctor... &amp;#34;Water is patient, Adelaide. Water just waits. Wears down the cliff tops, the mountains. The whole of the world. Water always wins&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works it even has 30 second interval timer for tooth brush . Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room on my counter and I love that it is a 2-in-1. My mistake was to put some tea tree essential oil in it and that &#x27;ate&#x27; at the plastic of the water container, but I bought a replacement container while I ordered my brushes after 3 months. If there is one minor negative thing that I could say about it, it is that the button that you have to depress for keeping the water to come out of the nozzle, is that it gets stuck sometimes. So what I do, is crank up the pressure for a second so it gets unstuck and then adjust it back to the preferred water pressure. It beats the flossing with a thread and it is much better for your teeth and gums to brush with this sonic toothbrush vs manual toothbrush. All in all I love it!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. It feels like a dentist&#x27;s cleaning every time.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have had.  The 1st one lasted 8 years before the vibrating motor in the toothbrush locked up.  We kept the old one just for a spare water pic.  You can buy a spare brush device, but it is almost as expensive as a new unit, so we opted for the new unit.</li>
            <li> Works perfect. Convenient that they are in one system. Great pressure and not as loud as my last water pik. Battery lasted great when I went out of town for 5 days on the sonic care. Very pleased with everything!</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Would reccomend it to anyone looking for such a product.  I especially like the fact that it does both brushing and &amp;#34;flossing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this unit. Far worth the extra  money spent. Some of the features like removable  water tank (lid not attached  to it. And a separate storage area to store your piks (not stored in lid, like  my other unit W-100/W-100W (same unit).&lt;br /&gt;(And I have a cordless travel unit, but I have to fill  it up twice in order to fully rinse and clean my braces).&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush is very gentle on my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this toothbrush is far better than any Sonicare toothbrush I own.&lt;br /&gt;I have the  W-100 at my home and decided to purchase another unit for our second vacation/winter home. Instead of taking my big unit from  home back and forth. Why not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new complete unit with the sonic toothbrush is truly COMPLETE. Now I do not have to get out my sonic toothbrush....the toothbrush is now right there&lt;br /&gt;next to my water flosser unit.....ALL IN ONE. Making it so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of purchasing  a Waterpik  water flosser. ...this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem is the fact that the cord is not long&lt;br /&gt;enough for me. So have to connect to short extension cord.  As I  am left-handed and my outlet  is on the right side of the sink. ( It does not help  that&lt;br /&gt; I have a larger counter).</li>
            <li> The waterpik It really eliminates plaque! Easier than flossing and fun to use. The brush makes teeth squeaky clean. You can buy one and get different brush and pik heads for each family member. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Only drawback: cannot buy replacement heads in any local stores. Online ones are $20 for 3. End price is kinda high for the brush. BUT FLOSSER IS AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this item.  My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I like the product.  I had to hunt for a good price on replacement heads and then the price went up the next time I ordered.  But still worth it and my hygenist always generates favorable remarks and asks me about the WPik.  I use about 25% HPeroxide mix.</li>
            <li> yes, very happy with the water pik.</li>
            <li> While bulky on the bathroom counter, it performs very well. It is well worth the price. It was also received on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I have been using the flossing stick for years, in combination with the Oral B brush forever.  But I was losing the fight on gum disease.  No matter how hard I tried, I continue to get worse with each check up.  So the dental hygenist suggested i try the Water Pik.  Yes, I made a mess the first day shooting water all over the mirror.  Who would have thought that a jet of water could be that strong and effective in cleaning down below the gum line.  About day 3 to day 4 I noticed that my troubled tooth that I wanted to have extracted did not swell anymore around the gum.  It appears to be healthier because I was able to wash away the gunk deep in the gum line.  I would not dare set the setting to maximum, as 6 is all it takes to get all the gunk out of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the toothbrush is incredible.  I did not know that  a brush can be that effective in cleansing my teeth.  My reference is my Oral B rotating brush experience.  It is hard to describe the feeling, but the ultrasonic vibration makes my teeth feel as clean as after a dental hygiene cleaning session.  It is well worth the money.  Sad I did not know about this many years ago.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after using this product vs. a regular toothbrush. I&#x27;m not sure how effective the water flosser is as my hygenist said you really need the mechanical action of  normal floss to remove plaque. I have had it for about 2 months - no problems so far. The storage area for tips is nice and the water canister holds plenty of water without needing to refill it.</li>
            <li> Concerning return of Waterpik WP900&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised I find it incomprehensible anyone would send me an appliance which cannot work here as it has the wrong voltage.&lt;br /&gt;I would like a replacement of a usable Waterpik of 240 volt function or if this is not possible then a refund.&lt;br /&gt;There was no mention in the user guide not to be used in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;So why was it sold here?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmen Chester  17th July 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  Packed up appliance to return but Big But  $56.00 postage&lt;br /&gt;So I left P.O. with the box. What to do????? I am only wanting a Appliance I can use. And now I could be out of pocket $140.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Happy not what i would expect from Amazon</li>
            <li> A powerful sonic brush without the jackhammer feel that some have.  It does a great job, and holds a charge beautifully.  I love this!</li>
            <li> I chose this waterpik because of the value and convenience of having a toothbrush and flosser in one unit. It works great, makes your teeth feel like you have had a professional cleaning and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I went from gum disease to healthy gums between dentist visits. It is a good feeling knowing that that this machine works. The only problem that I have is a too small of a bathroom to house the unit. So I moved it to the kitchen because it is worth it. People from big cities will understand the bathroom issues.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has two speeds. I use the high speed and my teeth are sensitive and I have no pain. I like that it comes with a small and large brush for the toothbrush. Multiple heads for the water pick and you can get great pressure out of all of them. Had to dial the pressure setting down. Not much setup at all and was ready to go in a minute!</li>
            <li> There was buy Waterpik WP-900 Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush Complete Care&lt;br /&gt;When Bualha Baltea burnt electrical device knowing that I have the power of electricity is 220 volts&lt;br /&gt;It does not deviate on the device for the electric power please explain wattage of the device and the second device will ask first&lt;br /&gt;Vaghtkd he was burned because of the increased wattage and I hope the price Mraati Is there a direct shipping to Saudi Arabia</li>
            <li> I was amazed at what came out from between my teeth after a through 2 minute brushing. The water flossed removed many small particles of food and debris that were left by brushing. My mouth feels cleaner, gums healthier and&lt;br /&gt;I am sure my breath smells better.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Three words....I love it!!!!!!!  I have been a Waterpik customer for years, and even though by old unit worked well, I decided to replace it with the Waterpik complete care unit.  My teeth and gums feel extremely clean and refreshed, actually better than a professional cleaning..  I was happy about my decision to upgrade.  Great product!</li>
            <li> teeth feel like you just left the dentist office. really gets into those hard to get places and I don&#x27;t have to mess around with floss anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik WP-900 for about a month now and I am glad that I purchased it. I primarily purchased it for the Waterpik flosser since I didn&#x27;t really have much faith in the sonic toothbrush (my last sonic toothbrush was a Sonicare), but was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonic toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The toothbrush itself has two settings: one sensitive teeth and non-sensitive teeth. Once the on button is pressed, you get the sensitive setting first and then the normal setting (something I wasn&#x27;t aware of until I tried turning off the toothbrush). It is very effective in giving you a thorough cleaning and knocks out any annoying pieces of food still lodged between teeth with ease. Waterpik&#x27;s sonic toothbrush also comes with two brush heads: a normal one and one for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The toothbrush can be a bit loud when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Be careful where you point the thing! I&#x27;ve had to wipe away toothpaste from my mirrors frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flosser&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I haven&#x27;t had the super clean, just-got-out-of-a-professional-dental-cleaning feeling outside of my visits to my dentist until I purchased the flosser. The flosser comes with several attachments that range from general cleaning to specialized attachments made for those with braces. However, the one that I always use is the general cleaning one and it gets the job done nicely. There is a knob that allows the user to control the pressure of the water which allows those who would prefer a gentler clean the option to have one.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The flosser can get really loud which makes it really annoying to significant others/roommates. The sound that the flosser emits is very similar to one of a more quiet jackhammer once its on. Also, be sure to make use of the button which stops the water from flowing out; You can easily turn a dry bathroom into a water park if you don&#x27;t use it. (Okay, maybe not a water park but definitely an aquatic mess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: The reservoir is taken out by lifting the lidand then pulling it out (took me a while so I hope this saves you the wondering). Also, putting a bit of listerine in the water of the reservoir gives you some extra added freshness (;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas  &amp; he periodically walks by me &amp; says &amp;#34;have I told you how much I like my Waterpik&amp;#34;  ,this is high praise indeed. Arrived and packaged as advertised by company. This is a great product. I Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The water flosser is very stronger and smooth level to adjust for the pressure. it is good work to clean the tooth pitch. The brush is well use for 1st level. but 2nd level seems much stronger for me. anyway, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results. It is easy to use and cleans our teeth the way we like. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Well, it is quite nice. I would like a larger reservoir, but at that point, we might as well have a gallon jug connected to it. I really like the power process for the toothbrush that is very nifty.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Works great both, Toothbrush and Flosser.</li>
            <li> Replaced  worn out electric toothbrush and a noisy water pic. Love that this takes up so much less space.  Does the job.  See what my dentist says when I return.  She always asks what I am using to take care of my teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> Had another brand sonic toothbrush plus a waterpik.  Consolidated both functions in the WP-900.  Works very well.  Be aware that many bathroom outlets on older homes are switched so the unit wont charge.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my peridontist.  Don&#x27;t want to have to go through that again!  Works well and comes with a good selction of tips.  Also provided a credit to buy additional tips.</li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpik toothbrush and water floss for six months now. This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level. Happiest moment during flossing is when I see food debris dropping on the sink. My dentist approves.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the sonic toothbrush, but when I tried to return I was told it was too late.</li>
            <li> The handle hose was broken soon after use. I tried to bend it and found it is fragile like a wood stick. I have to pay $17 to buy a replacement</li>
            <li> Love it! This system is great! So many attachments for the waterpik for whatever your needs are as well as two tooth brush heads that are different sizes. There is a great compartment to hold the extra waterpik and toothbrush heads. The unit also charges the toothbrush. The toothbrush is great. It pulses every 30 seconds for two minutes to make sure you brush your teeth for the right about of time, 30 seconds for each quadrant. The waterpik is also great! Although water flossing is great and feels really clean you should still floss regularly as well. As my dentist told me using a waterpik on your teeth is like standing 20 feet from your car and spraying it with a hose to get the dirt off; where as flossing regularly is like scrubbing the car with a sponge. lol</li>
            <li> great water pick, AAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++</li>
            <li> wonderful product, wish I had bought it years ago.  Am thinking to purchase for my grandchildren who are in braces.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very well, toothbrush has two speeds and the higher speed is a bit noisy but this is a small price to pay for a system that works as well as it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;s nice to have them together</li>
            <li> Stopped working after couple of months</li>
            <li> Works like it should, so far so good</li>
            <li> Excellent flosser for keeping your teeth clean.  Easy to use and very quiet.  Comes with a toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing pik. Amazing tooth brush. It looks like a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had and the water pic is amazing for flossing! I even put a little mouth wash in the reservoir and it&#x27;s so great!</li>
            <li> Good power. Good power level adjustment. Toothbrush has two levels and a timer. Really gets my teeth dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very easy to use. I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this Waterpik. It does make noise but NOT annoying or too loud. It has to it has a motor. I do NOT have a problem as others mentioned with the on/off button being on the machine rather than the pik handle. I haven&#x27;t tried the specialty piks yet.  I eat a lot of Chia seeds and fruit like raspberries and strawberries. This Waterpik is great for getting rid of the small seeds. I also have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth ( very difficult to floss with string) super easy with this Waterpik. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great combination dental appliance, 2 in 2, sharing one outlet with all the best of Waterpik I&#x27;ve used over the years, coupled with an electric toothbrush which I found OK but required getting used to.</li>
            <li> this item thoroughly cleans and does the best job you could ever want. It leaves my mouth feeling as if i just left the dentists office. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist. My hygienists and I love this combination and recommend it to all of our patients. The price is ridiculously low compared to the other popular sonic brush and I like this brush much better. The water flosser is great too, very powerful and effective at reducing gum inflammation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.....I wanted this 10 years ago.....been using flossers, BUT this it the BEST and quickest way to clean food out of your teeth and the electronic brush....so much easier than standard tooth brushes....and a quality job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item May 27, 2014.  On July 3, 2014 a few days after the Amazon return window closed, the Sonic toothbrush stopped working.  Not sure where to go from here.  Hopefully, Sonic has a warranty period for the toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  Contacted Waterpik support.  I was told that the reason this device would not work in my bathroom was that it needed to be attached to a outlet that either had a surge protector on it OR contrary to expectation was more than the standard 15 amp outlet.  However, the device worked OK in the living room!  The reason for this was that this device has \\&quot;fluctuating\\&quot; current and can trip a GSI.  I have a GSI in the bathroom and reset it when the Waterpik did not work.  The same support guy told me that I had 90 days to return things to Amazon.  I was also informed of the option of returning it to Waterpik and \\&quot;starting the return process.\\&quot;  Haven&#x27;t decided what to do yet or what to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More later.</li>
            <li> It is working just fine my dentist checked out and I  doing very well</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is not good as Oral-B&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> What a great machine.  It is powerful and easy to use.  Great to have everything in one place, plus it looks nice in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> loved mine so much  i bought one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Both tooth brush and water Flosser works great. It keeps my tooth smooth and clean, and Flosser cleans my gum healthy.  I should buy this earlier.</li>
            <li> I just wish the toothbrush bristles were more firm.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a waterpick/sonic toothbrush combo. takes up a lot less room than having a separate waterpik and rechargeable toothbrush. toothbrush is great. waterpik works very well. need to see if there is a round replacement brush for the toothbrush. Overall a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of electric toothbrushes and water flossers with varying success. This unit is well made, easy to use, takes up little counter space, has good power on the flosser. Excellent price. Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is just what my dentist ordered!  and I can fell how it is working for me.  Anyone have problems reaching those rear teeth...get this</li>
            <li> Works great, but the toothbrush charging base stopped working after 2 or 3 uses. I tested my toothbrush on a friend&#x27;s waterpik charger and my toothbrush still charges up fine, so I know it is the charging base that is faulty. I am outside of Amazon&#x27;s return window, so I contacted the manufacturer. They are sending me a new toothbrush with a charging base and are not asking me to send anything back to them. This means I&#x27;ll now have two toothbrushes, but will need extra counter space and another electrical outlet if I want to be able to charge the toothbrush and keep using the Waterpik. Since the Waterpik is so big, I&#x27;ll probably just be putting it in the closet and using my toothbrush and go back regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I asked my dentist if a Waterpik replaces floss and she told me that Waterpiks are beneficial to oral health, but should be used in conjunction with floss, not completely replacing floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the charger base not stopped working, I would have given this item 5 stars, even though it does take up a lot of counter space. The manufacturer was easy to work with, but I am surprised they would rather send a new (different) replacement product than fix the one with the problem.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It works really well and my mouth feels a ton cleaner after each use. Its been 6 months and everythings great.</li>
            <li> Very good use., I feel clean throughout the mouth. Never seen anything like it before. It&#x27;s great. I love it and will tell my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> After being encouraged by my brilliant ENT to get a Waterpik, I learned to irrigate my oral cavity with 16 ounces of water every morning without gagging. After that major accomplishment, I upgraded from a basic Waterpik to this combo unit with a sonic toothbrush. I have now adapted to placing a space-age toothbrush in my mouth that creates abnormal brain waves if allowed to rattle against my epiglottis, but removes all matter of plaque, uncleanness, and has brightened my teeth while still offering the tried and true water flossing and tonsil cleaning of a classic Waterpik.  Turn the toothbrush power switch on before placing it in your mouth, results of brain-banging are greatly reduced. Lovely. Clean. An OCD&#x27;s dream of oral hygiene, realized!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush will really clean your teeth. its quite different than those cheap ones you buy...this far exceeded my expectations..</li>
            <li> Wish I used it the first 50 years, I might have saved a tooth and the pain that went with that loss.</li>
            <li> Used it and afterwards my teeth felt clean not as good as dentist clean but clean enough that I feel my dental situation will improve.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik  I purchased was recommended by my dentist this the first one for me&lt;br /&gt;it was not hard to set up or use mine came with a sonic tooth brush a little weared but&lt;br /&gt;it works well I would recommend this to any one who needs one thank you.</li>
            <li> So it lost a star because of the holding clamp for the flosser water jet. It just does not hold the handle in place securely and if you move the unit it falls out . No big deal but could have been made to hold it better.&lt;br /&gt; The flosser has plenty of power . Cleans between teeth very well . It has a button on handle for stopping the spray temporarily if needed.&lt;br /&gt; The tooth brush is great . two power settings . High is very strong . Pauses for a second to let you know when it is time to move brush to a different quadrant of teeth  . When all four quadrants are done it shuts off automatically . 2 minutes brushing as recommended .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say buy one . It does the job.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The water pressure is awesome, but that also means that you have a lot of splatter. You get used to it after a while and learn how to use it without making a mess. You will be amazed at how much stuff comes out of your mouth. My dentist recommended the product. Good deal.</li>
            <li> We love the Waterpik.  Wish we would have gotten it a long time ago.  Best investment we have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> the best! great value.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to set up and so easy to use.  I bought this for my daughter when she had her braces put on.  It is easier to use a water flosser than trying to thread regular flosser through the braces.  She loves the toothbrush and likes how you can change the speed on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s my first one, and it&#x27;s so easy.  It takes up less on the sink thank I thought it would.  The attachments to the pik and the brush slip easily on and off, and the brush has a two speed function.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this unit.  My previous Waterpik died after years of use and I was thrilled to get this unit, with the addition of the toothbrush feature, in a very timely manner.  I really enjoy the clean feeling-just like a professional cleaning- that this unit provides.</li>
            <li> Great to have these two items combined.  Saves counter space!</li>
            <li> It is the best I ever had - one item on counter with two uses and they both work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 days and I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I lived without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik: The waterpik flosser is fantastic. I read some reviews about people having a hard time with getting the hang of using it without getting water everywhere but I have had a very easy time with it thus far, aside from the first time I turned it on and realized it should already be in your mouth when you hit on. ;) Although I do like to turn it on 1 facing down into the sink for a few seconds prior to use so that it clears all of the water that may have been sitting in the tubes from the previous use. I would suggest starting with the setting in 1 and working your way up to what pressure is comfortable for you, I have found that 4 is a nice pressure for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush: Wow, this toothbrush is fantastic and conveniently times 30 second intervals and shuts off after 2 minutes to ensure you pay proper attention to each area of your mouth and don&#x27;t fall short of your 2 minute brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist after each use. My teeth feel so nice I find myself constantly running my tongue over them. After just 4 days of using this product I can already see improvements in my teeth and gums. I have also noticed that my breath is staying fresher longer. I used to find myself feeling very self conscious about my breath by the end of the work day because I could feel a funny taste in my mouth and knew I needed to brush, now my breath stays fresh so much longer! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone, I feel it was a great purchase. This is also a great deal, the waterpik WITHOUT the toothbrush is in my local grocery store for $59.99 and the toothbrush on its own will run $89.99 so don&#x27;t pass this deal up!</li>
            <li> Great price for this product, brush and flosser combo.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Love the timer feature on the toothbrush. A little loud for the water pik but it&#x27;s my first one so not sure if they&#x27;re all like that. Totally recommend this set up.</li>
            <li> I do not like this toothbrush at all. Going from a Braun electric round to this sonic tooth brush is such a disappointment. The toothbrush vibrates and has a high speed or low speed. The low speed is completely pointless - I could do better with a manual toothbrush and the high speed is a bit scary. And no matter how long or thorough I brush, I still don&#x27;t get the same clean feel as with my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Braun made a combo. Oh well, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! It works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fanatic for keeping my teeth clean.  This Waterpik does the job and so easily!</li>
            <li> ARRIVE ON TIME WAS WHAT I WAT TO RECEIVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and love it.  I previously had a cheep electric toothbrush and a travel sized Waterpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush does a great job and is quite comfortable on the gums. Far better than my old standard electric that always felt like it was assaulting my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik flosser is very nice.  I haven&#x27;t tried all the attachments yet but the ones I have tried work well.  I&#x27;ve found the reservoir to be just the right size for a cleaning of the whole mouth without needing refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush is a bit loud but I imagine that&#x27;s to be expected for a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the flosser attachment holder had a spot to store the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;The tongue cleaning attachment (not included) would have been more useful than some of the attachments that were included.</li>
            <li> Love it! My boyfriend has started stealing the use of it recently, too. I highly suggest this item for those who have difficulty regularly flossing like I do. Since I&#x27;ve started using it my dentist has stopped lecturing me as much about daily flossing and has toned it down to &amp;#34;just floss at least twice a week while you use the waterpik&amp;#34;. Which is great!</li>
            <li> cleaning my teeth has never been easier. it takes a while to get used to it. I particularly like the adjustment of water pressure, and the two speeds of the brush.</li>
            <li> PROS: Is nice to have waterpik and toothbrush in one unit. Was worried about counter space but did not take up much. The sonic motion of the toothbrush sometimes helps break free congestion in my sinus as I brush and the adjustable rate of the waterpik was nice after periodontal surgery. The battery holds a charge rather long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The waterpik leaks out the whole water bin if the handle pops out of its cradle. The cradle for the handle is just a cheap tapered piece of plastic to cup around the body of the waterpik. The button now sticks on the waterpik, so if I need to stop water flow I have to use the power switch. If you have the adaptors lid open and go to open the reservoir lid, the stand pops out the adaptor container. Water level markings are inside the reservoir, not out side where you see 90% of the time. The cord to the waterpik does not wrap up nicely back into the base, most times.</li>
            <li> Exellent..I feel my tooth becoming more strong..thank you</li>
            <li> While the product package mentions the following clearly&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the Box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Complete Care Combination Water Flosser + Sonic Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;  1 Classic Jet Tip - For general cleaning&lt;br /&gt;  1 Plaque Seeker Tip - For implants, crowns, and bridges&lt;br /&gt;  1 Orthodontic Tip - For braces and orthodontics&lt;br /&gt;  1 Pik Pocket Tip - For gentle, low-pressure delivery of antimicrobial rinses&lt;br /&gt;  1 Standard Sonic Toothbrush Head - Gently target hard-to-reach areas&lt;br /&gt;  1 Compact Sonic Toothbrush Head - Excellent access for precision cleaning&lt;br /&gt;  1 Premium Sonic Toothbrush Travel Case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the pack with no floss tips as well as no brush head. As one can imagine the product is useless without these. After contacting customer service I&#x27;ve been given only one option get a 20% refund. However when you buy the tips and head separately there is quite some gap in the price (in additon to exchange rate, excise duty etc. since I am an non-US customer). In effect I am paying shipping and excise duty twice for the same parts which is completely unjustified. Why will the customer bear the price of this kind of a mistake in shipping?</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  My mouth only feels this clean after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist.  easy to use, variety of picks to work with.  compact, it all fits on the bathroom counter.  can dial the intensity.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he is very pleased with it. He uses both the toothbrush and the flosser and still comments on how clean his teeth feel now.</li>
            <li> here I thought it was the lame gift, but it&#x27;s been his favorite!&lt;br /&gt;he has thanked me more for it than the ipad mini LOL</li>
            <li> I am old, the periodontist&#x27;s dental hygienist told me to get on if I wished to save my molars--having just spent a vast sum for a tooth implant I heeded her warning. The Waterpik and sonic tooth brush give you the super clean feeling of a professional cleaning without the bleeding gums--get one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING!  I have used sonicare for years...about 9 years.  In that time I have bought two separate brushes ($$$).  This waterpik is amazing.  Yes, at first, I will admit getting used to barely on or turbo brush was a little much...but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me on high at all.  Make the jump to waterpik, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> This a must for those who floss and of course brush on a regular basis. It is compact enough to take up less space on a small bathroom sink, everything is attached and at hand and ready to use at all times. I love it and will be getting one for my husband for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I like the brush most!!! really wonderful~~  but the Water Flosser just a little bit big to my little room space  !!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Waterpik WP-900 Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;and feel that I got a great deal for my money thru Amazon</li>
            <li> This thing is a miracle machine and I don&#x27;t know why I never tried one before!! I have very tender gums and also havea hard time flossing with Floss but this this works wonders. I am almost addicted to it. It makes my mouth feel so clean... And my teeth look better too. I will never be without one again. I am age 59..h ave no fillings and only 4 teeth pulled over my lifetime.  I plan on making my teeth last my lifetime and this will definitely help make that happen.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Waterpik Ccomplete Care Water Flosser and sonic. Water Plk  I have been wanting this item for a long time.</li>
            <li> solid for the price. very nice.</li>
            <li> I was told at my dentist office to get a water pik, and saw this one came with the sonic toothbrush.  Both work so far but I&#x27;ve only been using them for a short time.  My gums look great, almost as good as going for a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my mouth so fresh and so clean with almost no effort...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you want to reduce your &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; in your bathroom, this does the trick.  The toothbrush is as good as any sonic type toothbrush (if not better), and the waterpik holds plenty of water..  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. My teeth felt like I had just had them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I got braces at 47 and this is a must have. I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> great product, do the job, I will recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works great, just as expected. I especially like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the Waterpik.  The tooth brush really cleans my teeth.  The feel so smooth and whiter.  The Water Flosser works great!  Really cleans my teeth after brushing it continues to clean my teeth and is great for my gums  I would recommend this to anyone. Especially for children who do not brush their teeth properly, the Water Flosser gets what they miss</li>
            <li> Great product.. Have one, buying two more for my sons.</li>
            <li> Compact and works like a dream</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my unit and depended on it to get my teeth their cleanest. I did, however, expect it to last for a couple of years (mine died at 10 months). One could argue that I \\&quot;got my money&#x27;s worth\\&quot;, but for the price it would be like tossing out a vacuum cleaner every 10 months. Not acceptable in my book.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my son who just got his braces on!!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this 2 weeks ago &amp; I used this only once and the darn thing nearly blew up! Scary!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed with keeping my teeth clean, so I was a little leery about this combo living up to the hype; but, I have to say, I LOVE both the flosser and the toothbrush (this was my first experience with a waterpik).  The waterpik has several settings of pressure, which is great for cleaning different areas of your mouth and seems to do a great job at removing built-up plaque.  In fact, after I had been using it for about a week, I went to visit my sister out of state and almost as soon as she saw me she asked if I had gotten gum contouring done :).  The toothbrush has two settings and the higher setting really does an awesome job - the most thorough brushing job I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  I would highly recommend this product!  (Expect to get water all over you and your bathroom until you get the hang of using the waterpik :))</li>
            <li> A wonderfully compact and efficient health care product. Because tooth care affects my whole health I decided to stop with the piecemeal gadgets and I am so glad I did. The toothbrush timer tells me when to switch surfaces, and the waterpic has a variety of heads and lots of different water pressures to make it work just the way +you+ like. I am so glad I invested in this economical and neat gadget. Makes things so pleasant!</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested me to purchase this device!!! I use it daily.  It does exactly what it is expected!  I purchased this device because it came with 5 tips and a toothbrush.  The toothbrush pauses after 30 seconds as a prompt for the brusher to changed to the next side of the mouth.  Great way to continue brushing for 2 minutes. It also came with a toothbrush travel case!  I would definitely recommend this product to friends!</li>
            <li> Good product! Very good quality</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first got it, but it has two speeds and the fastest one has quit working. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not convinced the water flosser actually does much for me, but the toothbrush is okay. I don&#x27;t like the design for the storage compartment-- if it&#x27;s on your counter, those things aren&#x27;t going to stay clean. Overall, kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. It comes with multiple heads for the irrigator, &amp; extra head for toothbrush. Works great! Go slowly till you are accustomed to irrigation force &amp; learn to position yourself over basin.  I am certain this will make a difference in oral health with timed brushing cycles &amp;  stimulation of gums.  Please be aware that it does not replace flossing. To mechanically remove plaque from sides of teeth, you still must floss.</li>
            <li> if you had brace, buy this  work very well for my wife</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no charger for the toothbrush....and there&#x27;s no damn notice telling me that I need to buy a charger or I can only watch watch my &amp;50 toothbrush die there</li>
            <li> Great product it does make a mess with the water but other than that it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> Waterpic flosser is easy to use and leaves your teeth and gums free of annoying food particles that can get caught between teeth.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about the quality at first - I had seen mixed reviews and it felt so light weight. The one thing I will say is, I wish that the tip holding area was a bit larger, I really had to cram to get all of mine to go in, but they are safely inside now. The hot button stop on the pik is amazing. No more getting water and mouth wash all over everything, as I can control when it&#x27;s coming out much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product , I have been using it daily for the last 3 months. Initially I was a bit foxed about the wireless charging on the dock but the Amazon forum helped. Highly recommended and great value for the flosser as well as the toothbrush. The toothbrush travelling case us can added bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this water flosser.</li>
            <li> I still have all four of my wisdom teeth but they are tough to floss and brush. I was surprised and disgusted by the food particles it washed out from between my teeth AFTER I had already brushed them.  I found that using warm water to fill the reservoir works best for me.</li>
            <li> Functional, but clumsy to clean &amp; dust</li>
            <li> I certainly hope this investment pays off at my next check-up; it certainly makes my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> It worked fine  for only 2 weeks, after this time it started to clatter and now  it almost doesnt work........Unfornately, I am from EU, so returning will be more expensive than another new Water Flosser...... It is the last time I have buyed Waterpik or bought  something in USA...</li>
            <li> Really like the double treatment of flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Both the flosses and toothbrush are great and it&#x27;s worth it to buy! I recommend this product</li>
            <li> space saving.  Charges quickly .  available pieces.  waterpik has a lot of pressure.  works perfectly.  would totally recommend.  thinking about getting a second one</li>
            <li> When it arrived the tooth brush was broken, I had to call the Manufacturer to get it replaced. After using it since it arrived I really like it. But just should have gone to Walmart.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it. Wish I had it thirty years ago! Would highly recommend it to anyone who values their teeth!</li>
            <li> This is my second  water pix.  This product cannot be beat for the mouth hygiene. I t works well for denture wearers also.</li>
            <li> My hygienist suggested quite a while ago that I get a Waterpik, since flossing wasn&#x27;t my strong suit. I realize now I put it off much too long. And the fact this includes a sonic toothbrush has made a difference too. My teeth feel smooth, like I just had them professionally cleaned. And I no longer  feel that tartar buildup in those hard to reach areas. Thanks to another reviewer, I started slow with the water flow, so I didn&#x27;t have water splashed all over the mirror. I know I put off this purchase because I feared I wouldn&#x27;t use it. Now I know I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it. I checked my local stores before purchasing here, and this was the best price.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and I&#x27;ve only used it once but I am really impressed with the quality of this product. The waterpik is forceful but can be turned down, which I love. The electric toothbrush was ready immediately and I love not having to wait for it to charge. My mouth felt fresh as if I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend to anyone. The flossing pik is very effective and my teeth feel very clean after using it. It has timer so you know how long you should brush on each side. great product.</li>
            <li> Waterpic doesn&#x27;t work very good</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 months ago and worked great, till the toothbrush stopped recharging once on its stand.</li>
            <li> use the flosser everyday and I like the toothbrush also.</li>
            <li> The quality is a little below what it was twenty years ago but the added brush heads have made the difference. It&#x27;s also a little smaller as a unit which makes it fit better on the limited space of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! received on time ... i would recommend</li>
            <li> Works great. My teeth were cleaner after the first use. Love the combo of irrigater and sonic toothbrush in one.</li>
            <li> OMG this this is amazing ....what a powerful toothbrush and the water flossing is bomb! ....Whats really cool is the toothbrush pauses for a second to let you know its time to move to the next section to complete a 2 min brushing time :) EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THESE!</li>
            <li> I love water picks and this is the worst I have ever bought. It worked a handful of times and then stopped working. Everything on this feels cheap and  not at all sturdy. I do not recommend anyone buy&#x27;s this pick.</li>
            <li> I have never had a water flosser before but it&#x27;s a must have for someone with braces.  It really cleans in between teeth.  I also have no problems with the tooth brush.  It has two speeds.  My only change would be to add an off between the two different speeds.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Brush your teeth. You think that&#x27;s great then use the waterpik and check out what comes out of your teeth. Totally happy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this product. I went to the dentist and he told me my gums needed to be cared for better and suggested I get a vibrating toothbrush and water pick. This product has so many different kinds of interchangeable heads to fit whatever gum/tooth cleanup need you have. After I used it one time my mouth had never felt cleaner. My boyfriend used it too and he said the same thing. I can&#x27;t wait to get back to my dentist and tell him that I&#x27;m on my way to a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how in the 21st century this product has not yet a universal transformer 120-240 V!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unbelievable how in the 21st century the manufacturer of this product does not warn consumers about this fact with big orange labels &amp;#34;127 V only&amp;#34; glued to the power cord!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In South America, the named third world, it&#x27;s mandatory by law!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unbelievable that in the 21st century the manufacturer of this product does not consider the limitations of the sick and elderly people:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inscription saying &amp;#34;127 V&amp;#34; is only written at the bottom of the box and in almost microscopic caracters!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to limitations of vision and patience, I just found the tiny inscription 127 V after burning the product in a 220 V power line!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If the product does not have a big orange warning about specific voltage, then it should be 120-240&amp;#34;, I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unbelievable how a website with global reach does not alert to this fact in the product description!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star only because zero stars is not possible!</li>
            <li> Great so far.  Should use a softer plastic on the cord to the pic.  Otherwise a great product.  Feels great to have clean teeth again.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  First one at Best Buy leaked immediately.  2d one did not leak but had no power.  Will the third be the charm?  Bad quality control.</li>
            <li> Great, from a LONG-TIME Waterpik and Sonic Toothbrush user.  I have a small area for my bathroom appliances, and this combo with 2 appliances and only one cord is really appreciated.  Both utensils have been upgraded and are much improved.  I get raves from the Dental Hygienists for cleanliness.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Toothbrush works great and has two settings. It has a timer that tells you when to switch to the next quadrant then automatically shuts off. If you do not enjoy flossing with string then the waterpik is excellent as it does the same job using water. It has variable force settings from light to hard. Start off at light and work your way up. I have been using waterpik products for 30 years and my dentists always compliment me on my great teeth.</li>
            <li> Work well.  The set is up is for only one person.  There is no storage for the tooth brushes and nothing for additional users.</li>
            <li> I asked my hubby for electric toothbrush for Christmas and he got me this. I was a bit disappointed initially and wondered what I&#x27;m going to do with such a bulky toothbrushing set. All these feelings were gone after the first time I used it. The electric toothbrush is good, nothing our of the ordinary, just does its job. It buzes at certain time intervals to tell you it has been 2 minutes. The flosser part is wonderful. I never thought I would say this, but I&#x27;m actually enjoying flossing my teeth. You would be amazed how much stuff stays between your teeth after brushing (and you see it all in the sink when you spit out the water). You can adjust the pressure to a level comfortable to you and with a variety of heads it comes with, you will find something for you. No more dealing with dent floss or floss picks.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have about this is that it is a bit loud, a bit more than most electric toothbrushes (the flosser part is loud) so your sleeping mate might not appreciate the wake-up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this water flosser and sonic toothbrush. To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference between this waterpik flosser and the waterpik I had been using for years. It does have a few different tips to use, but all in all to me it basically does the same thing as the older model--remove whatever food particles are stuck between your teeth. I do like the fact that the whole setup is in one place which makes it very convenient to use. I don&#x27;t have much room on my sink either, but I don&#x27;t think that it takes up that much room. When I went to the dentist last week for a cleaning the hygienist commented &amp;#34;you certainly don&#x27;t leave much for me to clean, do you?&amp;#34; I was glad that she said that because it proves to me that this flosser and toothbrush are doing what they claimed to do. I would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best water flosser we have ever used.  Combined with the sonic toothbrush, the unit does a fantastic job.  Holds a charge longer than most.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this product.  The water flosser aspect is very good for problem areas (bridges, etc.) and does a great job.  The sonic toothbrush was recommended by our dentist, not only for the teeth, but for the gums and bone.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk, and in my opinion, a complete waste of money. Contacted WaterPic and received a return authorization, but decided not to waste any more time with this company or their products. Mine will go in the trash today!</li>
            <li> Very pleased except the flossing tool should better store on the unit. This unit is 5 star but the friction storage clip needs improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient with both the water pik and sonar toothbrush all in one.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this, it was listed as being made in USA, it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s made in China, I would have given it five stars if not for this.  The brush is kind of big and the travel case is huge,  but I really like that it has one.  I previously had a Phillips sonicare that was much smaller and worked great for five years until the battery died.  I like the brush design on this more, the spread out bristles do a much better job of getting along the gum line, the sonicare did a really good job on what it reached, but wasn&#x27;t very flexible to get between teeth.  The water flosser takes a little to get used to, but works great, I like putting some mouthwash in the water, it cleans better and keeps the water fresh.  My only complaint is that the reservoir is a little inconvenient to refill I have to keep a cup to do that, and the on/off switch could be a little more one-handed friendly.  Overall really like it, much better than flossing.</li>
            <li> a little bit too noisy when it works.. but it&#x27;s good at cleaning and now i&#x27;m fond of brushing my teeth.. lol..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt my teeth so clean before !!! Must have</li>
            <li> The all-in one system is convenient and one less item to plug into the outlet with the Sonic Toothbrush charger attached. However, the Sonic Toothbrush is no where near as nice as the Phillips Sonicare brush I replaced with this unit.  The two speeds provided are inadequate for my need - the low is so low, I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are being cleaned, and the fast is so jarring it feels like I might be doing damage. Disappointed but stuck.</li>
            <li> its good and multi choice for cleaning tooth</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I love having the toothbrush and waterpick in one. It&#x27;s just one unit on my counter. It works great. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the water pick</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for keeping your teeth free of yesterday&#x27;s meals.  No matter how much I brush and floss, this thing can always find more to root out of the gaps between my teeth and gums, and my dentist says that my oral hygiene has improved a lot since I started using this.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it! For less than the cost of replacing a severely broken Sonicare brush handle, I got a complete water flossing and sonic toothbrush kit.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love that it comes with portable,  rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner than when using an electric (non sonic) Oral B.  I put a little Hydrogen Peroxide in the water basin and my teeth are not only smooth but whiter.  I like the timer that goes off every 20 seconds on the toothbrush.  I like the adjustable water pressure on the water flosser.  It leaked once.  After that I simply make sure that the water pick hose is empty when I&#x27;m done.  I leave the hose in the sink.  Any water will drain into the sink.  No more leaking problems.  Update:  The toothbrush would not hold a charge.  I thought my unit was out of warranty.  Called customer service and they asked me to read the serial number on the bottom of the unit.  Well... I was in the last month of my warranty period.  They are going to send me a new unit.   I am very happy.   No arguments or pleas needed.  Customer service was very polite and accommodating.</li>
            <li> i like it. be careful strong water flow~</li>
            <li> I like the combo system for brushing and flossing. This is a perfect addition to my bathroom for dental care.</li>
            <li> It works.... but its annoying, hence only 3 starts. When I say annoying, I mean you really have to be careful when using it otherwise its just going to spray all over your mirror. Otherwise, it does what it does well.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as advertised. So far it works really well. Far better than i expected it to. And now i actually feel to brush and floss because when I&#x27;m done i can actually feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes your mouth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended getting a water flosser and electric toothbrush to help with gum issues with my teeth.  After using as instructed twice a day for three months with regular flossing and seeing my dentist for a follow up visit, I can say that the report came back excellent.  My gums are in much better shape than they were three months ago.  The product has all the pieces needed and makes for easy storage. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just as described.  Good to have the tooth brush incorporated.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my family member!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Advised by my Dentist, takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and returned it the next day. I think the idea is great (having the tooth brush AND the water dispenser in the same unit) but it was too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing seemed to leak, but maybe that was operator difficulty on my part. All I know is that it was a mess and wires and brushes and water piks were all over my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the idea of the product is excellent but not for me. In fact, I may buy just the water pik dispenser without the brush. It might be less messy.</li>
            <li> Just ordered the WP-900 waterpik water flosser. The flosser is exceedingly convenient and makes the flossing experience quick and less messy, especially when you have braces - just fill up the water tank and floss away. You may have a splatter control problem for the first few flosses :D but should get smoother with time. However, the reason I chose this model(Over WP-660) was also due to the convenient rechargeable brush that comes along with the device. To my surprise, inspite of the &amp;#34;better than sonicare&amp;#34; high and mighty claims on the electric toothbrush, it falls way below par even compared to Oral B Pro-Health Power, hence the product gets a less than 5 star rating (I would still rate the water flosser at 5 stars).</li>
            <li> I like the combination.  Neat on the counter easy to store when guests arrive. I wish there were a small separate travel charger  available the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Its okay. Its extremely loud which loses a star. Also the toothbrush is not rechargeable. Dont get this version. Get the 1 without the toothbrush. This is bad because the toothbrush should be rechargeable instead of just sitting on the thing. It was a good buy but it is loud and annoying. Also the toothbrush took a star</li>
            <li> Makes flossing effortless, and the toothbrush is great. I actually look forward  to brushing now. I dont have anything bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning. Mouth feels like you did something to Save your teeth</li>
            <li> The unit works well, comes supplied with several different tips and two brushes of different sizes. My only complaint is that additional brushes must be purchased separately for other family members.</li>
            <li> Great product. My teeth feel ten times cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> Waterpik as usual is working very well. Sonic tooth brush is a little messy.</li>
            <li> Worked for five weeks. Now the water flosser pause button sticks. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s cheap trash.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews emphasize, the functionality of this device is just awesome -- the water flosser works great and reliably, the toothbrush and accompanying attachments are top notch, and the battery life is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest negative, however, is the sheer size of the unit. I live in a small apartment where sink space is at a premium -- I think this device is worth it, but be warned prior to making the investment.</li>
            <li> This product making brushing and flossing an EPIC experience! My teeth are so clean, gums are healthy and breath is fresh! BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Compact design.  Easy to use.  Storage too.  It is not a chore to use this product.  I love the great results the toothbrush and water flosser combo provides.</li>
            <li> love it ,works great, two in one, is good care for your hygiene. I believe this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> works good just what we needed</li>
            <li> I mean, it seemed good in the first place. then the toothbrush won&#x27;t charge after three months use. Apparently there&#x27;s a quality issue.</li>
            <li> Best way to floss your teeth!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Waterpik. My Sonicare had died, so I bought the Waterpik Complete Care. I like it a lot. Hopefully it will make a difference at the cleanings!</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I had this on my wish list as my current electric tool brush was over 10 year old and I&#x27;ve always struggled with flossing my back teeth that are really close together. And I got it for Christmas!! Issues solved! I&#x27;ve used it for almost a week now and every time I&#x27;m done my teeth feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist. Can&#x27;t wait for my checkup so I can say: YES, I do floss everyday.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Really works.  Wish it were quieter at night so I could use it without waking other up.</li>
            <li> 3 months later, and the toothbrush no longer works. On the face of it, this seems like good value, but the quality is too poor to make it worth buying.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this years ago. I believe it does a very good job of flossing. However, I would not buy the model with the toothbrush. As you may know, there have been marketing wars between the Braun rotary brush and the Sonic Care up and down action brush,such as the water pick has. I know for a fact that Braun is better. I had switched to the brush that came with the water pic when I received it. Occasionally, I fail to brush my teeth often enough, for example, if I am traveling. The back of my upper front teeth felt &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; as if they needed to be brushed. I used the water pic brush and it didn&#x27;t quite make my teeth feel smooth again. I then switched to Braun and it worked much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;Beware! Some &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to do so or because they sell competitive products. Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb. And the biggest of companies have been heavily fined for hiring an army of “reviewers” to review their products.</li>
            <li> This flosser works great, but I must say that this is very rickety and cheap.  As well, I did not receive the tongue attachment.  It also leaks a big puddle underneath the machine every time I use it.  But having said that I do think that this product will increase your dental health, if it holds up and doesn&#x27;t leak too much, that is.</li>
            <li> Works well but messy I don&#x27;t use it before heading out the door unless I put a towel around me.  I have teeth very close together and flossing with string was not working and taking me a long time without great results. Mouth feels a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a pause button on the water flosser!</li>
            <li> overall a pretty good product. The waterpik takes a while gettting use to. The toothbrush is easy to use and effective. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product one star for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(I used this product for two days trying to give it a chance, but it is not good for me)&lt;br /&gt;first, the toothbrush head is very soft and i does not vibrate much. The only thing that vibrates is the handle. the toothbrush has two speeds, on speed one i feel the vibrations of the handle, but still have to perform round movements to brush my teeth (i guess because the head does NOT rotate). On speed two, the vibrations of the handle are so strong that once i even got a nerve twitch in my cheek where the toothbrush touched (god knows what it was but it scared the heck out of me). that has never happened to me before in my 4 year history of using electronic toothbrushes (previous was braun and lasted me for 3,5 years). On speed two the vibrations are very VERY strong. It doesnt feel pleasant to apply the toothbrush head on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the waterflosser does not impress me. I have never had waterflossers before, and it is possible that i had higher expectations.  i have a bridge that needs to be cleaned daily. So, i expected 2 (am + pm) uses a day will keep it somewhat clean. Nope, thats not the case.&lt;br /&gt;overall, my mouth does not feel clean after using this set.&lt;br /&gt; i think ill have to go with a rotating head toothbrush and a simple floss.</li>
            <li> Box was open and obviously repacked. An item I am going to use in my mouth, now come on! Sent back and didn&#x27;t reorder. I have received several repacked/ reused items. This is routinely done at Amazon. It is careless and obvious. I want a new unopened item not someone else&#x27;s reject.</li>
            <li> Never had a water flosser before and I needed a new electronic toothbrush so this ended up being a good buy for me. Flosser takes a little time to get used to it, but I managed to find a technique that works for me after squirting water all over the first few times. Lol.</li>
            <li> After many years of manual brushing, I took the chance on one of those rotary pulsating brushes, Oral B to B exact.  That was my first venture in powered tooth brushing and not my last.  That brush lasted about three years; twelve brush heads and around $120 later, I went into the ultra-sonic field of brushing.  Sonicare was the best brush experience I had to date in my middle aged life.  That brush too lasted around 3 and even possibly 4 years.  Although the replacement brush heads were much more costly than the Oral B ones, and ultamitly the replacement cost of the brush heads is what drove me back to purchase another Oral B rotary type tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Let me say neither of my first two electronic tooth brushes ever quit, or even slow down.  It simply got to the point of replacement heads cost total, matched the total cost of the tooth brush when purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Well I went back to the Oral B simply because I could not bring myself to justify the Sonicare price + the brush head price.&lt;br /&gt;This time, my Oral B stuck around for 6 months.  I simply never felt the same &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling on my teeth as I did with the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;WELCOME WATERPIK&lt;br /&gt;Now here is the Waterpik flosser and sonic tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;In short, I have owned this for 3 months and I will never go back to either Oral B or Sonicare.  The cost for this unit complete is on par with a mid line Sonicare and the Oral B.  However, you also get the water flosser and five floss heads.&lt;br /&gt;Top that with the sonic toothbrush, and 2 brush heads, and you have the perfect combo for a healthy mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can report that may push some away from purchasing this is the sonic brush has two speeds.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the low is too slow and the high is a bit too fast.  However I also feel it does a fantastic job and in my opinion, beats out Sonicare in the tooth cleaning department.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used a sonic toothbrush, this combo is your chance.  Use the low and you are good to go.  Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot. I was skeptical at first because I never actually used a water flosser before and thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be good for me to use but I was taken aback by how good this is. Totally worth the money, you will be using this for a long time. I never had purely white teeth all of my life and after a few months of this, everyone keeps telling me that I have the whitest smile they have every seen for someone who wears braces.</li>
            <li> Does a really good job and everything stores inside the storage compartment. Variable size piks and water pressures. Toothbrush is great too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived well before the estimated delivery date and was just as advertised. I feel like I am getting two dental appliances for the price of one. Oh, and my wife loves it too.</li>
            <li> I love It !!!!  I am thinking of getting one for my other home!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for teeth care!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush (WP-900)&lt;br /&gt;I am in awe. Lets go per degrees. I read all negative reviews before i bought this water flosser. I decided that since the producer offers such great warranty it was worth the risk to get a defective piece. I have been using this machine for 4 days now and so far so good. Every component works fine. I got 2 general use picks and no tongue piece but i dont really care, i rather use the old school toothbrush on the tongue anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I have a severe bone loss and gum disease. So bad every brush was a blood bath, flossing a terrible painful chore, i couldnt eat an apple without bleeding. Hence why i bought this machine on the verge of desperation. I debated if buying the pick only or the brush combo. I dont like electric toothbrushes. My husband does so I bought the combo. I noticed how the combo has a separate tank and a separate compartment where to store the picks, while the waterpick only has a compartment on the lid of the tank for those.. not funny i opted for the combo JUST for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;Reading reviews from others i can clarify few little things:&lt;br /&gt;- i was expecting some huge monster but it is quite compact and will fit in any standard shelf (NOT the med cabinet tho)&lt;br /&gt;- i found easier to use a cup to fill the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;- i plug the machine when i use it and unplug it when i dont so that the toothbrush wont get an overcharge. People complained their toothbrush died after a month or 2 but come on use common sense. Anything left on a charger for too long when the battery is charged will fuse the battery.

            <li> I went to the Waterpik system after using floss all my life.  Floss causes damage if used incorrectly although it does a great job.  The Pik is easy to use but a bit noisy but it seems to do a great job of cleaning out the spaces between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Although the sonic brush that comes with this system seems to work well, I did not like it as I use a different system and could not get used to the sonic brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and works great!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, great, wonderful!  Have used Waterpik for over 40 years. My dentist always comments about how the health of the teeth and gums of his patients who use a Waterpik, on a regular basis, is significantly better than those who don&#x27;t. This combination toothbrush/water pick unit is space saving and works just as well as the original individual units.</li>
            <li> meets all expectations.  Can use instead of floss...doesn&#x27;t take any longer than flossing either.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for two months.  Just went to the dentist and hardly had any plaque to remove.  Ordering one for my husband now.</li>
            <li> Much better than the previous model</li>
            <li> love this thing. wish I had bought one years ago, probably wouldn&#x27;t be having dental surgery very soon...</li>
            <li> You never know how much stuff gets into your teeth.  It cleans food out in the very back of the mouth.  The toothbrush is okay, but the flosser is great.  It amazes me how much the flosser rinses out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt better.</li>
            <li> wonderful! I love it!</li>
            <li> good  machine~!!&lt;br /&gt;nice works  thx~</li>
            <li> my mouth feels super clean after using this. both me and my bf use the toothbrush and it&#x27;ll hold a charge for a week.  Edited: had to downgrade my initial review. There is a 2 year warranty on this unit, guess how long the toothbrush lasted until it stopped holding a charge? 2 years and 3 months! So now I have to buy a whole new unit since the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable. There are vid online to replace the battery but it includes soldering wires and I don&#x27;t know how to do that. Seems ridiculous to shell out 80-100 bucks every two years for a toothbrush. Shame, I really loved it.</li>
            <li> This product equals, less time in dentist chair!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Waterpik Complete. I was a Philips Sonicare user for years. After the nightmares of Sonicare&#x27;s airflow product, I vowed to never purchase a Sonicare product again. The Waterpik has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this. It has it all.</li>
            <li> Have used it a month or so and everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Waterpick is super powerful (will spray across the room). Toothbrush is great and has two settings. Battery life is long.</li>
            <li> Love my waterpik.  I use it twice daily and see my teeth brightening quickly.  I love the variety of attachments, too.  The toothbrush holds a charge for days without needing to be in the cradle, so it&#x27;s convenient for overnights.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Like having a dental cleaning at home!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has is jaw wired shut (for the second time in the last year!) The first time we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing and I had never heard of a water pick. Needless to say after his visit to the dentist after getting his wires off the first time he introduced us to the waterpik and told us to get one. I found this all in one with a sonicare toothbrush which actually turned out to be a godsend too! It&#x27;s super easy to use and has made a HUGE difference this time on the appearance of his teeth and the tartar build up. I would recommend this to anyone who is going through the same thing. I&#x27;m positive he will continue using it even after his jaw is fixed. Very affordable and a very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works well.  I enjoy the fresh feeling it leaves.  :)  Thank you</li>
            <li> Very effective, what an awesome tool!</li>
            <li> Wife insisted on getting one of these...I have been using an Oral-b and floss forever.  Hot bat-smoke!! This thing is a BEAST!!! My teeth feel great afterwards...though the high setting on both of these tools are Rambo-eque.</li>
            <li> I used the sonic and oral b. i personally liked the oral b but on a trip, I left the charger. I need a new electric toothbrush as I was having should surgery.. Harder to brush with a post op shoulder in oct... I decide to try this waterpick tooth brush as the price was much better then the oral b smart scenes.  the toothbrush has 2 speed which I like the faster one as it cleans better.  My last dentist checkup went very well and had little plaque.  This toothbrush works very well for me if I brush for the 1.5 to 2 min.....  My only complaint is the base is larger so can&#x27;t travel with it really.  It will keep a charge for awhile but for longer trips, it not good.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> after using a sense of purity for the whole day, I recommend))) Decreased bleeding gums</li>
            <li> Love it  but  takes up  a lot of  room  on  my  sink.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat anal about dental hygiene, and this thing fits the bill.  Having a permanent retainer, it makes flossing between those teeth a breeze, no longer having to thread through those impossibly small gaps.  Downsides: loud, requires user dexterity to not blast self in eye, and definitely not the most impressive thing to talk about with women, but neither is gingivitis.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe the results after a few days of using the waterpik</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece. She wanted awater flosser.  I love my sonic toothbrush so when I saw this combo I purchased it.  It is compact in size. The toothbrush is kept on charger so it is always ready. She loves it. Stated her teeth never felt so clean, except when cleaned by dentist.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good unit for the money. The Sonic Toothbrush is a little too bulky and I&#x27;d have preferred 3 speeds: clean, soft, &amp; Massage, rather than 2 speeds. I like the Water Flosser and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I was not able to get this product to clean my teeth as it advertised. I was just shooting water in my mouth.</li>
            <li> As described. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> makes my mouth feel awesome&lt;br /&gt;I should have purchase this a long time ago.  after brushing, feels like I just left the dentist...</li>
            <li> This is the second combination unit I have purchased. The first one the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after just 15 days. Happily it was still within the return period and Amazon took care of a replacement no questions asked. The replacement unit has now been with me since 28 Jan 2014, today the 27th of March 2014 I have the same problem, the toothbrush won&#x27;t stay charged. The waterpik works just fine. I guess this is what I get for trying to conserve electrical outlets and bathroom counter space. I don&#x27;t recommend this unit, I will go back to the Oral B toothbrush that I gave up.</li>
            <li> After two months, I can say that I love the Waterpik!  I was skeptical at first:  would it really do a better job than a standard toothbrush and dental floss?  Yes, to the toothbrush question and &amp;#34;most of the time&amp;#34; regarding the dental floss.  I actually use the Waterpik and regular floss, as well, to make sure my teeth are super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using the pause button, make sure to do two things:  keep the dial set at 3 or below, and press the button firmly.  If you have the dial set above 3, the pause button will stick.  In my case, the button eventually stuck permanently, and I contacted the company who immediately sent a replacement and told me not to exceed &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; when using the pik.  If you don&#x27;t press the pause button firmly, you&#x27;ll spray water all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money, I think.</li>
            <li> Man If you hear somebody talking bout they flossing, they ain&#x27;t flossin like I&#x27;m flossing playa. If you wanna be flossing you need this.</li>
            <li> It is a great unit, very pleased.  Having both the tooth brush and water flosser together makes it more compack.</li>
            <li> I love that there are the two things together, the brush and the waterflosser.  It saves on counter space and I love the ultrasonic brush, it makes my teeth and gums feel so clean!!!</li>
            <li> really gets the job done.  takes up little space on the counter top&lt;br /&gt;place to store pick heads</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A nice, compact unit.  It would have been nice if they had included two full size tooth brushes.  It seems that they&#x27;re only available on line.</li>
            <li> I had an older waterpik for many many years but it finally started leaking and needed replacement. This one is just as good as the older model and I use it two to three times daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this waterpik complete for myself and I loved it so much I bought 4 more for my children. They are loving it too, and so is my dentist!!</li>
            <li> Recently had a bridge installed so flossing is out and the waterpik is a great option. The sonicare toothbrush is different and would have been perfect with a sanitizer package.</li>
            <li> great experience ever before~~</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for my husband and the toothbrush would never charge correctly.  Now it does not charge at all and I can no longer return it (by three days).  The less expensive unit with just the toothbrush and a charger stand works great.  I didn&#x27;t expect any issue with Waterpik so I didn&#x27;t save the boxes and such.  I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this Waterpik, the only problem I&#x27;m having is that the battery on the toothbrush lasted only 2 weeks!  And now&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to replace the batteries and I&#x27;m unable to remove the cap.  I would like to return the Toothbrush (without the brush head) of course, and get a new one.</li>
            <li> Really good product. As for the toothbrush, the high is a little too high and the low a little too low, but you get used to it. The water jet is totally adjustable.</li>
            <li> Everything I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush since December of 2013.  In July, the second setting on the toothbrush went out on me.  I contacted Waterpik and they immediately sent me out a pre-paid label so that I could send the toothbrush back to them for examination.  About a week and a half later, I received a new unit without any further questions asked.  The customer service from Waterpik is the reason that I gave this product 4 stars.  If the product didn&#x27;t break on me it would definitely get 5 stars.  As to the product itself, I absolutely love, love, love it!  I immediately noticed the difference from the cheap Spinbrush I purchased from the local store while my toothbrush was out of commission.  Outstanding cleaning and my mouth feels great after brushing with this toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love brushing my teeth now. Only complaint is that is it a bit big and doesn&#x27;t quite fit in my bathroom, but I should have guessed that before hand. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been encouraging me to get one of these for years...  finally got one.  It is amazing.  Teeth feel like they were professionally cleaned every day.  Way better than I expected.   Update:    It is an Amazing Company as well....  My unit failed after 15-months....  Might have been related to a storm.   The company replaced it Hassle free.  A+ service.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> Great dental tool. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Absolutely met all my expectations!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Went to my Dentist after about a month of use. Best check up I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Gets your teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> Every good thing you&#x27;ve heard about it is true.</li>
            <li> Packaged well.  works great - a little messy to use until  you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I really like the deep clean feeling after using the toothbrush. It has two speeds, which I use the high speed.  Feels like a mini-spa in the mouth event.  the watertips are great!! Highly recommend the investment.</li>
            <li> A must-have for good dental care.  It is amazing how much food the waterpik removes, even after flossing.</li>
            <li> My first automatic toothbrush--love it.  My hands are very arthritic--it has become very difficult to use conventional floss --the water flosser is great!!</li>
            <li> Perfect...pressure is awesome&lt;br /&gt;..is just the right product to clean my teeth. Will write again after my next dentist visit.</li>
            <li> I have a deep pocket between two of my back teeth and I am always getting food stuck in there and it gets sore so I have to use a bristle tool to clean it all out.  So now I go in and floss it out with the water flosser and it cleans it all out.  I love this unit, my teeth get an awesome clean  with the tooth brush and my gums get a great clean with the water flosser.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.  I am getting one for my husband.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works Great.  Does have a mall glitch every 30 seconds. It stops for a brief second and then goes again.  I think it might have a short in the toothbrush wand.  Should I return it and get another?</li>
            <li> Love it and it works very well</li>
            <li> The toothbrush as well as the waterpik are beyond my expectations. Noticed an improvement on my teeth and gums immediately!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had braces for a year and I have always had a hard time flossing.  This thing gets so much stuff out of my mouth, even after brushing, its amazing! After first use feels like professional teeth cleaning from dentist! I wish I had bought this years ago, The tooth brush is really nice too.  This is probably the most valuable purchase you can make, Don&#x27;t think on this one, BUY IT NOW! Everyone should have one braces or not! Think of all the money you&#x27;ll save on dental bills.  I know what I&#x27;m getting family for their birthdays!</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this system before. Great fresh feeling</li>
            <li> Great water pick.  We love that a tooth brush came with this one for slightly more than the one we ordered last year without the brush.  Great value.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been after me for years about not flossing. I just couldn&#x27;t stick with it. So she finally recommended a water pic, and I love it. Between the sonic brush and the water pic, my teeth stay smooth and clean. And I am sticking with the program. Looking forward to my next dental visit.</li>
            <li> The battery takes 24 hours or more to fully charg .</li>
            <li> Works great- be sure to clean between the brush head &amp; base regularly.</li>
            <li> Very professional piece of equipment. Very powerful, heavy duty. Will last a long long time.  Great buy....</li>
            <li> The Water Flosser Button is stuck, I&#x27;ve had it just under 5 weeks and can&#x27;t return it because the window for return (1 month) has closed... now I have a product that doesn&#x27;t work... I did like it while it worked!</li>
            <li> Great set here.  The toothbrush functions well, although mine &amp;#34;pauses&amp;#34; every 30 seconds or so, for about a second, and then restarts.  It&#x27;s not random, so this may be a feature, but  I&#x27;m not a fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush charges easily, just drop it in the ring.  No cords to connect or terminals to lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik works well, but I am not quite proficient with using it yet.  There are several attachments, most of which I haven&#x27;t tried.  The blue button stops the flow of water.  I wish this were reversed, so that it would normally not spray, and the blue button would make it spray, but unfortunately not.  Multiple pressure settings, the highest of which is very strong, to the point that I&#x27;m not sure what it would be used for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, some very minor &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; (not that they even rise to the level of being an issue).  The value is great, I would definitely buy this set again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for hubby...he loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day and he loved it! I bought him another brand waterfloss that is compact and travel size, but he didn&#x27;t like that. He said it had to be Waterkpik and I see why because of the strength of the water flow through the pik. I just purchased another one for another family member who got braces and he is using it very well. Flossing is hard enough as is, but waterpik makes it easier to do so.</li>
            <li> Very good product, fast deliver.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this and I can definitely feel a difference in the way my gums feel and my teeth look.  Can&#x27;t wait for my next dental visit to show him the difference this has made.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC set! Strong motor on the toothbrush, which was my biggest worry. The brush has an internal timer. The brushing pauses for a moment eery 30 seconds and then turns off at 2 minutes. I LOVE this feature. The waterpik came with several extra pieces as well as an instruction book for how to use each one. Thoroughly pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> The best on the market. Great for periodontal pockets. Easy to use and really cleans your teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li> The convenience of having the the rechargeable brush and &#x27;power washer&#x27; contained in one unit (with a single plug) is worth the price to me alone.  The bonus of a sufficiently sized reservoir that allows me to do my entire mouth without refill and a toothbrush that has easily sensed signally at 30 second intervals while brushing only confirmed my satisfaction with this unit.</li>
            <li> i love this my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Love the way my teeth feel after I use it. So fresh and so Clean!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I had 2 and the are a good  for the purposed</li>
            <li> I bought the Waterpik based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation after his hygienist noticed I was getting some deep pockets in hard to reach places. She also recommended for use by my wife to clean under a permanent bridge. We use it daily. It cleans, flosses, and messages the gums in such a way that your teeth feel as clean as they do after a cleaning. I highly recommend it and wish I had bought one earlier. It is only messy if you turn it on without it being in your mouth. Learn to use the controls, which are intuitive and easy.</li>
            <li> Well, the water pump stopped working after less than a year. They replaced the whole thing under warranty. Now the replacement pump is about dead after less than a year. I like how good of a job it does. I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this long ago.  This thing is great, and a much smaller footprint on the counter than two separate dental tools.</li>
            <li> I love having the toothbrush and waterpik together. This is a perfect little waterpik station! Took me a few days to get used to the electric toothbrush but now I can&#x27;t live without it. I am taking much better care of my teeth because this is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy changing the attachments</li>
            <li> Great flossing product. I have fillings and I can&#x27;t get the floss out from between my back teeth.  This works great at removing all the food stuck. The tooth brush is grew too.</li>
            <li> My child uses this product. I think it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> makes my mouth feel super clean. I have several bridges and it really works well for them. Can&#x27;t wait until my next check up. My dentist is going to be so impressed!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. I did not realize how much cleaner my teeth would look and feel after using the toothbrush and water flosser. My gums are less tender. Only wish I had not waited so long to purchase.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Product works extremely well and would suggest to anyone. Have not had dental session since the purchase, but expect praise when I do.</li>
            <li> Got new braces and needed both the toothbrush and water pic, this set is perfect and great value. Its been months and it is performing beautifully, couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It works great, however, it would be nice to have a speed that is between the low and extremely high.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works as advertised. Toothbrush &amp; water flosser are gentle but powerful. i will buy one for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say flossing would be fun!!! Since I got the waterpik wp-900 I can now officially say that. I enjoy &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;The whole water pressure technique is just amazing.</li>
            <li> The water pike system it great. You get everything  you need. It provides great dental care and leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist office</li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper than the sonicare and the standalone waterpik. Great for the value, makes bushing your teeth more like an event than a chore. Gives you that smooth/clean feeling</li>
            <li> not giving it a 5 star only for the price which needs to be a little cheaper. but overall good product.</li>
            <li> I love this item. I&#x27;m on second round of braces. It used to take me at least twenty minutes to brush and floss and the Waterpik w/ the sonic toothbrush just totally cut that time in half. I will most definitely use this item well after my braces treatment.</li>
            <li> Is not specified power supply and Hz for this product and I have now problem with work mode in Europe. Waterpik work correct with 120V 60Hz voltage network, but not with 220V 50Hz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;ll buy some more product like this one. And my family is satisfied too. And shipping is so fast that I satisfied.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me my teeth and gums are so much better with use of this flosser and toothbrush.  That made me feel very good because I was not a great flosser otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have never used a waterpik before but decided to give it a shot.  I really like it!  It gets everything out, better then floss.  And I love the electric toothbrush....very soft, comfortable.  All in all very glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> Really a complete mouth care system. Very happy with it,</li>
            <li> this is everything that I wanted in one unit. It works very well and I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product very highly. The cord is long which is good for my bathroom since the&lt;br /&gt;outlet is on the other wall and a distance from the sink. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing machine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this machine and my teeth feels so fresh and clean. No bad breath and my Hygienic gave me an amazing A+ on my cleaning. He asked me what I was doing and I told them I am using my Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser . Love my waterpik and the tooth brush that comes with it is  a great tool.</li>
            <li> Great product and makes my mouth feel super clean</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I get this years ago. My gum health has already improved considerably. I can eat popcorn again! Yea! My brother has been trying to get me to buy one of these for a long time. I didn&#x27;t do it until my gums began to recede. Should have listened to my brother!</li>
            <li> I replaced a Sonicare toothbrush with the Waterpik Complete care......I have used Sonicare for over 5 years and I like the Waterpik much more. My gums have so improved since I began using the Waterpik Flosser.</li>
            <li> First one did not work at all water pic sent me new one an works good  I sent back one that did work to water pic thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the toothbrush unit on here at all, I prefer regular toothbrushes. I do enjoy the water pik though. that is what I bought it for...</li>
            <li> how did i live without this before?</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel like they were cleaned by the dentist. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the first time with a water pik, kept putting it off because I didn&#x27;t think it would make any different.  I&#x27;m was very wrong about it.  My mouth feels alot fresher and the gums get a good massage with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter since she just got braces and she doesn&#x27;t like to use regular floss. It&#x27;s very easy for her to use and I feel better knowing that the brush is doing the work for her rather than her doing it manually. Very satisfied with this product.   Update: Have had this product for 2 years now and the battery has died with no way to replace it. What a bummer. Had to bump this down from 5 stars to 3.</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I don&#x27;t have dental insurance and I was really noticing stains and buildup of plaque on my teeth. So I bought this, Lavadent and Dentizyme. I think it&#x27;s a combo of all of the above that has helped remove the plaque and brown stains. But whatever it, is it&#x27;s working!! My teeth feel much cleaner after using the Ultra Flosser and warm water. This will suffice until I get a professional cleaning. Love this product and the Lavadent and Dentizyme! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Good product a bit expensive for what it is ,the information on usage is not up to spec as i need to know more.</li>
            <li> The ease of working through my mouth with the Waterpik has definitely gotten me to improve my own dental health. It effectively gets bits of food out from between my teeth, although I still need to use traditional floss to get rid of the plaque that the Waterpik isn&#x27;t able to get. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their oral care habits, like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s louder than I expected. The motor surprised me the first time I turned it on. If you live with someone who is a light sleeper, be wary of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The toothbrush is a two-speed. The button turns the brush on at the first, slower speed setting. Pressing the button again switches the brush to the second, faster speed setting and pressing the button a third time turns the brush off. I use the first speed setting, which means, to turn the brush off, I need to switch to the second speed. If I keep the brush in my mouth to turn it off, it&#x27;s a bit jarring. If I take the brush out of my mouth, the second speed setting sprays toothpaste everywhere.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this thing has changed my life. I will never use a regular toothbrush ever again. The water flosser is like heaven on earth. I can&#x27;t understand how I lived without this for so long. Quality product, amazing power, amazing battery, sleep packaging! overall just overwhelmingly great! Worth every penny. I bought 3.</li>
            <li> Up to the job.  A pleasure to use. Fresh, clean, rinsed feeling.</li>
            <li> works great, I feel the difference right away</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have ever made!  I wish someone would have told me about it sooner.  It&#x27;s helping with the dental disease I&#x27;m fighting.  It&#x27;s all about keeping the gums healthy so that the teeth will be healthy. The dentist don&#x27;t tell you that.  Everyone should own one!</li>
            <li> Give you a fresh and clean feeling. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great quality, very happy with the performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week but I am loving how my mouth feels. As my dentist says, I have a very &amp;#34;crowded&amp;#34; mouth. This has caused me to have issues with tarter build up. This water flosser / tooth brush combo has been just what I&#x27;ve been needing. The toothbrush does great, I love that it pauses when you should switch quadrants so that each part of your mouth gets the proper amount of scrubbing. And it has two speeds which is great. My gums already look and feel healthier since using the water pic and no visible tarter. Needless to say, I recommend this product. Longevity I can&#x27;t account for but I sure am hoping for it! Great product.</li>
            <li> good product, I hope I can ues it everyday.</li>
            <li> This combo is fantastic !!!! Even better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! The toothbrush is very high quality, I like that it runs a bit stronger than my old Sonicare and the flosser has an attachment for everything. A great deal.</li>
            <li> Loving this care set so far. My teeth feel so clean! I take the tooth brush with me when I travel, but not the whole flosser - and I&#x27;m finding I truly miss it when I&#x27;m gone and relieved to use it again. My next dentist appointment is in January and I&#x27;m hoping the dentist will be able to tell me how much of a difference she sees</li>
            <li> Works great!  Our teeth feel dentist clean after each use! Well worth the money! Much cheaper than dentures!</li>
            <li> Works better than brushing</li>
            <li> This unit works well but the water flosser does not do a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Love the poser of brush and water jpic.  Price was also fair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic unit. Easy to floss quickly on tight teeth. My teeth feel so clean. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever purchased. My mouth has honestly never felt cleaner. This is also my first electric / sonic toothbrush as well as a water floss / pick thing. Take it from a guy who loathes flossing, I also have a permanent brace on my bottom row of teeth, so the water pik makes cleaning down there so much easier and a lot more fun than threading a piece of string through my teeth. Definitely worth the price, especially if your conscious about oral hygiene. Just can&#x27;t say enough of how good this product is.</li>
            <li> Great combination for the price</li>
            <li> there is nothing like the Waterpik.  after I use it, my mouth really feels clean</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so refreshed...easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> Two months of using the system and my teeth still feel as clean as the last time I had them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I&#x27;ve had this now for a couple of months.  I wasn&#x27;t consistent when it came to flossing so I bought this combo from Waterpik. This works great!!! The toothbrush pauses in 30 second increments and shuts off after 2 minutes (I usually run it an extra increment). If it&#x27;s your first time using a Waterpik I&#x27;d advise on stayed the first few times in lower settings.the first time I use the water went everywhere. Even while using the pause button I first made a mess. Once you find your groove though you&#x27;ll be attacking between your teeth and your gum line like a pro. Set up and clean up is pretty easy. Some times I mix in some mouthwash (just male sure to run clean water through the system afterwards). The convenience of having it all in one is a big plus. Oh yeah the toothbrush has 2 settings, the high power setting is really powerful. Overall this was definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent ..Couldn&#x27;t be happier with functions.  wish I had it sooner.  Will be getting my granddaughter and daughter one for Christmas.....also my brother.  Great price, too.  Nice to have one machine talking up space rather than two.  jp</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I use it daily and sometimes twice a day. My mouth feels as if I just left my hygienist. I have recommended this product already to several friends.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a water pik.  Found this on Amazon, great sale price.  It does the job. Takes a little getting used to, and it&#x27;s loud both with the pik and toothbrush, but it works and glad I got it!!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!!! i have braces, and this is amazing!!! it comes with a travel case for your toothbrush, so i take with me everywhere, it holds a charge for weeks on end. i had a gum infection, i used the water flosser twice a day, and then rinsed with listerine, my infection cleared up in a few days with no antibiotics. the water flosser works excellent with getting those missed particles out of your brackets, and in between your teeth....i didnt realize how much could be missed with just brushing, this is a great combo, and is worth the money....im going to order my husband one :)</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. Flossing was always awkward and difficult which meant i would skip doing it often. Now i floss everyday because it&#x27;s easy and effective. The sonic toothbrush and charger built makes this system handy and user friendly. Best purchase i have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  My teeth feel cleaner than ever and I can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Waterpik to replace my broken sonic toohbrush. This is a really nice combination flosser/toothbrush. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week and I&#x27;m still getting used to the water flosser. It sprayed my bathroom walls and floor the first couple of times I tried it. The big pause button on the pik helps avoid messes as you get used to aiming the spray nossle.   Someone mentioned it runs out of water too quickly, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that yet. I fill the tank halfway and get about 6 passes over my gums; upper, lower, inside, and out. My dental hygenist recommended setting the intensity midway for the best results.  The tooth brush is nice though the low setting seem a bit too slow. The high setting is a little faster than the Sonic. It does a nice job of making your teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I have never used a waterpik before so  Iwasant sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;I have braces and a dentist friend recommended this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s--cleaner teeth, I hate flossing--and this gets everything&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s-LOUD, messy, and kinda leaks a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try another brand/model next time</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised how this unit worked on plaque, whitened my teeth and cleaned food from between my teeth. I look forward to using it for dental health.</li>
            <li> My children have more fun using this so it increases the likelihood of them using it, thus keeping up with their dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> This thing works great, is easy to operate and is quiet. The price was more than reasonable. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law.  She loves it, because it&#x27;s more than just the normal Waterpik flosser.  it also includes the toothbrush.  Her old Waterpik was just the flosser, which she had for years once the pump went out.  She says it&#x27;s a lot more convenient than using regular floss.</li>
            <li> It works as described</li>
            <li> a little loud but works great</li>
            <li> great product...u can adjust pressure...water tank holds plenty of water and easy to fill...elec toothbrush is added extra...</li>
            <li> This works so easy and takes no time away from my normal routine, I should have bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> We needed to replace our  WaterPik flosser and wanted an electric toothbrush.  This combo is great!  We bought and returned two other electric toothbrushes before I found this.  The price is great compared to others plus the flosser with it.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with gingivitis and I hate to floss. This Waterpik keeps me out of the dentists chair. The toothbrush is really nice also - two speeds and a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> Bought back by the time a problem arises, the quality is very poor, but the machine has returned to Hong Kong so that the herd</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Should have started using this years ago.  Really cleans the teeth and gums, you can see the results in the sink.  Small learning curve to keep water flow from mouth into sink.  When done, feels like you came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  Many pros, works well, cleans well.  Just a note is that the water pick unit is not held very tightly onto the main body of the machine and if there is water left in the water reservoir and the waterpick nozzle is knocked off its stand, the water left in the reservoir drains out through the waterpick.  I&#x27;ve made a few water messes so now after I&#x27;m done, I leave the waterpick in the sink to drain rather than hook it back on.  Also there are three bright green LED on the toothbrush and at night they shine bright which I personally find very annoying.  Lastly, on the toothbrush, after use, the water drains down the handle of the toothbrush and settles on the holder and the holder gets pretty dirty but it can be cleaned using the waterpick.  Other than that it&#x27;s nice.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit in September 2013. In September 2014 the toothbrush unit stopped charging and failed to work. You can not replace the battery, you must replace the toothbrush unit, at a cost of at least $50.00+. Since it was within the 2 year warranty I contacted Waterpik. They said without seeing the unit they could not determine if it was the toothbrush unit or the base unit which was malfunctioning. They said a complete new unit would be shipped and I should receive it within 10 days. A new unit was received and works well. They stood by their product and did what they said they would do.</li>
            <li> Purchased the WP-900 and after 2 weeks the toothbrush base plastic cracked. I called Waterpik and they sent me a replacement. After a month the same thing happened. I called again and they asked me which toothpaste I was using. I told them Arm&amp;Hammer and they said in the manual that toothpastes containing baking soda or peroxide or abrasive cleaners may damage the plastic housing thus void the warranty. Doesn&#x27;t leave many choices for toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My old Waterpik was getting slow so I got this one with a built in toothbrush. It&#x27;s awesome! The Waterpik does its job and the brush on high speed makes my teeth feel polished and really clean.</li>
            <li> Best deal ever. Tooth brush is better then the other one I had and the water pick is awesome. For other buyers just remember to run white vinager through the machine once a month to clean the lines that may cause buildup</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended, i am loving it!  Waterpic and electric toothbrush combo is just what the dr ordered!</li>
            <li> I loved it for the first week but then the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge again.</li>
            <li> husband loves it, the extra accessories are quite nice</li>
            <li> Waterpik works so well! Our dentist recommended Waterpik for my husband who was fighting periodontal disease. This product has reversed his disease and saved his teeth! Our dentist is amazed at the turn-around in my husband&#x27;s dental health. Get the WP-900 and use both the brush and the water flosser!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I had the older model for years until it broke so I bought this upgraded version. Love the sonic toothbrush! Product works great and according to my dentist, my gums are healthier, I have less plaque and teeth are looking better. I add a little mouthwash to the water when using it and it works to get the mouthwash into your teeth / gum areas a little better than just swishing the stuff in your mouth.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery works great</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works as advertised. Toothbrush &amp; water flosser are gentle but powerful. i will buy one for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> All what I expected, even the hygienist is pleased with the results of the product. Glad had a found this product.</li>
            <li> The unit worked splendidly for about a year.  Then it suddenly lost about half it&#x27;s pressure. But the guarantee was for two years so I contacted the WaterPik company through their website and they promptly sent a replacement unit.  The WaterPik healed a long term tooth root infection by using the flosser with colloidal silver.  The dentist wanted about $7,000 to replace four good teeth with fake ones; this unit solved the problem and I still have my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this water flosser and sonic toothbrush set.   I&#x27;ve used a Braun sonic toothbrush before, but this seems to get my teeth even cleaner. It has two speeds so you can choose your level of comfort. The battery lasts a very long time allowing you to keep out of the charger for days on end if needed. That&#x27;s great if you want to take it with you while traveling.   This was the first time I&#x27;ve used a water flosser and I am really sold. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it does a great job of reaching where floss just can&#x27;t. My mouth feels fresher and cleaner than just brushing and using traditional string floss. I love it.  While the unit is larger than just a toothbrush-only charging unit, it really doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my bathroom counter.   If you have any questions about the product, please don&#x27;t hesitate to ask. I&#x27;ll do my best to reply as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> The jets need to be stronger for the water pick</li>
            <li> best purchase ever , works well.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonic Care products in the past and this one lived up to my expectations.  I have cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> I used it and it&#x27;s easy to use and does a good job taking all the excess waste from your teeth. Leaves your mouth clean and ready to talk up close to people. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The irrigator is just a  straight line of water.  The brush doesn&#x27;t move at all.  It just vibrates.  I think it&#x27;s one of the lesser Philips models.  But I&#x27;m using both and they seem to work all rightl</li>
            <li> This replaced my Hydro Floss and I am so pleased with the performance of the Waterpik. Love the water flosser and sonic toothbrush combo. Easy to fill the tank, use and store.</li>
            <li> tooth brush stays charged and the waterpik rocks!  good by gum disease...</li>
            <li> I love it and works wonderful on my teeth, I have been to the dentist and came out of their and had no cavities.</li>
            <li> Love this it works great</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my dentist to help control place around my gumline. It makes my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean after use. It is very easy to use. I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I always get really great reviews at cleanings.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my teeth definitely feel clearer  it&#x27;s definitely improved from my old Waterpik and electric toothbrush! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it! The first one I ordered had a missing item (it was from another seller) and was quickly replaced with another one from a different seller. Very happy with the product, easy to use and maintain. My dentist is very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for the first in my life my teeth and gums feel &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34; every day. Makes a noticeable visual different.</li>
            <li> Love this! Not only does the 2 in 1 design save space, the toothbrush is awesome, and does a great job. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Superior to all other similar products by a long shot. Love it, won&#x27;t ever switch from Waterpik now that I&#x27;ve tried them. Forget the other companies.</li>
            <li> Works great arrived as described</li>
            <li> Great to have both tools in one place and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely blown away with the performance (but not the structural integrity) of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I cannot emphasize enough how much better/quicker/more enjoyable water flossing is relative to manual flossing.  My mouth feels so clean just after water flossing (not even having brushed!)&lt;br /&gt;-Sufficiently small.  Doesn&#x27;t take up too much real estate, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;-I expected the toothbrush to be an afterthought thrown in, but it works, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;-(How could they not advertise this?!)  The toothbrush has inductive charging, meaning there&#x27;s no plugs for the brush!  It&#x27;s really nice to just set the tooth brush down in the slot and see it charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Quality of components leaves me wanting.  There are cheap plastic components, but the product works, and works damned well.  There are times when I feel like I may break the water reservoir when I remove it to fill it with water, but the product has yet to break, so I really can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;BUY ONE NOW.  This will vastly improve your oral hygiene, saving you a lot of money in the long run!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and my wife loves it !!</li>
            <li> This is great, my teeth are clean and sparkling.  Should have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li> Sonic Toothbrush leaves my mouth and teeth clean however the water pik does not do a complete job of removing food between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Using it every day. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I had their old sonic toothbrush and the ultrasonic waterpik...each was separate.  This unit looked like a good idea.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It just fast-streams the water out of the Waterpik regardless of setting, making it a mess to use and emptying the reservoir really quickly.  I hate it.  The toothbrush has a redesigned handle...not as fat as the older one.  The older one was more ergonomic and therefore worked better and easier to clean your teeth.  I am really disappointed.  I may decide to return it, unless I can figure out how to get it to adjust properly.  If the Waterpik worked, I&#x27;d be happy, even with the less comfortable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, works better than the previous two waterpik&#x27;s I have had.  This is also an incredible value for the electric toothbrush that is included, even with a travel case to take it on the road.  This version also will hold all of the extra tips and toothbrush heads on the side which a lot of others don&#x27;t.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does everything just as advertised.</li>
            <li> use it every day - great product</li>
            <li> This device does all and more than described...I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I would rate this product with the highest rating available!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! So much better than flossing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product..  The toothbrush is very effective. My teeth feel very clean after use.  I like the fact it can be taken on short trips without the base.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner since purchasing this product.  I had a Sonicare toothbrush before with all the bells and whistles, and the Waterpik Total Care product is much better. It allows me to better control the tarter I am prone to. For travelers, you may want to purchase the water pick and tooth brush separately, since the combined unit is rather large.  Waterpik does not even sell the charger separately, which is something my Sonicare product included.  I called customer service with this suggestions, which I hope they take under advisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Over 6 months later I still love the product.  Best checkup ever at the dentist.  I used to have my teeth cleaned every 3-months to control the tarter. Lost insurance so waited 1-year--less tarter than I used to have at my 3-month cleanings.  I JUST WISH that replacement toothbrush heads were available in brick and mortar stores or that they were available with free shipping.  They are expensive and hard to find.  No problem finding the water tip replacements, just the brush replacements.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use a water pic for better gum health. I hate flossing and this works great.&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush that is integrated works good too. It&#x27;s convenient to have them both in one unit and saves a lot of counter space</li>
            <li> Works nicely and easily freshens your gums.</li>
            <li> works great,... lots of power from water pick and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This Pik requires TWO (2) hands to operate it when you first start. It seems to me that it was never given to a peer group to test out before it was put on the market, or when they assembled it they put the WATER VALVE contained in the handle backward. Once you turn the switch from 0 to 1 you have water under pressure going to the Pik and it will squirt all over unless you have the button on the water Pik handle depressed or you have the Pik in your mouth and you are holding it there between your teeth. You have to keep the button depressed to keep the water from squirting out and release the button on the water Pik handle to get the water to come out which I believe is CONTRARY, BACKWARD to how things normally work in this world. If a person has only one hand available to use it would be tricky. Once you get over the backward type of operation it will do the job it was intended for.</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric toothbrush or a waterpik, so this is my first unit, but I love it!  The clean feeling with my homemade toothpaste is amazing!</li>
            <li> First time using a Waterpik - both my Dentist and myself are very happy with the results.  The sonic toothbrush is great as well - very quiet but effective.  Having them both on one machine is great and its even better that the brush is always charged.  Recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush it&#x27;s very powerful and the timer helps you to use it the enought time. Also the water flosser complete the cleaning to show a white smile!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as it provides very good results for an amazing price!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product works really well with my adult braces.  I could tell the difference from the first use.  We love that the water flosser was attached which made it a great addition.</li>
            <li> Honestly feel like I have gone through an awakening.  I was never good at brushing and flossing well but now I make it a point to do this 2-3x a day just to get that clean feeling I&#x27;ve never had before.  I love that there&#x27;s a timer on the toothbrush that systematically does 30 second increments on 4 quadrants of your teeth.  Second, the waterpik is phenomenal.  I was concerned that it would be a mess but just run it with your mouth closed around it and spit frequently.  I made the mistake of starting at the high setting right off the bat and it hurt.  After going back to the instructions, it said to work yourself up to the higher settings.  Now I&#x27;m at setting 8 (out of 10) and I&#x27;m completely content that my flossing regiment is so much improved.  Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and it has really helped with cleaning my teeth, especially since I just got braces. If you have braces or hard to clean teeth, then this is your only choice. Just add a small amount of Listerine to the water tanks and it disinfects too.</li>
            <li> This is a very messy item! Be prepared to clean water up. I bought this for my daughter for her ortho. care. The tooth brush is fine. But the water pick leaks.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me about this product. Since I have implants, it&#x27;s a good idea to use a waterpik.  I can see and feel the difference right away after using this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t get a better tool for cleaner, healthier teeth. Individually, the water flosser and the sonic toothbrush are both great products. In a well-designed, single unit, the products are unbeatable. If you&#x27;re on the fence, hop off now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using both the water flosser and the sonic toothbrush for about a week, and my teeth have never felt cleaner. The water flosser, complete with adjustable pressure setting and multiple tips, is great. Waterpik makes models with more bells and whistles, but this model contains everything you need in a water flosser. I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik flosser before, but I forgot just how effective they are at removing debris in between teeth and gums. The results are astounding, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush, for me, was the big question mark. I&#x27;ve been a longstanding Sonicare user, so I was skeptical whether Waterpik&#x27;s sonic toothbrush was as effective. The Waterpik model, especially compared with many of the Sonicare models, is pretty basic. That being said, I took me exactly one use before I was sold on the Waterpik model. The difference is the Waterpik is much more powerful than the Sonicare. That additional power makes it easier to clean and whiten teeth, and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference: the toothbrush works fantastic! Also, the LEDs on the toothbrush are very handy to determine how much charge is remaining on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the combined unit, it&#x27;s very nicely put together. The convenience of having one plug for both your toothbrush and your water flosser leaves your precious bathroom outlets free for other things. The water reservoir is well sized for a complete cleaning, and is easy to fill and empty. The covered storage for both piks and brush heads is a very nice feature. And, the charging station for the sonic toothbrush is well thought out. Unlike the Sonicare that sits on top of the charging platform, the Waterpik charger has an open bottom with a ring around the base to charge so the unit is never sitting in water (the latter results in a horrible build-up of mold and debris).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik has combined their proven water flosser with a powerful sonic toothbrush in one very well executed unit. I&#x27;d buy one again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Ordered this the 14th of October and it said the water pick would be here between the 17-20 but it&#x27;s not. Supper excited to get it but don&#x27;t know when it will show up.</li>
            <li> I was considering professional teeth whitening before buying. Use this twice a day for just two weeks (with a good baking soda/peroxide toothpaste), and my teeth were shades whiter. It comes with a number of accessories that I haven&#x27;t used yet, but it&#x27;s almost time to replace the brush head. Oh, and it lasts over a week (one person\twice a day) with just one overnight charge, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water flossing takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s almost therapeutic after you get the hang of it - and it feels much less invasive than regular flossing. You can adjust the flow, so finding the pressure most comfortable for you is easy.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I went to the dentist and he said I have to floss more.&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought this and use it every night on Setting #7 or #8&lt;br /&gt;As a test I did not floss while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Six months later went back to the dentist and he exclaimed that I must have been flossing like a pro since the last time I saw him!</li>
            <li> Has the following design failures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The holder for the waterpik barely grips the bottom of the handle.  This means that you constantly knock it off and it ends up on the counter.  At the very least, you will knock it off every time you try to fill the tank by removing it.  Since the water hose is stiff, it will pop off the handle a lot just when you try to put it into the holder.  The other models hold it securely in the middle of the handle, apparently they wanted to save a cent or two in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The waterpik handle is too high in the holder.  That exacerbates 1 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The left side of the top is a badly designed tank to hold the tooth brush heads.  It is useless.  You can’t easily add or take out the heads and it does not dry out very easily.  Do you really want the kids grubby hands rooting around trying to do this every morning?  I didn’t think so.  You should have a separate holder for those heads that is external to this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The water tank is too small because of the brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The pause button on the handle will start sticking in the down position pretty soon.  It is not something you can take apart and cleanup to repair it.  You will then have to use the switch to pause the unit.  Why would the most used part of the system be the first to break?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears the waterpik company is on a downward quality slide, they don’t have any serious competitors so they are just going to milk the customers while they can.</li>
            <li> It works well...wish was qieuter the water pik part</li>
            <li> This is my second Waterpic and the first one with the tooth brush in the unit. I have found it to be a great addition to dental care. Nice compact unit.</li>
            <li> I like doing things by hand more. hand floss is better. this is good for a touch up.</li>
            <li> I love my Waterpik (plus the toothbrush is an extra plus) and so does my husband since we share the waterpik - although we do use different toothbrush attachments :)  My mouth feels cleaner I am actually looking forward to seeing my dental hygeinist to see how much (or hopefully less) scraping she will have to do and if it has made a big difference in the health of my teeth.  My teeth even appear whiter.  I told all of my adult kids they are getting these for Christmas and one daughter is so excited she is really looking forward to Santa this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an incident with a missing piece in my box and contacted Amazon and, as always, they are awesome to deal with.  I typically will buy things on Amazon (even if its a couple of dollars more) versus other unknown companies - even if the other company provides free shipping, because I know that I will get my item in perfect shape and in two days or less (Prime Member), and if I am less than happy with the product they will send me a packing slip to return it at no cost to me!!!  Amazon Rocks!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush and water pik.  Very quiet.  I like having 2 speeds on the brush.  Highly recommend.  :)</li>
            <li> I have never had a toothbrush that is so effective.  The water pik cleans and improves the health of your gums substantially.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works well after six months. Pressure high enough.</li>
            <li> The product is good and looks very well made, I have 3 other waterpiks in house , every one works very well, the only easy broken part is the on/off push button on the handle, I already replaced two handles because of this ,but overall this product is very good and we use it every day. that is why I bought this again with the tooth brush together.  the only mis-leading is it said  it is made in USA , but actually not , it is designed in USA and made in China. Even it is mis leading and I am a little bit upset , but I still give it a 5 star as it is very well made and great values included.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described. Wife and kids love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pic works great as does the toothbrush.  My teeth has that clean feeling you get after getting your teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several levels so this is a good product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t the tubing that attaches the waterpik to the unit be more flexible and/or stretchy? It doesn&#x27;t like to stretch out and is very hard to put back into place. I have to drag the entire unit right next to the sink because it doesn&#x27;t stretch out more than a foot or so. Other than that, this unit is just as good as the Waterpik unit my mother had from the 80&#x27;s! I would say that the tooth brush works just as good as my Sonicare as well.</li>
            <li> Best price and design</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing! Every time I use it I am blown away by how clean and great my teeth feel. Always feels like a fresh-from-the-dentist-cleaning!</li>
            <li> The motor vibrates the whole kit violently.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice a change in my teeth.</li>
            <li> it broke down on me twice!</li>
            <li> Everything we expected. Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd Waterpik.  The most recent was purchased in August 2014 and it blew a hole in the waterpik hose this week (2 months later).  The two I had before did the same thing.  Waterpik needs to improve the curly hose of the flosser to alleviate this issue.  This will be the last time I purchase this product. If the 4th one has the same issue, I will look for an alternative.  When it works, it works well</li>
            <li> I had an oral b floss action brush before and it did such a better job of keeping my teeth plaque free for the whole day. By the end of the day my teeth feel gross using this toothbrush. This just vibrates and doesn&#x27;t spin or move. I am just commenting on the toothbrush and not on the waterpik. Can I return a used item?</li>
            <li> I love it, so easy to keep your mouth hygiene.  It really makes a difference in your gums after a month using it.</li>
            <li> Arguably the best purchase of the year for me. This is my first water flosser and WOWW I will never not own a water flosser from here on out. The tooth brush is great too and has two levels of vibration. This comes with a replacement tooth brush tip and a few different flosser tips as well to give varying levels of stream. These replacements are neatly housed within the unit. I&#x27;ve been using the brush and flosser for a couple of months now and have not had to use any replacements. Having the toothbrush and flosser in the same unit also makes me more likely to use both of them more often. Water flossing is a fun and pleasurable activity. Cannot recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li> Great combination healthcare instrument.</li>
            <li> Very powerful. Haven&#x27;t had a toothbrush like this in a very long time, and glad to make the switch back. The toothbrush has two settings, a low and a high setting. The high is every powerful, get used to the low setting first before trying the high one. The waterpik has 10 settings, and once again, get used to the lower settings first, do not jump straight to the highest setting. This also comes with a variety of waterpik attachments, and 2 different toothbrush heads. Each with a different use. And one more thing, also a travel case for the brush! I am sure these are normally recmmended for anyone with braces (which I had previously, and this IS a must-have) however anyone wanting a little more focus on their teeth-health care should invest in this. This is also very santitary and takes little space on the counter. The cord is a decent length. I wish I had come across this sooner, this was definately one of the best purchases I made. Compare around like I did, but I am sure you will come back to this one. Not many more are going to be able to offer everything this one has and does.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Works well</li>
            <li> Great product! Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely, was as listed on the website, all parts arrived.  As a recent recipient of an All on Four permanent denture the dentist recommended one of these, and at the cost of the teeth I&#x27;ll darn likely take care of them this time as best I can.  Unit works great, water flosser pump is too loud to use late at night if the wife is sleeping nearby, but otherwise performs well.  Hope it works for several years.</li>
            <li> I live this system. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I can&#x27;t get rid of the funky taste in my mouth after using it. I tried mouthwash and changing toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Bought for our sons birthday gift. He got braces, recently, and he loves this. Here is back to flossing twice a day!</li>
            <li> This thing is a game changer in my dental hygiene. It actually makes me want to floss. Powerful and gets them looking clean really quick. The toothbrush is solid and gets everything squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Fan&amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34;tik!!!!</li>
            <li> lets start by saying i am 1 22 years old  who decided to give her teeth ab bit more care  almost 6 months ago&lt;br /&gt;the last time i went to a dentist before that was 5 years ago&lt;br /&gt;i used to only brush my teeth with those battery brushes  twice a day for probably less than 2 mins or even 1!  rarely flossed  n used a mouth wash n a tongue brush  (the orabrush one )&lt;br /&gt;so i used to only do miminal things  n  i am not an expert  havenot used anything similar before&lt;br /&gt;sure my teeth were a bit yellowish  though i am not a coffee drinker nor a  smoker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i bought this n no others  because  i wanted a water flosser  (i am just too lazy to floss by the end of the day)&lt;br /&gt;n wanted to upgrade my tooth brush ( i like the timer in this brush n how it stops every 30 seconds  so u dont over brush one area n forget about others)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ i dont have a large space in my sink to buy 2 products separately  n place them there&lt;br /&gt;so that was just perfect for  me  n the price  u  just cannot beat it  + i got 20% coupon  if u buy if from their website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ n it has a lot of good reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since i got it&lt;br /&gt;been using it daily  i used the floss usually at nights only ( n whenever i eat popcorn)  n the brush 2 - 3 times&lt;br /&gt;i mix some of my mouth wash with the flooser water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i felt the different  the first time i used it  my teeth felt cleaner  when i move my tounge around them i feel how clean they are&lt;br /&gt;i loved the water flosser  n found it better than regular flosser  just because it doesnt hurt my gum&lt;br /&gt;n i like how powerfull it is  i use it usually on the 7th speed  but at the beginning i only used it in the first 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the different attachment it has&lt;br /&gt;for the brush i start to use the compact brush attachment instead of the stander  n i love it because it can reach my wisdom teeth&lt;br /&gt;the only down side  with the second speed or setting for the brush  the vibration get a bit uncomfortable  but it definitely cleans better than the 1st one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n the more i used it the more i saw good results  n sometimes in weekends i go to my frinds house n use a regular toothbrush n i dont know how i was using them all my life  i never feel my teeth r clean now when i used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n finally a couple of weeks ago i had a dentist&#x27;s appointment.  After 5 years i finally decided i should go n get a check up&lt;br /&gt;n the dentist was more than happy with my teeth.  She even told me  there was no need for your visit! you&#x27;re taking good care of your teeth n it doesnt seem u need me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n I couldnt be more happy n i know the only thing that has changed my teeth was this system  n i would recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;for those who wanna whiten their teeth  i found that my teeth got whiter while using it  but they just became natural white teeth  not super white  like a Hollywood smile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i am giving it 4 stars not 5  because it claims to be \\&quot;complete care\\&quot;  n it has a lot of attachments that a regular user ( someone who dose not wear braces ) may not use them&lt;br /&gt;but they dont include the tongue one which is essential for everyone to use it daiyly; Even though, they do have one n offer it in their site ( havenot tried it though )  but for me without cleaning or brushing my tongue  my oral health is NOT complete  n i cannot get a fresh breath without using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it totally worth your money&lt;br /&gt;n i was a skeptical at the beginning specially that i am a student n didnt feel like spending $100 for a brush  but it really worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n i would love if they offer the attachments&#x27; replacements on stores where they sell there water flosser like walmart n target  so u dont have to order online every 3 months or so</li>
            <li> Very helpful and better than the regular flossing by the threat</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the dual unit.  Went with this choice due to limited counter/plug space.  I am now in the habit of better care of teeth and gums.  Takes a bit to get the right angles so as not to splash out over things, but be patient.  Better to use in in pj&#x27;s then get dressed, just to be safe.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combination of a simple yet effective electric toothbrush and water pick.</li>
            <li> The compressor/motor in this toothbrush failed to function after five weeks of use. It was great until then but the failure means the total cost was about twenty five dollars a week to brush my teeth. Unaxceptable!</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she looks forward to brushing her teeth with this water flosser and tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Works well, but very loud.</li>
            <li> The two vibration level sonic tooth cleaning feature is a surprise!  It seems to work better than the rotating brush generation of  tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;  The water pick tooth irrigation  feature seems to work as well as the previous versions except the amount of water in the container seems a little less than previous models.  The water spray feature cleans the crevices around the teeth effectively and reduces gum irritation. The pulse cleaning pressure is good, and better than competing brands I have tried, in flushing particles at the gum tooth interface.  That is what you want to happen!</li>
            <li> We loved the Waterpik, it cleaned great, however it only lasted 2 months.  For $82.00 and only to last 2 months is ridiculous.  More junk from China.</li>
            <li> Just as good as sonicare but way better price. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> was a gift, but she loves it</li>
            <li> It works great so far.  I really like having the brush and the water in one.</li>
            <li> quaity, does great job</li>
            <li> So far it has been working fantastic. Hope I have it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Price is good for what you get. The item is straight forward and the instruction tell you how to use the waterpik. The best quality is the brush lets you know every 30 seconds time to switch up where you&#x27;re brushing and stops after two minutes. flosser is functional but the button gets stuck from time to time.</li>
            <li> fast shiped&lt;br /&gt;A low price&lt;br /&gt;Satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;very safe delivery</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m 68 years old and just had braces put on my teeth. The Waterpik does the job cleaning all the bits of food caught in the braces and where I can&#x27;t floss...helps there too. The sonic brush is as good as the Sonicare I was using.</li>
            <li> Excellent ,I love it very much!</li>
            <li> the tooth brush broke my tooth that was fake. be careful.</li>
            <li> As an adult who recently got braces I was looking for something to help keep my teeth clean. I saw this on sale and decided to give it a try. It works great! The Waterpik is excellent at cleaning between and around my braces and along the gumline and the toothbrush does a great job of working around my braces too. I can&#x27;t wait to try it without my braces on in a year and a half!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a sonic toothbrush anf came across the waterpik sonic toothbrush plus water flosser and thought I might as well try it because the reviews were good. I purchased it and haven&#x27;t been happier. I can never go back to regular toothbrush and this flosser is perfect since I had such a hard time flossing before. I&#x27;ve had it now for close to a month. I&#x27;ll see what my dentist says when I go in for a checkup..</li>
            <li> I love it! At age 62 and having braces for the first time it makes flossing so much easier! And the battery operated toothbrush which is part of the unit is also great since we should brush for 2 minutes it pulses at 30 seconds so you know when to move to another area!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that, after you have used it, you truly wonder how you got through your day before having it. I cannot believe how much cleaner my mouth feels, and I was a diligent brusher before.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd waterpik.  Reduces plaque and time in the dental chair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even better then I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this item a quite a while ago and use it every day. LOVE it. Toothbrush is always charged and ready to go and my husband absolutely loves the waterpik. Very happy with this product and def recommend for daily dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I purchased 2 1 in Il. &amp; 1 in Fl.</li>
            <li> Having this is like going to the dentist for your six month cleaning - but twice a day and at home. So five stars for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also five stars to Waterpik for customer service. The first unit I received had a problem. I went to the web site and filled out their contact form. After a couple of e-mails a replacement unit arrived at my door. All they asked was that I send the first unit back to them using their mailing label. So five starts for customer service too.</li>
            <li> What a snazzy upgrade to an old favorite.  Two for the price of one.  I love the mechanics of this product...the ease of use and the functional aspects.  I have followed a 4 step process for dental care for 20 years that includes flossing, waterpik and electric toothbrush.  Have not had any dental problems.  My dentist is thrilled.</li>
            <li> Works just perfectly !!</li>
            <li> I HAVE CUT MY GUMS USEING STRING FLOSS BUT WITH THE WATER PIC WATER FLOSSER YOU CAN ADJUST THE WATER PRESURE AND IT FEELS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT ABRACIVE STRING.&lt;br /&gt; THE SONIC TOOTHBRUSH IS AMAZEING AND IT KINDA TICKELS YOUR GUMS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY MY TEETH AND GUMS FEEL SO MUCH HEALTHER AND CLEANER.</li>
            <li> Agree that it takes getting used to.  You WILL give your bathroom a shower the first few times using it, but the product does a WONDERFUL job.</li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpik products for 25 + years.  My dental checkups are great and I know this is partially due to the Waterpik.  This new device is even better and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I love this complete gum cleaning machine! It works great!!!! The water reservoir does not  stay full long!</li>
            <li> Had no idea that it works so well!</li>
            <li> Very good. Ackward to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> the first product sent to me stopped charging a few weeks in. i called waterpik; their customer service was very polite and helpful. i got my return label in the mail quickly and mailed it back to them. it took longer than i expected to receive my second one, but it worked like a charm and is still going strong. good customer service and a good product; i have no problems recommending this to anyone scared of the price tag.</li>
            <li> Really love the toothbrush, but the waterpik side broke just after the return date expired.  The plastic button on the pik side is flimsy and feels a bit like a toy.  It is this part that broke.  It stays in after being pushed and doesn&#x27;t come out now which means the water can&#x27;t run thru it.  Makes this portion of the unit useless.  Really bummed and hard to recommend as I hardly used it (I travel a great deal).</li>
            <li> wife loves using electric toothbrushes and with upcoming surgery, preferred the Sonicare and waterpick to rinse her mouth. has been a great buy, and best price found.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner!  I have had a waterpik for several years but the toothbrush is great an really cleans</li>
            <li> This is my first WaterPik. I love it.... my gums do for sure. :) I prefer this toothbrush to my old Philips Sonicare since the brush part pulls off easily. The simple way it&#x27;s constructed will make it much easier to keep clean than my old one.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over a week and my teeth have never felt cleaner. I have always been obsessive about my oral hygiene but this product took it to an entirely new level. I wish I had bought one years ago!</li>
            <li> Love it having both is very convenient</li>
            <li> I like using it. My dentist will be happy. The brush that came with it seems to do a better job than my cheap OralB.</li>
            <li> Got this on the recommendation of my dentist.  Was a bit skeptical as I thought it was more gadget than tool.  I was wrong, it has made a big difference in my dental health and the cleanliness of my teeth and gums. Takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this sooner?</li>
            <li> Great product. Impressed so far. Hopey dentist will be too.</li>
            <li> The only reason why it&#x27;s not 5-star is that it takes a bit of practice to deal with the water tank and the flosser and not get water everywhere.  It is super at cleaning between the teeth; makes floss seem a primitive device.</li>
            <li> The waterpik works great but the toothbrush is not worth it. The battery died super quick and when I tried to change the batteries. The internal wiring was glued to the batteries so I couldn&#x27;t change them without breaking the wiring. Broken wiring means broken brush . :/</li>
            <li> Works great! The button is held to turn off the water flow, which is counter-intuitive, but once you get used to that, you are on the road to good gum health. There is enough water in the reservoir to irrigate thoroughly, but an added bonus is blasting out gunk around the drain and faucet. I love using it to clean the sink!</li>
            <li> BUT OH MY GOD!!!!! I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A GIFT,,, THAT I DON&#x27;T WANT ANY ONE TO KNOW ABOUT. CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY. THIS IS THE BEST TEETH CARE SYSTEM THAT I HAVE EVER HAD....HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> Performance as advertise I would highly recommend this product my wife and I have been using this on a regular basis we really love it.</li>
            <li> I hate how big it is, but it works 100x better than the battery powered waterpiks. Max power on battery powered equivalent was around a 4 out of 10 on the wp-900. We have not gotten used to the toothbrush and still use manual brushes :)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush failed to charge after three weeks of use. l was able to return through Amazon and get a refund. Purchased a brush and flosser from a different brand for that money. Read the negative reviews before buying. The durability of this unit depends on your luck. Looks like some of them work fine, but a lot of them fail to charge after a couple weeks of use. Maybe you will get lucky, I personally did&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> 1really  love this product, i received 2 by mistake and i gave the other one to my daughter who has braces so we both love the way our teeth and mouth feel after we finish</li>
            <li> I always was a flosser, but have been pleased to find that Waterpik gets rid of particles which even flossing and brushing don&#x27;t seem to remove.  My new dentist also was surprised by how good the accompanying sonic tooth brush performed.  Yes, it makes a mess if you remove the water reservoir each time... so I don&#x27;t.  Instead, I refill it with a glass of water at the desired temperature (good for one use), and I&#x27;m no longer annoyed.</li>
            <li> I love the value with this 2-in-1 solution.  I like that the sonic speed is comparable to others out these but at much lower cost.  It&#x27;s not super fancy but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> an email has been sent to amazon,explaining that the the the product is not able to be used in australia as my address clearly shows!the instruction manual has no warnings and no information on voltage</li>
            <li> The water part pik is good;however the toothbrush leaves a lot to be desired. Brush itself is skimpy and action is poor.</li>
            <li> A great product, I just hope it continues to work for several years. The first one blew a chip on the motherboard after less than a months use.</li>
            <li> It did not work from the first use what to do to get it returned back or change it with another working one? Not happy until I get this sort it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 8 months now and while in the beginning it was working properly, the button on the flosser now gets stuck and (as some other reviewers mentioned) water reservoir leaks when you try to refill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product but definitely not a 5-star one either.</li>
            <li> I have had several different brands of these devices over the years. This one has met or exceeded every expectation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item! Highly recommend! Easy to use and your teeth and gums will love you for purchasing it!</li>
            <li> The water floss function is really effective. After flossing and brushing, the water floss function still gets bits of food out. The tooth brush is really awesome. It&#x27;s my first sonic brush, and I can&#x27;t believe the speed the brush moves. My teeth feel super clean after using the brush and water floss function. Would recommend and plan to buy for my husband&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this. I&#x27;ve been a longtime Sonicare user and tried this after my third Sonicare failed. Happy with the toothbrush, happy with the water flosser, happy with the heads, with the case, with the whole product. Don&#x27;t love the cord (thus the four stars instead of 5) but it&#x27;s part of the deal. All in all, I&#x27;ve been won over.</li>
            <li> We love it, it was open box but nothing was touched. My wife and I use both the toothbrushes and the waterpik everyday. I will look to open box deals in the future. Waterpik puts out a great product, makes me wonder why we took so long to buy one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THS THING, I HAVE ALWAYS JUST BRUSHED MY TEETH WITH A TOOTH BRUSH. AFTER BUYING THIS I FIND USING THE WATER PICK AFTER MEALS MY GUMS HAVE REALLY GOTTEN MUCH BETTER. AT 72 I JUST GOT LAZY, WITH NO SPOUCE TO PROD ME ON, I JUST LET MYSELF GO.</li>
            <li> This machine does it all very well. The toothbrush combined and attached to the water flosser is convenient ad takes up little space on the bathroom sink. Looks great, works great. A classic.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!!! I seen them in the stores. Broke down an got one using amazon gift cards from Christmas. It works great for what I need. I like the fact that it has a pocket pic for the pockets in my gums. It works great an I have felt a cleaner less inflamed gums mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is convenient and compact and worth the cost. The Waterpik takes up little room on the counter which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Enormous improvement on previous Waterpiks. Have given several.</li>
            <li> My cleaning habits have been: brush once a night, thoroughly floss once or twice a week, and to attend a routine dentist visit every 6 months.  This routine has been failing for a long time considering I have not gone one year in the past decade without having a cavity show up on an x-ray.  And, thanks to a few fillings from a young dentist, many of my teeth are now very sensitive to flossing.  Though, do not get me wrong, my teeth are not yellow and decaying - I just am not sitting at home enough to follow the recommended &amp;#34;3 times a day&amp;#34; routine.  After two weeks, my impression is that this sonic toothbrush and water flosser pair work fairly well.  I feel as though the spaces between my teeth and my gums are much cleaner after using this product.  The water flosser is actually very easy and quick to use, however the first few times you might make a mess, so keep a towel handy.  And, though the product feels very flimsy, it is very functional.  At first I feared possible mold build up, but this product is well designed, so mold should not be an issue.  Just do not leave it plugged in all the time or the wireless charger will destroy the toothbrush&#x27;s battery.  As an experiment for this brush, my cleaning habits will not change much.  I will be using the sonic brush and water flosser once a night and the same occasional floss from before.  Upon my next dental visit this review will be updated.  Update (6/28/16): I skipped a dental appointment, did not floss, and stopped using the water flosser daily after 4 months. I know - such weak will power...   However, I used the water flosser about once a month and brushed once a night every night without fail. The result? No cavities for the first time in 10 years!</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of years using a manual toothbrush, so, this has been quite the adjustment. Let&#x27;s start with the tooth brush. It does an amazing job at cleaning your teeth. It comes with two brushes a mini, and a regular size brush head. I gave the regular one to my son and he says its great. The mini gets into all the crevices and behind the teeth exceptionally well. This is great since the hygienist always seems to spend more time with the back 4 molars. With this it feels like I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. Dont get me wrong, my oral hygiene has always been very good. I have only had 2 cavities my whole life. But, I am over 40 and I have started developing sensitivities to cold and hot. My dentist said that I have been brushing to hard and that has contributed to loss of enamel. This has a soft bristle brush and removes all the plaque without the vigorous brushing. My only complaint is that the vibrations tends to tickle, not sure if they can do anything about that, Another great thing about this toothbrush is that it gives 30 sec timer that briefly pauses to let you move on to the next quadrant ensuring you get the whole two minutes of brush time.&lt;br /&gt;As for the water pick, it too is great! I still floss, mostly out of habit, but, the floss is always clean.I never had braces growing up so I do have spaces between my teeth. Despite this, I never have anything on the floss string. As a matter of fact, lately when I eat steak or similar food I use the water pic to freshen my mouth and remove any debris. Quick, easy, complete clean after meals. Initially there will be clean up while you get used to flooding your mouth. I also put a capful of mouthwash in the water container, and I also use warm water. That sensitivity thing. Overall this is a wonderful product. You can still use your favorite toothpaste and mouthwash, and its only slightly more expensive than just a plain ole waterpic.&lt;br /&gt;Update: definitely happy with this purchase! Last checkup went great! Plus no longer do I suffer from cold sensitivity!! By the end of my check up the hygienist had stopped using that soothing voice they use on terrified patients lol. If you on the fence buy this product, you will be happy you did!reat! Plus no longer do I suffer from cold sensitivity!! By the end of my check up the hygienist had stopped using that soothing voice they use on terrified patients lol. If you on the fence buy this product, you will be happy you did!</li>
            <li> Best ever used . Better than the one the Dentist asked me to buy. Dentist was very pleased at last check up.</li>
            <li> This was pretty awesome to find both a toothbrush and water pic in one product. One Plug! One item on the counter. Its great.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.</li>
            <li> This dental care product is excellent,  I bought it for my mother, and wouldn&#x27;t mind having one myself.  It was easy to set up, and she was using it the next day.  She was completely pleased with both the brush and the flossing attachment.  She described them as gentle, but I showed her the softest settings first and told her once she got used to them, then we could go to a higher setting.  (She is 90!)</li>
            <li> Fine product - just wish we had ordered sooner!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It has strong water pressure that is adjustable, and the toothbrush works great. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After the meal is good for removing plaque.</li>
            <li> Excellent but replacement brush heads are stupid expensive.  Buy OralB. Everybody stocks the replacements!</li>
            <li> Love this thing, can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this long ago, this thing is amazing. Rechargeable tooth brush and water flossing! My teeth feels fresh every time I&#x27;ve used this product. Water flossing has adjustable power so you can&#x27;t go wrong except you may want to hold on to the floss button frequently or it&#x27;ll shoot everywhere lol. Hold on to that button for dear life!</li>
            <li> Works good never thought my teeth could feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I have gum disease. If I had had this Waterpik Complete Care Flosser and Toothbrush, I most like would not have had this problem.</li>
            <li> Unit came on time and packaged well. Extremely functional, and much easier and more effective than regular flossing. Only downside, and a ding on the rating, there is no storage for the toothbrush heads. Easy workaround but would have made this unit great.  Update: After 6 months of flawless use the well is leaking like a sieve. Outside of the Amazon return policy. I am going to attempt to contact the mfg. NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Love this. Keep food out of my gum! The toothbrush is great too. I like the charging dock. It&#x27;s great using it at home. I bring it with me when traveling too.</li>
            <li> got it for the wife and daughter, they love it! This was recommended by our dentist for my daughter that has braces, and it works great. Really cleans all the stuff out. My wife loves it too.</li>
            <li> the waterpik does shoot all over the place, but that does not surprise me.  i&#x27;ll know better about how much I like it after my next dental check-up in march.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as it was an all-in-one tool. It goes from really slow to really fast. I would like a medium speed.</li>
            <li> nice thing. all is ok. quick and fine</li>
            <li> I have had a Waterpik for decades and I&#x27;ve found they last very well, so I am no stranger to the brand. I&#x27;ve also owned the Sonic Tooth Brush.  My last Waterpik laster 14 years and finally gave up the ghost so I ordered the Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Tooth Brush.  I have had this appliance for some time now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The flossing action is superior to the older models.  The picks meet any cleaning need one might have and are easy to change.  The tank holds enough water for a thorough flossing.l  To have the Sonic toothbrush right there at hand is an extra added bonus.  This Sonic bush seems to be an improvement over the last model:  There are different speeds in both brushing and flossing.  Both do make a little noise, but they certainly are quieter than earlier models.  I recommend this appliance without reservation.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Love using it. Especially the water glosser. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. My teeth feel amazing after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing electric toothbrush that I have ever owned!!!  I don&#x27;t have dental insurance so my at-home care is very important to me.  The waterpik flosser does a wonderful job and the toothbrush itself cleans my teeth better than any one that I have ever used.  It has a timer on it so that I know how long I&#x27;ve been on each section of my mouth.  I don&#x27;t have to watch the clock.  My teeth have never looked or felt better!  9/21/2016 UPDATE:  The toothbrush is not holding a full charge anymore and there are no replacement batteries.  I called Waterpik and they were so incredibly nice and helpful.  A brand new full unit is on its way to me.  I didn&#x27;t even have to produce my Amazon.com invoice.  They just needed the serial number and model number.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this company or this very excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a great device for brushing teeth and water flossing. It comes with both a regular and compact sized head for brushing and five options for water flossing. You&#x27;ll love it if you are looking for something to maintain your oral health.</li>
            <li> I just received this item and so far I like the way it works.</li>
            <li> I spent an afternoon whining to my friends about the only excitement in my life being my new Waterpik system.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong-- I LOVE this thing!!! I&#x27;ve been a much better brusher and water flosser than I ever was a thread flosser.&lt;br /&gt;That stuff cuts... This is great with a capful of Listerine. Yowsa-- Great dental care is my favorite morning and evening ritual.&lt;br /&gt;So sad to admit how boring my life is-- but my mouth is so FRESH!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, great proudct.</li>
            <li> I rate this product by its effectiveness.  It has helped me a lot - of that I am sure.  I like this product a lot.  That is one reason I want to advocate it for others by giving it 5 STARS, but also want to note for Water Pik that they need to design a better handle holder to hold the waterpik apparatus!  This setup does not always hold the one on the right in the picture (2014) and that can be frustrating from such an important and awesome device otherwise.  It is like they had no clue it was coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do when I don&#x27;t want to mess around is I shake the water off of the pik handle and then put it upside-down on the metal pole of the toothbrush (users are told to detach the toothbrush head after each use).  That holds it real nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped me to improve my oral health by leaps and bounds!</li>
            <li> we bought this for my husband who was having lots of expensive dental issues. He had used it 1 week before he had a return visit to the dental office. The dentist good see an improvement in his oral health after only 1 week. We recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Dentist told me to stay away from flossing under my bridge and showed me an air cleaner that shoots air through, did not like it and didn&#x27;t  seem to work good so got this waterpik with toothbrush. Works wonders and wish I would have got one years ago. Like it so much that it is what my kids are getting for Christmas. Well worth it as Teeth care is highly important,lost my step dad to tooth infection so you can never do enough for your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been on a Visit-the-dentist-every-4-months plan because of tartar build-up and pockets in my gums. Every time I visited the dentist, I would sit through a cleaning done with their version of the power washer. I used my Sonicare but wasn&#x27;t great about flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dentist-recommended Sonicare died over the summer, right after a big car and home repair and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $$$ to replace it so I chose this brush/water flosser combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just at the Dentist this week. She said my pockets were significantly reduced and there was only light tartar build-up. I only needed the normal dental picks for my cleaning. When she asked what changed, I took great pleasure in saying &amp;#34;I ditched my Sonicare and stopped flossing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dentist still gave me the flossing lecture, but couldn&#x27;t deny the results. She said I could come back in six months, like a normal person.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a similar Braun product that developed a pinhole leak in the irrigation supply line.    Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to form much of an opinion on its function, however I was a bit disappointed in the design for storing irrigation heads and toothbrushes.    The Braun, accommodated 4 brush heads and 4 irrigation heads.    The Waterpik provides you with 4 different irrigation heads and 2 different sizes of toothbrush...there is no place to store the tooth brushes and the whole setup of heads and brushes is just that, one set of 6 different devices    I suppose the thinking is that if you happen to have anyone else in your family, you can buy a separate appliance for everybody</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product. Absolutely worth every penny. Makes flossing a quick,easy and fun thing to do. I bought one for my niece. As a tool to improve dental hygiene, it is very good investment. Your teeth and gums will thank you for getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generates enough pressure for flossing. One thing I would add that no one else has probably added is that the sonic toothbrush has excellent battery capacity. It may not be the best wizbang toothbrush, but if you can figure out how to make the best out of it. It is to brushing what safety razors is to shaving, gets the job done quite well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY problem is that it is not using international voltages. Sticking with 110V AC only means that your device cannot be used internationally. Waterpik should really consider improving that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small, but it does take countertop space. Wall mounting model might be a good idea too. It is a bit noisy to use, but it seems to be using a reciprocating pump to generate the pressure. Body is plastic, but it is a very good quality plastic.</li>
            <li> would buy another love it</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the amount of food that the water pic removed from between my teeth, I found using the mid range on the jet dial worked just fine.  Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that my old WaterPik bit the dust! Had no idea that the new ones were so well made, attractive and, best of all, wonderful and easy to use. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> We have had this for 1 year now.&lt;br /&gt;The good : brushes and flosses teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;The bad : With my wife and I using it needs to be recharged every two max 2.5 days.&lt;br /&gt;If you go away there is no way of recharging without taking the whole unit with you.&lt;br /&gt;Other than online, no one sells the flossers.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush stopped charging within 4 day. Amazon  return policy does not apply, Customer &#x27;stuck&#x27; with $97.91  junk.&lt;br /&gt;Had this been brick/mortar  purchase I would simply walk into the store and pick up a replacement, but with Amazon?</li>
            <li> Our teeth have never felt cleaner!  It is well worth the price and we cannot wait to go for our next dental check-ups. Also, saw some complaints about the tank for the waterpik not holding enough water.  This has not been a problem at all for either of us.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for adult daughter for Christmas. She has nothing but praise for it. Said she can see the difference in the appearance of her teeth in just two and one half months she has been using it.  She also feels like her gums actually feel better.</li>
            <li> really cleans underneath the rings on my braces like floss could not.</li>
            <li> Great product. Should have purchased one years ago.  Doesn&#x27;t take much counter space and having the sonic toothbrush as part of it doesn&#x27;t clutter up the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Waterpik wirks fine. But the charger for the toothbrush would not recharge. Im Not happy for the money i spent.</li>
            <li> A little bit awkward to use at first but does the job. A good choice for at home. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess if it worked it would be nice. Looks nice but the only thing working is the flosser. The toothbrush was on the charger for days when it first arrived and never charged. I recently saw the lcd lights flicker( on the toothbrush), indicating that it was charging but as soon as I lifted the toothbrush from the charging base it stopped working. It has been on the charger ever since and still is not charging and havent seen the lights again. Smh at least the flosser works.</li>
            <li> This product comes with a carrying case for the tooth brush portion and it is awesome :)</li>
            <li> Since I am having a problem with my teeth, I decided to try this. It&#x27;s a combination of a brush and floss in one device! It is very convenient to use. I love it because it cleanses my gums as well. It reaches the areas that we do not clean often. I am glad it arrived!:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just to bad that I didn&#x27;t have money for this along time ago because it would&#x27;ve saved me tons of money at the dentist! The quality of this product is very good, plenty of attachments. Just be careful using the high settings you can make your gums bleed very quick-like, but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I used a Water Pic years ago, and I cannot remember what happened to it.  Maybe it broke--I just don&#x27;t remember.  When I was shopping for a new electric toothbrush, I settled on this Water Pic model, and I am very glad I did.  The pic works extremely well, dislodging all manner of stuff trapped between the teeth, and the brush makes my teeth feel extremely clean.  I like the brief pause after every thirty seconds to tell you to move to a different quarter of the mouth.  I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing great things from my dentist.  So far, I love this thing, having had it about a month or so.</li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush. I am very pleased. Much better than an Intellisonic toothbrush that I recently purchased from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I got this because I got my first cavity filled last month and I vowed to brush and floss everyday now. I realized after a week that I hate flossing because I dont like having to stick my whole hand in my mouth and seeing the debris is kinda gross. With the water flosser it takes care of both those problems plus I find it to be rather refreshing. When I bought this i already had an electric toothbrush but it was a cheap one. This toothbrush is worth the extra money. I recommend it so far.</li>
            <li> I start using waterpik  since 1989. I had a very old one (no tooth brush, only 4 tips ) and it last for years. I finally get a new one not because it broke. It&#x27;s because I wanted a tooth brush along with it. This toothbrush is incredible! Let see how long this last. I had the WP900 at another time and that didn&#x27;t last but the toothbrush last a long time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value. It does what it says. It cleans your teeth. And it comes with many different attachments (which all have a dedicated storage area next to the water tank)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I have seen is that it uses water fast so you might have to refill the cup often. And the water flosser , when turned up to &amp;#34;maximum power&amp;#34; becomes obnoxiously loud. But that is to be expected of water pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the toothbrush heads were made of a more &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; plastic because if you are using the higher powered mode and your teeth touch the hard plastic it can be quite uncomfortable or even painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately a great buy. 1 point deducted because the brush heads could be softer.</li>
            <li> Love using it everyday it makes me feel like my dentist will be happy when she sees me next visit. Love it</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my teeth feels.  My gums are not nearly as sensitive.</li>
            <li> Great price !!! Bought it for my son!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in December &amp;#62; it has been perfect for 92 days and now toothbrush stopped working!!! No help in getting it serviced is frustrating. Not worth buying another one every 90 days. has anyone else experienced this? Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good item. And I bought it cheaper than other sites in amazon. Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dentist recommended this product. We bought it. As usual, it arrived ahead of the estimated date of delivery. It is every bit as good as it ads proclaimed. The instructions for use were simple and clear. Picks and brushes are simple to insert and remove. Very simple to operate and does a good job for which it was designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this unit to any one.</li>
            <li> Poorly made item compared to other Waterpik products, switch and handled both were broken less than 50 days in use.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! I love it!!!  If you register your product with waterpick you will get a buy one get one free coupons for replacement parts. Awesome Deal!!!</li>
            <li> After I received I found it&#x27;s not working at alll I switch power on but no respond I checked electricity and from my side every thing is  ok ,no invoice was add in side the package and no return address .,however if I want to return I need to pay extra money because I am out of states now in gulf country and shipping is to expenses ,I am really disappointed .</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the water flosser since my teeth are too tight to get regular floss through. This was the best deal and I love it!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I had an electric toothbrush (LOVE) and a separate Waterpik (Love).  I dropped by Waterpik and broke it, so  decided to go for this more compact model for my very small bathroom.  The technology is really great, and the footprint is very small.  I am religious about going for 6-month check-ups/cleaning, and the dentist is amazed at the health of my mouth since I started using these tools two years ago.  You&#x27;ll never need to floss again - this tool is amazing!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does a great job of cleaning my teeth.  However, when I use the floss attachment, no matter how I stand the water flows down my arm.  Not a big deal, I just position myself over the sink.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery. Highly satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> This was an easy way to help me improve my dental care. The toothbrush and pic comes with an assortment of easy to change heads. The toothbrush feels solid, it is well made. The water pic works great with various levels of pressure, easy to adjust. The only thing I ding, it is a little loud when using the water pic.</li>
            <li> Product construction seems a bit flimsy.  It feels like it will break if i open the lids too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Also whe the wate Pik tip is inserted,  it still rotates freely.  Maybe that&#x27;s intended but I would like to lock it down if tbere was a way.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwize,  it does the job and it does it well</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, &amp; great value. In 3 or four minutes my mouth feels completely clean, so much so that I don&#x27;t even get morning breath. Well made, a complete, all-in-one oral hygiene center.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Works great.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand before........a good buy.......and is great for daily dental care.  I especially like the water pik part.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 97 year old father who refused to brush his teeth. He uses this every day and isn&#x27;t fighting me to do so.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this as our main toothbrush and just use different heads (it comes with a small and large head).  After I floss with string, I brush, and follow up with the water flosser.  I am amazed how little its and bits of debris are flushed out by the water flosser even after regular flossing and brushing!  This would be great for using with braces too!</li>
            <li> bought this to replace a Braun that finally bit the dust.  really like the power of the water pic and the 2 speeds of the brush.  also the design of the brush touching the base for power is much better as the ring does not get any buildup on the bottom like the Braun did.</li>
            <li> Love this waterpik because it has both water flosser and sonic brush in one unit.  Very effective for maintaining clean teeth and fresh breath. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I can see visible results in the clean of my teeth. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> better than just a sonic care, battery last a full week or more brushing twice daily, space saving, love the water pick.</li>
            <li> Using this everyday now. Loved it.</li>
            <li> First one, the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge. The company sent another one and works AWESOME...</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist. I have some OCD when it comes to my teeth and I have found it a good tool. I still prefer holding the floss in my fingers, even though this one works well.</li>
            <li> Why not keep your teeth clean? And why use floss when there&#x27;s THIS THING? Other than the mildly annoying pump noise it makes while you&#x27;re using it (it&#x27;s a water pump, go figure) it works great. There&#x27;s different tips for different cleanings, different pressure settings, and even a sonic toothbrush because if you&#x27;re going to put this doesn&#x27;t-match-with-most-of-your-bathroom gadget on your sink, it better have a bunch of uses. I&#x27;m glad to report that it does, and now I&#x27;m going to use it.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun toothbrush/oral irrigator which finally died after ten or twelve years.  It&#x27;s difficult to find the combination of both appliances in one, and my bathroom has minimal counter space which dictates what I can place there.  This Waterpik is quite new to me but it seems to do everything I need and does it well, in as compact a space as possible.  The design covers the obvious easy-use buttons and controls, but also has the thoughtful additions of vented storage space for the brushes and irrigator tips, and the little flat spot on the back of the toothbrush handle so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the counter to crash on the floor.  If yours is a designer bathroom you perhaps won&#x27;t care for the bright blue and white color scheme, but that&#x27;s the only down side I can see so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these.  One for myself and one for my son for Christmas.  I think it is a great value and works great for me.  My dentist is always telling me that my gums could use some work.  Can&#x27;t wait for my next appt., so I can hear him say &amp;#34;wow your gums are looking good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> awesome product.  should have had this years ago</li>
            <li> excellent device, much improved over previous models.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. I am very happy with my purchase and feel like my teeth have never been cleaner</li>
            <li> Excellent product bought it for my son he loved it.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for what you get. I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a water pik before.  It is AWESOME!.  My mouth feels so clean after use.  Also great for cleaning teeth after eating food that gets stuck between teeth, where you would normally use a toothpick.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Will not ever be able to use a regular toothbrush or floss again. The product is built really well.</li>
            <li> Bought this the end of Nov 2014 and loved it at first. Month and a half of using it and the high speed in the toothbrush quit. The low speed is for the gums and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cleaning the teeth. Pretty much worthless now. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a Water Pic Water Flosser.  But when I saw this combo pack, I knew I just had to get this one.  It is neat and compact in my bathroom taking up very minimal space on the counter and using only one cord and one plug slot.  And being in one unit, it is a very convenient reminder to use both sides in my dental health care program.  I always hated dental floss, sometimes going extended periods of time between flossing.  The Water Flosser portion was heaven sent and my mouth feels so much better with this total cleaning program.</li>
            <li> I used to hate flossing and I doubt I brushed the recommended 2 minutes. Now my toothbrush tells me when to change quadrants, flossing is no longer a pain (and kind of fun) and my mouth feels super clean every day. Love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only been using this a few days but very happy with the purchase so far. It isn&#x27;t too big of a foot print for my tiny sink. The toothbrush is great- I had a sonicare years ago and this is just as good for way less cost. It&#x27;s my first time using a waterpik and I love it, I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth (a metal bar attached to the backs of my teeth) that I could never thread floss through, such a pain but this makes flossing super easy. My 3 year old and 6 year old are also big fans which is great, getting kids to properly and thoroughly brush and floss isn&#x27;t always easy. I usually don&#x27;t spend money on myself but I have pregnancy gingivitis (bleeding gums) and got this in hopes that it would help, I already have significantly less bleeding! Very happy I treated myself to this unit!</li>
            <li> Great high powered cleaning of my teeth.  Water tank does have to be refilled to finish cleaning.  I would recommend this pik.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m horrible with flossing, even without braces and i knew i really needed to with them so i gave in and bought this guy. i love it. i brush my teeth and follow up with the waterpik and it still finds stuff (tmi?). it works great. i&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own many electric toothbrushes but simply put this is the BEST and you get a waterpik too. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My hubby LOVES the water flosser!</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth fresh and clean</li>
            <li> i like this dental care set product, as including electronic tooth brush and water flosser together. just one shortcoming for me as the working voltage is only 110v used in america but i am living in china, so extra voltage converter needed if you want this product working properly in china.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get one and tried to sell me one at the office at double the price. Works great, mouth and gums never felt so good</li>
            <li> I returned this, because it doesn&#x27;t have some of the features I liked about the original.  An appliance repairman who kept my old one running as long as he could told me that his customers all try to keep their &amp;#34;little cutie&amp;#34; running:  it held four brush heads, four water pik tips, plus the handle for them and a reservoir - all with a very small footprint.  Can&#x27;t understand why the manufacturer stopped making that one.  I do miss the water flossing, though, and may give in and buy one eventually...perhaps the portable water flosser?</li>
            <li> Love it - Excellent purchase for your dental hygiene needs</li>
            <li> Bye, bye floss! I have been using this after get adult braces and only this and went to my latest dental exam and they had to do nothing. The dentist commended me on my dental hygiene. I will never go back to floss after using this. The toothbrush itself if fantastic and automatically turns off after about 2.5 minutes. Great product!</li>
            <li> It is amazing how easy it will clean your teeth. I just love it and also my wife:-) And also I bought second one for my parents in law. They&#x27; ve tried it and ask for it.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Get It..Get it.. Get It&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry</li>
            <li> I brought this system only because it came with a Sonic toothbrush.  The price was also a major contributor.  We use it every day twice a day and we love.  Even my 4 year old loves how it feels on his gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dentist even mentioned to me that my mouth was much healthier than my last visit.  Asked what we were all doing differently.  I told him that we brought a Waterpik and Sonic Toothbrushes and he said WOW good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have since brought another one for the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Even though you have brushed your teeth the waterpik completes the job.&lt;br /&gt;I have difficulty use floss, this is my answer.</li>
            <li> Waterpik quality and works great! This was purchased for a person with very limited counter space.  Two appliances in one base!  Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat it for great oral hygiene!  How can I get one for kids delivered to Mexico?</li>
            <li> Other then poor or lack of instructions, seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> What a great combo! I originally got this thinking the toothbrush would just be a convenient add-on to the waterpik, but I love them both equally! The toothbrush has great battery life, is very sturdy and quality, and has cool features like the 30-second buzz that divides up your brushing time. The waterpik has more tips than I think I&#x27;ll ever use, but I absolutely love it, and I actually consider it *fun* to use. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve certainly never said about regular flossing. It&#x27;s essentially pointing a small, high-powered hose at your face, but after the first use, I&#x27;ve successfully used it without covering myself/my bathroom in water.  I can&#x27;t use it with the casual elegance of the guy in the waterpik ads, but it&#x27;s easy and fairly mess-free.    Two weeks in and I&#x27;m loving this thing, I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is just wonderful.  Everything I hoped for.  Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> very efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans like a pro . Love it , meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> Excellent set!  Best toothbrush with rechargeable storage base &#x3D; No more costly batteries! Replaceable heads avail. too.  Add a little mouthwash to flosser water &amp; enjoy clean teeth, gums &amp; fresh breath!  (Must remember to keep mouth &amp; lips shut, otherwise water everywhere. This just takes a little practice.)  My dentist says my gums &amp; teeth look great which means it was worth the purchase.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this set.  No comparison, I will never brush manually again! Brushing with this is so easy!!!  I would recommend to others who want overall good health, which always starts with good oral health.</li>
            <li> Works great and does what it said it would do!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item. It has everything I want in an electric toothbrush and water flosser in a nice small footprint that fits easily on my counter and is easy to store when company is coming over</li>
            <li> easy to use. and the delivery is very quick.</li>
            <li> Great item however does not include brush heads or floss heads- you need to purchase those items separately. I was  expecting to be able to use the water pick straight out of the box  but had to go purchase brush and floss attachments at a local store.  With the proper  attachments this is the best dental product! I brush &amp; floss more now than ever. Does a much better job than  regular floss.  Surprised to see how many particles regular flossing doesn&#x27;t  get out of teeth.  My entire family loves this water pic!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  It is easy to use.  I have had other flossers and the tank was always difficult to get off to fill.  This is perfect.  And I absolutely love the toothbrush.  What a pleasant surprise.  It has a timer built in so that you spend 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  Love the carry case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I had doubts about this item until I tried it.  It does a super job of cleaning the teeth and gum areas.  I&#x27;m having three crowns replaced soon at a total cost of $2,475 which I could have likely prevented or greatly delayed had I used this product instead of just manual brushing and flossing.  Manual flossing does not get everything out, but this water jet will.  I can also see where the sonic toothbrush will be gentler on the teeth while offering a better cleaning over manual brushing.  There&#x27;s a whole lot of water being sent into your mouth over a short period of time so be sure to have the jet tip in your mouth and be over a sink when you turn it on.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My wife has bridges and this is perfect for cleaning her dental work.</li>
            <li> just what I need for my mouth !</li>
            <li> Toothbrush stopped charging after 11 months. I see a lot of customers have this problem; wish I had read the other reviews first.</li>
            <li> Works great! My teeth and mouth feel so clean after using this its almost like the same feeling as if I just had my teeth polished! I thought these things were all just hype.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it I don&#x27;t like to use my regular tooth brush anymore. Its also smaller then I thought it would be.  And it didn&#x27;t take up nearly as much counter space as I thought it would - very compact and everything fits all together nicely. The toothbrush part feels very solid like something that will last a long time.  The rest of the product is plastic but still feels well made and designed.  The water pick has a good strong stream and you can really feel it getting in all the crevices and spaces.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have only been using it for a week but every time I use it my teeth feel cleaner. They even look whiter. I recently got braces and they were the reason I purchased this unit, it is gentle enough for the braces to be safe but it also has enough water pressure to clean throughly. It takes some time to learn how to use it and not take a shower when you do but I believe I will get used to it sooner or later. I gave it four stars because eventually you will be needing to replace many parts, I still would have bought it but I would have included all of the replacements I will eventually be needing.</li>
            <li> very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;excellent!!!</li>
            <li> great deal great product, replaced my oral-b with this tandem ...... works fantastic....both items</li>
            <li> brush is very good, another part of set so so</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way. Just the right size &amp; I love the all in one.</li>
            <li> Bought this about 2 months ago, after about a month the charger light indicator stopped working. I was hoping it was just the lights but in fact it was the unit. So fantastic 2 months use and now throw it away. Flawed product will never buy another</li>
            <li> I love it for cleaning around my gumline. This product helped improve my overall oral health would definitely recommend this for people who had oral problems and implants.</li>
            <li> my teeth and gums haven&#x27;t looked so good in ages. cuts back on all those deep cleanings at the dentist</li>
            <li> Love the unit.teeth feel so much cleaner. Very easy to use.and I love the pick.can&#x27;t wait for my next dental appt, to see if using the pic made a difference.</li>
            <li> Great product and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I would never floss without this. Also, the fact that the toothbrush comes with it saves you like $80.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective the toothbrush was going to be because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my previous electric toothbrush. To my surprise this toothbrush works excellently!  I like the Waterpik too. I recommend this product. Great investment.</li>
            <li> this is the second one we purchased as my husband has one, and now I have one</li>
            <li> Works very well, however, I really think the waterpik flosser start button should have been designed differently. Instead of pushing it to start it, you have to push it to turn it off. It&#x27;s just a headache.</li>
            <li> We do get complete care with this Waterpik device at an attractive price.  The &amp;#34;but&amp;#34; is that the hose to the water pik is so flimsy is distracting.  Yet everything works like it should and my gums thank me for the new Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I Love this it makes your mouth feel clean &amp; fresh.  Would recommend this complete care to everyone</li>
            <li> i had an oral B toothbrush that i loved but collected mold on the handle after a while. I decided to try this since I wanted a good quality electric toothbrush as well as a water flosser. My husband has another model of Waterpik, and he also likes his, but I feel this is a better deal... GREAT toothbrush and water flosser in one. The vibrations are strong, but i still feel like it does a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Feeling very good, clean</li>
            <li> You have never truly experienced life until you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth with an electric toothbrush. Then you can blast your gums with the handy dandy sprayer which also does an amazing job of cleaning the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Works well, toothbrush is like a sonicare</li>
            <li> This cheap little thing cannot keep your teeth as clean as the traditional flosser, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the whole build quality is rather poor.&lt;br /&gt;No reliable medical evidence support for these water flosser will benefit your health.&lt;br /&gt;And for the price, puff...</li>
            <li> Love it the best feeling ever!</li>
            <li> Works like a champ &amp;#34;Feels fresh after every Brush&amp;#34; I give 7 Star</li>
            <li> Best money i have every spent on my mouth</li>
            <li> I just got it Wednesday and I love it. Great product; worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik works well, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results- gets in places where the toothbrush misses. Now my wife wants to use it. :-)</li>
            <li> Toothbrush head no good</li>
            <li> awesome..it really does a great job on my teeth..i like that it has all features in one ...tooth brush and water flosser..easy to fill....great assortment of pics ....my teeth really feel clean and healthy...</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and most helpful to clean teeth and get between gums and enamel and makes mouth feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush as much as the water flosser. I like having the 2 in 1 unit to reduce bathroom counter clutter. The unit works great.</li>
            <li> I have so many dental implants, and it helps a lot clenning all</li>
            <li> Got this as I just had braces put on. The water pick operates flawlessly. The toothbrush beats Sonic Care hands down! But be warned it is strong. The orthodontist and dental hygienist have both commented on what excellent care I take of my teeth. It is all due to using this unit religiously.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long.  This thing has improved my oral hygiene 100% .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much of a difference a water flosser and good electric toothbrush can make. Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been a SonicCare toothbrush user, but I honestly think this toothbrush does just as good of a job. And the water flosser makes a huge difference that you can see which in one use. I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Just had my bi-annual check up at the dentist.  They hygenist said, &amp;#34;you leave me nothing to do&amp;#34; and the dentist said, your oral health care is so excellent everything looks perfect.  If you try this, you are going to be incredibly happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Got the pik for my 12 getting braces.  Works wonderful to help keep her mouth clean</li>
            <li> Chinese customers are satisfied</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and works like a charm!  I love it!  You can&#x27;t beat the price for a sonic toothbrush and a waterpik!</li>
            <li> Nice unit. if you have more than one person using it you must buy additional brushes and tips.  I like the pause feature on the water pik, it helps keep the bathroom cleaner.  ome thing they don&#x27;t address is  should you keep the brush on charge and fully charged or run it down. a non charging holder or switch for the tooth brush charger would e an improvement</li>
            <li> This replaces my old Waterpik unit I used for many years, but the plastic has finally met it&#x27;s demise.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the toothbrush, but I do like it and know it will improve my overall dental health.  Overall very good quality and design, BUT,,,  Would have given it five stars if they offered a travel charger - talked to CS and they don&#x27;t have a solution.  I travel 17 days a month and a full charge only lasts about two weeks and I&#x27;m not going to buy a separate electric toothbrush.  Also, they only offer soft bristle tooth brush replacements, which are outrageously expensive.  Other brands are cheaper and you can get replacements for them from Sam&#x27;s Club much cheaper than Waterpik, which I found out after I bought this unit.  (If I had it to do over again,,,,  )</li>
            <li> I love this product, I cannot believe what was being missed during my previous brushing processes. I will be getting as gifts for some friends.</li>
            <li> Although I like it, be aware, the water pic flow cut off button stopped working properly within a very short time. I make do without it.</li>
            <li> does a great job! my teeth feel like I just had them cleaned at the dentist office</li>
            <li> I just got this today and I love it. The water pick works great. The tooth brush is also awesome. I am so happy that I did order this. My mouth feels like I just had a deep cleaning done at the dentists and not a painful one either.</li>
            <li> The combo of of a toothbrush and a waterpik for under 100 dollars can not be beat.  The toothbrush is very high quality.  It is near imposable to get all of the stuff out between your teeth with floss.  I wish I had the product 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> It sounds too loud when it works but overall a nice thing to have.</li>
            <li> This setup works great, I wish the water bowl would hold a little more.  It may just push my dentist cleaning visits.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a great electric toothbrush when I came across this. I love it! It makes brushing/flossing so much fun. I also use dental floss as well, but the combination really makes my teeth feel clean and shiny. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and are now used as well will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  There is a learning curve with the water pik.  Like, keep your mouth closed so you don&#x27;t spray the mirror.  I flossed after using the pik the floss came out clean.</li>
            <li> 1 unit with a toothbrush and a floss, also comes with a travethe Waterpik text several times to learn to use, the more you the easier it is to use.The Waterpik take several times to learn to use, more use the easier it is to use.</li>
            <li> I was told to buy a waterpik by my dentist  because I have tight teeth that are difficult to floss. I have been using this as my flosser and it makes my teeth feel so clean. I bought 2, one for myself and one for my mother as a birthday gift.  The toothbrush works great as well but I didn&#x27;t realize that the base had to be plugged in for it to recharge. Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> Very good teeth waterline used, and the price is very appropriate, very affordable</li>
            <li> The one stop shot for a cleaner healthier mouth. It takes a couple of weeks to get used to, but eventually you&#x27;ll crank it up to 10 and be amazed at how much stuff this device will take out of your gums.</li>
            <li> price vs goods very good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this unit for two weeks now and I can definitely feel the clean difference! The sonic brush is awesome and more powerful than the Phillips Sonicare. My only problem is after two weeks the brush can&#x27;t hold a charge, but that&#x27;s ok cause with the two year warranty that comes with the unit Waterpik is sending me a entire new unit to keep for free. Now I have two!  Best health investment I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li> This is what is called a s***. Man, you better buy it. Its the best to clean ur teeth. 11/10</li>
            <li> This water pic does not replace flossing. It does however clean really well. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get one</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Noticed a difference in the first use.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush and flossed for about a year now and love it!  did find the replacement brushes are better though.  The water flosser is wonderful and have noticed my gums no longer are tender.</li>
            <li> Daughter got braces and she loves this !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this toothbrush!! We had an OralB electric toothbrush for years, and it was finally dying. Within a week or so of replacing it with this Water Pik sonic toothbrush, I realized how sad I was that I had waited so long to ditch the old toothbrush! This sonic toothbrush makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office after a cleaning. I literally drive to work in the morning running my tongue over my teeth marveling in how amazingly smooth and polished they feel! You&#x27;ve really got to try this. And the Water Pik is really nice too. I like that it&#x27;s all one unit that doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love the double Pik.  I thought it was discontinued, or maybe it was and came back.  In any case, it is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few months ago and liked it however now it does not work and I will probably not buy another one again for this is too much money to pay for a device that doesn&#x27;t even last six months. So back to the old fashion dental floss, which is a shame I liked the waterpik when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Tracy</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a regular toothbrush. I love that there are several water pik attachments and water dispensing options.</li>
            <li> I love the electric toothbrush, along with the water pik.  They both keep my teeth so clean!!  It is hard to find  them both together!!&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Fannon, Seminole, Florida</li>
            <li> Does all it promises to do and after 3 or 4 months of use I have very few complaints. My main one is that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a medium speed - the low setting is a little too wimpy but the high setting feels like my gums are getting brushed right out of existence</li>
            <li> WHAT A DEAL,THE TOOTHBRUSH ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE. I LOVE THE WATERPIC, I AM 60 YEARS OLD AND CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I WAITED THIS LONG TO TRY ONE,I LOOK FOWARD TO USING IT EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t always get everything and it takes a bit longer but overall you get a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Have had a Waterpik water flosser and Sensonic toothbruth for eons. It was time to get new ones.&lt;br /&gt;This is even better. I highly recommend it. Do not know how I could do without it!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, one of the best toothbrushes and water piks</li>
            <li> Love it don&#x27;t know how I lived&lt;br /&gt;My life without it. I had a different one before but there was no place to leave the attachment on the outside so had to take it off each time. With this one don&#x27;t have to do that .</li>
            <li> Love it and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this unit!  Can&#x27;t believe I went all these years without it.  Add  a little mouthwash for a cool tingling was floss.  I would not recommend using it to clean your ears though, the thought crossed my mind but I opted out!</li>
            <li> The machine works well; however, the water pick pause button (which is a must) sticks in the paused position and can only be taken off pause by thumping the button.  Difficult to do when you have this thing in your mouth.  The toothbrush is great in any case.</li>
            <li> I bought this combo to replace a sink-attaching water flosser and a SoniCare e-series toothbrush when the battery stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On gentle mode, the toothbrush is nowhere near as strong as the SoniCare, but on high, it&#x27;s stronger. Some people might find it to be too powerful, but I like it! I also like the quad timer - it keeps me from focusing too much on one area of my mouth. The travel case is also nice &amp; sturdy. The toothbrush itself also seems more sturdy than the SoniCare - it&#x27;s heavier and the brush head is held in place better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can use Listerine in the flosser, but I wish the power could go higher. I got much better force with my sink-attaching one.</li>
            <li> A little getting used to at first but this thing sure knocks the crap out of your teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> Awesome. A must have for cleaning teeth. I had many implants done and flossing was not getting food particles out until I used this pik. I was very skeptical before using this but now I can&#x27;t live without it. I use it at least twice a day and each time I eat. It gets under and between very well especially in max setting 9 or 10.  It is very powerful compared to other water jets from walmart. I even bought a portable travel water pik.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty good report at the dentist after using this for several months.  I bought it for the Waterpik feature to try to prevent losing more teeth due to ill-fitting implants.  Bone loss at extraction made food traps between implants and natural teeth.  I find the toothbrush okay, but I feel the bristles are too widely spaced; I still feel roughness on my tooth surfaces after brushing.  I wish there were denser brush heads available.</li>
            <li> The water pik feature leaks from the bottom of the unit when I stop the flow of water with the button on the handle.</li>
            <li> My husband has enjoyed using the Waterpik.  Very easy and thoroughly cleans.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  I originally bought the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660) on Prime Day but ended up returning it because it didn&#x27;t seem to produce enough pressure.  But this one is AWESOME!  I have bonded retainers on top and bottom following having braces and it&#x27;s tough to clean around them.  This water flosser does the trick!  AND this is my first sonic toothbrush and love it as well!  Having both in one setup is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> works nicely, but a bit noisy. Other than that it is good.</li>
            <li> Best decision I made for my teeth ahaha got to keep them clean though, it&#x27;s a must have people!!</li>
            <li> Machine is easy enough to use. I felt like it was doing an OK job but within the week I started using it my gums were a little uncomfortable. I thought it was just the WaterPik flosser, well 2 months later at the dentist yesterday I got the worst dental report of ever gone. I usually use manual toothbrush. I spent 2 years using the sonicare. I am extremely disappointed I brushed twice a day for the full two minutes. And flossed every single day with the flosser. Going to throw this away! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean, other than a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. Wish I had bought this years go.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I bought this because my dentist said I needed expensive scaling. I don&#x27;t have bleeding gums or any obvious visual signs of gum damage so I decided to take a do it yourself approach. Overall it&#x27;s better than just brushing your teeth alone.  I love the Sonic tooth brush.  Mouth feels really clean with it.  The waterpik is good too, but less than 5 minutes during the first use, the pause button quit working. So if I don&#x27;t turn off the machine in between rinses, water sprays everywhere. I didn&#x27;t return it because I expected that most of them were going to leak in some form or another. It isn&#x27;t a reservoir leak so I can deal with turning it off and on during use. My gums do look a bit healthier and I am only using original Listerine and Hydrogen Peroxide as my cleaning material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have an all in one waterpik and sonic toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have to have multiple cords. The brush is very powerful, the replacement heads are affordable, and this unit comes with two of them already. Plus it has lots of attachments for the flosser. One guy was saying he gets the bathroom wet and it can be messy. I&#x27;ve found that instead of keeping my mouth open a little like the instructions say, I close it completely and just open it a little when it gets full of water. This works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Came in nice packaging; items were well protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes a carrying case for two brush heads and the main brush itself.  The main machine has the floss attached and a little brush/tip container that allows air flow to enhance drying.  The two clear glass parts are detachable for washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long power cord can be crammed into the bottom of the base to hide and then run through a small cut out at the bottom so it stays in place at any customized length you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss pressure gets pretty high actually and the pressure works pretty well.  The one problem I had was that the machine itself is loud.  Really loud.  On the level of my phone on vibrate while sitting on a tin surface.  This is only while using the floss stick.  I&#x27;ll probably only use it in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have awful dental habits.  The main issue being I&#x27;m crazy CRAZY LAZY.  The best part of this set is that the toothbrush feels wonderful on my gums.  It&#x27;s almost like a massage and the bristles really clearing out between my teeth.  The floss water does get in-between my teeth really well and it feels refreshing.  Surprisingly, it really does give you the feeling of going to your dentist... without the gross gloves smell and sharp objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The many heads of the floss really motivates me to try each one.  I&#x27;m genuinely excited to brush and floss... like a weirdo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used only one day.  Will update if anything goes wrong.  If you see this review years from now, it&#x27;s because it still works like a charm.</li>
            <li> got this as gift for husband because he has problems with his gums. works great when used daily.</li>
            <li> Works great and at only a fraction of the cost from such stores  stores such as Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a product that is exactly as advertised. The water flosser is great; no more floss fingers for me!  Having said that, using the flosser does take some getting used to.  I found that a setting of 9 was needed to really clean my teeth. This results in a sound that ran my cat out of the bathroom the first time I used it.  It is definitely not something you should plan on using outside of your sleeping baby&#x27;s or significant others room.  There is a learning curve in positioning the flosser correctly so that the water hits the bottom and backs of all your teeth.  Once you&#x27;ve mastered it, your teeth will feel dentist clean every time you use the flosser.  My one complaint is for the Sonic Toothbrush. I found the 1st setting to be too soft and the 2nd setting to be too high, no mid-range available.  I used a Braun  electric toothbrush with a small round head befor the Waterpik, so getting used to the larger head on the Waterpik is difficult.  Overall, however, my teeth are clean and my gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li> We bought this after a suggestion from our dentist when we disclosed our less than perfect flossing habits (non habits). It won&#x27;t replace flossing entirely however I find it much easier to be on top of oral health when its fun /enjoyable. The water pik flosser portion is essentially a pressure washer for your teeth and destroys that annoying plaque build up on the gumline and other debris in between teeth.  For those with bridges, braces or teeth with no gaps this is way way easier than flossing and it comes with a variety of heads to use to tackle different problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things of note,&lt;br /&gt;The pressure settings from 0-10 are nice to customize for those with sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Tooth brush has 2 power settings&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it yet but it does include the use of listerine in the flosser directions&lt;br /&gt;The size is fairly compact for the 2 items in one unless you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy with water spraying</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this product.  Skeptical that the toothbrush wasn&#x27;t &#x27;Sonicare&#x27; branded, but  would buy again.  Be sure to click the toothbrush button twice to put it in &#x27;high&#x27; mode</li>
            <li> great product though larger than my last one.</li>
            <li> The WP-900 really gets our teeth clean. The kids even enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s only 2 speeds. low and super high!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I particularly like the fact that both the toothbrush and waterpik are combined. I&#x27;m sure they ARE working together to improve my dental health!</li>
            <li> It is like going to the dentist everyday! It is a great system having both the brush and flosser in one, and being rechargable. It feels alittle flimsy like all plastic items do, but with care it should last. I wish I had bought this years ago. One feature that I like is the little pause as it times the brushing of each quadrant of your mouth and shuts off after a full 2 minute cycle. The reviews helped me make the decision to purchase this...they were right on.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, can&#x27;t believe how much debris is left over after normal brushing. Recommend this to F &amp; F.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Comlete is not as convenient as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I assume it does what it says..but it is a pain to have out on the counter and a bit of a hassle to use.  The water floss seems to leak and you have to be over the sink constantly..don&#x27;t have your clothes on for the day when you use this..dress after!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have bought one for me and one for my husband.  Wish I had been using a water pick for years.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is easy to use and my gums and teeth are enjoying the experience. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> This thing is a life-saver and a great deal.  I love the water pick, and the toothbrush is comparable to a Sonicare without being ridiculously pricey. The toothbrush took some getting used to, because the entire thing vibrates rather than just the head, so it tickled my hand a lot...it was a weird sensation... but I&#x27;m over it, and it gets the job done effectively and efficiently. The water pick was also an interesting experience the first time... I got water all over the place, but you eventually figure out how to use it properly and it all works out.  This product has improved my teeth and gum health so much. I was developing gingivitis, and my gums were super uncomfortable. I have been using this consistently for the last two months with mouth wash, and let me tell you, the pain is gone. It&#x27;s a great investment, I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  The first one I got had a toothbrush that lost its charge after I traveled with it, and would regain charge.  The seller sent me a replacement, and it&#x27;s worked great.  If it wasn&#x27;t for that small issue, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My dentist suggested I get something like this and after reading reviews, I decided on this one.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and I can&#x27;t believe I have gone so long without one of these.  It is amazing how much food the water pik removes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Waterpik Complete for about a year and have loved it.  However, the battery in the toothbrush is not been holding a charge. do they make replacement tooth brushes?</li>
            <li> Great product. Ten times better than using dental floss.</li>
            <li> We wanted this unit for use in our RV.  It more than serves the purpose for both of us.</li>
            <li> After my last visit to the dentist I was told that I had slight gum disease and that I need to do better at flossing. So after some research I bought this waterpik. I love the way my teeth feel after I use the water flosser, I have tried almost all the attachments. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the hygienist says at my next appointment. I do recommend this for maintaining healthy gums.</li>
            <li> excellent.  I love it</li>
            <li> love it and enjoying it</li>
            <li> veramente buono contento dell&#x27;acquisto</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a sonic care toothbrush and Waterpik.  How delighted I was to find the Waterpik WP-900!  It is compact and fits perfectly on my small vanity.  The quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> works well. feels like a regular dental cleaning. good pressure with the waterpik as well.</li>
            <li> You definitely see a difference with this system about a week or two later of using it. Waterflossing makes flossing all that more enjoyable and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Works great kids love it</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare for years and switched when mine broke.  This brush is definitely powerful and the two settings are perfect.  The flosser works great but the button has begun to stick and make it hard to start and stop.  Be careful not to set the flosser too high because it will hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  The toothbrush does not hold a charge enough for 2 min.</li>
            <li> Very nice that both tools are in one combined unit. Takes up much less space on the counter. The reservoir does go through the water quickly. Would reorder this unit.</li>
            <li> I like to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought as present for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> My son and daughter love it. Say their mouths have never felt so fresh and teeth so clean. It&#x27;s nice to have all dental appliances in one to save space and stuff falling off shelf. Waterpik products have never broken on me in the past and I trustbthis will last years as well. The whole family can use by trading out brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare as well oral b, none comes even close to this one. I can see difference on first use. Water flosser is great. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> havent been able to use it much but its better than a trip to the dentest.add to it the sonic toothbrush &amp; my mouth has never felt so clean.I give it 5+ stars to this seller</li>
            <li> This works great, my kids even like using it on lower settings. I have two crowns and this really gets all the yuck out. Use on the lowest setting and work your way up, gums will bleed if its too high at first.</li>
            <li> This is a great combination!  I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a sonic toothbrush but was having a hard time justifying the cost.  When I needed to replace my Waterpik, I was excited to see this cost effective combination.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Fast shipping excellent product!</li>
            <li> Waterpik is very messy, and cumbersome. No real clear precise instructions on use this tip and how to adjust water-flow....very disappointed in the purchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this waterpik! Saved me from going to the periodontist!! Was on a 4 month cleaning interval at the dentist and am now on a regular 6 month interval. Again can&#x27;t say enough! Yes, you need to empty the reservoir ever time you&#x27;re done. When you use it, fill it with whatever temp water is comfortable for your teeth and wipe it all down after your done to keep it nice and to prevent mildew.</li>
            <li> This worked great when we first got it but after a few months the flosser wont spray very hard. But, the toothbrush still works great.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Comes with plenty of heads for the toothbrush and waterpik.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations.  It&#x27;s as they say..&amp;#34;a game changer&amp;#34;.  I have had continual problems with deep gum pockets and related infections for years. After using this for a few weeks haven&#x27;t had a single problem. Due to my problems I brush &amp; floss vigorously and I was amazed at the amount of food particles that came out with water pick after I had brushed and flossed normally.</li>
            <li> Compact, good quality, good price.  I like having everything in one place.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month ago, with recommendations from a friend. It works amazingly. The toothbrush is awesome and has timers for each quadrant of your mouth. The waterpik itself is sooooooo(I can&#x27;t add enough o&#x27;s) amazing. I have braces and anyone who has or has had them knows it takes forever to thread floss through each and every tooth. This machine takes a little over a minute to clean out everything especially the back that&#x27;s hard to reach. Once I&#x27;m done, my teeth feel like I just got done at the dentist&#x27;s office. I would recommend this product to everyone. It really is awesome.</li>
            <li> WOW. Just wow. Got a sonicare toothbrush from a friend a few years back and the toothbrush that comes with this kit, BLOWS my sonicare out of the water. Also, the water flosser is the most ingenious hygienic invention ever. You don&#x27;t need to get your fingers dirty and covered in saliva trying to floss, and don&#x27;t have to deal with bleeding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how powerful the water flosser is. MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> Only had system for a couple of weeks, I wish I( had done this a long time ago!!! So far, I love it!!! Purchased 2 of these for me and my wife, she loves it also!!!</li>
            <li> This appliance has everything. There is an electric toothbrush. Two double speed heads are always fully charged. It has multiple pics for caring for your gums, fighting plaque and just feeling really orally fresh and clean. The pause button is particularly useful unless you enjoy an unexpected bast of streaming water shooting up your nostril. Hey, a neti!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The pics are easy to put onto the pic-head and to remove.. The clear plastic reservoir  makes it easy to track how much water is left during your cleansing routine. It does seem to run out of water quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had had this years ago. My dentist has smiled after my routine visits ever since I acquired this Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. It is more compact than expected and fits nicely on the bathroom counter. Pleasantly surprised by the toothbrush features. While the waterpik is a bit messy to use and will take practice to not spray myself, I think it is going to be very helpful and save on dentist costs in the long run. My hygenist has been after me for over a year to get one and this version was a great price.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a week and love it!  I am someone who has always hated flossing.  It takes too long and I can never find a floss that I really like.  Plus, it&#x27;s a challenge to reach those teeth in the back.  This little machine solves all those issues.  Not only is it easy to use, but I feel like it&#x27;s doing a much better job than regular flossing ever did.  I have one area of receding gums from brushing too hard, and this seems to be getting it cleaner than regular floss, and it&#x27;s not causing any sensitivity issues.  I took another reviewers advice and have been adding a little bit of mouthwash to the water and it just makes my mouth feel so fresh.  And the toothbrush is pretty nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note to buyers:  It&#x27;s not a quiet machine.  It kind of sounds like a tiny pressure washer.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but some might find this to be an issue.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old toothrush and waterpick. Takes up less room and is much stronger.  Well worth the price. It was an excellent price and came on time and in perfect condition. I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> Got for a gift and they loved it!</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely.  Product does a great job cleaning gums and teeth.  Just wish toothbrush has more accessories.  Tongue cleaner etc.  For the price this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I have used both the waterpik and electric toothbrush once, after just receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did we live without one for so long.  It is an amazing product.  If it is as durable as it is effective, it will be a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After recent dental work, a waterpik was recommended by our Mexican Dentist.  We are looking for a long term relationship with our Dentist and our Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as advertised, and is expected to help maintain our dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be on the spendy side, but compared with the cost of dental treatment, it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> Great clean feeling every morning and night</li>
            <li> Cleans better than expected.  I was a little anxious, as I have crown throughout my mouth.  Other &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleaners actually loosened my crowns.  This, however, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I like it. It help me to protect my teeth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> i like it ！depand on it every meal。</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fabulous. It&#x27;s somewhat compact and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this yrs ago. My dentist suggested it and just love it. Took a few times to get used to it. I think this product is going to save my teeth.</li>
            <li> works well . easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different electric toothbrushes, but this one has worked so well I bought a system just to use for my dogs.  They don&#x27;t seem to mind much, but then I&#x27;ve been doing their teeth since they were babies.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my dentist recommended it however I barely use it. It&#x27;s too big to fit on the landing in my bathroom and it is very loud. I can only use this when everyone is awake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just ordered for the Waterpik to replace  old one, but really impressed with tooth-brush, especially high-speed setting. No gum problems since getting and teeth feel &amp;#34;detailed&amp;#34; after each brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this because of the different attachments included with the water flosse; as well as being to adjust the speed of the flossing. I also like the fact that it takes little counter space wirh it being both the toothbrush &amp; flosser.  It is so easy to use and I am able to switch up and use Periodex with the water, or my mouthwash for Dry Mouth.  Hygenist has seen great improvement.</li>
            <li> My wife + I love it.  Hope it lasts as long as previous WaterPik-30 yrs.Best price on Amazon by far.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this now I am looking for a travel version wit h110 and 220 electrical options</li>
            <li> Works better than advertised.  A little messy but does the job.  I&#x27;ll never go back to just a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I&#x27;ve purchased. I take very good care of my teeth and can&#x27;t imagine not having this. After using this for a short time my teeth felt cleaner then right after a dentist visit. I purchased a portable flosser and toothbrush to use in our RV, but after 10 days my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel very clean. So I purchased this identical unit for the camper. My teeth and gums have never been healthier and dentist cleanings are a breeze. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> very nice experience, to protect my teeth very well</li>
