            <li>This mousse provides excellent lift at the crown without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>This is the best Mousse I have ever used, did not weigh down my hair and yet could style my hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years now and it works well with my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>Delivered quick!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have found this product to be amazing in so far as it adds volume and body to my hair.</li>
            <li>When I blow out my hair it is smooth and has lift.  </li>
            <li>Use in conjunction with Moroccan oil light.</li>
            <li>I have to say that since two products I loved and lived by were taken off the market (that kept my hair looking superb), I have been unable to find replacements for them - one was a product by Icon called Sultry (this was for volume and was fantastic...</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this for our very curly, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky feeling....and it smells soooo nice!!</li>
            <li>I love Moroccan Oil (the pure oil)  </li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t anything better than stuff you can buy at the store for way cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I love all moroccan oil products and I have very curly/frizzy hair</li>
            <li>However, the moroccan oil volumizing mousse was just okay, didn&#x27;t really give &amp;</li>
            <li>Great product - been using for several years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the oil and curling lotion much better!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are nice too, but after a couple of days of use I switch to a different shampoo because of product &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been using this for nearly a year and love it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work but keeps the hold for days, Extra bonus it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Although a bit pricey, I have been very pleased with the curl and control it creates-I usually air dry, but works great with a diffuser, as well.</li>
            <li>They are all very color safe and most have an awesome, intense scent base.</li>
            <li>Product is very soft and light.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the Doctor ordered</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the scent...will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>However it gives it  hair so much body!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser first introduced me to this.</li>
            <li>It has a light hold but still allows my hair to swing free and natural and stay soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Feels good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff at all.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and makes your hair fuller while, if you&#x27;re like me, trying to tame fly-a-ways</li>
            <li>It kind of weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>They never fail to hold my natural curl whether I am in North Carolina or hot Arizona!  </li>
            <li>I can air dry or style my hair and have fabulous results!  </li>
            <li>Luv this for my blonde, fine hair.</li>
            <li>no stiffness, just full body); the other was Dove Volumizing Shampoo (no longer made, but was also fabulous for my hair).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for styling and shine, but is a little heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, the entire Moroccan Oil line is fantastic, lightweight mouse that really gives my hair bounce and helps to hold the curl.</li>
            <li>Works really well on curly hair</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner from Moroccan Oil, but the Mousse is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It also tends to make your hair a bit greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Really does add volume and bounce to hair.</li>
            <li>you dont need alot in your hair, too much will make it look greasy....</li>
            <li>For the amount of money this cost, I expected more.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft, voluminous, super healthy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Needs a little more punch.</li>
            <li>It also washes out of my hair easily and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out.</li>
            <li>I started with the oil, then the hairspray and now I pretty much use the entire line (for curly hair).  </li>
            <li>It did tame my frizz although it is a bit drying (as most mousse&#x27;s are.)</li>
            <li>This is not a bad mousse however  not sure I really want to pay this much for it again because I did not see that it gave my hair much volume.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, and this holds up to humidity.</li>
            <li>It really gives a nice shine to my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first mousse I have tried that actually works.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I expected more after reading some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I have a modern pixie cut that is longer on one side than the other.</li>

            <li> Really does add volume and bounce to hair.</li>
            <li> you dont need alot in your hair, too much will make it look greasy....</li>
            <li> For the amount of money this cost, I expected more.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft, voluminous, super healthy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Needs a little more punch.</li>
            <li> It also washes out of my hair easily and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out.</li>
            <li> I started with the oil, then the hairspray and now I pretty much use the entire line (for curly hair).  </li>
            <li> It did tame my frizz although it is a bit drying (as most mousse&#x27;s are.)</li>
            <li> This is not a bad mousse however  not sure I really want to pay this much for it again because I did not see that it gave my hair much volume.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, and this holds up to humidity.</li>
            <li> It really gives a nice shine to my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first mousse I have tried that actually works.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and manageable</li>

            <li> I have a modern pixie cut that is longer on one side than the other.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and with little volume.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time!</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair body and allows me to style my fine, thin hair without being too heavy.</li>

            <li> I have oily hair at the scalp, but the ends can get dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair dry or sticky like some other mousses.  </li>
            <li> The mousse did not give my hair the lift I expected</li>
            <li> Everything as expected!</li>
            <li> I like other Moroccan Oil products</li>
            <li> Does not leave the curls &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like other mousses.</li>
            <li> No oily or heavy feeling when dry.</li>
            <li> There is virtually no smell and it weighs heavy on my short hair, even just using a small amount.  </li>
            <li> This product manages to protect my ends, without causing my scalp to become oily and weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is now dry and dull.  </li>

            <li> Does not leave hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I get a small amount of the product to use, but I am loosing patience and might just throw it out.</li>
            <li> It manages to hold my thick, heavy hair and gives it plenty of volume.  </li>
            <li> My canister came with a broken cap which means I can travel with it.  </li>
            <li> I use a few products in this line and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any weird odors that linger either.</li>
            <li> so that was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> very difficult to squirt out the mousse.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this mousse.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Max123</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my hair.  I can air dry or style my hair and have fabulous results!  Full of body!</li>
            <li> I like volume at the crown and this product delivers.  Love it!  I use a few products in this line and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the Doctor ordered</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil NEVER disappoints. I would recommend this to anyone who loves volume in their hair and prefers mousse over gel.</li>
            <li> This is the first mousse I have tried that actually works. It will not make your hair greasy and will keep it in place. I like extra volume and this mousse will provide it</li>
            <li> This is a great product and arrived quickly.  Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Adds volume without frizz.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected! Good product arrived on time!No problems at all with the service or product. Would order it again when I need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while but it really isn&#x27;t anything better than stuff you can buy at the store for way cheaper.  I thought it would help add more shine to my hair since it&#x27;s made with the moroccan oil but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Delivered quick!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time but bought from a salon.  This has NO smell like the Moroccan Oil line. I love this mouse but will not reorder again.  The smell is why I buy it.</li>
            <li> Great mousse - not drying.</li>
            <li> I love all moroccan oil products and I have very curly/frizzy hair so the oil works wonders for me.  The mousse, however, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with.  It didn&#x27;t give me any extra volume.  It did tame my frizz although it is a bit drying (as most mousse&#x27;s are.) Overall, I like the oil and curling lotion much better!</li>
            <li> Works really well on curly hair</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s great for styling and shine, but is a little heavy for my fine hair. The shampoo and conditioner are nice too, but after a couple of days of use I switch to a different shampoo because of product &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Awesome. Works better than supermarket products. Smells Great.  Keeps hair hydrated. You&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product ... Will buy again ! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product on my hair.  Makes my hair manageable and easy to style.</li>
            <li> While I loved the smell,I found that the mousse did not give my hair volumn nor did it have any hold to it.  I have fine hair so I was looking  for a product that would give me some volumn while keeping the volumn throughout the day.  This did neither.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad mousse however  not sure I really want to pay this much for it again because I did not see that it gave my hair much volume.</li>
            <li> very difficult to squirt out the mousse. the nozzle seems to be faulty. I get a small amount of the product to use, but I am loosing patience and might just throw it out. Next time I&#x27;ll just buy it from my hairdresser, where I could return it without a hassle.</li>
            <li> Love this product, helps my hair look like I have thicker hair with lots of body. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil (the pure oil)  It really gives a nice shine to my thin hair.  However, the moroccan oil volumizing mousse was just okay, didn&#x27;t really give &amp;#34;my hair &amp;#34;the lift it needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the Moroccan Oil line! This mousse definitely does not change that opinion. I have a modern pixie cut that is longer on one side than the other. This mousse provides excellent lift at the crown without weighing hair down. As always all Moroccan products allow your hair to remain manageable throughout the day, after applying product. They are all very color safe and most have an awesome, intense scent base. I use the volumizing shampoo and conditioner as well as the volumizing mousse and luminous hairspray. My hair routine wouldn&#x27;t be the same without Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> This  is a companion product that works well with the  Moroccan  Oil hair volumizing products. I highly recommend it. it is very light and does not leave residue on hair.</li>
            <li> This Moroccan mouse works great on my hair.  It manages to hold my thick, heavy hair and gives it plenty of volume.  I love the scent...will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan products and this mousse is great</li>
            <li> Great product.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil for a number of years now.  It started because I just loved how it smells....then I was like &amp;#34;and it&#x27;s a great product too!!&amp;#34;.  I started with the oil, then the hairspray and now I pretty much use the entire line (for curly hair).  This is a great mouse.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky feeling....and it smells soooo nice!!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner from Moroccan Oil, but the Mousse is not what I expected. It kind of weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Love the body this gives my hair, and the smell... oh, the smell!  I love the smell of Moroccan Oil products!!  Doesn&#x27;t make hair dry or sticky like some other mousses.  Good price compared to at the salon.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS and all the Moroccan products. They make your hair amazingly shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an ok mousse but a bit pricey. It also tends to make your hair a bit greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Really does add volume and bounce to hair. It&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> doesnt work as well as others</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff it gives my hair more body and protects it from all the heat products I use</li>
            <li> I have oily hair at the scalp, but the ends can get dry.  This product manages to protect my ends, without causing my scalp to become oily and weigh down my hair.  When I blow out my hair it is smooth and has lift.  The smell is fantastic too!  This is by far the best hair styling product I have used.</li>
            <li> very nice product, has an OK smell and leaves your hair nice &amp;  soft! you dont need alot in your hair, too much will make it look greasy....I found that out quickly enough!</li>
            <li> Satisfied.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product and was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have been using it for years now and it works well with my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I expected more after reading some of the other reviews. I was looking for a mousse that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and brittle which this mousse does. On the other hand the holding power is great and it has a good scent. It also washes out of my hair easily and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out. This is a good product, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this mousse.  It left my hair soft and with little volume.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mousse because of the Argan oil it contains.This product gives my hair body and allows me to style my fine, thin hair without being too heavy. It has a nice, light fragrance. My hair feels softer and more moisturized since using this mousse.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work but keeps the hold for days, Extra bonus it smells so good!</li>
            <li> did not feel like I got any volume</li>
            <li> I USE THIS MOUSSE DAILY AND I LOVE ALL THE MOROCCAN OIL PRODUCTS. IT IS CHEAPER AT AMAZON THEN AT MY HAIRDRESSER&#x27;S.</li>
            <li> Luv this for my blonde, fine hair. Use in conjunction with Moroccan oil light. You will luv your hair. I live in Florida, and this holds up to humidity.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mousse I have ever used, did not weigh down my hair and yet could style my hair anyway I wanted to, plus smells good.</li>
            <li> makes styling my hair easy</li>
            <li> oh ! the best mousse , I am very happy with this product,  amazing smell ;-)</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome mousse ever!  Does not leave hair stiff.  However it gives it  hair so much body!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Just absolutely love morroccanoil products.  Smells so good and makes your hair fuller while, if you&#x27;re like me, trying to tame fly-a-ways</li>
            <li> My hairdresser first introduced me to this. Works great for volume! Feels good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love the smell! Gives may hair volume and softness.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great service.</li>
            <li> I could start my own salon with the number of haircare products I have tried over the years! My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this for our very curly, very fine hair. Although a bit pricey, I have been very pleased with the curl and control it creates-I usually air dry, but works great with a diffuser, as well.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and in good condition. The mousse did not give my hair the lift I expected so that was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this light mousse. Lasts me a long time! Does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot be without this best product ever</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I have been using this for nearly a year and love it.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on me at the salon and I HAD to find it. This product leaves my hair soft, voluminous, super healthy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money this cost, I expected more.  There is virtually no smell and it weighs heavy on my short hair, even just using a small amount.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok .... I like other Moroccan Oil products but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, the entire Moroccan Oil line is fantastic, lightweight mouse that really gives my hair bounce and helps to hold the curl. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product - been using for several years and really like it.  Good price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My canister came with a broken cap which means I can travel with it.  The top was wrapped in saran wrap too.  I have never bought a product wrapped in saran wrap.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Love the product and the smell.  Does not leave the curls &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like other mousses.</li>
            <li> Product is very soft and light. Needs a little more punch. But it&#x27;s good if you like a light conditioning product.</li>
            <li> I have to say that since two products I loved and lived by were taken off the market (that kept my hair looking superb), I have been unable to find replacements for them - one was a product by Icon called Sultry (this was for volume and was fantastic...no stiffness, just full body); the other was Dove Volumizing Shampoo (no longer made, but was also fabulous for my hair).  Moroccan Volumizing Mousse smells DELICIOUS, but that ends my romance with the product.  My hair is now dry and dull.  I bought the mousse along with the shampoo, which also does nothing for me - but smells DELICIOUS!  Everybodies&#x27; hair is different...I do not respond to either of these products, except for a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome product  great for summer. No oily or heavy feeling when dry. Makes hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have found this product to be amazing in so far as it adds volume and body to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love all of their products.  They never fail to hold my natural curl whether I am in North Carolina or hot Arizona!  FANTASTIC product!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> I use all Moroccan Oil products! They last a long time! A little expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this mousse. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff. It has a light hold but still allows my hair to swing free and natural and stay soft to the touch. It doesn&#x27;t have any weird odors that linger either.</li>
