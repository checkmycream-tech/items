            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and doesn&#x27;t wear out throughout the day like the drugstore eye-shadows that i&#x27;m used to.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing about this product for years, and I had hesitated to order it because I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very good considering the cheap price and not ever having heard/used this brand of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

            <li>The colors are great and come out the way they look as well, add a primer underneath and they look even better, but you don&#x27;t even need one for them to look</li>
            <li>I love the colours and it gives a great variety, with 252 shadows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the number of colors in the palette, and I&#x27;m looking forward to using each and every color eventually.</li>

            <li>I put these on in the morning with a cheap primer and my shadow is still looking good with no crease at night after working all day.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality, would not waste money.</li>
            <li>The palettes themselves are made of kind of flimsy plastic, but they&#x27;re in the case most of the time</li>
            <li>Some shadows are shimmer, some are matte which is nice :3</li>
            <li>There are so many incredible colors in this palette, I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ones to use first.  </li>
            <li>Bought them to do make for a very colorful wedding, the bride loved it.</li>
            <li>Compact design makes it easy to transport tons of options!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>so with that being said i strongly recomend this eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li>I love bright, bold colors!</li>
            <li>As a person of dark skin, not every color looks good on me, so it&#x27;s wonderful to have a nice range of colors to play with</li>
            <li>Great value, great quality, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Great pigments that are true to color and easy to use.</li>
            <li>She is pretty happy with number of colors but the quantity is pitiful.</li>
            <li>Coastal Scents has really outdone itself with this beautiful product.</li>
            <li>they are just great and very pigmented !</li>
            <li>Eye shadows were NOT broken was packaged with care and look beautiful when applied.</li>
            <li>Great buy ,pretty colors, a must have .</li>
            <li>Very impressive for the price, arrived days early, is authentic Coastal Scents, couldn&#x27;t be happier:)</li>
            <li>she likes it Great Colors and stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it was a great way for me to try out Coastal Scents for the first time.</li>
            <li>i said it was wayyy too good to be true...</li>
            <li>and if she says is good I would say is true.</li>
            <li>When I saw the price I was hesitant, thinking it was too good to be true and</li>
            <li>Colors are super pigmented and nothing was damaged when it arrived!!</li>
            <li>quality is wonderful, highly pigmented and smooth in texture.</li>
            <li>it was good,  liked it very much, peachy keen, dandy, groovy.</li>
            <li>The colors look very bright and vivid on the palette,  but don&#x27;t show up well even with a primer.</li>
            <li>love this makeup.so many colors.blends nicely which is why I got it.very good purchase at a nice price.very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but i just wish the pigments were not too powdery and rub off too quick and ugggggggg im saying u need a really good primer to matte the pigment on your skin.</li>
            <li>this palette gives you a ton of colors and they come on extremely nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful colors on my beautiful dark skin love the variety of colorsüòÉ</li>
            <li>Not as happy with the pigment in certain colors</li>
            <li>Quality is just as good as my higher end eyeshadows!  </li>
            <li>but the colors are beautiful and highly pigmented</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as beautiful as the high ends products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus there are so many shades of each color you can mix and match.</li>
            <li>I figured for the price to pay $15.00 more for this set</li>
            <li>s so many colors</li>
            <li>I love the colors to my eyeshadow pallet</li>
            <li>This is bang for your buck :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This set sure has everything I like in eye shadow.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow itself actually stays on all day too, which is great!</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful range of colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although most of the colors on here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying using this product.</li>
            <li>Lots of great colors, all very pigmented, and cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I also love that the palette includes matte shadows as well as the shimmery shadows.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, so many colors to use.</li>
            <li>one of the best kits of ULTIMATE EYES SHADOWS</li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wait to get creative.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pallet.</li>
            <li>What would make this pallet  even better is if the names of the eyeshadows were included.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Some colors are more bendable and pigmented than others.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>Love them, and will buy from the company again.</li>
            <li>Which I love.</li>
            <li>lo ok like the pictures</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to buy so much color love</li>
            <li>Oh man, I love this set.</li>
            <li>i will by myself some more</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this set.</li>
            <li>There are so many combinations</li>
            <li>i just cant wait to start using it :)</li>
            <li>I love how it has many colors to choose from</li>
            <li>Anyways, I love it and would purchase again and again and again if need be.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay--</li>
            <li>This is helping me become a lot more courageous in my makeup color choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think Amazon should have used more than one layer of bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many reviews of this product</li>
            <li>For me this was the most rewarding and fulfilling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience this is better than Mac and Saphora and Sigma and everything else you know.</li>
            <li>Now I imagine with a primer would be better,</li>
            <li>and they love the shades and how it looks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to since I have so many colors.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It was a great purchase and I may just be purchasing for a friend who loves eye shadows as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I love all the color and how i am able to work them together to create the color im going for...</li>
            <li>Love that it is compact and you can carry it anywhere with you.  </li>
            <li>I really love this</li>
            <li>A bit overwhelming</li>
            <li>but I will not have to buy any more eye shadow in quite awhile</li>
            <li>I just love the colours.</li>
            <li>The palettes contain more colors than I know what to do with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>

            <li>Use eye primer on your lid then apply the shadow colors will show up better.</li>
            <li>There was just one pot that had some fall out dust on top</li>
            <li>it would be to have a bit more neutral/skin tone shimmers or mattes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Its perfect for the price .Someone stated they didn&#x27;t receive an actual coastal scents palette, for me that was not the case it was genuine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are very intense and striking and others are natural and very beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for sure!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this, it will be very useful for years to come.</li>
            <li>Most definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try so many of these colors.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, great!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette!  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t need anymore than this!  </li>
            <li>Very quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to use when traveling.comes in plastic case.</li>
            <li>and it is a good value for such an amazing amount of colors</li>
            <li>I really love all the different shades and they look great on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pigmented, so many different options, great for beginner makeup artists and theater performers.</li>
            <li>Easily blends.</li>
            <li>I tried them out today and I am amazed how easily they blend.....</li>
            <li>beautifull colors, easy to apply</li>
            <li>/&gt;They fall apart a bit too easily for me in each socket.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>ATTACHED WHICH MAKES FOR A EASY PULL OUT OF THE COMPACT.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel if you don&#x27;t want to drag around a huge trunk with you.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you apply a lot of the eye shadow from this palette on your eye, you will get a strong affect.</li>
            <li>3 stars ..because the color isn&#x27;t strong..</li>
            <li>There are so many shades to choose from which makes getting ready in the morning to use them kind of fun because you have so many options for so many looks.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get my own and it was a really good decision.</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented and good quality.</li>
            <li>just have to use a high quality primer like two faced and use some good brushes like Goss.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented colors - gorgeous pay off.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s review: \\&quot;Amazing colors, they are really pretty.</li>
            <li>But I am very satisfied and they go on really pigmented when applied over a primer.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors look the same but they have some beautiful variances.  </li>
            <li>There are 252 different colors and each one is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love that there is so many colors to play around with also, this palette was a great buy especially for how many pretty colors you get.</li>
            <li>There are some great, pure, bright colors in there that I love to fade my other colors into.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll do fine</li>
            <li>super love it,</li>
            <li>Love all the bold colors.</li>
            <li>You can easily wipe the fall through off easily without ruining your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Second, these shadows are already so rich in color that I don&#x27;t use any primer</li>
            <li>So much to choose from it&#x27;s almost too many colors!</li>
            <li>All of the shadows are very pigmented and look absolutely stunning!</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and go on so very smooth!</li>
            <li>Blending is easy with the right brush and the color variety is fabulous!</li>
            <li>it arrived in perfect condition, I was a little concerned about that after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I can do costume and everyday makeup very easily with this beautiful pallette.</li>
            <li>Good eyeshadows, came very good packed, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>They give you lots of highlight colors, which are the ones I run out of the fastest and there are not only bright rainbow colors, but also plenty of neutral colors for those more &#x27;conservative&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li>Huge selection.</li>
            <li>Oil free makeup remover took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li>The color payoff is great, but for me, they don&#x27;t last all day on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Overall, the value is great, and I would repurchase (but I don&#x27;t know if I will ever need to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use most of them, but they&#x27;re fun to play with and you never know what you might end up trying over the course of a year.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal if you want to experiment with color, but can&#x27;t afford to spend much.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and doesn&#x27;t wear like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>I opened it up and was amazed by all the colors available.</li>
            <li>and they go on smoothly</li>
            <li>Case closes securely.</li>
            <li>So many of my friends have purchased this palette because of all the fun I have with it.</li>
            <li>but the colors are supper pigmited came in great packaging and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Its a cheap investment.</li>
            <li>Color goes on smooth and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>Which is nice because you can&#x27;t just throw the whole thing in your bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>There is fallout though, so be prepared to lightly brush the excess that falls on your cheeks, or apply foundation after.</li>
            <li>light skinned</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great and there is various colors!</li>
            <li>i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li>these do pack color IF you use primer (urban decay) and great brush.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE TINY SMALLER THAN A DIME, THE COLORS ARE GREAT AND SERVICE WAS GREAT</li>
            <li>I have a light skin tone,  and even after layering it on,  </li>
            <li>And there are 252 fabulous</li>
            <li>it rocked my world, really,really,really,really liked it so much</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s light and shiny, it goes on light and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great finally got it...</li>
            <li>Worth it and work better with primer</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised, the quality is superior and the color selections are</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use a lot of the same colors, but that&#x27;s okay, because I can experiment and see what looks good.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as the big name brands, but better price.</li>
            <li>Loved the way each tray came completely out.</li>
            <li>I own zillions of palettes and this one offers more colors packed into one case than you could ever hope for.  </li>
            <li>The product blends pretty easily too!</li>
            <li>My friend had originally recommended this palette to me because of my love for makeup and with it&#x27;s 252 shades to choose from, i&#x27;m never bored of it!</li>
            <li>I love how there are so many different colors from shimmer to neutral and smokey its super easy to fit in anything they fit nice n</li>
            <li>There is a large variety of vibrant colors, and is great quality for the affordable price.</li>
            <li>but like i said with the right primer and brush worked a lot better when applying.</li>
            <li>so much, I bought one for my friend!!!</li>
            <li>, i love the case , the way all 3 palett&#x27;s sit on top of one another and to the right side they all have pink ribbon tabs for easy removal, I&#x27;vebeen using the shadow for 2 days now and they are very bright and pigmented, you dont have to use much product.</li>
            <li>First I tried them on just playing with colors to see how I liked it and wasn&#x27;t pleased,  Color&#x27;s wore off and didn&#x27;t look very pigmented.</li>
            <li>the colors are sooo pigmented and long lasting on the skin even without a primer, is incredible of how good it is...</li>
            <li>The color is nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really well pigmented and very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly as they look - if the color on the palette is bright and vivid, it goes on bright and vivid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am super happy with this purchase, especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smudge proof &amp; totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited upon ordering this product</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>But it and start the fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair, so I have to be careful and apply it light, then fill in if I need more color.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited that I&#x27;m purchasing this product again for my sister.</li>
            <li>There are barely any good matte colors</li>
            <li>it cause i love it so much!</li>
            <li>It is soooo worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This is so much fun!  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re one of those critical young ladies then good heavens get yourself a good primer</li>
            <li>The colors are awesome, yes they are on the small side but no biggie.</li>
            <li>Another reason this product is not 5 stars is because of the significant staining on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It was worth it!</li>
            <li>Colors stay on for a really long time and there&#x27;s a really great variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is having fun trying all the colors!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed in the eyeshadows themselves.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I love the color not cheaply made at all great price and its very worth it ...</li>
            <li>Very well pigmented, Lasts all day and are really easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This palette has some really great colors, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all!</li>
            <li>i was clean out my make up box just for this.</li>
            <li>Where u need so many different palettes to recreate the looks if you don‚Äôt own the shades.</li>
            <li>I think I can safely say that after buying this palette, I officially do not need to buy any more eyeshadow (oh who am I kidding, I&#x27;m a complete makeup addict).</li>
            <li>Great, fun fashion shades at low prices.</li>
            <li>and they were surprised and happy when I told them the price and how much you get for</li>
            <li>The colors are great, go on smoothly and last pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few colors and they are pretty bright color and good to play around color matching and it stay on my skin even without using the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>All the color choices are great and for many occasions, i did Halloween makeup, xmas makeup, new years, and my birthday along with regular girls nights out on the weekends.</li>
            <li>The assortment of colors is wonderful, and all of the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far have been highly pigmented and so vibrant.</li>
            <li>So many vibrant colors!  </li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and even without primer look fresh all day and the color payoff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but most of them are vivid and strong when I put them on, so</li>
            <li>This is a great palette for people who want a wide range of colors and types of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>As far as pigmentation goes, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Colors are true and stay.</li>
            <li>So that was cool too.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, so much</li>
            <li>Such a good deal for the amount of colors there</li>
            <li>/&gt;These shadows are as they appear in the picture, and are fairly pigmented- if you don&#x27;t like the way it looks on you, try using some NYX Milk underneath as a primer and smoothing them on with different methods.</li>
            <li>I love this item so much I want to buy another one as a gift for a friend who&#x27;s a make up</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow palette so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>True...</li>
            <li>absolutely fell in love with this item tons of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>, i was expecting a full size palette.  </li>
            <li>I had bought a different palette from Coastal Scents with 88 colors before buying this one, and I loved that one as well.  </li>
            <li>but it has really too many colors.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even believe how inexpensive this is for such good quality shadows.</li>
            <li>The package was safe, there was none of breaks which I was really concerned about did not happen at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in absolute love and this is NO exaggeration.</li>
            <li>i wanted to test it for a full week before i made a review on it..</li>
            <li>Even after a full work day (I&#x27;m a waitress at a pub and grill)</li>
            <li>But overall good product.</li>
            <li>There are options options and more options they are really about a dime size pots.</li>
            <li>This palette is actually cool for the price ce paid....</li>
            <li>Good but very very tiny!</li>
            <li>After a full day of eye wiping this make-up is still there... faded</li>
            <li>I am having a good time using the various colours.  </li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE TRUE TO THE IMAGE.</li>
            <li>is good but it seems bigger in the picture</li>
            <li>Not bad, either,</li>
            <li>But one out of two hundred and fifty two is not a bad trade.</li>
            <li>take a couple dips to make it more pigmented but be careful when you use the more colorful wells because if you&#x27;re heavy-handed, they&#x27;ll be really strong!</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful and very well pigmented, they can easily be blended and last for a long while, just make sure to wear some eye primer or concealer to make your color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my new CS Palette, in fact I&#x27;ll give all my old eye shadows.</li>
            <li>This palette is super gorgeous and definitely isn&#x27;t short on colors.</li>
            <li>So I recommend dipping lightly into the more colorful ones unless you want a really vibrant color.     </li>
            <li>But other than that it is a great palette for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, stay on pretty well and blend nicely.</li>
            <li>In general the palettes are very good :) the color possibilities  are endless.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is the best eyeshadow palette EVER!!</li>
            <li>There is every color you can imagine in here; also in matte, shiny, sparkly, and bold colors.</li>
            <li>Great product arrived the next day really fast delivery and the person loves the makeup</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, and there is so many to pick from.</li>
            <li>After doing lots of research and reading reviews of several different brands of eye shadow pallets, I decided that this would be the best to start off with.</li>
            <li>But the colors are lovely and vibrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors are vibrant, for the most part.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super pigmented</li>
            <li>Luckily it was a neutral cream.</li>
            <li>A quick blow and gone.</li>
            <li>The colors are super blendable, too.</li>
            <li>, when you run out, you can order more of your favorites shades on the Coastal Scents website.&lt;br /&gt;First time, CS customer, look forward to ordering more products in the future :D.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are really well pigmented, blend easily without getting muddy, and don&#x27;t fade much or crease when used with a primer.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for vibrant colors, when it is really more of a tint.</li>
            <li>The pots arrived full and unbroken, the colors are highly pigmented and very rich.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product :3</li>
            <li>have from the most high end makeup products to drugstores even dollar store makeup and trust me</li>
            <li>high pigmented, however there were two or more of some colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with these highly pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>And although the pigment circles are dime sized (if they weren&#x27;t, the palette would be incredibly large), it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of pigment to get full coverage!</li>
            <li>This covers most of the normal shades.</li>
            <li>Colors are of good pigment, and stay in well as long as a foundation is used 1st.</li>
            <li>it is worth every dollar believe me the pigments in the cols are so vibrant i just love it</li>
            <li>With so many vibrant colors to choose from, I have a lot of fun with this palette.</li>
            <li>so this palette is perfect when I want to try a new look out with some similar colors that she uses that I don&#x27;t normally have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fun to play around with, and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think you could get such a wonderful palette for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Not only do I use this on a daily basis for regular wear, but I used this palette to create an incredible, bright, defined Poison Ivy make-up job for DragonCon.</li>
            <li>I love playing with the colors and creating new eyeshadow designs.  </li>
            <li>I love my new 252 eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>I love my new 252 eye shadow palette from coastal scents.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and rich!</li>
            <li>The dome itself is small for each color, but the eyeshadow has excellent pigmentation and doesn&#x27;t require much on your brush to cover your lid.</li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty darn good, especially with an eye shadow primer.  </li>
            <li>However they do break easily so place them gently anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have found that the colors aren&#x27;t very vibrant unless applied as a cream shadow however, the variety is great and, although they come in small amounts, how many times are you going to wear each of those colors?</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it, is that they come in three separate trays that you stack on top of each other, so it is a good idea to leave the protective plastic sheets on top.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are extremely pigmented, the size is workable, and the colors are amazing !</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more from coastal scents!</li>
            <li>you apply any primer, foundation or even powder, YOU DO YOUR EYES FIRST!</li>
            <li>My favorite that I&#x27;ve purchased so far!</li>
            <li>Now, I have 2 Naked palettes and a Smashbox palette, which I absolutely love; however, I would recommend this Coastal Scents palette over any of those!</li>
            <li>I ordered this 252 makeup palette a while back and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I bought the first one it contains a variety of colors!</li>
            <li>Not because I&#x27;m such an expert reviewer but because the product is OUTSTANDING!  </li>
            <li>The only words I have is I love this!</li>
            <li>/s last longer and pop better!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even made it off the first section yet, and theres three!</li>
            <li>This product would be perfect, but it did cause slight irritation on my extremely sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>What I enjoyed the most is the fact that I barely pat my brush on top of the color pot and had enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>This is a great product im always super skeptical about buying make up online but for the price its amazing i always get compliments on my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The colors go on smoothly, and are very vibrant when on.</li>
            <li>The size of the box is too large for travel, and that is also huge downside.</li>
            <li>After spending $50 on drug store eyeshadows and finding little pigment or variety in colors, this was a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li>this little palette is great.</li>
            <li>So far I have been impressed with the little that is provided.</li>
            <li>It makes for a pretty fun, and kind of ridiculous (in a good way), gift to give someone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to have received this eye shadow palette, there are so much options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for special occasions, messing around, costumes, and everyday wear!</li>
            <li>Then it was wrapped in the amazing massive bubble squares and placed in a spacious box.</li>
            <li>would be worth it because I could use it anytime.</li>
            <li>im going to have fun with thisüòÜ  </li>
            <li>so worth what you pay for it....andrea</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s not even worth mentioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either on the back of them or a  sheet chart included would be nice.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the amount.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
            <li>The product was worth my every cent</li>
            <li>My palette came in perfect order, no colors were broken.</li>
            <li>So worth it</li>
            <li>Nice assortment of colors but pigment is not that deep.  </li>
            <li>Fun to have anyway</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and watching many YouTube reviews of this product, I felt like I got what I expected.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has purchased many different eye shadow palettes through many different brands, I have to say that Coastal Scents has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makeup geek for myself and wanted to get my daughter a pallet that she could play with just starting out learning how to do her own makeup.</li>
            <li>Colors are nicely pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant &amp; go on super smooth.  </li>
            <li>worth the yearly membership fee).</li>
            <li>So much fun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with another reviewer about the purple staining a bit but honestly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>Def worth it....</li>
            <li>Well worth the 26$</li>
            <li>My teen daughter bought this item with her own money.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day and is in a very sturdy case capable of taking a hit with layered plastic sheets between palette layers to keep the pots safe.</li>
            <li>I have so much fun with my makeup palette.</li>
            <li>Tons of colors totally worth the money</li>
            <li>For the price and the amount of eyeshadow you will get I will say it worth getting.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money as for quality and quantity</li>
            <li>For that amount of money, I think the palette is worth buying for.</li>
            <li>Received it as a Christmas gift, I love it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>This product comes in a nicely packaged box covered in bubble wrap for extra safety.</li>
            <li>As someone who is just starting to get into the whole eyeshadow thing , i bought this to experiment and learn different techniques and it is absolutely perfect for that .</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item and received it a day early which was great.</li>
            <li>Really nice gave it a 4 because I thought they were bigger.</li>
            <li>So not quite appropriate for a younger girl just learning and experimenting with makeup, But my 15 year old daughter is loving it</li>
            <li>it was worth the wait..</li>
            <li>and then afterward they sent me a useful brush as a gift .</li>
            <li>They last throughout the day which comes in handy.</li>
            <li>a very good product, sometimes is hard to clean up for its high quality!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my pallet, I love exploring with makeup and all the different colors.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast too!</li>
            <li>The warms (reds, oranges &amp; yellows) are bold on first stroke.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as strong as the MAC shadows and it suits me because I don&#x27;t know how to work with such strong shadows anyway.</li>
            <li>I did not return because I needed to use right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to expand there range of color options in</li>
            <li>though not as many true blue and purple shades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was fast, I opened up the box, everything was clean, none of the shadows were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And i trust this eyeshadows so much that I do people&#x27;s make up with this for special occasions</li>
            <li>The color pigmentation is surprisingly very nice and not only for the price but in general.</li>
            <li>No broken colors and the colors are VERY pigmented :) I am brown skinned and they show up very well.</li>
            <li>However, the lg number of colors, variation in color, shimmer &amp; matte options, &amp; the great pigmentation make up for the small size.</li>
            <li>I normally wear browns and light orange colors</li>
            <li>They are small, but they work great.</li>
            <li>However be careful as some of the colors are very more pigmented and brighter than others.</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday colors are gone way to quick!!</li>
            <li>Pair it with a good eye shadow primer and you will not be let down.</li>
            <li>, i do my eyes everyday and have used so many different eyeshades for many different name brand ,,by far one of the best for the price</li>
            <li>I barely use any of the shadow to cover both my eyes; it&#x27;s very easy to blend and shows up very well.</li>
            <li>a starting makeup artist, I STRONGLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>but i notice that some has little mineral and sone has too much but over the the colors are great.</li>
            <li>The pigments are FANTASTIC and you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your eyelids, (which is great since each eye shadow is very small).</li>
            <li>In this case especially, inexpensive does not mean &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34;  I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>And it arrived wrapped very well, all the eyeshadows were in a plastic case too and it was really quick.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and a beautiful set of colors.</li>
            <li>If you are a colorful person who enjoys beauty products, I would definitely recommend this affordable and fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on high-end eyeshadow, and this one is just as good as my UD pallets.</li>
            <li>After looking at the other options I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors are very very powdery though.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The problem I&#x27;m running into is that they are VERY VERY powdery.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to any girl who loves make up &amp; loves a huge variety of eye shadow colors!</li>
            <li>OMG super blendable and vibrant colors that transformes any look for the day or night.</li>
            <li>I use an eye primer that makes the colors pop even more, but it&#x27;s not necessary.  </li>
            <li>but it seems that is the case with most yellow eye-shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously the design is meant to be more compact and somewhat sturdy to hold everything.</li>
            <li>says its got great colors and last long.</li>
            <li>at least lol).</li>
            <li>This palette is a real steal guys, don&#x27;t pass up on it!</li>
            <li>Shipping is really fast and convent!</li>
            <li>but when I got it was the real deal!</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>I love doing multicolor makeup with this and the brigh colors, also a variety of nude and low tones for smoky eyes and depth .</li>
            <li>I love these pallets , this is my second time purchasing this</li>
            <li>and you already have more than enough color.</li>
            <li>Love these colors..will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>The colors are very concentrated and there are loads of fun shades.</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are as stunning as they are numerous.  </li>
            <li>others have said in recent reviews, there is no Coastal Scents mark on the top of the lid.  </li>
            <li>The color lasts throughout the day as well as my Naked palette shadows do, and better than drug store</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was asking for.</li>
            <li>and very inexpensive !</li>
            <li>I love creating different eyeshadow</li>
            <li>Today was the first time I tried it on</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly as displayed.  </li>
            <li>you no longer need to have so many different palettes to achieve the look you want.</li>
            <li>I love to experiment with all kinds of different looks.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I have not had any that would come out if trying to be used and the case is pretty durable</li>
            <li>but you get a lot out of them because you do not have to use so much!</li>
            <li>So many different colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>now on to the makeup, it definitely could have been package much better.</li>
            <li>For inexpensive shadows this is great.....very pigmented and pretty colors.....</li>
            <li>and when you find the colors you love you can purchase them individually from CoastalScents.com !&lt;</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be sticking with Coastal Scents for my eye shadows!</li>
            <li>I use it in a daily basis :)</li>
            <li>Especially the packaging could have been better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still mostly intact too, so no big deal.</li>
            <li>If you find a color or 2 you like &amp; use the most -- they can be ordered individually by number.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Then when I was going out later that night I put elfs eye primer on first and got waaayyy better results.</li>
            <li>First of all, if you know how to do your makeup and what to do on your face first...</li>
            <li>So by you doing your eyes first...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got matte shadows and shimmer from the whole color wheel!</li>
            <li>Definitely willing to rebuy when I run out.</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>Not only is there a color variety, but there is also different types of finishes.&lt;br /&gt;For somebody who loves different colors and who is on a budget, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow Is Absolutely Awesone!</li>
            <li>I have favorite colors and want them to last</li>
            <li>But I guess that&#x27;s the downfall of being given so many colors in such a compact case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better off buying off the actual site</li>
            <li>Each day I&#x27;m able to decide what similarly shaded colors I might blend or what contrasting colors I might want to combine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which one I want to do first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I just got overwhelmed by all the possible combinations that I haven&#x27;t been able to come up with any looks yet.</li>
            <li>, I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the delivery was really fast!</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the various shades</li>
            <li>It has many different colors and the pigment is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So many colors to choose from, although some look the same on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Some of the darker colors are much too dark for me on my fair skin but that may be just what your looking for.</li>
            <li>I love how the shadows last all day</li>
            <li>I did a You Tube review on this palette when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dancer and they are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>I had to order this twice because they didn&#x27;t mail me my first order</li>
            <li>THAT IS MOST DEFINITELY</li>
            <li>The colors are great and last long.</li>
            <li>Came exactly how I thought it would come.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun colors and really goes on well and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>but the UPS guys really put a beating to the box!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>They are extremely bold and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, especially for the price, but it is definitely a cheap product.</li>
            <li>I love all of the different colors of eye shadow</li>
            <li>Absolutely no broken pieces!</li>
            <li>When I first used my palette</li>
            <li>All I need is one of these palettes and I&#x27;m good to go all year round.</li>
            <li>I like the case it came in and how each palette is removable to work with a little more easily</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more natural colors, I would consider getting a different palette, but if you want a variety for real cheap, look no further.</li>
            <li>The three palettes were separated by a thick sheet of plastic and then they were encased in a very nice plastic container.  </li>
            <li>They go on highly pigmented and take very little to get great colour.</li>
            <li>It is alot smaller than i expected it but its pretty great.</li>
            <li>The issue is the little plastic covers they give you don&#x27;t work incredibly well, and if any powder is left on the holders, it gets all over.</li>
            <li>The case the three palettes come in is sturdy plastic and while not exactly a display piece, still looks nice.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I have a hard time deciding which colors to use or pair with one another because there are so many options, but I&#x27;m finding myself using these more often than my MAC shadows.</li>
            <li>So, there&#x27;s a very high chance of your eye shadow touching the bottom of the palette above if you forgot the plastic.</li>
            <li>i love the colors they&#x27;re really vibrant and bright, but the pallet is a little smaller than i thought</li>
            <li>I probably will never use it&#x27;s great to have such a wide selection.</li>
            <li>The colors are smaller than expected but over all great product.</li>
            <li>If you like colorful eyeshadows, particularly shimmery ones, I&#x27;d buy this palette.</li>
            <li>I would have kept then because they come in the same format as the Real Coastal Scents palettes, but they did not have a label on the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please and would definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li>There are SO many colors (obviously) and the colors are very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I really need as many different yellows as there are though.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way because they are highly pigmented and has maaaany shades both matte and shimmery to make the perfect eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>However, I found this to be priced very reasonably and especially after I had a chance to try it out and discovered that the colors stay as bold as they appear in the palette once they are applied!</li>
            <li>Another thing I do adore about these eyeshadows is that they&#x27;re pretty much arranged in categories of how you can put them on your eyes.</li>
            <li>at first i didn&#x27;t think this was a real coastal scents palette.</li>
            <li>The palette itself has pretty much every colour you could ever need.</li>
            <li>Received it fast and all the colors are very pigmented!</li>
            <li>this will not take up much space for a first time buyer</li>
            <li>It has been fun experimenting with colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy.</li>
            <li>SO SMALL U CANT EVEN USE GOOD BRUSHES WITH THIS</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth - BOLD colors - I didn&#x27;t expect such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>However, they gladly posted my other positive reviews!</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had... labels or color names to each so that you can find the color pot easily and order your favorites.  </li>
            <li>Such strong pigments.</li>
            <li>I am writing this because I am a dark skinned woman and there were not to many reviews for us on here to see if it was really worth buying.</li>
            <li>The well size is small, but if you use a good technique you shouldn&#x27;t need much anyway.</li>
            <li>The only thing i didn&#x27;t like that&#x27;s a strong dislike is the smell.</li>
            <li>It comes in a sturdy case so I can carry it around in a large bag if I&#x27;m staying somewhere else.</li>
            <li>but there is a large variety of colours.  </li>
            <li>It certainly has a ton of colors.  </li>
            <li>I received this within a few days of ordering and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this palette a few months ago and I have to say, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>we found a new brand we can always come back to and be satisfied</li>
            <li>In love with my new 252 ultimate eye shadow</li>
            <li>Love the different colors.very pigmented and blends well.only down is i wish it had more matte shades.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was lucky, but my shadows arrived completely intact and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>These shadows have great pigmentation, and each small pot is more than enough to last a while.</li>
            <li>any colors i have in my closet, this palette matches :) the only concern was the eye shadows do pop out occasionally, they are not glued or fastened down, which could be good if you want to interchange them.</li>
            <li>but only half of them are pigmented enough to show up on your skin and the texture isn&#x27;t that easy to deal with, definitely have a good eye primer using this and be ready to spend more on eyeshadows when you figure out which ones you want to use.</li>
            <li>I have enough with one dab on the eyeshadow and its looks just fine.</li>
            <li>I sure would (this was my first purchase of coastal scents) and looking into other products as well.</li>
            <li>Blending them out can get tricky especially with the more vivid shades but lots of practice helps there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because the colors are just so vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>but they are very highly pigmented and that makes it up for it.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner makeup artist and really wanted to purchase an eye shadow palette with a large variety of colors to experiment with.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price and the amount of colors you get and the quality, I would say this is great to pick up if you are looking for eyeshadows and want to experiment with your look a little.</li>
            <li>I fixed them with a little rubbing alcohol, and good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Inspires so much creativity, and the textures are very high end, you&#x27;d never know you were using something this inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is compact enough to fit in a bathroom drawer with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without primer I found the colors to be very pigmented and with primer</li>
            <li>They blend very well</li>
            <li>This is very convenient for travelling.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic and the variety is extensive.</li>
            <li>Every different color you can think of, but it also doesn&#x27;t have that cheap feeling that eyeshadow sometimes has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>all of the ones I used were very pigmented.</li>
            <li>There is so much variety.</li>
            <li>This product is very pigmented for the price and lasts all day with or without a primer</li>
            <li>With an eye primer, the color stays on your lids the whole time.</li>
            <li>daughter enjoys having all of the colors she could ever think of when she gets ready to wear her makeup</li>
            <li>so I am unsure of how fast the shipping was</li>
            <li>In my opinion this was an absolute steal for me.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal guys.......</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The colors are intense and vivids and when yu convine the colors are so beatiful.</li>
            <li>what i wanted the whole time.</li>
            <li>It has all the colors i can imagine and its high quality !</li>
            <li>but I do not have to use to much.</li>
            <li>the color really show up.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the colors would be very pigmented and I was hesitant to buy it.  </li>
            <li>The shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews really helped me make the decision to purchase.  </li>
            <li>Going to repurchase this palette soon for a friend that loves this so much</li>
            <li>I got the palette in the two days after ordering it and the shadows are very pigmented when using a eye primer.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented....</li>
            <li>This palette lets me choose any color combo in a ton of intensities to really reflect how I feel that day.</li>
            <li>I work in cosmetics and when I receive shipments they are packed very well to ensure none of the eye shadows crack.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>As soon as i opened the package i knew it was real.</li>
            <li>and I use it very often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t really even fade after me rubbing my eyes.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>colors come in dime size, but the color is very dense</li>
            <li>some colors are intense.</li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>, all the colors are available to be sold individually on the coastal scents website.</li>
            <li>She took them on vaca with her and that would have made it much easier.</li>
            <li>they are really pigmented</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>They are definitely very pigmented.</li>
            <li>now, they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>the shadows were intact on arrival, as they were packaged very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this palette .</li>
            <li>although they look very pigmented and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li>Very disappiinted.</li>
            <li>Some colors are very pigmented others</li>
            <li>not so much I do see that some colors are repeated in the palette.</li>
            <li>Well, actually better than expected.</li>
            <li>Daughter really likes these..</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was inexpensive but yet really pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product, they were just the way the seller describes it</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you will have to turn the whole case over to get them out</li>
            <li>This will be a fabulous xmas gift for all the ladies in my life next December.</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing just look at the pacaking ---_----</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>it lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li>Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented ...</li>
            <li>The colors also blend really well</li>
            <li>They should have just given you a plastic tray cover to fit over each individual palette.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of green shades and warm colors to choose from,</li>
            <li>quite a few of them were shattered, but the shadows apply nice, and stay on all day</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are nice and powdery and blend well, and I use some of them as a liner by wetting a narrow angle brush to apply.  </li>
            <li>from light, delicate and matte to rich, vibrant and full of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Using any good eyeshadow primer or base would allow you to get the true quality of the hues but they are still bold enough on their own.</li>
            <li>I really have no other complaints and if Coastal Scents ever comes out with more colors, I am definitely buying them!</li>
            <li>Some aren&#x27;t as pigmented as i would&#x27;ve expected but overall they&#x27;re pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased some of my favorite colors from this palette in individual hot pots.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m quite pleased that I do not need to buy the other two palettes.</li>
            <li>(this might be that they were close to my skin color), but other than that I love this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put anything on my face other than MAC, but after watching a million tutorials and seeing many makeup artists use these colors I figured what the heck let&#x27;s try it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;d like a large assorment of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Probably the only downside is there are so many that they probably WILL get old and need replacing before you use up more than half of the shadows.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to really examine them all and use even a fraction of all that is available.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very concentrated and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation of most of the shadows is impressive (especially the shimmer ones), but the durability was very disappointing.</li>
            <li>but when I did it came quickly, the eye shadow for each palette is a bit tiny, it is either very pigmented or not at all.</li>
            <li>They are rich colors though, so the fact that the swatches are small isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li>The amount of each color is kind of small</li>
            <li>Yes the swatches are small, but there are 252 options, and honestly you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>The long lasting of it works better with an eye primer first.</li>
            <li>other reviewers, I wish there were more purple shades, as well as more deep blue shades.</li>
            <li>they are kind of small, about the size of dimes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected!!</li>
            <li>There are so many colors to choose from I sometimes get lost from applying one eye to the other!</li>
            <li>The pallet is good only that its little</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine ever running out of new pigments to try with this palette!</li>
            <li>I am very into switching up eyeshadow and trying new looks and patterns, and this fills any gap for any color</li>
            <li>I received my new palette in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>so I would rather have many colors to choose from with less amount of each.  </li>
            <li>And if you do, many of the colors can be bought in individual (bigger) pots on the Coastal Scents site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors are just as vibrant as they look on here.</li>
            <li>It is my first time buying from this company and on amazon in general and i will absolutely being ordering from here again.</li>
            <li>But the pigments are vibrant.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, buttery, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>For some reason this helps the brush hold more color and DOES NOT make it smear/run...may have actually helped with the lasting capabilities as well, now that I think about it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that there can be a lot of fallout with some shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is a great palette.</li>
            <li>I wonder how quickly I will go through some that I use regularly.</li>
            <li>THE QUALITY IS DECENT, I&#x27;M CARAMEL COMPLEXION</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>It seems super high pigment, especially the red-tinted shades.</li>
            <li>The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the small portion of each color, but so far I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that either.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a one-stop box that has every color you can imagine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a gift for any girl out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The price is high</li>
            <li>Colors are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette.</li>
            <li>I always find myself  ignoring my drugstore and high end products to use these eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this product and I highly recommend Coastal Scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The one thing i can say i didn&#x27;t like is that these colors create a little fall off but most eyeshadows do so</li>
            <li>but I prefer to keep mine a little more protected with the sheets.    </li>
            <li>I love this palette, some were a little cracked</li>
            <li>They may take a little more TLC but for the effect for the price</li>
            <li>color palette on this is so amazing I hardly have words to explain it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to damage the colors in the corners by bumping them with the corners of the other palettes.</li>
            <li>It is highly pigmented, just too many outlandish colors for everyday use.</li>
            <li>If you need bigger pans of wild colors, I suggest getting a special palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i dont have anything bad to say about this palette is perfect!</li>
            <li>by far I rather use this one I got from AMAZON, they stayed on threw the whole day.....</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this and it has completely changed the way I use make up.</li>
            <li>Also I have really picky and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and it lasts the whole day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Occasionally I may need to reapply but that is rare.</li>
            <li>Ordered this a few months ago and I love it.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t use it everyday but after buying this product I doubt I am going to be making any more purchases any times soon.</li>
            <li>They make it look so big and so worth it when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>love the package and all of the colors included in the set all is missing is the brushes and glitter</li>
            <li>colors are gorgeous, ranging from all ends of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;The individual colors are small, however I researched this before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more products from this company in the near future!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m Hooked, ordering a few more for gifts...</li>
            <li>Lots of colors, good setup to keep them from getting broken, quality case.</li>
            <li>Not so much for the purples and blues but regardless put the shadow on wet and be prepared for a bold difference.</li>
            <li>My palette came in perfect condition (well the black was broken</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is just as amazing, if not better, and the price is way cheaper!</li>
            <li>With the right amount of eyelid primer, this shadow will last you all day.</li>
            <li>Once you find colors that are right for you, you can take those right down to the mac store or whoever you like and buy that color.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge issue though because it stops it from mixing with the other colours.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>and she makes me want to venture out and try new colors</li>
            <li>so i got this to try new looks.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and shipped this to my sky box in Miami then to Trinidad.  </li>
            <li>Also, be careful not to pull to hard on the ribbons because the glue/adhesive that they use isn&#x27;t all the great.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how pigmented the colors were and how I had to use very very little of the color for it to show up enough on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have medium to dark skin tone and all the colors show on my skin perfectly fine...</li>
            <li>Not real, false advertising.  </li>
            <li>The trays store easily in any order in the compact black plastic case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pack and travel with and the less products I take with me, the easier life is for me....</li>
            <li>Arrived early, works well with my skin and the colors are really vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about makeup and was super shocked that this product was so good.</li>
            <li>Maybe good to buy for a 10 or 12 year old who&#x27;s just starting out with makeup and having fun playing with it but not so much for anyone older.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this product, but I&#x27;m just not impressed with the quantity and quality of this palette.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors to choose from and a little goes along way!</li>
            <li>I bought the palette to review on a beauty blog, and found myself pleasantly surprised by the silky consistency and high pigmentation of the shadow.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, and have not had any reaction to these.  </li>
            <li>I use one third of the colors on my higher end palettes</li>
            <li>aware, the eyeshadow pans are tiny.  </li>
            <li>The colors are vivid no need to reapply.</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;m not sure you could find better.</li>
            <li>I do use primer and a white jumbo pencil (L.A. Colors in Sea Shell, to be exact) under the eye shadows for added pop and long-lasting color.</li>
            <li>Yes, the shadows are small but there&#x27;s so many to pick from that it makes up for it.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned the eyeshadows are small, but they are great long lasting quality.</li>
            <li>my make up atrtist had the same exact palette.</li>
            <li>These colors are small but I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Which usually won&#x27;t get it from other brands in such a good price and quality!.  </li>
            <li>Each color was much smaller than my daughter expected, but overall she liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also slightly smaller than I thought but because there is such a variety I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never actually get to use them all anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little ribbons on the side make it so easy to get to what you want.</li>
            <li>The colours are vibrant and pigmented and last all day, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Now im dark skinned and after experimenting with a few of the colors i can say most are very pigmented a few others one dont show up too well as opposed to others but overall its a good set.</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more of a darker tone...not the darkest of browns but dark enough to be challenged in finding well pigmented eye-shadows and will show on my skin.  </li>
            <li>At first when i unboxed it i checked out the selection of colors and made sure no shadows were broken but didn&#x27;t take the plastic dividers off yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have noticed that there isn&#x27;t much fallout - less than the first revealed palette!</li>
            <li>Some of the colours aren&#x27;t well pigmented, and it breaks off if you travel with the case creating a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Rich pigment on dark complexion.</li>
            <li>the colors are super pigmented and it offers a wide variety to choose.</li>
            <li>There is a large array of colors and can be easily mixed together and blended.</li>
            <li>At first colors may seem as though the colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented, wet your brush and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love all of the colors the size of the pallette is a little smaller than I was expecting though.</li>
            <li>ton of color, many combinations, it is hard to chose what colors I will wear each day.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in the makeup field or just loves makeup in general.</li>
            <li>However I think even without the primer the color would have lasted because it took eye makeup remover to get the color completely off.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product 100% to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have a few light specs that sprinkled out of three</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented , blendable, they last forever!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this palette.</li>
            <li>so I could try different types of makeup without worrying about how much product I was wasting.</li>
            <li>I also will be using for cosplay bounding (like disney bounding but a wider spectrum) cause some times being a 22 year old woman</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Just wow.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Definitely has staying power, I need to find a gentle makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The package came a day early .</li>
            <li>but the color is so pigmented that you only really need to dot your brush once or twice to get a load of color.</li>
            <li>and it last the whole night and</li>
            <li>My young daughter likes these.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised by how pigmented they were.</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR</li>
            <li>All the colors I have tried so far blend</li>
            <li>My 14 year old saw this set in a make-up tutorial</li>
            <li>I am a returning customer and so far I ordered 2 of the 252 palette .</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast prior to ordering .</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented so I have to build the color up and consequently when blending it almost makes it look like you have no eyeshadow on, even with the primer.</li>
            <li>My young daughter likes these.</li>
            <li>Obviously they aren&#x27;t designer quality, but for something of a &amp;#34;Drugstore&amp;#34; brand they are really pigmented.</li>
            <li>my 18 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>so it makes it easier for your look to become seamless.</li>
            <li>The shadow pots are small but since it is nicely pigmented it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Well worth what I spent.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, it will probably last me a few years</li>
            <li>The case is nice and sturdy and none of the pans were cracked or broken.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they are actually the size of a dime but other than that I am pleased.</li>
            <li>This product has so much different shades of so many different colors and that once you purchase this palette you do not need to purchase any other eye shadow palette for about  years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I was wrong!</li>
            <li>I received this palette today, it was a lot smaller than I expected,  but the shadows are so pretty and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The pods are about the size of a dime which was a little smaller than expected but with this many colors I won&#x27;t be running out any time soon!</li>
            <li>All the colors are very vibrant and there is such a wide variety you will have trouble choosing just which one you want to wear :).</li>
            <li>But the main problem I have is that the make up simply doesn&#x27;t stay on for any length of time, let alone all day.</li>
            <li>The paletteis pretty small too (about 9&amp;#34;x6&amp;#34;) so it&#x27;s not going to take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li>I usually just apply once in the morning and most shades last throughout a work day.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my eyemake up which I apply daily before work, usually matching the outfit I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many of their pallets in the past and the colors come on solid and don&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li>This product is not bad but not original.</li>
            <li>Like any other eye shadows I have tried, it does fade a little throughout the day, but it lasts for as long as I need it to and is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a high end pallet from TOO FACE n</li>
            <li>they came as expected and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several palettes from high end brands...</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such high pigment quality.  </li>
            <li>Black is main color!!!</li>
            <li>I was a little bit skeptical about how great this product really was when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I received my palettes on time, none were broken and every single one of them are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It is small and light so you can carry it on roadtrips when you travel, but it still packs a punch with all of the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although each reservoir is small, the selection and variety of color is fabulous.</li>
            <li>For the price of this item, I was incredibly surprised by how deep the swatches were; they are about the size of a dime, but if you flip the palette over you can see how deep they really are.</li>
            <li>and I normally use Urban Decay when it comes to my eye-shadow.</li>
            <li>but it was very well wrapped killing my fear of the palette being broken, it is actually fairly tiny but there are so many colors</li>
            <li>The palette is great, my only complaint is that a few of the pots broke in shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>My Mac 219 now is permanently hot pink.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant, no matter how dark your skin is, it shows very well.</li>
            <li>It has a large selection, The only thing is that the pots are really tiny.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I make my eye brush a little wet to make sure the powdery eye shadow doesn&#x27;t fall all over my face, but this depends on each color.</li>
            <li>So many choices, it&#x27;s hard to even know where to start!</li>
            <li>are about dime size, but many people failed to mention that the colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t like that only a plastic sheet protected each palette once you remove the individual plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li>but i think it&#x27;s ok to be that small as long as I get the desired pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Later when i went to use it and finally took the dividers off the smell really hit me</li>
            <li>A few colors needed to go on wet to show pigmentation better, and some didn&#x27;t show up well on my skin</li>
            <li>Great pigmentation but little small than expected</li>
            <li>it is so rich and pigmented very little</li>
            <li>The size of the individual pots are a little smaller than most palettes but with 252 colours, I do not believe that is a big downfall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having second thoughts as to whether if it&#x27;s worth it to buy other items from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>but it really threw me off being so excited to try this and having never experienced that before.</li>
            <li>Aside from the size of the shadow pans, I guess my only other complaint would be that I wish it were a little cheaper, but $30 for 252 shadows is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as big as the huge palettes you&#x27;re used to seeing, but as far as the product a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>This means that a little goes a long way, at least with my skin tone, lightly tanned - light, they do.</li>
            <li>The pans are small, but that&#x27;s to be expected with so many colors and the price.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I have not used every color yet, but so far the green shadows seem to go on lighter, more sheer, even the dark greens.  </li>
            <li>You barely have to tap your brush in the pan</li>
            <li>As a broke college student, this really allowed me the freedom (and doesn&#x27;t take up valuable space) to have a wide range of colors without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with this</li>
            <li>I owned one of these that i had purchased from coastal scents a few months back for personal use and wanted another to put in my free lance kit.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors look very similar - they may look identical if you are looking from far away.</li>
            <li>Should I ever run out, or they get too old to use, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>Was kind of sad about that.</li>
            <li>I was pleased about that because I&#x27;ve read that some were broken in transit.</li>
            <li>I usually have to wet down my applicator brush to get any store brand to look as good.</li>
            <li>I was a little afraid to buy this palette only because I have another large palette of 88 neutral shadows that I haven&#x27;t used yet, despite the great quality.</li>
            <li>The pigments are amazing on this pallette, the colours are very small, but for personal use it can last you a long time, becouse you dont have to apply a lot to get what you want.</li>
            <li>They came in a small bubble wrap around the actual case them slipped into the items original packaging.</li>
            <li>Some of the shadows have a little fallout, but most of them are fine, and all of them are better than Wet n Wild, which I was surprised to find out, despite reviews to the contrary, had awful</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing eyeshadow and this is coming from a person who buys a crazy amount of high end makeup.</li>
            <li>I got tired of buying eyeshadows at the store I thought looked good only to get it home and turn out differently than expected.  </li>
            <li>I thought for the price the shadows wouldn&#x27;t be as vibrant or long lasting as the description said.</li>
            <li>I did think it&#x27;d be bigger but seriously, with all those options of eyeshadow and all the other eyeshadow I already own</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t forget the primer to get the most dramatic color.</li>
            <li>the circles are a bit smaller than I expected, but the product  really  hold on your skin and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been shopping around for eye shadow palettes for a while, and was expecting to pay quite a bit for a wide color spectrum of a decent quality.</li>
            <li>There are a wide variety of vibrant colours.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow isn&#x27;t flaky but when I first put the eyeshadow on my eyes, it burned a little bit, but not a lot.</li>
            <li>They seemed a little powdery when you first put the shadow on your brush</li>
            <li>the only problem is the size of each color shade is small so colors run out quickly</li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave it four stars, is because the eye shadows don&#x27;t last as long as the high end brands.</li>
            <li>I just got this recently but the colors are so vibrant and pigmented and last all day long!</li>
            <li>I have to also say that colors show up very well on my dark skin</li>
            <li>So it DID arrive on time but strangely it never came to my house..</li>
            <li>One thing that I wish other individuals using makeup would realize is that we seriously do not have to buy makeup at Sephora or MAC to feel like we have quality makeup, that we can&#x27;t look at ourselves in the mirror and feel like we&#x27;ve created a masterpiece.</li>
            <li>Just as other reviewers say it&#x27;s highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting in it&#x27;s color pigment and photographs naturally.</li>
            <li>and I have not used a single pallet completely</li>
            <li>For example, mattes and glitters and right next to each other that would compliment each other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the same quality as Urban Decay, Lorac, Smashbox, Too Faced or any of the other high end brands, but this exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>3 of the colors got a little messed up but its 252 eyeshadows so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a palette that you don&#x27;t want to set down in any way other than right side up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>

            <li> I understand that this is a good way to explore color options</li>
            <li> I loved this pallet.</li>

            <li> Loved mine</li>

            <li> Swatches I&#x27;ve seen online had really good pigmentation</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved this gift.</li>
            <li> i would recommend buying a good eye primer for this</li>
            <li> The amount of eye shadow is sufficient and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li> It is also good to carry in your purse for touch ups.</li>
            <li> and everyone said they loved my eye shadows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and doesn&#x27;t wear out throughout the day like the drugstore eye-shadows that i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> and I found good review about Coastal Scents</li>
            <li> I got my palette a day before the estimated shipping date, which is always good.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing about this product for years, and I had hesitated to order it because I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very good considering the cheap price and not ever having heard/used this brand of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Great for the price , it work for me for practice on my makeup class , love it</li>
            <li> The colors are great and come out the way they look as well, add a primer underneath and they look even better, but you don&#x27;t even need one for them to look</li>
            <li> I love the colours and it gives a great variety, with 252 shadows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the number of colors in the palette, and I&#x27;m looking forward to using each and every color eventually.</li>

            <li> I love love love Coastal Scents eyeshadows and the price for the pigment and quality is always amazing!</li>
            <li> Love love LOOOVE this !</li>
            <li> These are great colors, many choices to pick from and they look great especially with a good primer.</li>
            <li> The shadows are gorgeous and super pigmented!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how great the colors look!</li>
            <li> She said she liked the quality after she picked out her favorite colors.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a good quality eyelid primer to added brightness to the colors and also to help with a smooth application</li>
            <li> so many colors, stays on all day, blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I put these on in the morning with a cheap primer and my shadow is still looking good with no crease at night after working all day.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, would not waste money.</li>
            <li> The palettes themselves are made of kind of flimsy plastic, but they&#x27;re in the case most of the time</li>
            <li> Some shadows are shimmer, some are matte which is nice :3</li>
            <li> There are so many incredible colors in this palette, I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ones to use first.  </li>
            <li> Bought them to do make for a very colorful wedding, the bride loved it.</li>
            <li> Compact design makes it easy to transport tons of options!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> so with that being said i strongly recomend this eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li> I love bright, bold colors!</li>
            <li> As a person of dark skin, not every color looks good on me, so it&#x27;s wonderful to have a nice range of colors to play with</li>
            <li> Great value, great quality, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great pigments that are true to color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> She is pretty happy with number of colors but the quantity is pitiful.</li>
            <li> Coastal Scents has really outdone itself with this beautiful product.</li>
            <li> they are just great and very pigmented !</li>
            <li> Eye shadows were NOT broken was packaged with care and look beautiful when applied.</li>
            <li> Great buy ,pretty colors, a must have .</li>

            <li> I use it every day and it was a great way for me to try out Coastal Scents for the first time.</li>
            <li> i said it was wayyy too good to be true...</li>
            <li> and if she says is good I would say is true.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price I was hesitant, thinking it was too good to be true and</li>
            <li> Colors are super pigmented and nothing was damaged when it arrived!!</li>
            <li> quality is wonderful, highly pigmented and smooth in texture.</li>
            <li> it was good,  liked it very much, peachy keen, dandy, groovy.</li>
            <li> The colors look very bright and vivid on the palette,  but don&#x27;t show up well even with a primer.</li>
            <li> love this makeup.so many colors.blends nicely which is why I got it.very good purchase at a nice price.very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but i just wish the pigments were not too powdery and rub off too quick and ugggggggg im saying u need a really good primer to matte the pigment on your skin.</li>
            <li> this palette gives you a ton of colors and they come on extremely nice and strong.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful colors on my beautiful dark skin love the variety of colorsüòÉ</li>
            <li> Not as happy with the pigment in certain colors</li>
            <li> Quality is just as good as my higher end eyeshadows!  </li>
            <li> but the colors are beautiful and highly pigmented</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as beautiful as the high ends products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus there are so many shades of each color you can mix and match.</li>
            <li> I figured for the price to pay $15.00 more for this set</li>
            <li> s so many colors</li>
            <li> I love the colors to my eyeshadow pallet</li>
            <li> This is bang for your buck :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This set sure has everything I like in eye shadow.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow itself actually stays on all day too, which is great!</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful range of colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although most of the colors on here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this product.</li>
            <li> Lots of great colors, all very pigmented, and cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I also love that the palette includes matte shadows as well as the shimmery shadows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, so many colors to use.</li>
            <li> one of the best kits of ULTIMATE EYES SHADOWS</li>
            <li> and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wait to get creative.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet.</li>
            <li> What would make this pallet  even better is if the names of the eyeshadows were included.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Some colors are more bendable and pigmented than others.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> Love them, and will buy from the company again.</li>
            <li> Which I love.</li>
            <li> lo ok like the pictures</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to buy so much color love</li>
            <li> Oh man, I love this set.</li>
            <li> i will by myself some more</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this set.</li>
            <li> There are so many combinations</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s okay--</li>
            <li> This is helping me become a lot more courageous in my makeup color choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think Amazon should have used more than one layer of bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many reviews of this product</li>
            <li> For me this was the most rewarding and fulfilling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience this is better than Mac and Saphora and Sigma and everything else you know.</li>
            <li> Now I imagine with a primer would be better,</li>
            <li> and they love the shades and how it looks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to since I have so many colors.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase and I may just be purchasing for a friend who loves eye shadows as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I love all the color and how i am able to work them together to create the color im going for...</li>
            <li> Love that it is compact and you can carry it anywhere with you.  </li>
            <li> I really love this</li>
            <li> A bit overwhelming</li>
            <li> but I will not have to buy any more eye shadow in quite awhile</li>
            <li> I just love the colours.</li>
            <li> The palettes contain more colors than I know what to do with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>

            <li> There was just one pot that had some fall out dust on top</li>
            <li> it would be to have a bit more neutral/skin tone shimmers or mattes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette!  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t need anymore than this!  </li>
            <li> Very quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to use when traveling.comes in plastic case.</li>
            <li> and it is a good value for such an amazing amount of colors</li>
            <li> I really love all the different shades and they look great on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pigmented, so many different options, great for beginner makeup artists and theater performers.</li>
            <li> Easily blends.</li>
            <li> I tried them out today and I am amazed how easily they blend.....</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, easy to apply</li>
            <li> /&gt;They fall apart a bit too easily for me in each socket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> ATTACHED WHICH MAKES FOR A EASY PULL OUT OF THE COMPACT.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel if you don&#x27;t want to drag around a huge trunk with you.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you apply a lot of the eye shadow from this palette on your eye, you will get a strong affect.</li>
            <li> 3 stars ..because the color isn&#x27;t strong..</li>
            <li> There are so many shades to choose from which makes getting ready in the morning to use them kind of fun because you have so many options for so many looks.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get my own and it was a really good decision.</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented and good quality.</li>
            <li> just have to use a high quality primer like two faced and use some good brushes like Goss.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented colors - gorgeous pay off.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s review: \\&quot;Amazing colors, they are really pretty.</li>
            <li> But I am very satisfied and they go on really pigmented when applied over a primer.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors look the same but they have some beautiful variances.  </li>
            <li> There are 252 different colors and each one is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love that there is so many colors to play around with also, this palette was a great buy especially for how many pretty colors you get.</li>
            <li> There are some great, pure, bright colors in there that I love to fade my other colors into.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll do fine</li>
            <li> super love it,</li>
            <li> Love all the bold colors.</li>
            <li> You can easily wipe the fall through off easily without ruining your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Second, these shadows are already so rich in color that I don&#x27;t use any primer</li>
            <li> So much to choose from it&#x27;s almost too many colors!</li>
            <li> All of the shadows are very pigmented and look absolutely stunning!</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant and go on so very smooth!</li>
            <li> Blending is easy with the right brush and the color variety is fabulous!</li>
            <li> it arrived in perfect condition, I was a little concerned about that after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I can do costume and everyday makeup very easily with this beautiful pallette.</li>
            <li> Good eyeshadows, came very good packed, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> They give you lots of highlight colors, which are the ones I run out of the fastest and there are not only bright rainbow colors, but also plenty of neutral colors for those more &#x27;conservative&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li> Huge selection.</li>
            <li> Oil free makeup remover took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li> The color payoff is great, but for me, they don&#x27;t last all day on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Overall, the value is great, and I would repurchase (but I don&#x27;t know if I will ever need to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use most of them, but they&#x27;re fun to play with and you never know what you might end up trying over the course of a year.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal if you want to experiment with color, but can&#x27;t afford to spend much.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and doesn&#x27;t wear like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and was amazed by all the colors available.</li>
            <li> and they go on smoothly</li>
            <li> Case closes securely.</li>
            <li> So many of my friends have purchased this palette because of all the fun I have with it.</li>
            <li> but the colors are supper pigmited came in great packaging and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Its a cheap investment.</li>
            <li> Color goes on smooth and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Which is nice because you can&#x27;t just throw the whole thing in your bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> There is fallout though, so be prepared to lightly brush the excess that falls on your cheeks, or apply foundation after.</li>
            <li> light skinned</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and there is various colors!</li>
            <li> i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li> these do pack color IF you use primer (urban decay) and great brush.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE TINY SMALLER THAN A DIME, THE COLORS ARE GREAT AND SERVICE WAS GREAT</li>
            <li> I have a light skin tone,  and even after layering it on,  </li>
            <li> And there are 252 fabulous</li>
            <li> it rocked my world, really,really,really,really liked it so much</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s light and shiny, it goes on light and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great finally got it...</li>
            <li> Worth it and work better with primer</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised, the quality is superior and the color selections are</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use a lot of the same colors, but that&#x27;s okay, because I can experiment and see what looks good.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as the big name brands, but better price.</li>
            <li> Loved the way each tray came completely out.</li>
            <li> I own zillions of palettes and this one offers more colors packed into one case than you could ever hope for.  </li>
            <li> The product blends pretty easily too!</li>
            <li> My friend had originally recommended this palette to me because of my love for makeup and with it&#x27;s 252 shades to choose from, i&#x27;m never bored of it!</li>
            <li> I love how there are so many different colors from shimmer to neutral and smokey its super easy to fit in anything they fit nice n</li>
            <li> There is a large variety of vibrant colors, and is great quality for the affordable price.</li>
            <li> but like i said with the right primer and brush worked a lot better when applying.</li>
            <li> so much, I bought one for my friend!!!</li>
            <li> , i love the case , the way all 3 palett&#x27;s sit on top of one another and to the right side they all have pink ribbon tabs for easy removal, I&#x27;vebeen using the shadow for 2 days now and they are very bright and pigmented, you dont have to use much product.</li>
            <li> First I tried them on just playing with colors to see how I liked it and wasn&#x27;t pleased,  Color&#x27;s wore off and didn&#x27;t look very pigmented.</li>
            <li> the colors are sooo pigmented and long lasting on the skin even without a primer, is incredible of how good it is...</li>
            <li> The color is nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really well pigmented and very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly as they look - if the color on the palette is bright and vivid, it goes on bright and vivid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am super happy with this purchase, especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smudge proof &amp; totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was so excited upon ordering this product</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> But it and start the fun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair, so I have to be careful and apply it light, then fill in if I need more color.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited that I&#x27;m purchasing this product again for my sister.</li>
            <li> There are barely any good matte colors</li>
            <li> it cause i love it so much!</li>
            <li> It is soooo worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is so much fun!  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re one of those critical young ladies then good heavens get yourself a good primer</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome, yes they are on the small side but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Another reason this product is not 5 stars is because of the significant staining on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It was worth it!</li>
            <li> Colors stay on for a really long time and there&#x27;s a really great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is having fun trying all the colors!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed in the eyeshadows themselves.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the color not cheaply made at all great price and its very worth it ...</li>
            <li> Very well pigmented, Lasts all day and are really easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This palette has some really great colors, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all!</li>
            <li> i was clean out my make up box just for this.</li>
            <li> Where u need so many different palettes to recreate the looks if you don‚Äôt own the shades.</li>
            <li> I think I can safely say that after buying this palette, I officially do not need to buy any more eyeshadow (oh who am I kidding, I&#x27;m a complete makeup addict).</li>
            <li> Great, fun fashion shades at low prices.</li>
            <li> and they were surprised and happy when I told them the price and how much you get for</li>
            <li> The colors are great, go on smoothly and last pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few colors and they are pretty bright color and good to play around color matching and it stay on my skin even without using the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> All the color choices are great and for many occasions, i did Halloween makeup, xmas makeup, new years, and my birthday along with regular girls nights out on the weekends.</li>
            <li> The assortment of colors is wonderful, and all of the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far have been highly pigmented and so vibrant.</li>
            <li> So many vibrant colors!  </li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and even without primer look fresh all day and the color payoff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but most of them are vivid and strong when I put them on, so</li>
            <li> This is a great palette for people who want a wide range of colors and types of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> As far as pigmentation goes, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Colors are true and stay.</li>
            <li> So that was cool too.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, so much</li>
            <li> Such a good deal for the amount of colors there</li>
            <li> /&gt;These shadows are as they appear in the picture, and are fairly pigmented- if you don&#x27;t like the way it looks on you, try using some NYX Milk underneath as a primer and smoothing them on with different methods.</li>
            <li> I love this item so much I want to buy another one as a gift for a friend who&#x27;s a make up</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> True...</li>
            <li> absolutely fell in love with this item tons of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> , i was expecting a full size palette.  </li>
            <li> I had bought a different palette from Coastal Scents with 88 colors before buying this one, and I loved that one as well.  </li>
            <li> but it has really too many colors.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even believe how inexpensive this is for such good quality shadows.</li>
            <li> The package was safe, there was none of breaks which I was really concerned about did not happen at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in absolute love and this is NO exaggeration.</li>
            <li> i wanted to test it for a full week before i made a review on it..</li>
            <li> Even after a full work day (I&#x27;m a waitress at a pub and grill)</li>
            <li> But overall good product.</li>
            <li> There are options options and more options they are really about a dime size pots.</li>
            <li> This palette is actually cool for the price ce paid....</li>
            <li> Good but very very tiny!</li>
            <li> After a full day of eye wiping this make-up is still there... faded</li>
            <li> I am having a good time using the various colours.  </li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE TRUE TO THE IMAGE.</li>
            <li> is good but it seems bigger in the picture</li>
            <li> Not bad, either,</li>
            <li> But one out of two hundred and fifty two is not a bad trade.</li>
            <li> take a couple dips to make it more pigmented but be careful when you use the more colorful wells because if you&#x27;re heavy-handed, they&#x27;ll be really strong!</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful and very well pigmented, they can easily be blended and last for a long while, just make sure to wear some eye primer or concealer to make your color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new CS Palette, in fact I&#x27;ll give all my old eye shadows.</li>
            <li> This palette is super gorgeous and definitely isn&#x27;t short on colors.</li>
            <li> So I recommend dipping lightly into the more colorful ones unless you want a really vibrant color.     </li>
            <li> But other than that it is a great palette for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, stay on pretty well and blend nicely.</li>
            <li> In general the palettes are very good :) the color possibilities  are endless.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best eyeshadow palette EVER!!</li>
            <li> There is every color you can imagine in here; also in matte, shiny, sparkly, and bold colors.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived the next day really fast delivery and the person loves the makeup</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, and there is so many to pick from.</li>
            <li> After doing lots of research and reading reviews of several different brands of eye shadow pallets, I decided that this would be the best to start off with.</li>
            <li> But the colors are lovely and vibrant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors are vibrant, for the most part.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super pigmented</li>
            <li> Luckily it was a neutral cream.</li>
            <li> A quick blow and gone.</li>
            <li> The colors are super blendable, too.</li>
            <li> , when you run out, you can order more of your favorites shades on the Coastal Scents website.&lt;br /&gt;First time, CS customer, look forward to ordering more products in the future :D.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are really well pigmented, blend easily without getting muddy, and don&#x27;t fade much or crease when used with a primer.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for vibrant colors, when it is really more of a tint.</li>
            <li> The pots arrived full and unbroken, the colors are highly pigmented and very rich.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product :3</li>
            <li> have from the most high end makeup products to drugstores even dollar store makeup and trust me</li>
            <li> high pigmented, however there were two or more of some colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with these highly pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> And although the pigment circles are dime sized (if they weren&#x27;t, the palette would be incredibly large), it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of pigment to get full coverage!</li>
            <li> This covers most of the normal shades.</li>
            <li> Colors are of good pigment, and stay in well as long as a foundation is used 1st.</li>
            <li> it is worth every dollar believe me the pigments in the cols are so vibrant i just love it</li>
            <li> With so many vibrant colors to choose from, I have a lot of fun with this palette.</li>
            <li> so this palette is perfect when I want to try a new look out with some similar colors that she uses that I don&#x27;t normally have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fun to play around with, and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think you could get such a wonderful palette for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use this on a daily basis for regular wear, but I used this palette to create an incredible, bright, defined Poison Ivy make-up job for DragonCon.</li>
            <li> I love playing with the colors and creating new eyeshadow designs.  </li>
            <li> I love my new 252 eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> I love my new 252 eye shadow palette from coastal scents.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and rich!</li>
            <li> The dome itself is small for each color, but the eyeshadow has excellent pigmentation and doesn&#x27;t require much on your brush to cover your lid.</li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty darn good, especially with an eye shadow primer.  </li>
            <li> However they do break easily so place them gently anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have found that the colors aren&#x27;t very vibrant unless applied as a cream shadow however, the variety is great and, although they come in small amounts, how many times are you going to wear each of those colors?</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it, is that they come in three separate trays that you stack on top of each other, so it is a good idea to leave the protective plastic sheets on top.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are extremely pigmented, the size is workable, and the colors are amazing !</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more from coastal scents!</li>
            <li> you apply any primer, foundation or even powder, YOU DO YOUR EYES FIRST!</li>
            <li> My favorite that I&#x27;ve purchased so far!</li>
            <li> Now, I have 2 Naked palettes and a Smashbox palette, which I absolutely love; however, I would recommend this Coastal Scents palette over any of those!</li>
            <li> I ordered this 252 makeup palette a while back and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the first one it contains a variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Not because I&#x27;m such an expert reviewer but because the product is OUTSTANDING!  </li>
            <li> The only words I have is I love this!</li>
            <li> /s last longer and pop better!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even made it off the first section yet, and theres three!</li>
            <li> This product would be perfect, but it did cause slight irritation on my extremely sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> What I enjoyed the most is the fact that I barely pat my brush on top of the color pot and had enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great product im always super skeptical about buying make up online but for the price its amazing i always get compliments on my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The colors go on smoothly, and are very vibrant when on.</li>
            <li> The size of the box is too large for travel, and that is also huge downside.</li>
            <li> After spending $50 on drug store eyeshadows and finding little pigment or variety in colors, this was a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li> this little palette is great.</li>
            <li> So far I have been impressed with the little that is provided.</li>
            <li> It makes for a pretty fun, and kind of ridiculous (in a good way), gift to give someone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to have received this eye shadow palette, there are so much options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for special occasions, messing around, costumes, and everyday wear!</li>
            <li> Then it was wrapped in the amazing massive bubble squares and placed in a spacious box.</li>
            <li> would be worth it because I could use it anytime.</li>
            <li> im going to have fun with thisüòÜ  </li>
            <li> so worth what you pay for it....andrea</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s not even worth mentioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either on the back of them or a  sheet chart included would be nice.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the amount.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
            <li> The product was worth my every cent</li>
            <li> My palette came in perfect order, no colors were broken.</li>
            <li> So worth it</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of colors but pigment is not that deep.  </li>
            <li> Fun to have anyway</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and watching many YouTube reviews of this product, I felt like I got what I expected.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has purchased many different eye shadow palettes through many different brands, I have to say that Coastal Scents has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makeup geek for myself and wanted to get my daughter a pallet that she could play with just starting out learning how to do her own makeup.</li>
            <li> Colors are nicely pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant &amp; go on super smooth.  </li>
            <li> worth the yearly membership fee).</li>
            <li> So much fun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with another reviewer about the purple staining a bit but honestly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> Def worth it....</li>
            <li> Well worth the 26$</li>
            <li> My teen daughter bought this item with her own money.  </li>
            <li> Lasts all day and is in a very sturdy case capable of taking a hit with layered plastic sheets between palette layers to keep the pots safe.</li>
            <li> I have so much fun with my makeup palette.</li>
            <li> Tons of colors totally worth the money</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount of eyeshadow you will get I will say it worth getting.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money as for quality and quantity</li>
            <li> For that amount of money, I think the palette is worth buying for.</li>
            <li> Received it as a Christmas gift, I love it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a nicely packaged box covered in bubble wrap for extra safety.</li>
            <li> As someone who is just starting to get into the whole eyeshadow thing , i bought this to experiment and learn different techniques and it is absolutely perfect for that .</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and received it a day early which was great.</li>
            <li> Really nice gave it a 4 because I thought they were bigger.</li>
            <li> So not quite appropriate for a younger girl just learning and experimenting with makeup, But my 15 year old daughter is loving it</li>
            <li> it was worth the wait..</li>
            <li> and then afterward they sent me a useful brush as a gift .</li>
            <li> They last throughout the day which comes in handy.</li>
            <li> a very good product, sometimes is hard to clean up for its high quality!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my pallet, I love exploring with makeup and all the different colors.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast too!</li>
            <li> The warms (reds, oranges &amp; yellows) are bold on first stroke.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as strong as the MAC shadows and it suits me because I don&#x27;t know how to work with such strong shadows anyway.</li>
            <li> I did not return because I needed to use right away</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to expand there range of color options in</li>
            <li> though not as many true blue and purple shades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was fast, I opened up the box, everything was clean, none of the shadows were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And i trust this eyeshadows so much that I do people&#x27;s make up with this for special occasions</li>
            <li> The color pigmentation is surprisingly very nice and not only for the price but in general.</li>
            <li> No broken colors and the colors are VERY pigmented :) I am brown skinned and they show up very well.</li>
            <li> However, the lg number of colors, variation in color, shimmer &amp; matte options, &amp; the great pigmentation make up for the small size.</li>
            <li> I normally wear browns and light orange colors</li>
            <li> They are small, but they work great.</li>
            <li> However be careful as some of the colors are very more pigmented and brighter than others.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday colors are gone way to quick!!</li>
            <li> Pair it with a good eye shadow primer and you will not be let down.</li>
            <li> , i do my eyes everyday and have used so many different eyeshades for many different name brand ,,by far one of the best for the price</li>
            <li> I barely use any of the shadow to cover both my eyes; it&#x27;s very easy to blend and shows up very well.</li>
            <li> a starting makeup artist, I STRONGLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> but i notice that some has little mineral and sone has too much but over the the colors are great.</li>
            <li> The pigments are FANTASTIC and you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your eyelids, (which is great since each eye shadow is very small).</li>
            <li> In this case especially, inexpensive does not mean &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34;  I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> And it arrived wrapped very well, all the eyeshadows were in a plastic case too and it was really quick.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and a beautiful set of colors.</li>
            <li> If you are a colorful person who enjoys beauty products, I would definitely recommend this affordable and fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on high-end eyeshadow, and this one is just as good as my UD pallets.</li>
            <li> After looking at the other options I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors are very very powdery though.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;m running into is that they are VERY VERY powdery.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to any girl who loves make up &amp; loves a huge variety of eye shadow colors!</li>
            <li> OMG super blendable and vibrant colors that transformes any look for the day or night.</li>
            <li> I use an eye primer that makes the colors pop even more, but it&#x27;s not necessary.  </li>
            <li> but it seems that is the case with most yellow eye-shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously the design is meant to be more compact and somewhat sturdy to hold everything.</li>
            <li> says its got great colors and last long.</li>
            <li> at least lol).</li>
            <li> This palette is a real steal guys, don&#x27;t pass up on it!</li>
            <li> Shipping is really fast and convent!</li>
            <li> but when I got it was the real deal!</li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> I love doing multicolor makeup with this and the brigh colors, also a variety of nude and low tones for smoky eyes and depth .</li>
            <li> I love these pallets , this is my second time purchasing this</li>
            <li> and you already have more than enough color.</li>
            <li> Love these colors..will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The colors are very concentrated and there are loads of fun shades.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are as stunning as they are numerous.  </li>
            <li> others have said in recent reviews, there is no Coastal Scents mark on the top of the lid.  </li>
            <li> The color lasts throughout the day as well as my Naked palette shadows do, and better than drug store</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was asking for.</li>
            <li> and very inexpensive !</li>
            <li> I love creating different eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Today was the first time I tried it on</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly as displayed.  </li>
            <li> you no longer need to have so many different palettes to achieve the look you want.</li>
            <li> I love to experiment with all kinds of different looks.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have not had any that would come out if trying to be used and the case is pretty durable</li>
            <li> but you get a lot out of them because you do not have to use so much!</li>
            <li> So many different colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> now on to the makeup, it definitely could have been package much better.</li>
            <li> For inexpensive shadows this is great.....very pigmented and pretty colors.....</li>
            <li> and when you find the colors you love you can purchase them individually from CoastalScents.com !&lt;</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be sticking with Coastal Scents for my eye shadows!</li>
            <li> I use it in a daily basis :)</li>
            <li> Especially the packaging could have been better.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still mostly intact too, so no big deal.</li>
            <li> If you find a color or 2 you like &amp; use the most -- they can be ordered individually by number.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Then when I was going out later that night I put elfs eye primer on first and got waaayyy better results.</li>
            <li> First of all, if you know how to do your makeup and what to do on your face first...</li>
            <li> So by you doing your eyes first...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got matte shadows and shimmer from the whole color wheel!</li>
            <li> Definitely willing to rebuy when I run out.</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> Not only is there a color variety, but there is also different types of finishes.&lt;br /&gt;For somebody who loves different colors and who is on a budget, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow Is Absolutely Awesone!</li>
            <li> I have favorite colors and want them to last</li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s the downfall of being given so many colors in such a compact case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better off buying off the actual site</li>
            <li> Each day I&#x27;m able to decide what similarly shaded colors I might blend or what contrasting colors I might want to combine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which one I want to do first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just got overwhelmed by all the possible combinations that I haven&#x27;t been able to come up with any looks yet.</li>
            <li> , I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the delivery was really fast!</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the various shades</li>
            <li> It has many different colors and the pigment is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from, although some look the same on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Some of the darker colors are much too dark for me on my fair skin but that may be just what your looking for.</li>
            <li> I love how the shadows last all day</li>
            <li> I did a You Tube review on this palette when it first came out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dancer and they are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> I had to order this twice because they didn&#x27;t mail me my first order</li>
            <li> THAT IS MOST DEFINITELY</li>
            <li> The colors are great and last long.</li>
            <li> Came exactly how I thought it would come.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun colors and really goes on well and stays all day.  </li>
            <li> but the UPS guys really put a beating to the box!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> They are extremely bold and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, especially for the price, but it is definitely a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I love all of the different colors of eye shadow</li>
            <li> Absolutely no broken pieces!</li>
            <li> When I first used my palette</li>
            <li> All I need is one of these palettes and I&#x27;m good to go all year round.</li>
            <li> I like the case it came in and how each palette is removable to work with a little more easily</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more natural colors, I would consider getting a different palette, but if you want a variety for real cheap, look no further.</li>
            <li> The three palettes were separated by a thick sheet of plastic and then they were encased in a very nice plastic container.  </li>
            <li> They go on highly pigmented and take very little to get great colour.</li>
            <li> It is alot smaller than i expected it but its pretty great.</li>
            <li> The issue is the little plastic covers they give you don&#x27;t work incredibly well, and if any powder is left on the holders, it gets all over.</li>
            <li> The case the three palettes come in is sturdy plastic and while not exactly a display piece, still looks nice.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have a hard time deciding which colors to use or pair with one another because there are so many options, but I&#x27;m finding myself using these more often than my MAC shadows.</li>
            <li> So, there&#x27;s a very high chance of your eye shadow touching the bottom of the palette above if you forgot the plastic.</li>
            <li> i love the colors they&#x27;re really vibrant and bright, but the pallet is a little smaller than i thought</li>
            <li> I probably will never use it&#x27;s great to have such a wide selection.</li>
            <li> The colors are smaller than expected but over all great product.</li>
            <li> If you like colorful eyeshadows, particularly shimmery ones, I&#x27;d buy this palette.</li>
            <li> I would have kept then because they come in the same format as the Real Coastal Scents palettes, but they did not have a label on the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please and would definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li> There are SO many colors (obviously) and the colors are very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I really need as many different yellows as there are though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way because they are highly pigmented and has maaaany shades both matte and shimmery to make the perfect eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> However, I found this to be priced very reasonably and especially after I had a chance to try it out and discovered that the colors stay as bold as they appear in the palette once they are applied!</li>
            <li> Another thing I do adore about these eyeshadows is that they&#x27;re pretty much arranged in categories of how you can put them on your eyes.</li>
            <li> at first i didn&#x27;t think this was a real coastal scents palette.</li>
            <li> The palette itself has pretty much every colour you could ever need.</li>
            <li> Received it fast and all the colors are very pigmented!</li>
            <li> this will not take up much space for a first time buyer</li>
            <li> It has been fun experimenting with colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy.</li>
            <li> SO SMALL U CANT EVEN USE GOOD BRUSHES WITH THIS</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth - BOLD colors - I didn&#x27;t expect such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> However, they gladly posted my other positive reviews!</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had... labels or color names to each so that you can find the color pot easily and order your favorites.  </li>
            <li> Such strong pigments.</li>
            <li> I am writing this because I am a dark skinned woman and there were not to many reviews for us on here to see if it was really worth buying.</li>
            <li> The well size is small, but if you use a good technique you shouldn&#x27;t need much anyway.</li>
            <li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like that&#x27;s a strong dislike is the smell.</li>
            <li> It comes in a sturdy case so I can carry it around in a large bag if I&#x27;m staying somewhere else.</li>
            <li> but there is a large variety of colours.  </li>
            <li> It certainly has a ton of colors.  </li>
            <li> I received this within a few days of ordering and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette a few months ago and I have to say, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> we found a new brand we can always come back to and be satisfied</li>
            <li> In love with my new 252 ultimate eye shadow</li>
            <li> Love the different colors.very pigmented and blends well.only down is i wish it had more matte shades.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was lucky, but my shadows arrived completely intact and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> These shadows have great pigmentation, and each small pot is more than enough to last a while.</li>
            <li> any colors i have in my closet, this palette matches :) the only concern was the eye shadows do pop out occasionally, they are not glued or fastened down, which could be good if you want to interchange them.</li>
            <li> but only half of them are pigmented enough to show up on your skin and the texture isn&#x27;t that easy to deal with, definitely have a good eye primer using this and be ready to spend more on eyeshadows when you figure out which ones you want to use.</li>
            <li> I have enough with one dab on the eyeshadow and its looks just fine.</li>
            <li> I sure would (this was my first purchase of coastal scents) and looking into other products as well.</li>
            <li> Blending them out can get tricky especially with the more vivid shades but lots of practice helps there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because the colors are just so vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> but they are very highly pigmented and that makes it up for it.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner makeup artist and really wanted to purchase an eye shadow palette with a large variety of colors to experiment with.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price and the amount of colors you get and the quality, I would say this is great to pick up if you are looking for eyeshadows and want to experiment with your look a little.</li>
            <li> I fixed them with a little rubbing alcohol, and good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Inspires so much creativity, and the textures are very high end, you&#x27;d never know you were using something this inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is compact enough to fit in a bathroom drawer with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without primer I found the colors to be very pigmented and with primer</li>
            <li> They blend very well</li>
            <li> This is very convenient for travelling.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic and the variety is extensive.</li>
            <li> Every different color you can think of, but it also doesn&#x27;t have that cheap feeling that eyeshadow sometimes has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> all of the ones I used were very pigmented.</li>
            <li> There is so much variety.</li>
            <li> This product is very pigmented for the price and lasts all day with or without a primer</li>
            <li> With an eye primer, the color stays on your lids the whole time.</li>
            <li> daughter enjoys having all of the colors she could ever think of when she gets ready to wear her makeup</li>
            <li> so I am unsure of how fast the shipping was</li>
            <li> In my opinion this was an absolute steal for me.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal guys.......</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The colors are intense and vivids and when yu convine the colors are so beatiful.</li>
            <li> what i wanted the whole time.</li>
            <li> It has all the colors i can imagine and its high quality !</li>
            <li> but I do not have to use to much.</li>
            <li> the color really show up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the colors would be very pigmented and I was hesitant to buy it.  </li>
            <li> The shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews really helped me make the decision to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Going to repurchase this palette soon for a friend that loves this so much</li>
            <li> I got the palette in the two days after ordering it and the shadows are very pigmented when using a eye primer.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented....</li>
            <li> This palette lets me choose any color combo in a ton of intensities to really reflect how I feel that day.</li>
            <li> I work in cosmetics and when I receive shipments they are packed very well to ensure none of the eye shadows crack.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> As soon as i opened the package i knew it was real.</li>
            <li> and I use it very often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t really even fade after me rubbing my eyes.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> colors come in dime size, but the color is very dense</li>
            <li> some colors are intense.</li>
            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> , all the colors are available to be sold individually on the coastal scents website.</li>
            <li> She took them on vaca with her and that would have made it much easier.</li>
            <li> they are really pigmented</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> They are definitely very pigmented.</li>
            <li> now, they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> the shadows were intact on arrival, as they were packaged very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this palette .</li>
            <li> although they look very pigmented and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> Very disappiinted.</li>
            <li> Some colors are very pigmented others</li>
            <li> not so much I do see that some colors are repeated in the palette.</li>
            <li> Well, actually better than expected.</li>
            <li> Daughter really likes these..</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was inexpensive but yet really pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product, they were just the way the seller describes it</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you will have to turn the whole case over to get them out</li>
            <li> This will be a fabulous xmas gift for all the ladies in my life next December.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing just look at the pacaking ---_----</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> it lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented ...</li>
            <li> The colors also blend really well</li>
            <li> They should have just given you a plastic tray cover to fit over each individual palette.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of green shades and warm colors to choose from,</li>
            <li> quite a few of them were shattered, but the shadows apply nice, and stay on all day</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are nice and powdery and blend well, and I use some of them as a liner by wetting a narrow angle brush to apply.  </li>
            <li> from light, delicate and matte to rich, vibrant and full of shimmer.  </li>
            <li> Using any good eyeshadow primer or base would allow you to get the true quality of the hues but they are still bold enough on their own.</li>
            <li> I really have no other complaints and if Coastal Scents ever comes out with more colors, I am definitely buying them!</li>
            <li> Some aren&#x27;t as pigmented as i would&#x27;ve expected but overall they&#x27;re pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased some of my favorite colors from this palette in individual hot pots.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite pleased that I do not need to buy the other two palettes.</li>
            <li> (this might be that they were close to my skin color), but other than that I love this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put anything on my face other than MAC, but after watching a million tutorials and seeing many makeup artists use these colors I figured what the heck let&#x27;s try it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you&#x27;d like a large assorment of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Probably the only downside is there are so many that they probably WILL get old and need replacing before you use up more than half of the shadows.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to really examine them all and use even a fraction of all that is available.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very concentrated and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation of most of the shadows is impressive (especially the shimmer ones), but the durability was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> but when I did it came quickly, the eye shadow for each palette is a bit tiny, it is either very pigmented or not at all.</li>
            <li> They are rich colors though, so the fact that the swatches are small isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li> The amount of each color is kind of small</li>
            <li> Yes the swatches are small, but there are 252 options, and honestly you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> The long lasting of it works better with an eye primer first.</li>
            <li> other reviewers, I wish there were more purple shades, as well as more deep blue shades.</li>
            <li> they are kind of small, about the size of dimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from I sometimes get lost from applying one eye to the other!</li>
            <li> The pallet is good only that its little</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever running out of new pigments to try with this palette!</li>
            <li> I am very into switching up eyeshadow and trying new looks and patterns, and this fills any gap for any color</li>
            <li> I received my new palette in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> so I would rather have many colors to choose from with less amount of each.  </li>
            <li> And if you do, many of the colors can be bought in individual (bigger) pots on the Coastal Scents site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Colors are just as vibrant as they look on here.</li>
            <li> It is my first time buying from this company and on amazon in general and i will absolutely being ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> But the pigments are vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, buttery, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> For some reason this helps the brush hold more color and DOES NOT make it smear/run...may have actually helped with the lasting capabilities as well, now that I think about it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there can be a lot of fallout with some shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is a great palette.</li>
            <li> I wonder how quickly I will go through some that I use regularly.</li>
            <li> THE QUALITY IS DECENT, I&#x27;M CARAMEL COMPLEXION</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> It seems super high pigment, especially the red-tinted shades.</li>
            <li> The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the small portion of each color, but so far I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that either.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a one-stop box that has every color you can imagine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a gift for any girl out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The price is high</li>
            <li> Colors are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> I always find myself  ignoring my drugstore and high end products to use these eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this product and I highly recommend Coastal Scent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The one thing i can say i didn&#x27;t like is that these colors create a little fall off but most eyeshadows do so</li>
            <li> but I prefer to keep mine a little more protected with the sheets.    </li>
            <li> I love this palette, some were a little cracked</li>
            <li> They may take a little more TLC but for the effect for the price</li>
            <li> color palette on this is so amazing I hardly have words to explain it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to damage the colors in the corners by bumping them with the corners of the other palettes.</li>
            <li> It is highly pigmented, just too many outlandish colors for everyday use.</li>
            <li> If you need bigger pans of wild colors, I suggest getting a special palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont have anything bad to say about this palette is perfect!</li>
            <li> by far I rather use this one I got from AMAZON, they stayed on threw the whole day.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this and it has completely changed the way I use make up.</li>
            <li> Also I have really picky and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and it lasts the whole day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Occasionally I may need to reapply but that is rare.</li>
            <li> Ordered this a few months ago and I love it.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t use it everyday but after buying this product I doubt I am going to be making any more purchases any times soon.</li>
            <li> They make it look so big and so worth it when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> love the package and all of the colors included in the set all is missing is the brushes and glitter</li>
            <li> colors are gorgeous, ranging from all ends of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;The individual colors are small, however I researched this before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more products from this company in the near future!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m Hooked, ordering a few more for gifts...</li>
            <li> Lots of colors, good setup to keep them from getting broken, quality case.</li>
            <li> Not so much for the purples and blues but regardless put the shadow on wet and be prepared for a bold difference.</li>
            <li> My palette came in perfect condition (well the black was broken</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is just as amazing, if not better, and the price is way cheaper!</li>
            <li> With the right amount of eyelid primer, this shadow will last you all day.</li>
            <li> Once you find colors that are right for you, you can take those right down to the mac store or whoever you like and buy that color.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge issue though because it stops it from mixing with the other colours.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> and she makes me want to venture out and try new colors</li>
            <li> so i got this to try new looks.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and shipped this to my sky box in Miami then to Trinidad.  </li>
            <li> Also, be careful not to pull to hard on the ribbons because the glue/adhesive that they use isn&#x27;t all the great.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how pigmented the colors were and how I had to use very very little of the color for it to show up enough on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark skin tone and all the colors show on my skin perfectly fine...</li>
            <li> Not real, false advertising.  </li>
            <li> The trays store easily in any order in the compact black plastic case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pack and travel with and the less products I take with me, the easier life is for me....</li>
            <li> Arrived early, works well with my skin and the colors are really vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about makeup and was super shocked that this product was so good.</li>
            <li> Maybe good to buy for a 10 or 12 year old who&#x27;s just starting out with makeup and having fun playing with it but not so much for anyone older.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this product, but I&#x27;m just not impressed with the quantity and quality of this palette.</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from and a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> I bought the palette to review on a beauty blog, and found myself pleasantly surprised by the silky consistency and high pigmentation of the shadow.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, and have not had any reaction to these.  </li>
            <li> I use one third of the colors on my higher end palettes</li>
            <li> aware, the eyeshadow pans are tiny.  </li>
            <li> The colors are vivid no need to reapply.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m not sure you could find better.</li>
            <li> I do use primer and a white jumbo pencil (L.A. Colors in Sea Shell, to be exact) under the eye shadows for added pop and long-lasting color.</li>
            <li> Yes, the shadows are small but there&#x27;s so many to pick from that it makes up for it.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned the eyeshadows are small, but they are great long lasting quality.</li>
            <li> my make up atrtist had the same exact palette.</li>
            <li> These colors are small but I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Which usually won&#x27;t get it from other brands in such a good price and quality!.  </li>
            <li> Each color was much smaller than my daughter expected, but overall she liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are also slightly smaller than I thought but because there is such a variety I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never actually get to use them all anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little ribbons on the side make it so easy to get to what you want.</li>
            <li> The colours are vibrant and pigmented and last all day, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Now im dark skinned and after experimenting with a few of the colors i can say most are very pigmented a few others one dont show up too well as opposed to others but overall its a good set.</li>
            <li> The coverage is amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more of a darker tone...not the darkest of browns but dark enough to be challenged in finding well pigmented eye-shadows and will show on my skin.  </li>
            <li> At first when i unboxed it i checked out the selection of colors and made sure no shadows were broken but didn&#x27;t take the plastic dividers off yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have noticed that there isn&#x27;t much fallout - less than the first revealed palette!</li>
            <li> Some of the colours aren&#x27;t well pigmented, and it breaks off if you travel with the case creating a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Rich pigment on dark complexion.</li>
            <li> the colors are super pigmented and it offers a wide variety to choose.</li>
            <li> There is a large array of colors and can be easily mixed together and blended.</li>
            <li> At first colors may seem as though the colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented, wet your brush and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love all of the colors the size of the pallette is a little smaller than I was expecting though.</li>
            <li> ton of color, many combinations, it is hard to chose what colors I will wear each day.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in the makeup field or just loves makeup in general.</li>
            <li> However I think even without the primer the color would have lasted because it took eye makeup remover to get the color completely off.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product 100% to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a few light specs that sprinkled out of three</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented , blendable, they last forever!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this palette.</li>
            <li> so I could try different types of makeup without worrying about how much product I was wasting.</li>
            <li> I also will be using for cosplay bounding (like disney bounding but a wider spectrum) cause some times being a 22 year old woman</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Just wow.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Definitely has staying power, I need to find a gentle makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The package came a day early .</li>
            <li> but the color is so pigmented that you only really need to dot your brush once or twice to get a load of color.</li>
            <li> and it last the whole night and</li>
            <li> My young daughter likes these.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised by how pigmented they were.</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR</li>
            <li> All the colors I have tried so far blend</li>
            <li> My 14 year old saw this set in a make-up tutorial</li>
            <li> I am a returning customer and so far I ordered 2 of the 252 palette .</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast prior to ordering .</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented so I have to build the color up and consequently when blending it almost makes it look like you have no eyeshadow on, even with the primer.</li>
            <li> My young daughter likes these.</li>
            <li> Obviously they aren&#x27;t designer quality, but for something of a &amp;#34;Drugstore&amp;#34; brand they are really pigmented.</li>
            <li> my 18 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> so it makes it easier for your look to become seamless.</li>
            <li> The shadow pots are small but since it is nicely pigmented it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well worth what I spent.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, it will probably last me a few years</li>
            <li> The case is nice and sturdy and none of the pans were cracked or broken.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are actually the size of a dime but other than that I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This product has so much different shades of so many different colors and that once you purchase this palette you do not need to purchase any other eye shadow palette for about  years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I received this palette today, it was a lot smaller than I expected,  but the shadows are so pretty and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The pods are about the size of a dime which was a little smaller than expected but with this many colors I won&#x27;t be running out any time soon!</li>
            <li> All the colors are very vibrant and there is such a wide variety you will have trouble choosing just which one you want to wear :).</li>
            <li> But the main problem I have is that the make up simply doesn&#x27;t stay on for any length of time, let alone all day.</li>
            <li> The paletteis pretty small too (about 9&amp;#34;x6&amp;#34;) so it&#x27;s not going to take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> I usually just apply once in the morning and most shades last throughout a work day.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my eyemake up which I apply daily before work, usually matching the outfit I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of their pallets in the past and the colors come on solid and don&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li> This product is not bad but not original.</li>
            <li> Like any other eye shadows I have tried, it does fade a little throughout the day, but it lasts for as long as I need it to and is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a high end pallet from TOO FACE n</li>
            <li> they came as expected and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several palettes from high end brands...</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such high pigment quality.  </li>
            <li> Black is main color!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical about how great this product really was when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I received my palettes on time, none were broken and every single one of them are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It is small and light so you can carry it on roadtrips when you travel, but it still packs a punch with all of the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although each reservoir is small, the selection and variety of color is fabulous.</li>
            <li> For the price of this item, I was incredibly surprised by how deep the swatches were; they are about the size of a dime, but if you flip the palette over you can see how deep they really are.</li>
            <li> and I normally use Urban Decay when it comes to my eye-shadow.</li>
            <li> but it was very well wrapped killing my fear of the palette being broken, it is actually fairly tiny but there are so many colors</li>
            <li> The palette is great, my only complaint is that a few of the pots broke in shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> My Mac 219 now is permanently hot pink.</li>
            <li> The color is vibrant, no matter how dark your skin is, it shows very well.</li>
            <li> It has a large selection, The only thing is that the pots are really tiny.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I make my eye brush a little wet to make sure the powdery eye shadow doesn&#x27;t fall all over my face, but this depends on each color.</li>
            <li> So many choices, it&#x27;s hard to even know where to start!</li>
            <li> are about dime size, but many people failed to mention that the colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t like that only a plastic sheet protected each palette once you remove the individual plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li> but i think it&#x27;s ok to be that small as long as I get the desired pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Later when i went to use it and finally took the dividers off the smell really hit me</li>
            <li> A few colors needed to go on wet to show pigmentation better, and some didn&#x27;t show up well on my skin</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation but little small than expected</li>
            <li> it is so rich and pigmented very little</li>
            <li> The size of the individual pots are a little smaller than most palettes but with 252 colours, I do not believe that is a big downfall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having second thoughts as to whether if it&#x27;s worth it to buy other items from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> but it really threw me off being so excited to try this and having never experienced that before.</li>
            <li> Aside from the size of the shadow pans, I guess my only other complaint would be that I wish it were a little cheaper, but $30 for 252 shadows is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as big as the huge palettes you&#x27;re used to seeing, but as far as the product a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> This means that a little goes a long way, at least with my skin tone, lightly tanned - light, they do.</li>
            <li> The pans are small, but that&#x27;s to be expected with so many colors and the price.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I have not used every color yet, but so far the green shadows seem to go on lighter, more sheer, even the dark greens.  </li>
            <li> You barely have to tap your brush in the pan</li>
            <li> As a broke college student, this really allowed me the freedom (and doesn&#x27;t take up valuable space) to have a wide range of colors without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets with this</li>
            <li> I owned one of these that i had purchased from coastal scents a few months back for personal use and wanted another to put in my free lance kit.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors look very similar - they may look identical if you are looking from far away.</li>
            <li> Should I ever run out, or they get too old to use, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li> Was kind of sad about that.</li>
            <li> I was pleased about that because I&#x27;ve read that some were broken in transit.</li>
            <li> I usually have to wet down my applicator brush to get any store brand to look as good.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to buy this palette only because I have another large palette of 88 neutral shadows that I haven&#x27;t used yet, despite the great quality.</li>
            <li> The pigments are amazing on this pallette, the colours are very small, but for personal use it can last you a long time, becouse you dont have to apply a lot to get what you want.</li>
            <li> They came in a small bubble wrap around the actual case them slipped into the items original packaging.</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows have a little fallout, but most of them are fine, and all of them are better than Wet n Wild, which I was surprised to find out, despite reviews to the contrary, had awful</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing eyeshadow and this is coming from a person who buys a crazy amount of high end makeup.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying eyeshadows at the store I thought looked good only to get it home and turn out differently than expected.  </li>
            <li> I thought for the price the shadows wouldn&#x27;t be as vibrant or long lasting as the description said.</li>
            <li> I did think it&#x27;d be bigger but seriously, with all those options of eyeshadow and all the other eyeshadow I already own</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t forget the primer to get the most dramatic color.</li>
            <li> the circles are a bit smaller than I expected, but the product  really  hold on your skin and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been shopping around for eye shadow palettes for a while, and was expecting to pay quite a bit for a wide color spectrum of a decent quality.</li>
            <li> There are a wide variety of vibrant colours.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow isn&#x27;t flaky but when I first put the eyeshadow on my eyes, it burned a little bit, but not a lot.</li>
            <li> They seemed a little powdery when you first put the shadow on your brush</li>
            <li> the only problem is the size of each color shade is small so colors run out quickly</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it four stars, is because the eye shadows don&#x27;t last as long as the high end brands.</li>
            <li> I just got this recently but the colors are so vibrant and pigmented and last all day long!</li>
            <li> I have to also say that colors show up very well on my dark skin</li>
            <li> So it DID arrive on time but strangely it never came to my house..</li>
            <li> One thing that I wish other individuals using makeup would realize is that we seriously do not have to buy makeup at Sephora or MAC to feel like we have quality makeup, that we can&#x27;t look at ourselves in the mirror and feel like we&#x27;ve created a masterpiece.</li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers say it&#x27;s highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting in it&#x27;s color pigment and photographs naturally.</li>
            <li> and I have not used a single pallet completely</li>
            <li> For example, mattes and glitters and right next to each other that would compliment each other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the same quality as Urban Decay, Lorac, Smashbox, Too Faced or any of the other high end brands, but this exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> 3 of the colors got a little messed up but its 252 eyeshadows so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a palette that you don&#x27;t want to set down in any way other than right side up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Took only a day and a half to get here with normal shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some colors where broken  Other then that love them</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and some seem to be slight different shades of each other.</li>
            <li> add a little water to your makeup brush and they become vibrant.</li>
            <li> Yes...maybe a little squirly, particularly for someone my age</li>
            <li> So far, i haven&#x27;t had to purchase colours from other brands because they are already in this palette.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this palette to anyone on a budget (or not, for that matter) and curious about trying out a wide assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> I thought i would be disappointed over it, but there are SO MANY colors to choose from that it really makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I spent a little time reading the reviews, and basically what I found was that the only real issues are the size of each shadow colour, and sometimes the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> very good......just a littlebit small in size....strong package...</li>
            <li> I do wish the color pieces were a bit larger, as a larger shadow brush can be difficult to fit in the pod.</li>
            <li> so they last a long time.</li>
            <li> They wear well as well as are long lasting.</li>
            <li> it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I find them to be long lasting if used over a primer, as well.</li>
            <li> The color is long lasting even when I use it without primer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are dime sized but the shadows are highly pigmented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Colors come out so vibrant and they last they dont wear off or nor will excessive powder fall off ur eyes when applying the shadow.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very pigmented, hardly ever smudge or transfer, and the colors last all day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how some blues are on different section than others (same goes with other colors such as yellows, browns, oranges, pinks, etc</li>
            <li> I had it last all day long with no wear!</li>
            <li> The actual size of each is very small but you can always purchase the individual pots if you adore the colors that much.</li>
            <li> but it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> only prob was that they were a little small but worth it</li>
            <li> they last VERY long!</li>
            <li> Either most individuals are not aware that this is fake, or the seller has changed the products they are selling.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and you just need a small amount to use.</li>
            <li> and I hope these palettes last me some time because as a college student, and just a young woman in general, I seriously cannot afford to be broke just to &amp;#34;look good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, and you really do not need to load your brush with the colors so even though each one is small, they will last.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing negative to be said about this palette unless you find yourself using up just one which is highly impossible with the amazing neutral shades and vibrant colors it provides.</li>
            <li> There are many colors, so you can go as crazy as you would like with your eye shadow.</li>
            <li> the only issue is that one of the colors is all crushed up when it got here.</li>
            <li> The colors were a bit smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Im giving it three stars only because the one I received today had some of the eye shadows crushed.</li>
            <li> Even earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> When used wet they have an especially concentrated</li>
            <li> they stay for long time.</li>
            <li> Without putting any sort of base or primer under the shadows, they show up fantastically, even the mattes which was really surprising.</li>
            <li> They came very well packaged, not a single one broken.</li>
            <li> I mean of course the customer wants to protect all their pallets.</li>
            <li> wish each palette was and individual palette as oppose to the 3 trays in one box, only because I feel like this makes it easier to mess it up and get you fingers in the shadow when you are just trying to get them out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pods are a little smaller than I thought but as long as I change it up on a regular basis I shouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> Not like some other brands that are sheer when applied.</li>
            <li> so my shawdows wouldnt break with my other junk but Amazon packed them in the same box anyway, And they didnt break!!!</li>
            <li> It can be a little clumsy to handle sometimes and can take up a lot of room if they&#x27;re all laid out, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> When it first came I thought it was a little small, but these colors are so pigmented</li>
            <li> some of the colors I use daily or weekly other colors</li>
            <li> I would not only recommend coastal scents eyeshadow palette, I would recommend coastal scents for other products as well.</li>
            <li> Some are a bit chalky, and others are just too hard to use, and mainly glitter.</li>
            <li> In the pictures on Amazon it looks like there are a few multiple of the same color.</li>
            <li> The only ones I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use are the green ones though, since I have blue eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to makeup</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a single one that was messed up.</li>
            <li> If your one who draw inspiration from a single look this will work for you.</li>
            <li> I will probably never buy another single or quad eyeshadow ever again (unless I run out of a color).</li>
            <li> the eye shadows were tiny and looking at the picture I expected them to be a little bigger!</li>
            <li> Each color is about the size of a dime which is enough for an average user.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was surprised at the small portions of each eyeshadow</li>
            <li> These are all extremely pigmented especially when paired with a wet brush.</li>
            <li> The size is small but the color really pop on my skin and u only have  to use a small amount...</li>
            <li> I have used NYX white eyeshadow base to make the colors pop even more &amp; a primer to last all day.</li>
            <li> smashed and now it is completely loose dust.</li>
            <li> The colors last long and show perfectly on dark skin !</li>
            <li> the pots of color in these are tiny tiny and it will take an extremely small make up brush to use them, and I bought them for my 10 year old granddaughter and they are just to small for her.</li>
            <li> The colors blend well and work well dry or wet.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this palette is how small the pots are (smaller than a dime).</li>
            <li> Small swatches, but enough to last a while.</li>
            <li> a very dry eyeshadow meaning that if you put a truck load on at a time you will get some debris on your face.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not excessively powdery, and there was very little under-eye fallout even with a dark smokey eye.  </li>
            <li> The little pots of makeup are small in size, but each shadow is so highly pigmented that you only need a little product to achieve your desired look.</li>
            <li> Plain black package, plain black palette case, and eye shadow palettes are not the same as the real one.</li>
            <li> I only had to use a little bit of color to get the effect I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product is a little pricey for how tiny the eyeshadow is.</li>
            <li> But the each color comes in little circles, not as big as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The only little con I would highlight is the size of each colour.</li>
            <li> the little pans are smaller then that.</li>
            <li> After I put on the shadow, it was harder to take off, I had to scrub.</li>
            <li> some of the yellows would require a wet brush</li>
            <li> Of corse, when they arrived there were about 4 completely broken eye shadows even though it did have very thorough packing.</li>
            <li> Not what expected but can do.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried to use them wet yet so maybe that will make a difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Colors are as expected.</li>
            <li> I think it depends on how careful mail carriers/ups/fed ex is with the package.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you are removing each palette from the box.</li>
            <li> Just 1 individual round dot of color...</li>
            <li> Maybe the eye shadows wouldn&#x27;t have gotten crushed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake?&lt;br /&gt;You are obviously not very educated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a real coastal scents product.</li>
            <li> wet your brush in water.</li>
            <li> And arrived sooner than time expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a lot of fall out, but I guess that&#x27;s expected with cheaper eyeshadows</li>
            <li> covers a wide range of colours and finishes (matte, shimmer, duo-chrome).</li>
            <li> no matter how carefully I try to dab at each color.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> the money I spent</li>
            <li> A majority of them blend well, and there are only a few (&amp;#60;5) which gave me issues.</li>
            <li> i also like the wide variety of colors this palette provides.</li>
            <li> Im a brown skin lady who loves making my colors stand out with out the drag queen of queens effect.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to drag around a thousand eye shadows pots.</li>
            <li> The shadows are literally the size of the tip of my pink finger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well they hold up when using them wet.  </li>
            <li> I have done a few different looks with these, and the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li> but I expected it, like if you have an 88 shimmer palette</li>
            <li> nothing was broken the packaging was very well handled</li>
            <li> Works better with the NYX Cosmetics Base in White</li>
            <li> With 252 colors, it&#x27;s likely there are a few in here that are dupes for other brands shadows.</li>
            <li> which kind of disappointed me a little</li>
            <li> Being a high end makeup snob, buying this palette was a bit of a tough decision.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so it might not look like a lot</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way bc</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> The product also is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> BUT A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> The have a cream to powder feel to them and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After swatching every single shadow on my arm, I determined that well over half were useable.</li>
            <li> As other comments will tell you, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is very little of each color but enough to get atleast 2 months use out of each well.</li>
            <li> and I think green shadow looks odd on blue eyes.</li>
            <li> While the eyeshadow pots are small, they are also fairly deep to the point that you can use them quite a bit before running out.</li>
            <li> I had it packed with other items</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> The colors come in a dime sized amount, but then again the colors are extremely pigmented so there&#x27;s no worry.</li>
            <li> Stila etc and see no reason to order anything other than these from now on.  </li>
            <li> The color selection is endless.  </li>
            <li> Some of the shadows on the other hand can be chalky and blend away to nothing.</li>
            <li> I got mine in a box with other items, so maybe that</li>
            <li> I got mine in a box with other items, so maybe that</li>
            <li> Perfection, I&#x27;m looking to see if this manufacture gas any other products like blushes, if they do I&#x27;ll be purchasing them as well.</li>
            <li> I got it 4 days before the expected day!</li>
            <li> other two trays have plastic wrap over them.</li>
            <li> The palettes are small, but just enough.  </li>
            <li> and i received my other item that day</li>
            <li> It was in the middle tray too, so not sure how that could have happened either where it was stored or during shipping.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could just remove the sheet and stack the palettes without any protection atop each other</li>
            <li> Small enough for her to pack and take to college.</li>
            <li> (Other colors are pigmented too)</li>
            <li> but they are so small individually</li>
            <li> Everyone can bond over make up The three pallets allows you to demonstrate while the other pallet can be given to your student.</li>
            <li> but when I ordered it I was sure I was going to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> size of the shadows is small, about the size of a dime or slightly bigger  </li>
            <li> Now the other colors i use them a lot.</li>
            <li> The combo of colors are endless and combined with a eye primer</li>
            <li> The colors are so pigmented that you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> My pallette looks nothing like the other ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The amounts of each color is smaller than I expected, but still seems to go a long enough way for a casual user.</li>
            <li> The glitter ones are a little flakey and cinda loose</li>
            <li> fast shipping a few colors came broken</li>
            <li> The only downside to this is being careful with applying it, you do have to slowly build some of the colors because it is</li>
            <li> As a caramel skinned black woman, the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant on my skin as i would like and the palletes are very small!</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t fade off my eyelid after long use like other make up products I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> But the way the three palettes stack on top of each other with separate plastic sheets is really annoying and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Each palate has a hard plastic sheath to separate it from the palate above it, and each palate also has a ribbon on one end that acts as a tab to lift palate out of the box.</li>
            <li> As a dark skinned woman I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding products that were pigmented enough for my skin tone, until now.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding an eyeshadow that is pigmented enough to show through my dark skin (even with primer and concealer).</li>
            <li> The colors are extremely pigmented, just as other reviewers have said, the dime-sized pans are small but a little goes a long way with these colors.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that each palette is separated by only a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> But its just weird packaging, I don&#x27;t like to pull this whole thing out every morning.</li>
            <li> If your a dark skinned woman, this is the holy grail.</li>
            <li> I am a dark girl</li>
            <li> I am also writing because I am to a dark skinned woman that purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry though, all the colors are at least one shade different from one</li>
            <li> For dark skin individuals, you may have to put a lot on to stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, since I usually wear neutral eyeshadows, this palette should last me a while since I won&#x27;t be wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind, i doubt ill hit pan anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I have natural dark circles under my eyes, as well, and often feel like eye-shadow makes me look like I secretly run a Fight Club.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and none of the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> I use a MAC paint pot base, so I&#x27;m sure that helps, but it stays all day.  </li>
            <li> I was also a little disappointed in how small and deep the shadows are, they wont last long if you use the same color daily.</li>
            <li> I mean, even Urban Decay doesn&#x27;t quite do the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mean that only makes since.</li>
            <li> While the pots of color are small a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> different colors to choose from and very small and compact.</li>
            <li> These eye shadow holes are really small but trust me don&#x27;t need much a little goes a long way I tried some on as soon as I got</li>
            <li> the black is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a pigmented black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say less than dime size.  </li>
            <li> I bought this half off on Black Friday.</li>
            <li> because I have lots of black shadows).</li>
            <li> this palette has something to offer for every skin tone, from pale to dark.</li>
            <li> The pans are small, but a small amount of product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My only sort of complaint is that the shadow pans are quite small.</li>
            <li> When used with a primer there is little to no fall out.</li>
            <li> The purple stained my brush a little</li>
            <li> The pigments stay on all day when preceded by a little eyelid primer.  </li>
            <li> They were a little damaged in the delivery process.  </li>
            <li> definitely lots of colors to choose from.. 2 little ones came a little broken</li>
            <li> a couple shadows were a little broken but nothing to obvious</li>
            <li> I am shocked with this product, not only did it come early</li>
            <li> They must have gotten broken/shattered through the mail or was already broken prior to shipping out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a few colours that aren&#x27;t as pigmented but considering the amount of colours for the price</li>
            <li> There were several of them that were broken</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like heavy color, this wouldn&#x27;t be for you.  </li>
            <li> if you like one, it will probably be gone in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Goes on with a few swipes.</li>
            <li> Some colors don&#x27;t go on well, but it&#x27;s just a few.</li>
            <li> But it heavily pigmented</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is just too messy to use.</li>
            <li> I did a few swatches</li>
            <li> A few of the shadows were shattered when I got them</li>
            <li> and that gets messy.  </li>
            <li> dont waste ure money....</li>
            <li> I am not a huge makeup person</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of this brand, as I have no previous experience with it</li>
            <li> I recived it in a off package that dosent even verify it&#x27;s from coastal scents just a black box!  </li>
            <li> Like i said earlier in my post, sorry about my other review</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the very small size.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend an eye shadow base if you want those vibrant colors though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which reviewers here felt this make up doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays on all day, but in my experience that is not true.</li>
            <li> It came neatly packaged in a black case, each of the three trays were encased in plastic and none of the colors were loose or broken.</li>
            <li> From the shades it has you can go for a very natural look to a very dramatic one.</li>
            <li> Only small issue that can be over looked is one of the eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> they are so pigmented but they are a little small</li>
            <li> The case is hard plastic and a matte black color</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a single color is broken.</li>
            <li> And as with matte colors, they are a little hard to blend</li>
            <li> so you need very little to stand out.</li>
            <li> Other than that, omg that pigmentation are out of this world!!!</li>
            <li> Small cakes, but</li>
            <li> The product pots are small in size about a dime size but thats</li>
            <li> Each color is small.</li>
            <li> yes the colors are small</li>
            <li> Besides that I am still not able to even come close to denting the amount of options there are.</li>
            <li> And the pot sizes may be small</li>
            <li> I usually use a primer when using shadows</li>
            <li> colors are just how you see them in the picture, they&#x27;re a bit small</li>
            <li> so im not sure what happen.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I didnt realize the eyeshadows were so small</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small but not too small.  </li>
            <li> The size per colour is small...</li>
            <li> THE SHADES ARE SMALL</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m usually scared to wear them out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfectly said; Money is not being wasted here for 252 colors for just $25!</li>
            <li> Small samples</li>
            <li> Yes the eye shadows are small but for the amount you get, it makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are a bit small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star rating because I&#x27;m still not sure how i feel about that</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t come with a case for the two other pallets and that I was not happy about.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that the color last quite a while on your eyes, not as long as a really expensive eyeshadow but for the price of one expensive eyeshadow you get 252 colors..</li>
            <li> It came wrapped up tightly, none of the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find some that have lots of pigment w/o spending a fortune.  </li>
            <li> each well of color is approximately the size of my little pinky nail.</li>
            <li> i thought it would at least be nickel sized.</li>
            <li> SUCKS DONT BUY</li>
            <li> I was running late.  </li>
            <li> Also pigmentation sucks.</li>
            <li> Not very happy.</li>
            <li> i mean</li>
            <li> But I mean there&#x27;s 252 eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> 252 colors is a lot for so small a price!</li>
            <li> Omg well I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, so I&#x27;ve been wanting the urban decay and all those expensive pallets, however this pallet is a makeup junkies dream!</li>
            <li> The only kinda bad thing i could say about this palette is that the eyeshadows are as small as a dime.</li>
            <li> Some state that they are very small shadows</li>
            <li> But each color is very small.  </li>
            <li> I usually use these as a base color and put Urban Decay Stardust on as the glitter really compliments the base color.</li>
            <li> Seriously, there&#x27;s something for everyone and every skin</li>
            <li> When I received my eyeshadow palette some of the eye shadows were broken in pieces, I was not very happy when I saw themüòï...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to pick a face of the day!</li>
            <li> A few came broken so that was sad</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are really tiny /: its kinda lame and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed I want my money back</li>
            <li> So when I apply the eyeshadow is gets everywhere on my face and is very hard to wipe off.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I just also think it&#x27;s a little inconvenient to have to pull them all out if I want to get to the bottom</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, through the terribly pigmented product, there are some that are very well</li>
            <li> and I use it often, however I can almost guaranty there will be some broken eye shadows.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this palette for me through Amazon by Coastal Scents and some of the eye shadow palettes came broken.</li>
            <li> nothing got broken</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the purchase, therefore I requested a refund.</li>
            <li> Two colors were slightly broken upon delivery, which I&#x27;m not worried about.</li>
            <li> but this palette and the blush one came with broken colors.</li>
            <li> none of the palettes were broken.  </li>
            <li> but they arrived broken</li>
            <li> Shipment was covered with bubble wrap and nothing came broken thank god.</li>
            <li> when I got it it wasn&#x27;t even broken or anything.</li>
            <li> The container itself is thin for what its proposing</li>
            <li> i received my 252 palette package today, I opened it, and 4 colors were broken.</li>
            <li> Without a primer and base colors do not show up well enough.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be broken because it came by way of post office</li>
            <li> When I received nothing was damaged or broken.</li>
            <li> the shadows were irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> This was false advertising.</li>
            <li> I can do a dramatic look even with the neutral colors.</li>
            <li> Pallets are approximately the size of a dime, I was a little disappointed by that</li>
            <li> and there is no color black. :(</li>
            <li> For the price of this palette you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> after I ordered them I was scared about it being fake.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on how pigmented this palette would be but when I got it and tried it out the makeup stayed on all day without a problem.  </li>
            <li> no matter the expensive of the eyeshadow you buy excess will fall.</li>
            <li> After scrubbing and scrubbing, I was still unable to remove the stain, and just attempted to cover it with concealer.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> but the product is not perfectly protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those plastic sheets you have to use to protect your eyeshadow form getting damaged is silly.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received the item because it was very small</li>
            <li> One color did arrive broken, which is a shame but one color out of 252 isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I lllooooovvvveee  make up and this is not real coastal scents its crap don&#x27;t buy at all!!!!</li>
            <li> 2 colors is broken, which disappointed a perfectionist like me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t belive how crazy pigmented ALL of these colors are.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the item would suffer any damage</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> was disappointed to get a fake product.</li>
            <li> i am so mad</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Yuck! :(</li>
            <li> When I received it, a handful of the shadows were shattered!!!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> the product was going to be crap, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> and I always use an eyeshadow base which makes these colors POP!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst or strongest smell</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for the price , it work for me for practice on my makeup class , love it</li>
            <li> Careful when applying they seem to smudge, but I do love all the colors and at a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> For the price of this palette you cannot go wrong. Colors are true and stay. Not like some other brands that are sheer when applied. I travel with this palette and use the bubble wrap and box it came with to wrap it, so no breakage or chipping yet. The shadow pots are small but since it is nicely pigmented it goes a long way. Plus there are so many shades of each color you can mix and match. It has been fun experimenting with colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy.</li>
            <li> This is way better than I wished for!!! The colors are vibrant and rich! Just as other reviewers say it&#x27;s highly pigmented. I decided to purchase this set instead buying a makeup kit for Halloween. I figured for the price to pay $15.00 more for this set would be worth it because I could use it anytime. I only had to use a little bit of color to get the effect I wanted. I did use a eye primer and foundation primer. However I think even without the primer the color would have lasted because it took eye makeup remover to get the color completely off. Just washing my face with face soap wasn&#x27;t enough. I was left with a stain where I used the makeup. Oil free makeup remover took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy with this set.</li>
            <li> Great value for money. Small cakes, but thats good coz u wont have it sit with u unused for years... great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Well hello everyone i just want to say is that i purchased  this beautiful eyeshadow pallet  and was soooo happy how pretty these eyeshadows are theres so many colors and i cant wait to use this im going to have fun with thisüòÜ  so worth what you pay for it....andrea</li>
            <li> This is NOT a realy coastal Scents product, I can guarantee this.&lt;br /&gt;However, through the terribly pigmented product, there are some that are very well quality.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li> She is pretty happy with number of colors but the quantity is pitiful.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors to dye for. OMG super blendable and vibrant colors that transformes any look for the day or night. I can&#x27;t believe that i didn&#x27;t get this sooner. There&#x27;s Matt colors some with shimmer i mean what make-up artist would&#x27;t want this in there travel kit. lol. Kisses</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! The makeup stay on and doesn&#x27;t ware off.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette for people who want a wide range of colors and types of eyeshadows. This palette has it all, form glittery to satin and matte. Without primer I found the colors to be very pigmented and with primer it&#x27;s just beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! After I put on the shadow, it was harder to take off, I had to scrub. It&#x27;s smudge proof &amp; totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed on how fast I got my package. I love the colors to my eyeshadow pallet I recently bought a high end pallet from TOO FACE n by far I rather use this one I got from AMAZON, they stayed on threw the whole day.....HAPPY HAPPY</li>
            <li> It is alot smaller than i expected it but its pretty great. I was worried because I did 3 seperate orders so my shawdows wouldnt break with my other junk but Amazon packed them in the same box anyway, And they didnt break!!! it was packaged so well. S/o to amazon</li>
            <li> ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è super love it,</li>
            <li> The pots arrived full and unbroken, the colors are highly pigmented and very rich.  I use an eye primer that makes the colors pop even more, but it&#x27;s not necessary.  These are excellent colors, and I&#x27;ve tried so many eyeshadows.  It&#x27;s hard to find some that have lots of pigment w/o spending a fortune.  This is bang for your buck :)</li>
            <li> This is a good assortment of eye shadow.  It is kind of clunky to have to take them all out to get to the color&lt;br /&gt;you need but they do go on and blend well.</li>
            <li> Lots of colors. I love it. Received. Very quick.</li>
            <li> Items were much smaller then i anticipated, only reason why i gave it a 4 star vs a 5.but still a beautifull set.</li>
            <li> These colours are great...some of the yellows would require a wet brush but it seems that is the case with most yellow eye-shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more of a darker tone...not the darkest of browns but dark enough to be challenged in finding well pigmented eye-shadows and will show on my skin.  This palette did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I spent a little time reading the reviews, and basically what I found was that the only real issues are the size of each shadow colour, and sometimes the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To touch of the size of each colour;&lt;br /&gt;They are about dime size, but many people failed to mention that the colors are very pigmented. This means that a little goes a long way, at least with my skin tone, lightly tanned - light, they do. The colors are great and come out the way they look as well, add a primer underneath and they look even better, but you don&#x27;t even need one for them to look lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is the reason I&#x27;m only giving four stars. Obviously the design is meant to be more compact and somewhat sturdy to hold everything. The issue is the little plastic covers they give you don&#x27;t work incredibly well, and if any powder is left on the holders, it gets all over. This isn&#x27;t a huge issue though because it stops it from mixing with the other colours. I just also think it&#x27;s a little inconvenient to have to pull them all out if I want to get to the bottom piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let that discourage you from getting this product though! I love the colours and it gives a great variety, with 252 shadows. It&#x27;s very fun to play around with, and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free which makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Any color you would ever want or need just not a lot of each color.  It was for my daughter and she&#x27;s happy with it</li>
            <li> Great colors and pigmentation.</li>
            <li> i really like this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved the quality and infinity options</li>
            <li> I love bright, bold colors! This set sure has everything I like in eye shadow. The eye shadow itself actually stays on all day too, which is great!</li>
            <li> Love it! All colors are beautiful. I recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pallet!! The colors are AMAZING. I got it at a good time. Such a wonderful range of colors. Most definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> These colors are perfect. Highly pigmented, stay on pretty well and blend nicely. If you&#x27;re looking for more natural colors, I would consider getting a different palette, but if you want a variety for real cheap, look no further.</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors and nicely packaged. Each palate has a hard plastic sheath to separate it from the palate above it, and each palate also has a ribbon on one end that acts as a tab to lift palate out of the box.</li>
            <li> Good eyeshadows, came very good packed, nothing was broken. They aren&#x27;t as strong as the MAC shadows and it suits me because I don&#x27;t know how to work with such strong shadows anyway. Of course, if you apply a lot of the eye shadow from this palette on your eye, you will get a strong affect. So don&#x27;t worry and order it you like it because it&#x27;s a good product :))</li>
            <li> Still have this palette and I ordered it off Amazon  3 years ago I believe. Still awesome.. use it every week.</li>
            <li> This product is a little pricey for how tiny the eyeshadow is. They are about a dime size. But I mean there&#x27;s 252 eyeshadows. Your not gonna find 252 eyeshadows any cheaper that are actually good and stay on. Plus it&#x27;s Coastal Scents and they are a pretty good brand. THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL. And it arrived wrapped very well, all the eyeshadows were in a plastic case too and it was really quick. They said the 17th but I got it the 7th. So that was cool too.</li>
            <li> so many colors! i got this for my teenager, she swears by it! says its got great colors and last long.</li>
            <li> A few came broken so that was sad but the colors are beautiful and highly pigmented</li>
            <li> I was so excited upon ordering this product and I was very impressed. All the colors are very vibrant and there is such a wide variety you will have trouble choosing just which one you want to wear :). Of corse, when they arrived there were about 4 completely broken eye shadows even though it did have very thorough packing. It was not a big deal to me, although it may be to some. The eyeshadow share all about the size of a dime, but that was not a problem to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very great quality and I use it often, however I can almost guaranty there will be some broken eye shadows. Great buy and I am happy with it!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this palette, so much so I purchased another one as a gift for my sister. The colors are great, go on smoothly and last pretty well. Occasionally I may need to reapply but that is rare. While the pots of color are small a little goes a long way so they last a long time. Great quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is literally the BEST BUYYY i ever made (makeup wise at least lol). These eyeshadows are the truth!!! Very well pigmented, Lasts all day and are really easy to apply! Plus the price and shipping are amazing as well. This palette is a real steal guys, don&#x27;t pass up on it!</li>
            <li> This is a knock off I think. But its still AMAZING.</li>
            <li> LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a stylist and need this in the salon to offer a variety of makeup styles and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The colors are bold and beautiful! I don&#x27;t know that I could have found a better product in all honesty! Plus the fact that I order it on a Friday and get it on a Tuesday! Shipping is really fast and convent! Great! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Beautifull, perfect pigmentation :)</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful &amp; my daughter was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love this and the package came quickly!</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s review: \\&quot;Amazing colors, they are really pretty. The eyeshadow isn&#x27;t flaky but when I first put the eyeshadow on my eyes, it burned a little bit, but not a lot. I recommend this product 100% to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive eyes. Such a good deal for the amount of colors there are.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find the color you want, it probably doesn&#x27;t exist.  This covers most of the normal shades. Easy to use when traveling.comes in plastic case. Haven&#x27;t used it yest.  WOn&#x27;t be using it until the end of January</li>
            <li> Amazing for what you pay for, When I need a certain color that I don&#x27;t have in my MAC collection, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It smells like motor oil, colors are good if you are doing makeup for a costume and need garish colors.  It is highly pigmented, just too many outlandish colors for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical about how great this product really was when I ordered it. I&#x27;d never heard of the Coastal Scents brand and I normally use Urban Decay when it comes to my eye-shadow. I received this within a few days of ordering and I absolutely love it! There is every color you can imagine in here; also in matte, shiny, sparkly, and bold colors. The dome itself is small for each color, but the eyeshadow has excellent pigmentation and doesn&#x27;t require much on your brush to cover your lid. It&#x27;s nice to have this color variety all in one box! I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a one-stop box that has every color you can imagine. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I recieved this palette set with all shadows intact. While the eyeshadow pots are small, they are also fairly deep to the point that you can use them quite a bit before running out. And if you do, many of the colors can be bought in individual (bigger) pots on the Coastal Scents site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These shadows are as they appear in the picture, and are fairly pigmented- if you don&#x27;t like the way it looks on you, try using some NYX Milk underneath as a primer and smoothing them on with different methods. I found a lot of luck with a sponge brush from E.L.F.</li>
            <li> (Using my boyfriends account) For starters, the selection. In the pictures on Amazon it looks like there are a few multiple of the same color. Upon arrival and closer inspection they are mostly different!!!! They have Matt and shimmer of almost every color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condition for packaging was great. They came in a small bubble wrap around the actual case them slipped into the items original packaging. Then it was wrapped in the amazing massive bubble squares and placed in a spacious box. Granted I had it packed with other items it was probably the most precise item that got the most attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a single color is broken. I have a few light specs that sprinkled out of three but it is so  unnoticeable that it&#x27;s not even worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color palette on this is so amazing I hardly have words to explain it. I love this item so much I want to buy another one as a gift for a friend who&#x27;s a make up fanatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although most of the colors on here I probably will never use it&#x27;s great to have such a wide selection. This is a must-have buy and this is coming from somebody who doesn&#x27;t even use make up every day.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this palette for me through Amazon by Coastal Scents and some of the eye shadow palettes came broken. They must have gotten broken/shattered through the mail or was already broken prior to shipping out. I&#x27;m having second thoughts as to whether if it&#x27;s worth it to buy other items from Coastal Scents. It&#x27;s a shame because the colors are just so vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> very good......just a littlebit small in size....strong package...nothing got broken</li>
            <li> Great for the money! Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set!</li>
            <li> Its soo great to have just about every color you could want all in one kit! I&#x27;m really enjoying using this product. It has both matte and shimmer shades for each color. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was so good that I got two more for family members!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these eyeshadows!! after I ordered them I was scared about it being fake. but when I got it was the real deal! yay! but the colors are very vibrant and beautiful! I recommend buying it it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I love it!! It arrived early and none of the colors were broken. There was no damage. I will order this again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, the pigment of them is really good and doesnt wear off</li>
            <li> Lots of great colors, all very pigmented, and cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette so much. The shadows are gorgeous and super pigmented! They blend very well and I can wear them all day without the color fading or the shadow creasing. I also love that the palette includes matte shadows as well as the shimmery shadows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, so many colors to use. Pallets are approximately the size of a dime, I was a little disappointed by that at first. However I have had this product for almost a year and I have not used a single pallet completely and I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> 3 stars ..because the color isn&#x27;t strong..the black is...u need to have primer if u want it to be stronger in shades u pick. but i like it cus its options..looks good on my desk. but i just wish the pigments were not too powdery and rub off too quick and ugggggggg im saying u need a really good primer to matte the pigment on your skin.</li>
            <li> one of the best kits of ULTIMATE EYES SHADOWS i will be reviewing on youtube !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the number of colors in the palette, and I&#x27;m looking forward to using each and every color eventually. Each palette section is sealed and has a ribbon to help pull each out. This is very convenient for travelling. The case is hard plastic and a matte black color and it&#x27;s very easy to clean off. This product has been great, so far.</li>
            <li> i was verrrrrry happy with this product. any colors i have in my closet, this palette matches :) the only concern was the eye shadows do pop out occasionally, they are not glued or fastened down, which could be good if you want to interchange them. I was also a little disappointed in how small and deep the shadows are, they wont last long if you use the same color daily. I love doing multicolor makeup with this and the brigh colors, also a variety of nude and low tones for smoky eyes and depth . I would reccommend this product</li>
            <li> I use this when I have a photoshoot.  I am sure to find a great color.</li>
            <li> Not what expected but can do.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever running out of new pigments to try with this palette! The color payoff is great, but for me, they don&#x27;t last all day on my eyelids. Some sort of setting spray might work, as would a primer. The colors are fantastic and the variety is extensive. If anything, I wish the colors were all grouped with &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; colors. I don&#x27;t like how some blues are on different section than others (same goes with other colors such as yellows, browns, oranges, pinks, etc) Overall, the value is great, and I would repurchase (but I don&#x27;t know if I will ever need to.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect palette for having fun with color!  There is a good mix of matte shades and shimmer shades.  They seemed a little powdery when you first put the shadow on your brush but it applies beautifully on the eyelid.  I haven&#x27;t tried it without a primer.  With a primer it lasts all day and didn&#x27;t crease.  If you want to experiment with lots of different colors but don&#x27;t want to break the bank this is the pallet for you!</li>
            <li> As most people reviewed, this is a great product.  The colors are vibrant, and you really do not need to load your brush with the colors so even though each one is small, they will last.  That being said, I have not used every color yet, but so far the green shadows seem to go on lighter, more sheer, even the dark greens.  I have not tried to use them wet yet so maybe that will make a difference.  ton of color, many combinations, it is hard to chose what colors I will wear each day.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! they came as expected and very fast delivery. I have not swatched every color yet, but will update when I do</li>
            <li> This is good eyeshadow! Every different color you can think of, but it also doesn&#x27;t have that cheap feeling that eyeshadow sometimes has.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived the next day really fast delivery and the person loves the makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how great the colors look! The amount of each color is kind of small but it&#x27;s perfect for the price and amount of colors all together. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I just got my pallet today and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Got it within 3 days.  Good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are as expected. No damages to any whatsoever. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet so I cant speak to it longevity, or if it causes irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to get creative. Attached Pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet. The colors are great and the blend well. What would make this pallet  even better is if the names of the eyeshadows were included. Either on the back of them or a  sheet chart included would be nice. That way I will know the name of the colors.</li>
            <li> This was false advertising. The I ordered two of these palettes and they were not the actual Coastal Scents palettes. I would have kept then because they come in the same format as the Real Coastal Scents palettes, but they did not have a label on the top. Was not happy with the purchase, therefore I requested a refund. Just a warning.</li>
            <li> I love these pallets , this is my second time purchasing this and it&#x27;s the best! They are very pigmented , blendable, they last forever!</li>
            <li> I just got this eyeshadow palett and it is beautiful, i love the case , the way all 3 palett&#x27;s sit on top of one another and to the right side they all have pink ribbon tabs for easy removal, I&#x27;vebeen using the shadow for 2 days now and they are very bright and pigmented, you dont have to use much product. The product pots are small in size about a dime size but thats okay Because the pigment is good. The only thing i dont like or am having trouble with is it doesn&#x27;t blend very well , you cant pleand two colors in together i still see placement lines in the shadow</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors offered in these palettes! They are highly pigmented and good quality.</li>
            <li> This set is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters and cousins daughter. They all loved it and their friends want to order one.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this palette. It came neatly packaged in a black case, each of the three trays were encased in plastic and none of the colors were loose or broken. It comes with three plastic sheets that you can place over the eyeshadow when you stack them all back up and put them back in their case, which I recommend using. The eyeshadows themselves came in a variety of colors, some matte, some metallic, all of the ones I used were very pigmented. There are a lot of green shades and warm colors to choose from, though not as many true blue and purple shades. Overall for the price and the amount of colors you get and the quality, I would say this is great to pick up if you are looking for eyeshadows and want to experiment with your look a little.</li>
            <li> LOVE!! Such strong pigments. Lasts many hours and just AMAZING! Was skeptical at first but so happy I purchased it!! Best price for so many eye shadows! But it and start the fun!</li>
            <li> Wonderful pallet. I bought this as a play pallet so I could try different types of makeup without worrying about how much product I was wasting. It is long lasting and a beautiful set of colors.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Just received mine today. Great shipping time &amp; wonderful packaging. No broken colors and the colors are VERY pigmented :) I am brown skinned and they show up very well. I have used NYX white eyeshadow base to make the colors pop even more &amp; a primer to last all day. This is definitely worth the amount. The colors come in a dime sized amount, but then again the colors are extremely pigmented so there&#x27;s no worry. I&#x27;ve see. YouTube videos where MUA have had their palettes for a while so I&#x27;m not worried about the dime sized amount. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Some colors are more bendable and pigmented than others. However this is a great pallette for beginners.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the shipping process! quite a few of them were shattered, but the shadows apply nice, and stay on all day</li>
            <li> Excellent cost benefit where you can find a lot of colors options. It was a great Christmas gift for my fianc&amp;eacute;e.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and the sheer amount of eye shadow blew her away. She said she liked the quality after she picked out her favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Great investment, plus it arrived in perfect condition, I was a little concerned about that after reading some of the reviews. So happy with it I even bought another one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of color and how PIGMENTED they are! I could take this anywhere and be prepared to do ANY look!&lt;br /&gt;As a starting makeup artist, I STRONGLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have had this palette for a while now and I&#x27;ve loved it.  There is so much variety.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of colors. I bought this for my wife as an anniversary present. She was thrilled. The color is nice and vibrant. You barely have to tap your brush in the pan and you already have more than enough color. The case is nice and sturdy and none of the pans were cracked or broken. Great quality!</li>
            <li> Two colors were slightly broken upon delivery, which I&#x27;m not worried about. Things happen. The colors are very vibrant. The swatches are literally the size of a dime, which I also do not mind. I thought i would be disappointed over it, but there are SO MANY colors to choose from that it really makes up for it. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got this recently but the colors are so vibrant and pigmented and last all day long! I am so excited to experiment with all the colors!</li>
            <li> Love these colors..will definitely purchase again! They show up bright and bold..love the shimmering ones...played around on my daughters face..very nice</li>
            <li> I love this. The colours are vibrant and pigmented and last all day, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve found a few colours that aren&#x27;t as pigmented but considering the amount of colours for the price I&#x27;m still really impressed.</li>
            <li> My holy grail for almost all colour application. It is my go to, and the shades are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Best value for the money spent. The colors are highly pigmented and you just need a small amount to use. I love this palette. It has all the colors you will ever need :D</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on how pigmented this palette would be but when I got it and tried it out the makeup stayed on all day without a problem.  Pods are a little smaller than I thought but as long as I change it up on a regular basis I shouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon.  Great buy for value.</li>
            <li> I am very into switching up eyeshadow and trying new looks and patterns, and this fills any gap for any color I could possibly want. The pans are dime sized, yes, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I can&#x27;t fathom why anyone would need a full-size pan of neon yellow, for example. If you need bigger pans of wild colors, I suggest getting a special palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you need to fill in all of the gaps in color spectrum of shadows you own, like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pigment, buttery, and blendable. Great box/casing--high quality. Love them, and will buy from the company again.</li>
            <li> I recieved this and I love it! The colors are very concentrated and highly pigmented. Which I love. I bought for a cosplay for ECCC in 2 weeks. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase :3 I also will be using for cosplay bounding (like disney bounding but a wider spectrum) cause some times being a 22 year old woman it&#x27;s not considered &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; to run around dressed up as disney/comicbook characters ;3</li>
            <li> i love this makeup palette, amazing colors, good pig, good price, excellent at all</li>
            <li> This product is very pigmented for the price and lasts all day with or without a primer the only problem is the size of each color shade is small so colors run out quickly but it&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
            <li> The amounts of each color is smaller than I expected, but still seems to go a long enough way for a casual user. I absolutely adore this and it has completely changed the way I use make up. You can blend to different colors. There is shiny and there is matte. I even use it to create lip colors and add some chapstick over it for shine and blending. It comes in a sturdy case so I can carry it around in a large bag if I&#x27;m staying somewhere else. That&#x27;s nice. It can be a little clumsy to handle sometimes and can take up a lot of room if they&#x27;re all laid out, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Coastal Scent palette about a year ago and LOVED it so I took a gamble and ordered the Ultimate Palette.  Coastal Scents has really outdone itself with this beautiful product. The colors are amazing...from light, delicate and matte to rich, vibrant and full of shimmer.  I have purchased several palettes from high end brands...Urban Decay...Stila etc and see no reason to order anything other than these from now on.  The colors are highly pigmented and even without primer look fresh all day and the color payoff is amazing.  The color selection is endless.  It takes a long time to really examine them all and use even a fraction of all that is available.  The packaging is effective and attractive and my order arrived in perfect condition.  True...the colors are &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; but so what?  I use one third of the colors on my higher end palettes so I would rather have many colors to choose from with less amount of each.  These would also make a great gift for any cosmetic enthusiast.  I plan on ordering my daughter one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These colors are awesome and so pigmented!</li>
            <li> The pallet is good only that its little i dose not lo ok like the pictures</li>
            <li> The colors are great to experiment with. But its just weird packaging, I don&#x27;t like to pull this whole thing out every morning.</li>
            <li> GREAT PIGMENTACION GREAT COLORS GREAT PRICE PROFESIONAL LOOK I ADORE IT THIS&lt;br /&gt;EYESHADOW PALETTE HAS ALL THE INGRIDIENTS  FOR EYE MAKE UP PERFECTION .</li>
            <li> Excellent pigment. It&#x27;s an awesome starter palette for people wanting to experiment with bright colours.</li>
            <li> awsome üòç they are just great and very pigmented !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to buy so much color love‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫</li>
            <li> Great gift idea and the grade was something that I was looking for and the person I gave it to loved it</li>
            <li> The product was worth my every cent and it&#x27;s a great product u not gonna regret spending a dime on this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which reviewers here felt this make up doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays on all day, but in my experience that is not true. The size of the box is too large for travel, and that is also huge downside. But the main problem I have is that the make up simply doesn&#x27;t stay on for any length of time, let alone all day.</li>
            <li> I Order this eye shadow palette with the concealer palette, the lip palette and the blush palette, all from coastal scents. but this palette and the blush one came with broken colors. So disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if I could!!!! Every shade you could imagine and want!!! Every eyeshadow came in perfect no cracks or loose ones. Colors are just as vibrant as they look on here. I am in love with this, worth every penny! I would buy this a hundred times over and recommend this to anybody!!!!</li>
            <li> Oh man, I love this set. So many color option! I love being able to just switch up the trays to get a fresh look!</li>
            <li> it is worth every dollar believe me the pigments in the cols are so vibrant i just love it i will by myself some more</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are nice. Some are a bit chalky, and others are just too hard to use, and mainly glitter. I&#x27;ve had this palette for a year and I&#x27;ve already put pan on some of the shadows. But the shadows are breakable. While the pans are tiny it does take you a while to get through the pan unless you break it. But other than that it is a great palette for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Eye shadow lasts about a year before it needs replacing. All I need is one of these palettes and I&#x27;m good to go all year round. The colors are very concentrated and there are loads of fun shades. I don&#x27;t use most of them, but they&#x27;re fun to play with and you never know what you might end up trying over the course of a year.</li>
            <li> Loooveee the colors beautiful</li>
            <li> 252 COLORS!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t belive how crazy pigmented ALL of these colors are. The pots are tiny, like dime size tiny, but the pigmentation makes up for that. You do NOT need more than one dip of your finger or brush to create your perfect looks. My suggestion is to use a primer under the colors, (like with ANY eyeshadow) to make the POP and last all day without any creasing or smugging.</li>
            <li> love it will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> I really like the colors, they go great with any skin tone!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this set. There are so many combinations and I have no issues with the quality. Like any other eye shadows I have tried, it does fade a little throughout the day, but it lasts for as long as I need it to and is super easy to apply. Once I finish using all the colours, I will definitely be ordering another one!</li>
            <li> With an eye primer, the color stays on your lids the whole time. Each color is about the size of a dime which is enough for an average user. There are many colors, so you can go as crazy as you would like with your eye shadow. Sometimes I make my eye brush a little wet to make sure the powdery eye shadow doesn&#x27;t fall all over my face, but this depends on each color.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sis she absolutely loved it ..Eye shadows were NOT broken was packaged with care and look beautiful when applied.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your credibility, but there is a problem in some fractures caddy at home as a result of transport for information only</li>
            <li> absolutely fell in love with this item tons of colors to choose from. only prob was that they were a little small but worth it u can say for the price</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for a beautician class, very good purchase, I intend to purchase another couple of these for friends for gifts</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are as stunning as they are numerous.  They give you lots of highlight colors, which are the ones I run out of the fastest and there are not only bright rainbow colors, but also plenty of neutral colors for those more &#x27;conservative&#x27; days.  Some of the colors look the same but they have some beautiful variances.  I recommend using a good quality eyelid primer to added brightness to the colors and also to help with a smooth application but I suggest eyelid primer with any eyeshadow.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got the palette on time.&lt;br /&gt;it has shimmer/matte colors so you can always switch it up&lt;br /&gt;it came in perfect condition..i just cant wait to start using it :)&lt;br /&gt;im happy customer!!</li>
            <li> This great and shipped great thanks my gf love it</li>
            <li> Pigmentation on some of them are great. Some of the shadows on the other hand can be chalky and blend away to nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing about this product for years, and I had hesitated to order it because I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very good considering the cheap price and not ever having heard/used this brand of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;But I was very pleasantly surprised, the quality is superior and the color selections are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made using amazon!!</li>
            <li> I understand that this is a good way to explore color options and it is a good value for such an amazing amount of colors but only half of them are pigmented enough to show up on your skin and the texture isn&#x27;t that easy to deal with, definitely have a good eye primer using this and be ready to spend more on eyeshadows when you figure out which ones you want to use.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend for Christmas and she loved it!  It makes for a pretty fun, and kind of ridiculous (in a good way), gift to give someone.</li>
            <li> daughter enjoys having all of the colors she could ever think of when she gets ready to wear her makeup</li>
            <li> i loved the product! different colors to choose from and very small and compact. its a great item and good pricing</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, For the price you cant go wrong. The colors are vibrant, and there is so many to pick from. My palette came in perfect order, no colors were broken. I think it depends on how careful mail carriers/ups/fed ex is with the package.</li>
            <li> I am shocked with this product, not only did it come early but it was very well wrapped killing my fear of the palette being broken, it is actually fairly tiny but there are so many colors and it is so pigmented it doesn&#x27;t even matter.It is my first time buying from this company and on amazon in general and i will absolutely being ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner makeup artist and really wanted to purchase an eye shadow palette with a large variety of colors to experiment with. After doing lots of research and reading reviews of several different brands of eye shadow pallets, I decided that this would be the best to start off with. I ended up getting this as a Christmas gift so I am unsure of how fast the shipping was but I was very pleased with the packaging. There were several of them that were broken but they are still useable. The pigments are FANTASTIC and you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your eyelids, (which is great since each eye shadow is very small). There is also a great range of colors; any color you can think of is in this pallet. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in the makeup field or just loves makeup in general.</li>
            <li> It came perfect! I love love love Coastal Scents eyeshadows and the price for the pigment and quality is always amazing! This is such an amazing eyeshadow and this is coming from a person who buys a crazy amount of high end makeup. Also I have really picky and sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me react or anything. Perfect gift for yourself or anyone who loves eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> Good quality, so many colors, but I think it is too mini, and some colors I don&#x27;t use regularly, Good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected!! Good quality and also very good price! So worth it (:</li>
            <li> the colors are amazing! the only issue is that one of the colors is all crushed up when it got here. love it though!</li>
            <li> I loved this pallet. I love how it has many colors to choose from</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of colors but pigment is not that deep.  Fun to have anyway</li>
            <li> The palette is great, my only complaint is that a few of the pots broke in shipping. Was kind of sad about that. But the colors are lovely and vibrant. They wear well as well as are long lasting. So minute the shipping breaking a couple of the cakes I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Lovely! Great quality! So glad i found these! I used to use MAC and these are just as good or better quality and are obviously much more cost-efficient</li>
            <li> Ordered this a few months ago and I love it. Some of the colors are very very powdery though. and there is no color black. :( Black is main color!!! Anyways, I love it and would purchase again and again and again if need be.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this was an absolute steal for me. I received my palettes on time, none were broken and every single one of them are gorgeous. One thing that I wish other individuals using makeup would realize is that we seriously do not have to buy makeup at Sephora or MAC to feel like we have quality makeup, that we can&#x27;t look at ourselves in the mirror and feel like we&#x27;ve created a masterpiece. Another thing I do adore about these eyeshadows is that they&#x27;re pretty much arranged in categories of how you can put them on your eyes. For example, mattes and glitters and right next to each other that would compliment each other. I&#x27;m only 19 and I hope these palettes last me some time because as a college student, and just a young woman in general, I seriously cannot afford to be broke just to &amp;#34;look good&amp;#34;. I highly recommend this as a gift for any girl out there. One thing my mom always taught me is that us women do not have to worry about name brands, only style. Leave the brands to the men. Bye y&#x27;all!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and watching many YouTube reviews of this product, I felt like I got what I expected.  I&#x27;d say this is a five star product FOR THE PRICE.  You couldn&#x27;t compare it to expensive eyeshadow, although some of the shadows performed as well or better than, say, the Naked palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are vibrant, for the most part.  If you don&#x27;t like heavy color, this wouldn&#x27;t be for you.  I&#x27;m fair, so I have to be careful and apply it light, then fill in if I need more color.  Some of the shadows have a little fallout, but most of them are fine, and all of them are better than Wet n Wild, which I was surprised to find out, despite reviews to the contrary, had awful fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, the eyeshadow pans are tiny.  They are dime sized, and not a speck bigger.  That&#x27;s okay--I never finish an eyeshadow pan, and you&#x27;re supposed to toss them after six months or so for sanitary reasons anyway.  This is an amazing deal if you want to experiment with color, but can&#x27;t afford to spend much.  After spending $50 on drug store eyeshadows and finding little pigment or variety in colors, this was a welcome relief.  There isn&#x27;t a color in the rainbow you won&#x27;t find in this kit.  I&#x27;ll probably use a lot of the same colors, but that&#x27;s okay, because I can experiment and see what looks good.  This is helping me become a lot more courageous in my makeup color choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said in recent reviews, there is no Coastal Scents mark on the top of the lid.  I don&#x27;t know if that means the seller is lying and these are knock off eyeshadows, or what.  But I can tell you that the quality is equal to the reviews of actual Coastal Scents products.  The color lasts throughout the day as well as my Naked palette shadows do, and better than drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shadows came intact, and they weren&#x27;t packaged terribly great.  Not bad, either, but I think Amazon should have used more than one layer of bubble wrap.  Makeup is notorious for coming damaged.  I got mine in a box with other items, so maybe that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.oming damaged.  I got mine in a box with other items, so maybe that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted an upgrade of my eye shadows. It came neatly packed in a box.  Each powder was smaller than I thought initially.  It was like a 0.5&amp;#34; in diameter per powder but there is a large variety of colours.  I am yet to use it but I&#x27;ll update after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many reviews of this product but I don&#x27;t think they did the product any justice. In my opinion. For me this was the most rewarding and fulfilling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. As a dark skinned woman I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding products that were pigmented enough for my skin tone, until now. The pigmentation is amazing, no lie. I was so excited that I&#x27;m purchasing this product again for my sister. I&#x27;m even thinking of purchasing two just so I don&#x27;t run out. The palette I received did have a crack, but I didn&#x27;t return it because the product was that good. If your a dark skinned woman, this is the holy grail. Perfection, I&#x27;m looking to see if this manufacture gas any other products like blushes, if they do I&#x27;ll be purchasing them as well. This is the real deal guys.......</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid no need to reapply. Looks great. Just what I was looking for and doesn&#x27;t wear like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is great I love it. Very nicely wrapped.nice colors very pigment. Each pod is the size of your point finger tip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to help this company sell or anything I&#x27;m just being 100% bc I know the struggle to decide which to choose on Amazon. And believe me I&#x27;m so picky with everything I buy like you have never seen anyone. Based on my experience this is better than Mac and Saphora and Sigma and everything else you know. It&#x27;s so so so amazing I would give this 100 stars if I could. Why do I think this is soooo amazing? Well I have had Mac eyeshadows, Saphora, have tried Dior, Lanc√¥me, Origins, Nars...and Walmart brands. Well my friend I use my eyeshadows without primers just the foundation or concealer that I put over my eyes and that&#x27;s it; it lasts about 16 hours to be totally honest. And that is without smudging, setting and to my wrinkles/crest, the color fading, non of that its so perfect. It&#x27;s super pigmented I have enough with one dab on the eyeshadow and its looks just fine. Now I imagine with a primer would be better, but about that I don&#x27;t know bc like I said I don&#x27;t use primers. And i trust this eyeshadows so much that I do people&#x27;s make up with this for special occasions and they love the shades and how it looks. It&#x27;s very easy to blend and it&#x27;s just so wonderful. I definitely recommend this product. Update on this: here are some pictures of when I was the bridesmaid at a wedding, the bride&#x27;s makeup I did on her, and another guest makeup. From the shades it has you can go for a very natural look to a very dramatic one. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> at first i didn&#x27;t think this was a real coastal scents palette. but i went and checked out their store front, and this is the same mini palette they offer, the box is the same, the case is the same. i just wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so tiny, i was expecting a full size palette.  it&#x27;s a miniature palette. each well of color is approximately the size of my little pinky nail.</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow for the price. The colors are smaller than expected but over all great product.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was asking for. The box that contains the colors is very strong, ideal for work. It has the three sets of colours, just like the picture.</li>
            <li> I am branching out when it comes to color. So far I have been impressed with the little that is provided. As other comments will tell you, a little goes a long way. Packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff, great quality, and I love that there are wearable colors and bright colors as well. I would repurchase but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to since I have so many colors.</li>
            <li> As someone who has purchased many different eye shadow palettes through many different brands, I have to say that Coastal Scents has been my favorite.  I had bought a different palette from Coastal Scents with 88 colors before buying this one, and I loved that one as well.  If you are a colorful person who enjoys beauty products, I would definitely recommend this affordable and fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and she absolutely loves it. There wasn&#x27;t a single one that was messed up. Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good quality i considered in this product. The colors are intense and vivids and when yu convine the colors are so beatiful.</li>
            <li> I loved it.. its what i wanted the whole time. i was clean out my make up box just for this.</li>
            <li> teeny tiny pots, lots of colors, but if you like one, it will probably be gone in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have received tons of compliments when wearin this eye shadow. Rich pigment on dark complexion.</li>
            <li> This pallet is amazing. The color pigmentation is surprisingly very nice and not only for the price but in general. There are so many shades to choose from which makes getting ready in the morning to use them kind of fun because you have so many options for so many looks. That being said I did I have one issue and that was the smell of the pallete. I was not a fan and it still somewhat smells but it&#x27;s faded a bit. But I still love this product!</li>
            <li> I am a dark girl and I always use an eyeshadow base which makes these colors POP! I get many compliments on how beautiful my eye makeup is when I use colors from this palette. The pans are small, but a small amount of product goes a long way.  There is a bit of fall out that happens when using the eyeshadow, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me since I apply my foundation AFTER my eye makeup</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Cero complains.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly! this brand is always great.&lt;br /&gt;Everything coastal scents i buy is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended! :D</li>
            <li> I loved this palette so much and my mother loved it that i had to order another one for her ! It has all the colors i can imagine and its high quality ! and very inexpensive ! buy it and you will not regret it !!</li>
            <li> There are barely any good matte colors</li>
            <li> The shadows are beautiful and arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> This pallet gives great color and pigmentation. There are 252 different colors and each one is beautiful. I love creating different eyeshadow looks and and this is prefect for that. A little goes a long way so it might not look like a lot but it will last a very long time. For the price I&#x27;m not sure you could find better. Just don&#x27;t forget the primer to get the most dramatic color. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really love all the different shades and they look great on me. It was a great purchase and I may just be purchasing for a friend who loves eye shadows as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I love all the color and how i am able to work them together to create the color im going for...</li>
            <li> 252 colors is a lot for so small a price! And although the pigment circles are dime sized (if they weren&#x27;t, the palette would be incredibly large), it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of pigment to get full coverage! And there&#x27;s plenty of variation to avoid using only one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product :3</li>
            <li> I am excited to try so many of these colors.  Now I don&#x27;t have to think twice about whether I have a color to match an outfit.  Love that it is compact and you can carry it anywhere with you.  Great price for so many shadows to try!!</li>
            <li> Goes on shear not as bright as you think but very good item to have as a starter kit in your tools</li>
            <li> fast shipping a few colors came broken but I still using them !</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding an eyeshadow that is pigmented enough to show through my dark skin (even with primer and concealer). I mean, even Urban Decay doesn&#x27;t quite do the job! But I received this palette yesterday (it came undamaged). Admittedly, I was surprised at the small portions of each eyeshadow but it ultimately worked out! Today was the first time I tried it on and I did the orange, gold, and yellow blend. It came out looking like a sunset! It was very beautiful! So excited to keep using it! Delivery was super fast too!</li>
            <li> I really love this but it has really too many colors.  I was looking for matte only.  This set has everything from matte to shine.  A bit overwhelming but I will not have to buy any more eye shadow in quite awhile</li>
            <li> I just love the colours. The pigmentation is great and the eye shadow stays on for hours!!! Easy to apply!!</li>
            <li> I had no problem getting my package in time and with NO DAMAGE. My purchase was perfect and the colors are amazing! Pigmentation of the eyeshadows are perfect even though each eyeshadow is the size of a dime but I do not have to use to much.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow are the size of a dime beautiful colors will stain eyelids even with makeup remover but colors worth it</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received the item because it was very small and it looked very big in the pictures.  The price is high</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was going to be a lot smaller than it actually was. The palettes contain more colors than I know what to do with and they don&#x27;t fade off my eyelid after long use like other make up products I have bought in the past. Good product :)</li>
            <li> is super beautiful has beautiful colors have good quality</li>
            <li> So SO happy with this purchase!! Can&#x27;t even believe how inexpensive this is for such good quality shadows. Every color imaginable, in both matte &amp; shimmer, so pigmented.</li>
            <li> Wow. Just wow. Wonderful collection, very pigmented and nicely packaged. If you&#x27;re reluctant to get this pallet, dont be! Your only regret would be not getting it! I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Only had one cracked color. Luckily it was a neutral cream. Each color is small. But the pigments are vibrant. When used with a primer there is little to no fall out.</li>
            <li> You never need to buy eyeshadow again! It&#x27;s pigmented, so many different options, great for beginner makeup artists and theater performers. WOW</li>
            <li> These Cora are amazing, I buy all&lt;br /&gt;Makeup geek for myself and wanted to get my daughter a pallet that she could play with just starting out learning how to do her own makeup. I now want one! There not chalky there HIGHLY pigmented which is wonderful in a eyeshadow. So Thank you costal scents and amazon for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Luv it!  The colors are exactly as displayed.  Shipping was great also.</li>
            <li> The colors were a bit smaller than expected. However, the lg number of colors, variation in color, shimmer &amp; matte options, &amp; the great pigmentation make up for the small size. A little goes a long way bc this palette is so well pigmented! A great price for the quality &amp; lg quantity of colors. Definitely recommend to any girl who loves make up &amp; loves a huge variety of eye shadow colors!</li>
            <li> A Definite Must Buy for the Money</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products. Colors are nicely pigmented and last all day. I do wish the color pieces were a bit larger, as a larger shadow brush can be difficult to fit in the pod.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soo happy with my purchase it came in good rapping not damaged at all I got it 4 days before the expected day! Just 2 day after I ordered it.  the pallets are beautiful , I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is a great pallet. the circles are a bit smaller than I expected, but the product  really  hold on your skin and the color really show up. I love the quality of the product. It stays perfect all day long.</li>
            <li> So many colors, and such good quality! I want to use them all the time, combining the colors, experimenting.. :) 10+ ^^</li>
            <li> Great price.  Great product.  If you love make-up like I do its must have.  If I had to do it over I would buy again.</li>
            <li> great pigments, and so many choices of colors. would def. recommend this to anyone who loves makeup and having choices</li>
            <li> So many colors! Each is a dime size. Perfect for me since I use ever color in the rainbow.</li>
            <li> Love allll of the colors! It has made it easier for me to just own this palette...you no longer need to have so many different palettes to achieve the look you want. With the right amount of eyelid primer, this shadow will last you all day. There are seriously so many color options that this palette is all that you need. It is small and light so you can carry it on roadtrips when you travel, but it still packs a punch with all of the variety of colors. I recommend it, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> i love that they are so pigmented.. they are about a dime size each but you cant beat the quality and the price.. definitely lots of colors to choose from.. 2 little ones came a little broken but it didn&#x27;t bother me.. just put water on them and compress them and you&#x27;ll do fine.. cant beat the price..</li>
            <li> No chipped or messed up trays! All great quality</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness since you&#x27;re looking at it.... you know you want it when i saw it i said it was wayyy too good to be true... and now I&#x27;m soooo happy that i bought it cause i love it so much! look it up on youtube. yes the colors are small but so what when you get 252 of them! i do not regret buying this and i wish i had gotten them sooner</li>
            <li> Lots of colors and it looks great.</li>
            <li> You will never need to buy another eyeshadow pallet. I wish I would have discovered this pallet sooner. I have spent so much money on high-end eyeshadow, and this one is just as good as my UD pallets. The colors are vibrant, buttery, and long-lasting. There are matte, shimmer, and satin colors. The shimmers are so beautiful and pigmented. The colors blend well and work well dry or wet. The packaging is just ok. I wish it had a mirror. It is soooo worth every penny! So happy with this product, and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Came out of the box like this. other two trays have plastic wrap over them. Guessing someone returned it. Yuck! :(</li>
            <li> Nothing like having 252 eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Oh boy, I don&#x27;t know where to begin on this pallet. I&#x27;m in love with the colors in this palette. With so many colors to come up with just about any color scheme, I can never run out of ideas with this palette. It&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li> I love to experiment with all kinds of different looks.  I won&#x27;t use all the colors, but that&#x27;s ok, there are lots that I will.  The colors are vibrant &amp; go on super smooth.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the colors would be very pigmented and I was hesitant to buy it.  I am light-skinned and the colors are amazing.  I love the golds and coppers.  I was needing teal and blue shades and this palette has so many shades that are amazing for you to make great smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> A great variety of colour I love it they are so pigmented but they are a little small so if you are a make up junkie like me u may need to get two of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been shopping around for eye shadow palettes for a while, and was expecting to pay quite a bit for a wide color spectrum of a decent quality. However, I found this to be priced very reasonably and especially after I had a chance to try it out and discovered that the colors stay as bold as they appear in the palette once they are applied! I usually have to wet down my applicator brush to get any store brand to look as good. This product also arrived in great condition. Just be careful when you are removing each palette from the box. It is easy to damage the colors in the corners by bumping them with the corners of the other palettes.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very pigmented. The only thing is that they are actually the size of a dime but other than that I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Great pallet of colors. Colors are of good pigment, and stay in well as long as a foundation is used 1st.</li>
            <li> The best eyes make up. Had to repeat it for my Mom. Can&#x27;t be any better. I love it in all ways.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!! Whoever thinking of buying this eyeshadow palette, do it. The color is vibrant, no matter how dark your skin is, it shows very well. 252 eyeshadow colors, you will not regret. The package was safe, there was none of breaks which I was really concerned about did not happen at all. It is so happy to buy this beautiful eyeshadow palette with great deal of money. I definitely will buy another one next time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just go to the coastal scents website it&#x27;s cheaper there and u might even find something else u like there</li>
            <li> It was great very pleased with everything</li>
            <li> Love this palette a great mix of colours. I would love for it be a bit more pigmented however. Besides that I am still not able to even come close to denting the amount of options there are.</li>
            <li> I love love love this prodict. Its great for somce one like me who loves to experiment with differenr colors.</li>
            <li> I am also writing because I am to a dark skinned woman that purchased this product.  I have to say it is great.  I ordered it with the Prime Shipping and it arrived within two days and when it arrived it was perfect none of the palettes were broken.  The palettes are small, but just enough.  I have to also say that colors show up very well on my dark skin and you don‚Äôt have to use a lot on the brush, so it will last a long time.  Reading the reviews really helped me make the decision to purchase.  This is my first time buying Coastal Scents and I am very happy with my purchase.  I hope this helps some.</li>
            <li> I am writing this because I am a dark skinned woman and there were not to many reviews for us on here to see if it was really worth buying. I have to tell you yes the pigments for the eyeshadow do come out on us and looks very nice I may add! I have not had any that would come out if trying to be used and the case is pretty durable ( I have traveled with it and no cracks or issues). And the pot sizes may be small but you get a lot out of them because you do not have to use so much! If I had to buy again I sure would (this was my first purchase of coastal scents) and looking into other products as well.</li>
            <li> Love the different colors.very pigmented and blends well.only down is i wish it had more matte shades.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are really tiny /: its kinda lame and disappointing.</li>
            <li> So good! Goes on smooth - BOLD colors - I didn&#x27;t expect such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> love them they are beautiful pigmented shadows I wouldn&#x27;t trade them for the world</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best eyeshadow palette EVER!!</li>
            <li> my wife love this product</li>
            <li> This product colors are hightly pigmented. Goes on with a few swipes. Love all the bold colors. Lasts all day. Best eye shadow!!!! Easily blends. Works better with the NYX Cosmetics Base in White</li>
            <li> Has just about any color you&#x27;ll need, and mixing shades covers any gap you may find. These are all extremely pigmented especially when paired with a wet brush. Blending them out can get tricky especially with the more vivid shades but lots of practice helps there. Definitely has staying power, I need to find a gentle makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors but they arrived broken</li>
            <li> Great pallette, love these colors...can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> I love the color not cheaply made at all great price and its very worth it ...great timing on arrival</li>
            <li> The pigments are amazing on this pallette, the colours are very small, but for personal use it can last you a long time, becouse you dont have to apply a lot to get what you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MAC addict and I actually LOVE this palette! I was not expecting such high pigment quality.  I use a MAC paint pot base, so I&#x27;m sure that helps, but it stays all day.  I prefer this way over my NAKED2 Palette.  I will reorder when my favorite colors get used up.</li>
            <li> I received this pallet as a gift and absolutely love it. There is a large variety of vibrant colors, and is great quality for the affordable price. The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the small portion of each color, but so far I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that either.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Great condition. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful! Great starters kit!</li>
            <li> Love this palette! So many different colors to choose from. Shipment was covered with bubble wrap and nothing came broken thank god. Going to repurchase this palette soon for a friend that loves this so much</li>
            <li> So it DID arrive on time but strangely it never came to my house..my package was left at the post office. i was at home all day and i received my other item that day so it wasn&#x27;t my fault.&lt;br /&gt;Well now on to the makeup, it definitely could have been package much better. 3 of the colors got a little messed up but its 252 eyeshadows so can&#x27;t complain too much. Now im dark skinned and after experimenting with a few of the colors i can say most are very pigmented a few others one dont show up too well as opposed to others but overall its a good set. i would definitely recommend this product. Like i said earlier in my post, sorry about my other review i wish i could change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars, would had given it 5 if package arrived at my house and it had better packaging.</li>
            <li> Great buy ,pretty colors, a must have . The package came a day early . Use eye primer on your lid then apply the shadow colors will show up better. I will be purchasing a again.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeshadow set a lot of diversity with colors and mixture of matte and shimmer colors! The one thing i can say i didn&#x27;t like is that these colors create a little fall off but most eyeshadows do so i can&#x27;t complain. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is so much fun!  I love playing with the colors and creating new eyeshadow designs.  Tons of color combinations!  Stays on the eye all day and nice rich color.</li>
            <li> Just 1 individual round dot of color...smashed and now it is completely loose dust. It was in the middle tray too, so not sure how that could have happened either where it was stored or during shipping. Otherwise, the product is great, and it isn&#x27;t the end of the world that I lost 1 out of so many colors. With so many vibrant colors to choose from, I have a lot of fun with this palette.</li>
            <li> I got the palette in the two days after ordering it and the shadows are very pigmented when using a eye primer. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> I orderd this Ultimate Palette on a Monday 2/4/13, Utilizing my Prime membership(well worth the yearly membership fee). I received my order Wednesday 2/6/13. I opened it up and was amazed by all the colors available. Mattes and shimmers. There was just one pot that had some fall out dust on top but that was it. A quick blow and gone. I tried them out today and I am amazed how easily they blend.....So much fun. What I enjoyed the most is the fact that I barely pat my brush on top of the color pot and had enough to do the job. Some state that they are very small shadows but a little goes a long way.....Very pigmented....I can&#x27;t see someone going thru this palette quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with another reviewer about the purple staining a bit but honestly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone wishing to get a great set of colors on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was only one suggestion to add to this collection it would be to have a bit more neutral/skin tone shimmers or mattes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall GREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li> For inexpensive shadows this is great.....very pigmented and pretty colors.....the size is alot smaller than i thought they would be, they are dime sized, maybe a tiny bit smaller. i thought it would at least be nickel sized. BUT its so many color choices, you shouldn&#x27;t run out....and when you find the colors you love you can purchase them individually from CoastalScents.com !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great palette though!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors and the payoff !!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of mac eyeshadows and some of the pigments.  I think that if you&#x27;re trying to get into makeup this is the best pallet to do it with.  Once you find colors that are right for you, you can take those right down to the mac store or whoever you like and buy that color.  As a person of dark skin, not every color looks good on me, so it&#x27;s wonderful to have a nice range of colors to play with so I can know how they look on me.  Also as a person of darker complexion I was nervous that some of the colors wouldn&#x27;t show up well on my skin.  But these eyeshadows aren&#x27;t sheer at all.  There  are a few that don&#x27;t really hold up on my skin but most of them are vivid and strong when I put them on, so if you have a darker complexion don&#x27;t fear, these colors will do you justice.  I don&#x27;t think you can get a better deal!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors. I do you a primer from urban decay with it and it makes it last longer. Some colors don&#x27;t go on well, but it&#x27;s just a few.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Bought it for myself, the pallets are alittle smaller than they look. Well worth it they blend wonderfully, I even bought one for my sister. Def worth it....</li>
            <li> So many colors that are matte and shimmer it&#x27;s hard to pick a face of the day! This palette lets me choose any color combo in a ton of intensities to really reflect how I feel that day. The price is amazing for a product that is so good and provides so many choices. As a broke college student, this really allowed me the freedom (and doesn&#x27;t take up valuable space) to have a wide range of colors without breaking the bank. I do use primer and a white jumbo pencil (L.A. Colors in Sea Shell, to be exact) under the eye shadows for added pop and long-lasting color. I will absolutely be sticking with Coastal Scents for my eye shadows!</li>
            <li> I love it all the color are perfect</li>
            <li> I love this pallete! Yes, the shadows are small but there&#x27;s so many to pick from that it makes up for it. Great price, and shipped fast. Satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I just recently got into makeup. I still don&#x27;t use it everyday but after buying this product I doubt I am going to be making any more purchases any times soon. There are so many colors to choose from and the pigmant in each one is amaizng. I love that there are mattes, sparkles and shimmer eyeshadows. This is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors on my beautiful dark skin love the variety of colorsüòÉ</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, or even buying this for your own makeup. Yes, the packaging is nice, the box it comes in is nice, and it arrived unbroken. But the picture makes all the shadows look bigger then what they actually are. They&#x27;re the size of a dime, NO I&#x27;m NOT kidding, A Dime! You could go to the mall into Forever 21, Claire&#x27;s, or Icings and, get this! Why? Because some of Icings palettes are the same size, A DIME, and so is this one, they&#x27;re the size of a dime. Not worth it. Unless you&#x27;re only buying it for yourself. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to guys trying to buy there girlfriend something for her birthday or Christmas, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the quantity of the eye shadow sizes and I bet she won&#x27;t be either!!!! Maybe good to buy for a 10 or 12 year old who&#x27;s just starting out with makeup and having fun playing with it but not so much for anyone older.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this product, but I&#x27;m just not impressed with the quantity and quality of this palette. They make it look so big and so worth it when it&#x27;s not. You can order one and see for yourself. No one will probably listen to what I say anyways since almost all the reviews are 5 star&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t no why.  My opinion.</li>
            <li> A lot n of these eye shadows have great pigment and this palette is especially great in you wanting to experiment with color. Each pot is about the size of a dime but for me that doesn&#x27;t matter at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome to start with!</li>
            <li> Pretty pigmented, a lot of colors, nice package, excellent!</li>
            <li> (From my wife) I&#x27;m very very fair skinned. I usually use a primer when using shadows but I don&#x27;t have to with this set. I use it in a daily basis :)</li>
            <li> Im giving it three stars only because the one I received today had some of the eye shadows crushed. Especially the packaging could have been better. Had it been? Maybe the eye shadows wouldn&#x27;t have gotten crushed. I work in cosmetics and when I receive shipments they are packed very well to ensure none of the eye shadows crack.</li>
            <li> like all coastal scents products, this is perfect.  just have to use a high quality primer like two faced and use some good brushes like Goss.</li>
            <li> This palette is super gorgeous and definitely isn&#x27;t short on colors. Most of them are matte or shimmery but no glitters or anything sparkly. The sizes are indeed dime sized but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they&#x27;ll last me a while. The lighter colors (white, tan, etc.) take a couple dips to make it more pigmented but be careful when you use the more colorful wells because if you&#x27;re heavy-handed, they&#x27;ll be really strong! So I recommend dipping lightly into the more colorful ones unless you want a really vibrant color.     I like the case it came in and how each palette is removable to work with a little more easily but I really didn&#x27;t like that only a plastic sheet protected each palette once you remove the individual plastic wrapping. I suppose you could just remove the sheet and stack the palettes without any protection atop each other but I prefer to keep mine a little more protected with the sheets.    One color did arrive broken, which is a shame but one color out of 252 isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s still mostly intact too, so no big deal. Anyways, great buy! I&#x27;m excited to try out all these colors!</li>
            <li> excellent and a good time</li>
            <li> Great value, great quality, super fast shipping. Colors are highly pigmented. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product was smaller than I thought it was gonna be. It&#x27;s not as big as the huge palettes you&#x27;re used to seeing, but as far as the product a little bit goes a LONG way. It&#x27;s so amazingly pigmented. I&#x27;m in absolute love and this is NO exaggeration. I will definitely be purchasing more from coastal scents!</li>
            <li> Great wet-dry eyeshadows!  Easily blend able.  Very pigmented.  Terrific purchase overall!  If you find a color or 2 you like &amp; use the most -- they can be ordered individually by number.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I am not a huge makeup person so I haven&#x27;t used it a great deal but when I did I was very pleased. Each color is about the size of a dime but the color is so pigmented that you only really need to dot your brush once or twice to get a load of color. I would recommend this to anyone. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love it. I recently purchased some of my favorite colors from this palette in individual hot pots. Well worth the 26$</li>
            <li> These are great colors, many choices to pick from and they look great especially with a good primer. Some of the shadows have a lot of fall out, but they&#x27;re still very nice. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was lucky, but my shadows arrived completely intact and very well packaged.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors.  I&#x27;ve used some of the beautiful browns.  Some of the colors are very intense and striking and others are natural and very beautiful.  The three palettes were separated by a thick sheet of plastic and then they were encased in a very nice plastic container.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Has every color you can think of!</li>
            <li> Loved these! Bought them to do make for a very colorful wedding, the bride loved it. The pigments were very bright!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Mines came in the mail with everything still intact.  Shadows weren&#x27;t broke or anything, the packaging was good. First I tried them on just playing with colors to see how I liked it and wasn&#x27;t pleased,  Color&#x27;s wore off and didn&#x27;t look very pigmented. Then when I was going out later that night I put elfs eye primer on first and got waaayyy better results. Great smoky eye I made and it last the whole night and the next morning after I passed out after a night at the club with no creasing. I recommend but with a primer !</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this color palette. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think you could get such a wonderful palette for such a low price. The variety of color is amazing! I also got the Coastal Scents eye primer.  They work wonderful together.</li>
            <li> This palette is a MUST HAVE!!  I have no regrets with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are just how you see them in the picture, they&#x27;re a bit small but you don&#x27;t need much cause the colors are bright.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommended this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s Ah-MAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the colors are so pigmented; that the size of the individual shadow doesn&#x27;t even matter... BC it is so rich and pigmented very little is needed for the big effect!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powder shadow. I see some reviews that complain of the residue that falls when you apply.... First of all, if you know how to do your makeup and what to do on your face first... You should know that if you are wearing eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;before you apply any primer, foundation or even powder, YOU DO YOUR EYES FIRST! That&#x27;s a fact BC no matter the expensive of the eyeshadow you buy excess will fall. So by you doing your eyes first... You can easily wipe the fall through off easily without ruining your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Second, these shadows are already so rich in color that I don&#x27;t use any primer but if you&#x27;re one of those critical young ladies then good heavens get yourself a good primer an stick it on your eyelid before applying the shadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it was a wonderful gift from by fianc√©. I put on my eyeshadow in the morning and it stays on and beautiful all day/ night! I&#x27;ve gotten sooooo many compliments! It&#x27;s just as beautiful as the high ends products.&lt;br /&gt;I have from the most high end makeup products to drugstores even dollar store makeup and trust me this product is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also see a lot that dish out BC it&#x27;s fake?&lt;br /&gt;You are obviously not very educated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I loved this product! It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s got matte shadows and shimmer from the whole color wheel! It&#x27;s love in a box!&lt;br /&gt;Came packed and sealed no broken product an perfect fast shipping! Thank you!! I would defiantly recommend it in a heart beat!!</li>
            <li> Arrived early, works well with my skin and the colors are really vibrant.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and they go on smoothly and they stay on.  Excellent shimmer colors very satisfied with the selection of colors.</li>
            <li> high pigmented, however there were two or more of some colors.</li>
            <li> BEST PURCHASE I&#x27;VE MADE</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome, yes they are on the small side but no biggie. The only problem I have with it, is that they come in three separate trays that you stack on top of each other, so it is a good idea to leave the protective plastic sheets on top. I wish they just came on one giant tray, that is why I gave it 4 stars. But other than that, great!</li>
            <li> This is not a real coastal scents product. The photos depict the real thing however what i received was not a genuine coastal scents palette. I read all these wonderful reviews on this product and the seller so im not sure what happen. Either most individuals are not aware that this is fake, or the seller has changed the products they are selling. I owned one of these that i had purchased from coastal scents a few months back for personal use and wanted another to put in my free lance kit. As soon as i opened the package i knew it was real. It doesn&#x27;t even have any coastal scents labeling on it. Plain black package, plain black palette case, and eye shadow palettes are not the same as the real one.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shadow Palette</li>
            <li> So many choices, it&#x27;s hard to even know where to start! Seriously, there&#x27;s something for everyone and every skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the shadows are long-lasting here&#x27;s a recommendation (because I had issues with pigmentation): wet your brush in water. For some reason this helps the brush hold more color and DOES NOT make it smear/run...may have actually helped with the lasting capabilities as well, now that I think about it. (As a side note, if you use a primer, it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove that either. I use E.L.F.&#x27;s eye primer and that stuff stuck with the whetted brush, no issue.)</li>
            <li> Ordered and Received promptly. Great pallets , love that they are easy to put in and remove from case. Case closes securely. Well worth what I spent.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there can be a lot of fallout with some shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is a great palette. I&#x27;ve already received compliments on my eyeshadow from friends and internet strangers using this palette.  Blending is easy with the right brush and the color variety is fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is amazing... the colors are sooo pigmented and long lasting on the skin even without a primer, is incredible of how good it is... I have medium to dark skin tone and all the colors show on my skin perfectly fine... I love it.</li>
            <li> This product would be perfect, but it did cause slight irritation on my extremely sensitive eyes. Being a high end makeup snob, buying this palette was a bit of a tough decision. It&#x27;s definitely not the same quality as Urban Decay, Lorac, Smashbox, Too Faced or any of the other high end brands, but this exceeded my expectations. I bought the palette to review on a beauty blog, and found myself pleasantly surprised by the silky consistency and high pigmentation of the shadow. After swatching every single shadow on my arm, I determined that well over half were useable. With 252 colors, it&#x27;s likely there are a few in here that are dupes for other brands shadows. Another reason this product is not 5 stars is because of the significant staining on my eyelids. After scrubbing and scrubbing, I was still unable to remove the stain, and just attempted to cover it with concealer.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it came in 2 days and was in excellent condition. The shadows are well pigmented and there are a range of different shades of every color. There are also matte and pearlescent shades. I&#x27;m very please and would definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li> My teen daughter bought this item with her own money.  It certainly has a ton of colors.  But each color is very small.  Packaging is nice - each tray stacks neatly in the box which closes very easily. But for the price this is a very good value and selection.</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE COLORS! I finally decided to get my own and it was a really good decision. All the color choices are great and for many occasions, i did Halloween makeup, xmas makeup, new years, and my birthday along with regular girls nights out on the weekends. It&#x27;s really well pigmented and very easy to blend. Recommend to anyone who is looking for a great variety of colors without having to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Love it. Never have to buy individual eye shadows ever again. Highly pigmented colors - gorgeous pay off.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!!!!!!! It&#x27;s a heck of a lot smaller then I thought it was going to be, but I love the palette! It came wrapped up tightly, none of the colors were broken. Very beautiful and colorful :)</li>
            <li> Shipped within three days, and it was in PERFECT condition when it arrived. Not one damaged pot whatsoever. The colours are a great variety and I&#x27;m incredibly happy with how they show up on my skin. I adore having the mattes and shimmers in one palette. Lasts all day and is in a very sturdy case capable of taking a hit with layered plastic sheets between palette layers to keep the pots safe. Definitely willing to rebuy when I run out.</li>
            <li> so i got my 252 palette last week.. the shipping was good.. i got it a day before the actual delivery date! so that was a plus! i wanted to test it for a full week before i made a review on it.. and i love it!!  i dont have anything bad to say about this palette is perfect! it has every color imaginable! yes the size of the color pans are dime size.. but the pigmentation makes up for it.. i swear all i had to do was dip my brush in the color one time and i had enough color for both eyes.. so with that being said i strongly recomend this eyeshadow palette! and i will purchase again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;: Happy Customer</li>
            <li> The pigmentation of most of the shadows is impressive (especially the shimmer ones), but the durability was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the quality everything is execelente, really happy and delighted</li>
            <li> The only downside to this palette is how small the pots are (smaller than a dime). Other than that, it&#x27;s truly fantastic. The assortment of colors is wonderful, and all of the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far have been highly pigmented and so vibrant. The colors are super blendable, too. I find them to be long lasting if used over a primer, as well. I would highly recommend this palette to anyone on a budget (or not, for that matter) and curious about trying out a wide assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Daughter is interested in beauty products and she loved the variety of colors, she uses it whenever she goes out.It is long lasting in it&#x27;s color pigment and photographs naturally.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, this is a must have</li>
            <li> We loved really nice and practice!</li>
            <li> This Pallete is incredible! I thought for the price the shadows wouldn&#x27;t be as vibrant or long lasting as the description said. I&#x27;m so happy I was wrong! The shadows are very pigmented, hardly ever smudge or transfer, and the colors last all day! Even after a full work day (I&#x27;m a waitress at a pub and grill) My Eye-shadow looks as if I had just applied it! I use it on a daily basis now. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all my friends I use it everyday! Worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> So much to choose from it&#x27;s almost too many colors! Goes on nice and love the case it comes in!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette!  There are SO many colors (obviously) and the colors are very pigmented.  With some eyeshadow primer underneath the shadows I had it last all day long with no wear!</li>
            <li> Well I gave u a 5 because I can compare your eyeshadow just as good as Mac no lie I love it and my daughter loves it we found a new brand we can always come back to and be satisfied with I&#x27;m so glad my friend turned me on to your makeup it&#x27;s awsome plus some of my friends say it looks flawless I love coastal scent all the way downtown lol:-)</li>
            <li> I didnt realize the eyeshadows were so small so i was a bit dissapointed, however, i love the colors and the fact that it stays on all day and does not smear. Happy Customer.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I ordered this that the shadow would not have lasting power...but I was wrong.  The colors are vibrant and a little goes a long ways.  I love that I have sooo many color choices with this palette.  I would order again.  It was worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.  The colors are so pretty. I have so much fun with my makeup palette. So many of my friends have purchased this palette because of all the fun I have with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my niece. This is great quality product. She loved it so much as she have tons if ways to.mix and match the shades.</li>
            <li> Everything was here on time. Even earlier than I expected. Only small issue that can be over looked is one of the eye shadows were broken. But one out of two hundred and fifty two is not a bad trade. I would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> This things are awesome!!! They&#x27;re small but not too small.  For the price it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Love all the colors! Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> My young daughter likes these.</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter wanted.  Small enough for her to pack and take to college.</li>
            <li> I got mines today and it came within a day of ordering each color is about the size of a dime but the colors are supper pigmited came in great packaging and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from, good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, easy to apply</li>
            <li> Very nice colors, very pigmented. It has a large selection, The only thing is that the pots are really tiny. They are about dime sized. But overall good product. And arrived sooner than time expected.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and the pigmentation is great!  I always wear primer before applying any eyeshadow so it may have been because of that, but either way it is amazing!  I love even the look of it!  But the each color comes in little circles, not as big as I&#x27;d hoped.  I did think it&#x27;d be bigger but seriously, with all those options of eyeshadow and all the other eyeshadow I already own, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t need anymore than this!  Great buy! Wish I bought it sooner!</li>
            <li> This palette has some really great colors, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all! There&#x27;s also a lot of fall out, but I guess that&#x27;s expected with cheaper eyeshadows</li>
            <li> so many colors, stays on all day, blends nicely.</li>
            <li> There is alot of eye shadows and it is a great product I gave it 4 stars bc the eye shadows were tiny and looking at the picture I expected them to be a little bigger!</li>
            <li> these colors are amazing</li>
            <li> Some of the colours aren&#x27;t well pigmented, and it breaks off if you travel with the case creating a huge mess. I do like the practice and experimentation with so many colours, both warm and cool. Its a cheap investment. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> There are options options and more options they are really about a dime size pots. The product also is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I simply love this kit. It had everything my girlfriend was looking for. I highly recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li> love,love,love it. this palette is beyond excellent. when i got it,it just blew me away. would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Inspires so much creativity, and the textures are very high end, you&#x27;d never know you were using something this inexpensive.</li>
            <li> There are so many incredible colors in this palette, I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ones to use first.  The coverage is pretty darn good, especially with an eye shadow primer.  The only thing I would caution is that the palette was a bit smaller then I anticipated, each color is about a dime to a nickle size.</li>
            <li> Love love LOOOVE this ! So many colors to chose from! Pallets are very well pigmented, and price is great for all the colors you get ! No complaints !</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and some seem to be slight different shades of each other. But I am very satisfied and they go on really pigmented when applied over a primer. I use the urban decay primer</li>
            <li> O m g the r awesome a wonderful colors  how can i describe it it is more wonderful than the pics</li>
            <li> Loved mine so much, I bought one for my friend!!! üòÉ</li>
            <li> great purchase. covers a wide range of colours and finishes (matte, shimmer, duo-chrome). So far, i haven&#x27;t had to purchase colours from other brands because they are already in this palette.</li>
            <li> AWESOME colors to choos from and AWESOME combinations!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and had it shipped to Guatemala. I was afraid the item would suffer any damage but it came on PERFECT CONDITIONS!!! Colors are completely beautiful I just can&#x27;t believe how amazing this product is. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. As others have mentioned the eyeshadows are small, but they are great long lasting quality. It&#x27;s fun to have so many options!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette a few months ago and I have to say, I LOVE IT! The colors are so vibrant and go on so very smooth! It&#x27;s wonderful. I will never buy more eye shadow again! It has almost every color out there in every finish you can think of! The price for it alone is amazing. It is a key part of my makeup collection now and I use it very often.&lt;br /&gt;I only have one con to this product. When I received it, a handful of the shadows were shattered!!!!!!!! :(. It is very likely that this happened during shipping, even with the fragile sticker on the packaging, I think we can all agree that fragile packages are not always treated as such. Even when shattered, the shadows are wonderful and there is a simple way to repair them ;). I really have no other complaints and if Coastal Scents ever comes out with more colors, I am definitely buying them!</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors I bought on for my niece.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, very pigmented. good packaging all I have to say are good things. GREAT PRODUCT !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a pigmented black. (Other colors are pigmented too) The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t really even fade after me rubbing my eyes. I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you don&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg for just one color that you want to try out on yourself... this palette gives you a ton of colors and they come on extremely nice and strong.  I love this palette, it will probably last me a few years and I love all the options I have.  I normally wear browns and light orange colors but sometimes I watch some Makeup Geek video tutorials and she makes me want to venture out and try new colors so this palette is perfect when I want to try a new look out with some similar colors that she uses that I don&#x27;t normally have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Andrea</li>
            <li> This palette has great shades in it. Would definitely recommend anyone to buy this palette...don&#x27;t want to own a million eye shadows? Buy this it&#x27;s great with the colors</li>
            <li> Sooooo happy with this product!..Tons of colors totally worth the money</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 kits from coastal scents but didnt get those. I got different kits and didnt like them.</li>
            <li> This palette is the bomb! The colors are beautiful.  Every shade you would need is in there.&lt;br /&gt;Im a makeup artist and i am happy i got it. My friends even borrow it .</li>
            <li> not crazy about all the colors but its a good pallette</li>
            <li> colours are amazing just some of the matte ones are chalky. Pots are smaller than youd expect but when you have ao many colours it&#x27;ll take forever to go through. Ive had it for a month and ive used it every day...rather than my naked palette</li>
            <li> love it! very nice and bright colors. I cant wait to try them on! very happy with my purchase. thanks</li>
            <li> Love them! very good price for 252 shades.</li>
            <li> I basically brought this palette to recreate the looks I saw on youtube videos. Where u need so many different palettes to recreate the looks if you don‚Äôt own the shades. This palette was the solution for my never ending palette list to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette, is so affordable and has every color under the sun. I could not believe how bright and pigmented they were. So velvety. Not only is there a color variety, but there is also different types of finishes.&lt;br /&gt;For somebody who loves different colors and who is on a budget, this is perfect. With some primer and good make up brushes these colors show up great and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;Also this palette has something to offer for every skin tone, from pale to dark. You may not use all colors but there are some which will compliment your skin tone.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow Is Absolutely Awesone! I just LOVE it! Wonderful colors...something to match every day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these...the packaging was awesome none were broke.  The pigmentation is great</li>
            <li> This palette is actually cool for the price ce paid.... The size per colour is small... But it heavily pigmented</li>
            <li> Lots of colors, good setup to keep them from getting broken, quality case.</li>
            <li> These colors are AWESOME!  Bright, bold, and beautiful.  A little goes a long way.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t last all day but it lasts for an evening out.  I&#x27;m just starting out learning about make-up techniques but I love having all of these options.</li>
            <li> I love all the color choices and my daughter is going to love these.</li>
            <li> Nicely compact, great colors, applies beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were a little bigger. I have favorite colors and want them to last but they are so small individually I wonder how quickly I will go through some that I use regularly. But I guess that&#x27;s the downfall of being given so many colors in such a compact case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fall apart a bit too easily for me in each socket. Many fly-aways no matter how carefully I try to dab at each color. This is definitely a palette that you don&#x27;t want to set down in any way other than right side up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, lovely, lovely palette. My favorite that I&#x27;ve purchased so far!</li>
            <li> This is a great product im always super skeptical about buying make up online but for the price its amazing i always get compliments on my eyeshadow. For my engagment party i went to get my makeup professionaly done and my make up atrtist had the same exact palette. Colors come out so vibrant and they last they dont wear off or nor will excessive powder fall off ur eyes when applying the shadow. Best buy!!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors. There so bright</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for any makeup lover or artist.There are a wide variety of vibrant colours. Using any good eyeshadow primer or base would allow you to get the true quality of the hues but they are still bold enough on their own. You will not be disappointed. The only little con I would highlight is the size of each colour. The size of the individual pots are a little smaller than most palettes but with 252 colours, I do not believe that is a big downfall.</li>
            <li> Great, great product and great price.  This is going great with my customers and are not heavy users of make-up.  Shades are excellent for the Caribbean, where you find many shades of people.</li>
            <li> Love it all , just perfect for me!!!</li>
            <li> Not real, false advertising.  The palette I received is not a coastal scents palette.  It looks similar to the inage but its not. Better off buying off the actual site</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although each reservoir is small, the selection and variety of color is fabulous. I have just decided to begin playing with eye shadow combinations and this gives me a great place to start. There are both iridescent and matte colors. And they last for hours -- though I AM using a primer. Each day I&#x27;m able to decide what similarly shaded colors I might blend or what contrasting colors I might want to combine. I&#x27;m even using the darker shades as eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the three trays is individually wrapped in plastic which needs to be removed. And then there is a sized plastic sheet to keep each tray covered and separated when not in use. The trays store easily in any order in the compact black plastic case. In addition, each tray has a ribbon attached to make it easier to lift each tray out of the case.</li>
            <li> I had bough one as a gift and I loved it so much that I got one for my self. Great quality! loved them!</li>
            <li> I asked for this palette for Christmas because one of my friends had it. I absolutely love it! Yes the swatches are small, but there are 252 options, and honestly you cannot beat the price. For the price of this item, I was incredibly surprised by how deep the swatches were; they are about the size of a dime, but if you flip the palette over you can see how deep they really are. I was also surprised by how pigmented they were. I barely use any of the shadow to cover both my eyes; it&#x27;s very easy to blend and shows up very well. Now, I have 2 Naked palettes and a Smashbox palette, which I absolutely love; however, I would recommend this Coastal Scents palette over any of those! The pigmentation is just as amazing, if not better, and the price is way cheaper!</li>
            <li> I like all the colors. I am like a kid in a candy store. I don&#x27;t know which one I want to do first. For the price and the amount of eyeshadow you will get I will say it worth getting. I have no complaints</li>
            <li> OMG!! I absolutely LOVE this product! It has every color known to mankind! I do not need to run to MAC to purchase any eyeshadow because this palette has all shades and finishes. It&#x27;s easy to pack and travel with and the less products I take with me, the easier life is for me....Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very impressive for the price, arrived days early, is authentic Coastal Scents, couldn&#x27;t be happier:)</li>
            <li> The individual eye shadows are smaller than they seem in the picture, about the size of a nickel but well worth the money as for quality and quantity</li>
            <li> Was ordered as a gift for my daughter and she loved it. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> To mothers with daughters or sons that aspire to be  make up artist this one of the best study guide. Everyone can bond over make up The three pallets allows you to demonstrate while the other pallet can be given to your student. Find me on Twitter#trcybass</li>
            <li> i love the colors and the variety but i notice that some has little mineral and sone has too much but over the the colors are great. i brought this for prom and i cant wait to play with it!</li>
            <li> These shadows have great pigmentation, and each small pot is more than enough to last a while. But the way the three palettes stack on top of each other with separate plastic sheets is really annoying and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> I lllooooovvvveee  make up and this is not real coastal scents its crap don&#x27;t buy at all!!!! I do make up and I wouldn&#x27;t even  call this play make up for kids AND A BIG NEG IS THAT THE EYESHADOWS ARE SO SMALL U CANT EVEN USE GOOD BRUSHES WITH THIS MAKE UP SUCKS DONT BUY</li>
            <li> I recieved this product three days earlier then said delivery date and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed by this palette. The colors are about the same of a dime but they are very highly pigmented and that makes it up for it. This palette is perfect for all types of looks and the packaging was very good.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Colors stay on for a really long time and there&#x27;s a really great variety of colors. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this set.</li>
            <li> I bought this two weeks ago. For that amount of money, I think the palette is worth buying for. Some of the colors look very similar - they may look identical if you are looking from far away. Don&#x27;t worry though, all the colors are at least one shade different from one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors come in dime size, but the color is very dense so you need very little to stand out. For dark skin individuals, you may have to put a lot on to stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that each palette is separated by only a hard plastic. So, there&#x27;s a very high chance of your eye shadow touching the bottom of the palette above if you forgot the plastic.</li>
            <li> Amazing color and variety! Just as good as the big name brands, but better price. Color goes on smooth and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> The colors are nicely pigmented, they go on smoothly. The long lasting of it works better with an eye primer first. There is a large array of colors and can be easily mixed together and blended. I bought this for myself and my niece and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the product. They are all intact upon delivery. So beautiful and afortable. Just as expected.üòä</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> I think I can safely say that after buying this palette, I officially do not need to buy any more eyeshadow (oh who am I kidding, I&#x27;m a complete makeup addict). I was a little afraid to buy this palette only because I have another large palette of 88 neutral shadows that I haven&#x27;t used yet, despite the great quality. I just got overwhelmed by all the possible combinations that I haven&#x27;t been able to come up with any looks yet. Anyway, after looking up swatches and reviews on Google and Youtube I decided to buy it. You get 3 palettes in one box and they are full of great colors. The only ones I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use are the green ones though, since I have blue eyes and I think green shadow looks odd on blue eyes. My only sort of complaint is that the shadow pans are quite small. They&#x27;re smaller than a dime, basically the same size as the tip of my index finger. However, since I usually wear neutral eyeshadows, this palette should last me a while since I won&#x27;t be wearing it everyday. As far as pigmentation goes, it&#x27;s amazing. Swatches I&#x27;ve seen online had really good pigmentation but when I ordered it I was sure I was going to be disappointed. Without putting any sort of base or primer under the shadows, they show up fantastically, even the mattes which was really surprising. I bought this palette because I was looking for a combination of the BH 88 matte and shimmer palettes. I prefer shimmery shadows, but I need mattes for my crease and blending. This palette is mostly shimmer but there are several matte shadows that I can make work for different looks so I&#x27;m quite pleased that I do not need to buy the other two palettes. Aside from the size of the shadow pans, I guess my only other complaint would be that I wish it were a little cheaper, but $30 for 252 shadows is still pretty good. If you like colorful eyeshadows, particularly shimmery ones, I&#x27;d buy this palette. I think it&#x27;s a great buy and really convenient to have all those color options in one box. The paletteis pretty small too (about 9&amp;#34;x6&amp;#34;) so it&#x27;s not going to take up a lot of room. If you were going to travel and needed to take makeup with you, you could bring just this palette alone for all the eyeshadows you could possibly need. If you need inspiration for looks, type in &amp;#34;252 eyeshadow palette&amp;#34; into youtube and there are several videos for you to get ideas from. I&#x27;m so happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever had, the colors are very rich and bold, they go on smooth, blend easily, and there&#x27;s so many to choose from!!!</li>
            <li> this palette is very high quality,i love it,a lot of nice colors,good texture,well applaied,not scattered.inexpensive but quality.recommend to all.i am pleased.</li>
            <li> There are no doubt lots of BEAUTIFUL shades.  And like others have mentioned, the swatches are tiny. I&#x27;d say less than dime size.  They are rich colors though, so the fact that the swatches are small isn&#x27;t a huge deal. The problem I&#x27;m running into is that they are VERY VERY powdery. So when I apply the eyeshadow is gets everywhere on my face and is very hard to wipe off.  If I can figure out a way to make the powder not get everywhere then I will be very pleased with this purchase. Otherwise it is just too messy to use.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is good, and the colors are beautiful, but the packaging is not as good as it could be.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying eyeshadows at the store I thought looked good only to get it home and turn out differently than expected.  Having a huge palatte allows you to find the perfect shade, with a variety of matte, shimmer, and metallic shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and powdery and blend well, and I use some of them as a liner by wetting a narrow angle brush to apply.  When used wet they have an especially concentrated pigment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any reaction to these.  I usually just apply once in the morning and most shades last throughout a work day.  Which is nice because you can&#x27;t just throw the whole thing in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in perfect condition, on time, and none of the shadows were damaged as they were well packaged.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 252 makeup palette a while back and absolutely love it! I like how there are the shimmery eyeshadows and just the matte colors, its perfect and i use it every time i go out. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE! I&#x27;M A BEGINNER WHEN IT COMES TO EYE SHADOW SO I USED THIS PALETTE TO START WITH SINCE IT CAME WITH 252 EYE SHADOWS FOR ONLY $26 BUCKS, YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT! THE SHADES ARE SMALL BUT A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. THE QUALITY IS DECENT, I&#x27;M CARAMEL COMPLEXION AND SO FAR I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE COLORS NOT SHOWING UP. YOU ALSO HAVE TO USE A EYE SHADOW PRIMER AND I USED N.Y.X AND IT WORKED WELL! I WILL PURCHASE THIS PALETTE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sampler pallet of all the amazing colors. The only thing I wish it had... labels or color names to each so that you can find the color pot easily and order your favorites.  The pigment is amazing. They glide on smoothly. Highly recommend if you&#x27;d like a large assorment of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> At first colors may seem as though the colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented, wet your brush and the colors are vibrant. One of the color pots did was cracked when I got it but no biggie</li>
            <li> Worked well for my costume makeup</li>
            <li> I do not think that you can ask for better pigment. The colors are bright, and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many options in this palette, you just can not go thru them all.&lt;br /&gt;for the money I spent, I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the delivery was really fast!</li>
            <li> Great choice I love it. The size is small but the color really pop on my skin and u only have  to use a small amount...</li>
            <li> This palette is a life saver. The colors are amazing,  bold, vibrate. They blend so well. For the price this palette is perfect for anyone looking for new eye shadow looks. 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. If you&#x27;re wanting a lot of colors, you get them. They are small, but they work great. A few colors needed to go on wet to show pigmentation better, and some didn&#x27;t show up well on my skin (this might be that they were close to my skin color), but other than that I love this. I waited a bit to post because I wanted time to see how well they worked and stayed. I used a primer, and the colors lasted well. A majority of them blend well, and there are only a few (&amp;#60;5) which gave me issues. They arrived in perfect condition. It&#x27;s realy a 4.5 star, but I give them 5 just for being on time and in perfect condition with a great product.</li>
            <li> love this makeup.so many colors.blends nicely which is why I got it.very good purchase at a nice price.very fast shipping.I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE! it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! When it first came I thought it was a little small, but these colors are so pigmented it&#x27;s not a worry for me. A great tip is to prime your eyelids before application</li>
            <li> this is a great buy for anyone wanting a variety of colors. perfect for someone who is starting out in the cosmetology industry. some colors are intense. add a little water to your makeup brush and they become vibrant. colors last too for all day wear. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved the way each tray came completely out. You can lay them out and see all your choices. Especially handy when doing makeup jobs.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are just amazing. They go on highly pigmented and take very little to get great colour. The palette itself has pretty much every colour you could ever need. With a mix of both matte and glittery shades you eye shadow for every occasion. This is a great buy for the price. Pair it with a good eye shadow primer and you will not be let down.</li>
            <li> This is the best for any person of any age. There are so many colors to choose from I sometimes get lost from applying one eye to the other! There is fallout though, so be prepared to lightly brush the excess that falls on your cheeks, or apply foundation after. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! Be sure to have lots of brushes!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a37a309a90601a946a63739a81ee4fd2]]I love both of the coastal scents revealed palettes, but I was feeling adventurous and wanted more colors. I decided to buy this palette and I was not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;-The quality is wonderful, highly pigmented and smooth in texture. All the colors I have tried so far blend really well. I always use eye primer, so I can&#x27;t say what they look like without it.&lt;br /&gt;-I have noticed that there isn&#x27;t much fallout - less than the first revealed palette! Pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m light skinned and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to pull off most of these colors, but I&#x27;m having fun Trying everything out. Most of the colors look better on skin than in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I wish there were more purple shades, as well as more deep blue shades. I don&#x27;t think that I really need as many different yellows as there are though. I love that there are so many metallicy shades.&lt;br /&gt;- several of the shadows in the palette arrived cracked. For me, not a big deal. I fixed them with a little rubbing alcohol, and good as new.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am super happy with this purchase, especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Also, all the colors are available to be sold individually on the coastal scents website. This is a great way to figure out which ones to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video: my video shows what each color looks like when switched on paper. The names for each shade were found on the coastal scents website.</li>
            <li> LOVE! it&#x27;s great and there is various colors! I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Small swatches, but enough to last a while. Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Love the various shades</li>
            <li> Received it as a Christmas gift, I love it so far. But it should come with a brush or something.</li>
            <li> Good but very very tiny!</li>
            <li> This product is not bad but not original. I dont know how the seller is Costal and the serial number is not opened in costal&#x27;s web site?!&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to get a fake product.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved this gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallete! It has such pigmented colors. I love all the shades of color and variety of matte and shimmery colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I was buying a BH Cosmetics pallette. I didn&#x27;t fully read the title. So that&#x27;s my own fault. Needless to say, I am happy with my purchase. The colors are the vibrancy I was looking for anyway. Thank you.</li>
            <li> all the colors you can possibly want. there is some i still have yet to wear. this little palette is great. you will enjoy all the colors and the quality is great. i would recommend buying a good eye primer for this</li>
            <li> I just love it and specially the colors...!!!</li>
            <li> I got these for my Mom. she likes it Great Colors and stays on pretty well. They didn&#x27;t come with a case for the two other pallets and that I was not happy about. I assumed they would. I mean of course the customer wants to protect all their pallets. I think they should have come with a  3 sleeve case. I&#x27;m mean that only makes since. She took them on vaca with her and that would have made it much easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette months ago and I&#x27;m still using it. Sooo happy with it!!!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTLEY LOVED THIS PALETT ! It has many different colors and the pigment is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the shadows is small, about the size of a dime or slightly bigger  but I absolutely love it because I can always make great combination &amp;#60;3  It&#x27;s not heavy and it lasts the whole day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the color choices and the texture and staying power. I put these on in the morning with a cheap primer and my shadow is still looking good with no crease at night after working all day. There is very little of each color but enough to get atleast 2 months use out of each well. Can be used dry or wet for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are amazing!! they are really pigmented i will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> For the eyeshadow palette, you get a range of matte and shiny, pigmented shades. I really like it. It&#x27;s well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> You get a great variety of colors. They are definitely very pigmented. Totally worth the money! I just love them!</li>
            <li> beautiful colors that unfortunately only stay when applied wet, not the best quality, but good for what you are paying</li>
            <li> Great, fun fashion shades at low prices. The product goes on nicely and lasts all day with primer. So many colors to choose from, although some look the same on my skin tone. You get arbor a dime size of each which is plenty. Arrived promptly in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter&lt;br /&gt; loves the Eye Shadow Palette</li>
            <li> I love this... the colors are super pigmented and it offers a wide variety to choose. The purple stained my brush a little but this is still an awesome product</li>
            <li> love the package and all of the colors included in the set all is missing is the brushes and glitter</li>
            <li> now, they are very pigmented. I love that. they are kind of small, about the size of dimes. I really don&#x27;t mind, i doubt ill hit pan anytime soon. I love the bright colors but I&#x27;m usually scared to wear them out. I just practice with them at home. Now the other colors i use them a lot. I can do a dramatic look even with the neutral colors.</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the colors were as displayed in the picture on the website. i also like the wide variety of colors this palette provides. i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li> I received this palette today, it was a lot smaller than I expected,  but the shadows are so pretty and very pigmented. I did a few swatches and I just love this palette. Can&#x27;t wait to do some makeup looks with it. I highly recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> Im lving for this product. The color lay out is wonderful. If your one who draw inspiration from a single look this will work for you. I love how a number of whites are thru-out the palette. Im a brown skin lady who loves making my colors stand out with out the drag queen of queens effect. the color stays pretty good. Take this into consiseration that Im wipe my eyes, I cant handle make up but I cant handle not wearing it. After a full day of eye wiping this make-up is still there... faded yes but there none the least&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ms. Shae&#x27;</li>
            <li> having mac eye shadows and lacome and clinque.... these do pack color IF you use primer (urban decay) and great brush. I had problems when appying falls all under the eye area...but like i said with the right primer and brush worked a lot better when applying. great colors.&lt;br /&gt;would I repurchase them again - dont know yet....</li>
            <li> Even though this pallet is cheap, it&#x27;s amazing. I love making my eyes pop with color. These are so well pigmented that they do just that. I usually use these as a base color and put Urban Decay Stardust on as the glitter really compliments the base color. These colors are small but I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old saw this set in a make-up tutorial and I was so happy to find it on Amazon at a great price.  Loads of colors!</li>
            <li> very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best. when I got it it wasn&#x27;t even broken or anything. I LOVE THIS THING!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING  AMAZING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so pigmented</li>
            <li> If you were to get a pallet like this from Sephora or MAC it would cost you around $100 on sale and they would say VALUE OF: $ 289.99. some of the colors I use daily or weekly other colors I use on occasion but every time I am happy. Some of the darker colors are much too dark for me on my fair skin but that may be just what your looking for. I would have to say that the color last quite a while on your eyes, not as long as a really expensive eyeshadow but for the price of one expensive eyeshadow you get 252 colors.. That is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat. The only downside to this is being careful with applying it, you do have to slowly build some of the colors because it is a very dry eyeshadow meaning that if you put a truck load on at a time you will get some debris on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought the first one it contains a variety of colors! Which usually won&#x27;t get it from other brands in such a good price and quality!.  I lend it to my friend and she love it. I order one for her.</li>
            <li> This was even better than I thought. My granddaughter is having fun trying all the colors!</li>
            <li> The only kinda bad thing i could say about this palette is that the eyeshadows are as small as a dime. Other than that, omg that pigmentation are out of this world!!!</li>
            <li> Some colors where broken  Other then that love them</li>
            <li> I received my new palette in a very timely manner. Took only a day and a half to get here with normal shipping.&lt;br /&gt;All the shadows were intact on arrival, as they were packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are gorgeous, ranging from all ends of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;The individual colors are small, however I researched this before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, when you run out, you can order more of your favorites shades on the Coastal Scents website.&lt;br /&gt;First time, CS customer, look forward to ordering more products in the future :D.</li>
            <li> I adore my CS 252 palette and always will. This product comes in a nicely packaged box covered in bubble wrap for extra safety. The container itself is thin for what its proposing but it has 3 slabs of palettes. All colors are the size of a dime but trust me they last VERY long! A little goes a long way because they are highly pigmented and has maaaany shades both matte and shimmery to make the perfect eyeshadow. The combo of colors are endless and combined with a eye primer they can last all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing negative to be said about this palette unless you find yourself using up just one which is highly impossible with the amazing neutral shades and vibrant colors it provides. I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 years and continue to get compliments all the time. I always find myself  ignoring my drugstore and high end products to use these eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly said; Money is not being wasted here for 252 colors for just $25!</li>
            <li> Love this palette!! Every color I could need!</li>
            <li> I love my new 252 eye shadows.  I am a returning customer and so far I ordered 2 of the 252 palette . I love how the shadows last all day and I had one of my palette 88 coastal scent warm shadows for 3 years and I have some colors still left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i received my 252 palette package today, I opened it, and 4 colors were broken. :( I wasn&#x27;t happy about that. The shipping was fast prior to ordering . I&#x27;m a fan of this product and I highly recommend Coastal Scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love all of the colors the size of the pallette is a little smaller than I was expecting though.</li>
            <li> The colors are hit and miss for blendability. Pigment doesn&#x27;t transfer well. Not the best quality, would not waste money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette. It&#x27;s easy to travel with. The eyeshadow holds up even after all day wear and the variety of colors if awesome. I no longer have to drag around a thousand eye shadows pots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS BRAND MANY TIMES AS A MAKEUP ARTIST, I FEEL I WAS MISLEAD BY THE SIZE OF THE EYESHADOWS THEY ARE TINY SMALLER THAN A DIME, THE COLORS ARE GREAT AND SERVICE WAS GREAT ALTHOUGH BUT NOT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> shipping was on time, beautifull colors</li>
            <li> I really like this palette . The colors are very pigmented which is great because it makes them more efficient . As someone who is just starting to get into the whole eyeshadow thing , i bought this to experiment and learn different techniques and it is absolutely perfect for that . Tons of colors and shades . Couldnt be happier with it .</li>
            <li> When I received my eyeshadow palette some of the eye shadows were broken in pieces, I was not very happy when I saw themüòï...although they look very pigmented and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;ALL 3 PALETTES ARE ABLE TO FIT INTO THE COMPACT THAT IT COMES IN. IT ALSO HAS RED RIBBONS ATTACHED WHICH MAKES FOR A EASY PULL OUT OF THE COMPACT. WHATEVER COLOR YOU&#x27;RE LOOKIING FOR IS LITERALLY IN THIS PACK!! GREAT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING palette!!! Colors are super pigmented and nothing was damaged when it arrived!! This product makes me question all the singe eyeshadows that I have bought!!</li>
            <li> Not as happy with the pigment in certain colors you deff get what you pay for ladies!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem that great to me. As a caramel skinned black woman, the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant on my skin as i would like and the palletes are very small!</li>
            <li> I recommend this make-up set.  After looking at the other options I am very satisfied.  The package came in order.  The amount of eye shadow is sufficient and the quality is good.  I am having a good time using the various colours.  I do not believe I will need any more eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Without a primer and base colors do not show up well enough. Definitely awesome assortment of colors and packaged great.</li>
            <li> Great pigments that are true to color and easy to use. Small samples but they last! Compact design makes it easy to transport tons of options!</li>
            <li> I did a You Tube review on this palette when it first came out.  Got over 10,000 hits.  Not because I&#x27;m such an expert reviewer but because the product is OUTSTANDING!  I love my 252 palette from Coastal Scents.  Recently, I took it to work with me to apply my eyeshadow.  I was running late.  Unfortunately, I dropped it and many of  shadows cracked.  I could still use them but for $20 plus some change, I decided to buy an extra one and keep it at home.  My &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; palette will stay at the office for make-up emergencies. As for quality and value, I will tell you this: there is nothing out there  that compares to the 252, both money-wise and product-wise. I own zillions of palettes and this one offers more colors packed into one case than you could ever hope for.  The looks you can achieve are LIMITLESS. The pigments stay on all day when preceded by a little eyelid primer.  I get so many compliments on my eyemake up which I apply daily before work, usually matching the outfit I am wearing.  Yes...maybe a little squirly, particularly for someone my age but you know what?  Who cares?  Color is the spice of life!  Why not make your face into a a work of art?  With the CS 252, you can do just that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new CS Palette, in fact I&#x27;ll give all my old eye shadows. Beautifull colours and they stay for long time. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! Received it fast and all the colors are very pigmented! The pods are about the size of a dime which was a little smaller than expected but with this many colors I won&#x27;t be running out any time soon!</li>
            <li> The colors look very bright and vivid on the palette,  but don&#x27;t show up well even with a primer. I have a light skin tone,  and even after layering it on,  it just started falling onto my cheekbones. Very disappiinted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with these eyeshadows!! I&#x27;m a dancer and they are exactly what I needed. TOTALLY IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and received it a day early which was great. It has a beautiful selection of colors so no matter the occasion you&#x27;ll have something to match. My only gripe is that the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented so I have to build the color up and consequently when blending it almost makes it look like you have no eyeshadow on, even with the primer.</li>
            <li> Some colors are very pigmented others not so much I do see that some colors are repeated in the palette. However they do break easily so place them gently anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, some were a little cracked but that&#x27;s not the sellers fault. The glitter ones are a little flakey and cinda loose but over all it is amazing! The product blends pretty easily too!</li>
            <li> In love with my new 252 ultimate eye shadow</li>
            <li> Really nice gave it a 4 because I thought they were bigger. Very nice though colors are easily blended</li>
            <li> a couple shadows were a little broken but nothing to obvious</li>
            <li> Omg well I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, so I&#x27;ve been wanting the urban decay and all those expensive pallets, however this pallet is a makeup junkies dream! The eyeshadows are extremely pigmented, the size is workable, and the colors are amazing !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected. Well, actually better than expected. I knew I was getting 252 colors but there is every color you could possibly want in there. I will probably never buy another single or quad eyeshadow ever again (unless I run out of a color). The colors are extremely pigmented, just as other reviewers have said, the dime-sized pans are small but a little goes a long way with these colors.</li>
            <li> I love my new 252 eye shadow palette from coastal scents. There are so many colors to choose from and a little goes along way! Will definitely order more products from this company in the near future!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my pallet, I love exploring with makeup and all the different colors. Therefore buying this palette was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, I opened up the box, everything was clean, none of the shadows were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are dime sized but the shadows are highly pigmented, a little goes a long way. And there are 252 fabulous colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, vibrant colors.  Quality is just as good as my higher end eyeshadows!  If you are thinking of purchasing, do it!</li>
            <li> I had to order this twice because they didn&#x27;t mail me my first order but when I did it came quickly, the eye shadow for each palette is a bit tiny, it is either very pigmented or not at all. I do admire that it comes in a case, keeps it well.</li>
            <li> Love love love this pallet. Yes the eye shadows are small but for the amount you get, it makes up for it. Used some of the peachy colors today for work. Definitely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful assorted colors</li>
            <li> I would of given  a 5 star rating but the pots of color in these are tiny tiny and it will take an extremely small make up brush to use them, and I bought them for my 10 year old granddaughter and they are just to small for her. So not quite appropriate for a younger girl just learning and experimenting with makeup, But my 15 year old daughter is loving it, so it worked out great.</li>
            <li> Fast deliver very please!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it was good,  liked it very much, peachy keen, dandy, groovy. it rocked my world, really,really,really,really liked it so much</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift from my Mother in Law. Wonderful buy. Exactly what i wanted and the colors are wonderful. You can create ANY LOOK. The well size is small, but if you use a good technique you shouldn&#x27;t need much anyway. Packaged correctly and perfectly. Nothing was broken! Five stars.</li>
            <li> Quality makeup palette for a great price. I&#x27;m really picky about makeup and was super shocked that this product was so good. It seems super high pigment, especially the red-tinted shades. There are some great, pure, bright colors in there that I love to fade my other colors into. Lots of choices!</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED THE PALETTE AND I AM IN LOVE. NONE OF THE SHADOWS WERE DAMAGED SO THAT IS MOST DEFINITELY A PLUS ! THE COLORS ARE TRUE TO THE IMAGE. I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO START USING THEM. DEFINITELY A GREAT INVESTMENT :D</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve purchased many of their pallets in the past and the colors come on solid and don&#x27;t flake off! Nice shine and matte colors hold for 24 hours at a time. Love love love!!</li>
            <li> The only words I have is I love this!</li>
            <li> Daughter really likes these.. so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Each color was much smaller than my daughter expected, but overall she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Any color combination I can dream of, is either included in this set or I can create it from this set by mixing. The color is long lasting even when I use it without primer.</li>
            <li> I have found that the colors aren&#x27;t very vibrant unless applied as a cream shadow however, the variety is great and, although they come in small amounts, how many times are you going to wear each of those colors?</li>
            <li> Love love love these colors... I thought they were going to be broken because it came by way of post office and I&#x27;ve worked there..they don&#x27;t care about fragile packages. Anyway  it came perfect Im posting a picture.</li>
            <li> This pallete amazing but it is very tiny. It is basically the miniature version of a pallete.  Perfect for travel if you don&#x27;t want to drag around a huge trunk with you. It is also good to carry in your purse for touch ups. The shadows are literally the size of the tip of my pink finger. The colors are great and last long.</li>
            <li> Came exactly how I thought it would come.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun colors and really goes on well and stays all day.  Got my package yesterday and put on some of the shadows today and everyone said they loved my eye shadows and I told them where to get it and they were surprised and happy when I told them the price and how much you get for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this pallet.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I was looking for something that was inexpensive but yet really pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;This one was recommended by a lot of beauty bloggers.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to experiment with it more!</li>
            <li> So many colors! Great color payoff! I love the combo of Matte and Shimmer and all of the palettes in one case. The hardest part is picking which color to use for the day.</li>
            <li> i am happy, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> much color to chose any time good itmes</li>
            <li> As a fair-skinned, freckle-faced redhead, I&#x27;ve always avoided wearing colors. I have natural dark circles under my eyes, as well, and often feel like eye-shadow makes me look like I secretly run a Fight Club. This eye shadow palette not only turned my opinion around, but turned me into a make-up addict, as well. The coverage is amazing, and a little goes a long way. The colors are exactly as they look - if the color on the palette is bright and vivid, it goes on bright and vivid. If it&#x27;s light and shiny, it goes on light and shiny. Not only do I use this on a daily basis for regular wear, but I used this palette to create an incredible, bright, defined Poison Ivy make-up job for DragonCon. My costume was great, but I received more compliments on my make-up than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the eye shadows are great I really recommend this product, they were just the way the seller describes it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo pissed this is not coastal scents! It&#x27;s a knock off I recived it in a off package that dosent even verify it&#x27;s from coastal scents just a black box!  I&#x27;m so disappointed I want my money back + I had expedited shipping</li>
            <li> Everything you need in an eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> For me, it is just okay. I feel like even though most are pigmented, some can apply patchy. And as with matte colors, they are a little hard to blend so you have to use a good brush that can pick up and deposit the color nicely. It is a nice palette to play with and in case you do find a really good color to order in pot size. My biggest gripe about this palette is that the purple colors stain my eyelid and my brushes after washing. My Mac 219 now is permanently hot pink. Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t permanently stain my eyelids! I did a review about this staining issue on Coastal Scent website and they decided NOT to post it. However, they gladly posted my other positive reviews! Thank goodness I bought this half off on Black Friday.</li>
            <li> i love the colors they&#x27;re really vibrant and bright, but the pallet is a little smaller than i thought</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Love everything about it. The colors, the way the go on and blend. So great!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Will purchase again!! Will post pics later!</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! I feel like it&#x27;s Christma time again. I can&#x27;t device which colors I like better - the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> Great product just apply a base underneath</li>
            <li> They go on great not like some that are light when you put it on</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation but little small than expected but i think it&#x27;s ok to be that small as long as I get the desired pigmentation. Happy to have!</li>
            <li> This pallet is amazing. Who cares if the colors are dime sized?! There are so many colors and they do have great pigment. I reccomend using a primer. I bought two pallets, one for me and my mom. They came very well packaged, not a single one broken. We both agree this is a bang for your buck! Loving this!!</li>
            <li> This palette is great. All of the shadows are very pigmented and look absolutely stunning! The little pots of makeup are small in size, but each shadow is so highly pigmented that you only need a little product to achieve your desired look. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of this brand, as I have no previous experience with it and it&#x27;s inexpensive. I read a lot of beauty blogs and watch a lot of beauty vlogs, and this is recommended for the selection, quality and value. In this case especially, inexpensive does not mean &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34;  I am very pleased with this product.  The pans are small, but that&#x27;s to be expected with so many colors and the price.  The case the three palettes come in is sturdy plastic and while not exactly a display piece, still looks nice.  The palettes themselves are made of kind of flimsy plastic, but they&#x27;re in the case most of the time so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  The whole thing is compact enough to fit in a bathroom drawer with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed in the eyeshadows themselves.  These are not quite MAC or Urban Decay quality and I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be.  But I was impressed with how nice they really are.  Most of the colors are really well pigmented, blend easily without getting muddy, and don&#x27;t fade much or crease when used with a primer.  They&#x27;re not excessively powdery, and there was very little under-eye fallout even with a dark smokey eye.  And so many beautiful colors!  Every shade I could ever use, and some I probably won&#x27;t!  Shimmers and mattes, all grouped into color families, neutrals, brights, warm and cool tones...you could probably use a different color combination every day for the rest of your life.  There&#x27;s something perfect for every look.  I haven&#x27;t tried any with a mixing medium or water yet, so I don&#x27;t know how well they hold up when using them wet.  Should I ever run out, or they get too old to use, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.  Probably the only downside is there are so many that they probably WILL get old and need replacing before you use up more than half of the shadows.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, nice quality and a lot of colors ... awesome, my girlfriend is so happy</li>
            <li> according with my wife this is an excellent product. She is very happy with this, she likes this stuff alot and if she says is good I would say is true.</li>
            <li> A few of the shadows were shattered when I got them</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the texture.  Had a problem with the corner colors.  They were a little damaged in the delivery process.  It seemed that they packaged it ok but the UPS guys really put a beating to the box!  I wish that the trays would slide rather than drop in.  I have accidentally messed up a couple of the shadows by putting the trays back in for storage.  *** PLEASE NOTE*** Make sure that you leave the ribbons hanging out from the trays so you can pull them out again later.  Otherwise you will have to turn the whole case over to get them out and that gets messy.  Also, be careful not to pull to hard on the ribbons because the glue/adhesive that they use isn&#x27;t all the great.</li>
            <li> just about every color eyeshadow you&#x27;d ever want to try rolled up into one box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put anything on my face other than MAC, but after watching a million tutorials and seeing many makeup artists use these colors I figured what the heck let&#x27;s try it. I&#x27;m so in love with these highly pigmented colors. Sometimes I have a hard time deciding which colors to use or pair with one another because there are so many options, but I&#x27;m finding myself using these more often than my MAC shadows. This will be a fabulous xmas gift for all the ladies in my life next December. GREAT PRODUCT AND BUY!</li>
            <li> Great quality makeup. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very good packaging, arrived perfectly as described by the photos. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has so much different shades of so many different colors and that once you purchase this palette you do not need to purchase any other eye shadow palette for about  years. The colors are so pigmented that you only need a small amount.  I would not only recommend coastal scents eyeshadow palette, I would recommend coastal scents for other products as well.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing just look at the pacaking ---_---- dont waste ure money....the front says coastal scents get creative...i am so mad</li>
            <li> Loved this palette it&#x27;s simply amazing</li>
            <li> So many vibrant colors!  They last all day too!  Many compliments!</li>
            <li> Great finally got it... it was worth the wait..</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, viene en lindo estuche y trae todos los colores, viene en tres secciones y el estuche es cerrado.</li>
            <li> These colors are SO PIGMENTED. I have done a few different looks with these, and the color lasts all day. Even when I swatch the color on my hand, I need to use soap and water to get it off. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i love it so much better than the shany cosmetics makeup pallete there is a shimmer to some colors and the matte so you get the best of both</li>
            <li> Not very happy. My pallette looks nothing like the other ones I&#x27;ve seen. Also pigmentation sucks. I was hoping for vibrant colors, when it is really more of a tint. My pallette has no brand written on it. In fact, it has no wording on it at all besides the ingredients... I still like the colors but I feel like I got cheated out of something</li>
            <li> I love this pallet. I use it every day and it was a great way for me to try out Coastal Scents for the first time. When I use a concealer or primer the colors last all day with no creasing or smearing. When I saw the price I was hesitant, thinking it was too good to be true and the product was going to be crap, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying Coastal Scents again.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the fact that I received a &amp;#34;I love make up sticker&amp;#34; as well. I put it on my mini fridge. I love all the colors in this palette. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My friend had originally recommended this palette to me because of my love for makeup and with it&#x27;s 252 shades to choose from, i&#x27;m never bored of it! she bought this palette from the coastal scents website for $60 when it was on sale, and i found it here for 30, it was a steal! It&#x27;s good quality and doesn&#x27;t wear out throughout the day like the drugstore eye-shadows that i&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;m glad i invested in this, and i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll be using this for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to have received this eye shadow palette, there are so much options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Every color of the rainbow, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;Variety of shimmer, matte, and in between those&lt;br /&gt;Great pigments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;I wish each palette was and individual palette as oppose to the 3 trays in one box, only because I feel like this makes it easier to mess it up and get you fingers in the shadow when you are just trying to get them out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;They are also slightly smaller than I thought but because there is such a variety I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never actually get to use them all anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to expand there range of color options in they&#x27;re eye shadows. This palette gives you everything at a low cost.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Have given this as gifts.</li>
            <li> I read lot of review with different brand like BH cosmetic and Shany and I found good review about Coastal Scents so I decided give it a try. The delivery time is on time, I am happy about received it in just 2 days waiting but the product is not perfectly protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;252 colors but 2 colors is broken, which disappointed a perfectionist like me. I gave only 5 stars because their customer service is awesome, they contacted me automatically and apologized about the product. Also offered me see if I would like to return it. I did not return because I needed to use right away and then afterward they sent me a useful brush as a gift . Which makes me happy and would love to recommend to others. I have tried a few colors and they are pretty bright color and good to play around color matching and it stay on my skin even without using the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For delivery packaging, may be the protector bubbles in the box doesn&#x27;t quite fit the package, look like just put something in there, may be it will be nice add more filling.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife, and she has no complaints todate</li>
            <li> love love love, great colors and vibrant it lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li> a very good product, sometimes is hard to clean up for its high quality!</li>
            <li> I got my palette a day before the estimated shipping date, which is always good. :) Good quality shipping bubble wrap and everything. Eye shadows are a bit small which kind of disappointed me a little but I expected it, like if you have an 88 shimmer palette the little pans are smaller then that. Some shadows are shimmer, some are matte which is nice :3 but I&#x27;m more of a shimmer person. ;) The shimmer ones apply really smooth but some of the matte ones are a bit more chalky than others, but it&#x27;s okay I just swatched a couple. In general the palettes are very good :) the color possibilities  are endless.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> My young daughter likes these.</li>
            <li> The colors last long and show perfectly on dark skin !</li>
            <li> Huge selection. I&#x27;m not new to makeup but I&#x27;ve always done the same thing so i got this to try new looks. It&#x27;s kinda awesome in that aspect. Some aren&#x27;t as pigmented as i would&#x27;ve expected but overall they&#x27;re pretty good so far. I love how compact and sleek it is. The little ribbons on the side make it so easy to get to what you want. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like that&#x27;s a strong dislike is the smell. At first when i unboxed it i checked out the selection of colors and made sure no shadows were broken but didn&#x27;t take the plastic dividers off yet. Later when i went to use it and finally took the dividers off the smell really hit me and i didn&#x27;t even use it that time. I&#x27;ve never owned any eyeshadow that smelled like that. Almost chemical i guess. It&#x27;s not the worst or strongest smell but it really threw me off being so excited to try this and having never experienced that before. Idk. I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star rating because I&#x27;m still not sure how i feel about that and if i should even use it.</li>
            <li> In love with every color! Blends well with brushes :)</li>
            <li> I really love these eyesehadows. Obviously they aren&#x27;t designer quality, but for something of a &amp;#34;Drugstore&amp;#34; brand they are really pigmented. I definitely recommend an eye shadow base if you want those vibrant colors though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of fallout though, so they are best applied after you finish the rest of your face makeup.</li>
            <li> i was told it a great product they loved it. it arrived on time packaging was very good will shop again</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing! They are extremely bold and vibrant. When worn over primer the results are all day wear with no crease. My only complaint is the very small size. My favorite everyday colors are gone way to quick!! I attached a photo for size comparison.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, especially for the price, but it is definitely a cheap product.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT GREAT SERVICE WAS AS PROMISED</li>
            <li> OMGosh i love this ,,,wish i would have ordered this years ago,,,so impressed, i do my eyes everyday and have used so many different eyeshades for many different name brand ,,by far one of the best for the price, I&#x27;m Hooked, ordering a few more for gifts...</li>
            <li> Love this palette! So many beautiful colors to create amazing looks. They blend well and stay in place. A definite must have</li>
            <li> amazing all of colors you need it in this palette</li>
            <li> awesome palate. the colors are really gorgeous and pigmented.</li>
            <li> just like the pict well package love it</li>
            <li> I like this product. It has almost every color and shade. The shipping was fast, the packaging was really good and the palette was in an excellent condition. The only reason why I gave it four stars, is because the eye shadows don&#x27;t last as long as the high end brands.</li>
            <li> I love all of the different colors of eye shadow the is in the set.</li>
            <li> i love all the colors.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! My hubby got it for my birthday since I&#x27;ve benn wanting it for a while... When I received nothing was damaged or broken. The colors are wonderful and very well pigmented, they can easily be blended and last for a long while, just make sure to wear some eye primer or concealer to make your color/s last longer and pop better!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors. The have a cream to powder feel to them and a little goes a long way. The actual size of each is very small but you can always purchase the individual pots if you adore the colors that much. Great price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Bright beautiful colours. Bought it as a gift.  I live in the Caribbean and shipped this to my sky box in Miami then to Trinidad.  I must say that the product was well packaged and shipped excellently.  Absolutely no broken pieces!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented ... I love it üòÄ</li>
            <li> is good but it seems bigger in the picture</li>
            <li> I love the colors. And they go on great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this palette for a couple weeks now. For the price it&#x27;s great! However be careful as some of the colors are very more pigmented and brighter than others. The warms (reds, oranges &amp; yellows) are bold on first stroke. Not so much for the purples and blues but regardless put the shadow on wet and be prepared for a bold difference. They may take a little more TLC but for the effect for the price it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> First off I LOVE the colors, they&#x27;re perfect. The pigmentation of the eye shadow is very bright. I can do costume and everyday makeup very easily with this beautiful pallette. The pots are dime sized but honestly Its perfect for the price .Someone stated they didn&#x27;t receive an actual coastal scents palette, for me that was not the case it was genuine.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are amazing! They last throughout the day which comes in handy. Love them!</li>
            <li> I AM in love with my eye shadows nothing was broken the packaging was very well handled I love how there are so many different colors from shimmer to neutral and smokey its super easy to fit in anything they fit nice n snug I travel a lot to visit family n this will not take up much space for a first time buyer you will probably say what tha??? These eye shadow holes are really small but trust me don&#x27;t need much a little goes a long way I tried some on as soon as I got it lasted me hours didn&#x27;t get any flakes on my face while applying the shadow and even better none of it smeared any where its nicely pigmented was well worth the cost will reorder when the time comes :)</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described, and a great price and great product, what more could you ask for? I would definitely recommend! COLORS ARE GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I baught this for mysef. when I used it the palet the shadows were irritating my eyes. I guess im allergic to them. Had to give it to  my 18 yr old daughter. Shes in love with it,uses it everday!</li>
            <li> Really good for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> As a Shany enthusiast, I have to say I freaking love this palette! It is great, vibrant colors and so many I haven&#x27;t even made it off the first section yet, and theres three! I absolutely love love love this eyeshadow. The colors go on smoothly, and are very vibrant when on. Go Shany!</li>
            <li> 29.99 for 252 Amazing eye shadows I am in love with this palette . Worth it and work better with primer</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing and well worth the purchase! I&#x27;m in love! My palette came in perfect condition (well the black was broken but that&#x27;s okay because I have lots of black shadows). The colors are vibrant and beautiful!!</li>
            <li> So I received my palette on the 25th, as estimated, and when I opened the package everything was perfect. No busted eyeshadows or anything. I was pleased about that because I&#x27;ve read that some were broken in transit. But nothing like that happened for me. When I first used my palette I was very pleased with how pigmented the colors were and how I had to use very very little of the color for it to show up enough on my eyes. I love that there is so many colors to play around with also, this palette was a great buy especially for how many pretty colors you get. The colors also blend really well so it makes it easier for your look to become seamless. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the palette is the way the eyeshadow is stored. Those plastic sheets you have to use to protect your eyeshadow form getting damaged is silly. They should have just given you a plastic tray cover to fit over each individual palette. Not really a big deal though. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this, it will be very useful for years to come.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for special occasions, messing around, costumes, and everyday wear!</li>
