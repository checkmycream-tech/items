            <li>It looks great and has great features.  </li>
            <li>This flatiron is LOVE!!</li>
            <li>so the straightener was very effective.</li>
            <li>Back-lit displays are not a requirement for me but a very nice to have.  </li>
            <li>and I find the 1 1/2 plate size very nice and have no issues with the size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The swivel cord is a very nice feature that helps keep the cord from twisting and tangling during use.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job with your hair as well.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not something I think I&#x27;ll attempt more than a couple of times a year, but it does a great job</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>I love this one!</li>
            <li>This straightener is a top of the line salon quality straightener!</li>
            <li>The Frieda straightner is well made and attractive but it just lacks some of the advanced features and does not offer any performance advantages to justify its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^</li>
            <li>The variable heat control is a nice feature and the instructions give guidelines on where to place the temperature for your hair type.</li>
            <li>, my hair is wavy and has a mind of its own</li>
            <li>The bonus comb is a nice comb.</li>
            <li>The plates are advertised as &#x27;titanium ceramic coated,&amp;#34; and they do a nice job of ironing out the wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With adjustable heat settings and a nice design, this works quite well.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice plastic click that you can lock your cord in place, so make sure you do not cut it off when you are unraveling the cord as it is reusable and stays clipped to the end of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may be of interest to some people; I liked that it was easy to use in sectioning off</li>
            <li>your hair is incredibly fine, I might get something else, otherwise, this is a perfectly nice straightener.</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity of the on/off button and the +/-</li>
            <li>Plants should be more rounded on the edges for easier curling, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter and she love the way it works.</li>
            <li>but it turned out that it did not perform any better than some of the lower costs straightners she has used.  </li>
            <li>The overall look and feel of this flatiron is very beautiful and stylish.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have the option.</li>
            <li>I think it is because the straightener can be heated beyond the smoke point for most oils used in styling products.  </li>
            <li>I think most people would be pleased with the results - I am, despite the snags.  </li>
            <li>I think most people would be pleased with the results - I am, despite the snags.  </li>
            <li>so it works faster than with most flattening irons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very straightforward to operate: an on/off switch, and a plus (to increase heat) and</li>
            <li>Variable heat control, so no messing around and very good idea where to set it for personal hair</li>
            <li>John Freida products have served me well and are one of the most affordable brands available.</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t have as many ions or the fancy heat setting, it just holds my super fine hair better than this one.</li>
            <li>If you use this at a lower temperature setting, and clean it between uses, you should be able to use oil-based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice feature is that the straightener doesn&#x27;t get so hot you can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li>A ready light would have been a nice feature so the user would know when the desired temperature had been met.</li>
            <li>It eliminates any fizziness and bumps with one smooth glide over my hair.</li>
            <li>The smooth, sleek finish on the straightener seems to presage how your hair will look.</li>
            <li>u will enjoy it.......</li>
            <li>I do get smooth finish on my hair</li>
            <li>It has several temperature settings and comes with a really nice comb which helps--it&#x27;s nicely sized and has a pointed tip for separating strands to straighten.</li>
            <li>The 1.5 inch plates are very nice for all but short length hair.  </li>
            <li>Great flat iron--especially for the price.</li>
            <li>this heats up quickly, has adjustable heat settings depending on your hair texture, and that it is lightweight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>She was excited to try the John Frieda hair straightner</li>
            <li>Very high temperatures, much better than others in the price bracket</li>
            <li>When I selected this straightener, I didn&#x27;t realize it matches my [[ASIN:B004YZMKKU John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer]].  </li>
            <li>Good heavens, suddenly my bathroom looks like a salon!  </li>
            <li>gets hot very fast, makes my hair sleek and shiny :)</li>
            <li>Super sleek looking and a bit heavier</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>It makes quick work of styling.ner is a Conair product with the John Frieda label.  </li>
            <li>It makes quick work of styling.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this flat iron.</li>
            <li>The sliding action is very smooth and I do not have ANY hair pulling.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and wavy hair, and this straightener works great!</li>
            <li>This iron is very lightweight and the plates are extremely smooth,  minimizing arm fatigue.</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ve said, I own several straightening tools that don&#x27;t have a swivel cord.  </li>
            <li>My tried and true hair styling product for years has been my John Freida hot blow drying brush.</li>
            <li>This straightener offers many heat settings, which are displayed in degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li>only thing I would say that might be improved upon is the fact that the power and + / - temperature setting buttons are easy to push while in use, so it can be easy to accidentally bump them.  </li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>the controls are right where you would put your thumb.</li>
            <li>The plates are a good size and there is no pull as I bring it down through my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I could never find a straightener that could  get my hair super straight till I bought this product .</li>
            <li>Such an Amazing Flat Iron/Straightener -Thanks to Seller! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Some others do not get hot enough to do a proper job and this one works great.</li>
            <li>The item arrived in an appropriate sized box with no waste and it was easy to open, no molded plastic to cut through.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find a good flat iron like my old maxiglide</li>
            <li>Heating time was minimal and there is an auto shut off after 60 minutes if you forget to turn it off (nice safety feature).</li>
            <li>THANKS JOHN FRIEDA!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Heats up very quickly, much better than others in the same range</li>
            <li>This John Frieda straightener did that, but it took more work, as I had to work in smaller sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I know plenty of other women who would love this as well!</li>
            <li>It is safe, because it will not got worm from the outside.</li>
            <li>Though they aren&#x27;t exact, I prefer this display over the notched displays often found on multi-temperature styling tools.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does heat up fast!  </li>
            <li>The actual surface area of the straightening plates is nice... not too small, so you can style your hair more quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For a first time user, it&#x27;s also simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Positive Points:</li>
            <li>This is my first hair straightener - though I&#x27;ve been in the market for one for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that tends to frizz a bit, and was looking for that sleek straight hair</li>
            <li>The heat plates are a good size… not too big… not too small.  </li>
            <li>I honestly like the sleek look and the fact that I can place it in my over night bag and it not take up as much room as my previous straighteners have.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, it claims 10 seconds and it&#x27;s ready to go before I am.</li>
            <li>but I might be expecting too much from at-home straightening.</li>
            <li>And the comb is really sturdy not flimsy Like the others.</li>
            <li>and it gets very frizzy</li>
            <li>and I appreciated all the heat settings it has.</li>
            <li>I might be in the minority here, but I really like my $15 (from Walmart)</li>
            <li>have it still straight after an hour.</li>
            <li>Nothing that really sets it apart from the crowd&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I should just be more careful.  </li>
            <li>My hair is already straight, and admittedly, I&#x27;m in a hurry to give it a finished look on shampoo mornings.  </li>
            <li>(so maybe it really is me).  </li>
            <li>It is very functional, but it is not a finishing comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is really something to be said for ionic straighteners.  </li>
            <li>With multiple heat settings, I can get this straightener super hot</li>
            <li>My wife and sisters have tried many other products.</li>
            <li>This flat iron leaves your hair smooth and sleek.  </li>
            <li>half the price of this one and love them just as much.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I was happy to see how simply packed this product actually is.  </li>
            <li>Revlon straightener a little better.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair this natural shine !!</li>
            <li>My previous straightener was basic in comparison and the result is very different with this very nice straightener.  </li>
            <li>I can get my hair straight, soft and shiny in one swipe.</li>
            <li>I have A LOT of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine and requires a tight hold to actually go from messy/wavy to sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>and I live in the tropics</li>
            <li>but you should live</li>
            <li>Digital display shows when on, and shows when it is hot</li>
            <li>Wow I mean this flat iron is so good.</li>
            <li>No waste.  </li>
            <li>If you try to take too much hair through at a time, it will catch your hair, but when done properly with smaller sections, this isn&#x27;t really an issue.</li>
            <li>The plates meet well, and so far, I&#x27;ve had no issues with the cord</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>For this reason it makes it difficult to quickly fly through flat ironing my hair when I am in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth between rating this flat irona 2 or 3 and settled on the 3 because overall I feel it is an OK flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest design flaw for me</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s due more to the design of the straightener then to me, as I&#x27;m pretty clumsy.</li>
            <li>I really like the extra long swivel cord, and push button on/off switch.</li>
            <li>My hair gets caught on the plates often and it has pulled my hair out if I am not careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the titanium coated plates - but hair comes out super smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Remington has both back-lit and has a large display which I am now a little spoiled and look for the same features in new irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair, and the sleek silver makes it look fancy.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is really pretty, and it is with a heavy heart I give it four stars because it tends to snag my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used super cheap flat irons and very expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but it pulls my hair a little too much.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The sliding action is very smooth and I do not have ANY hair pulling.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair, and this straightener works great!</li>
            <li> This iron is very lightweight and the plates are extremely smooth,  minimizing arm fatigue.</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve said, I own several straightening tools that don&#x27;t have a swivel cord.  </li>
            <li> My tried and true hair styling product for years has been my John Freida hot blow drying brush.</li>
            <li> This straightener offers many heat settings, which are displayed in degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li> only thing I would say that might be improved upon is the fact that the power and + / - temperature setting buttons are easy to push while in use, so it can be easy to accidentally bump them.  </li>
            <li> Just right.  </li>
            <li> the controls are right where you would put your thumb.</li>
            <li> The plates are a good size and there is no pull as I bring it down through my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I could never find a straightener that could  get my hair super straight till I bought this product .</li>
            <li> Such an Amazing Flat Iron/Straightener -Thanks to Seller! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Some others do not get hot enough to do a proper job and this one works great.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in an appropriate sized box with no waste and it was easy to open, no molded plastic to cut through.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find a good flat iron like my old maxiglide</li>
            <li> Heating time was minimal and there is an auto shut off after 60 minutes if you forget to turn it off (nice safety feature).</li>
            <li> THANKS JOHN FRIEDA!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Heats up very quickly, much better than others in the same range</li>
            <li> This John Frieda straightener did that, but it took more work, as I had to work in smaller sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know plenty of other women who would love this as well!</li>
            <li> It is safe, because it will not got worm from the outside.</li>
            <li> Though they aren&#x27;t exact, I prefer this display over the notched displays often found on multi-temperature styling tools.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does heat up fast!  </li>
            <li> The actual surface area of the straightening plates is nice... not too small, so you can style your hair more quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For a first time user, it&#x27;s also simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Positive Points:</li>
            <li> This is my first hair straightener - though I&#x27;ve been in the market for one for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that tends to frizz a bit, and was looking for that sleek straight hair</li>
            <li> The heat plates are a good size… not too big… not too small.  </li>
            <li> I honestly like the sleek look and the fact that I can place it in my over night bag and it not take up as much room as my previous straighteners have.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, it claims 10 seconds and it&#x27;s ready to go before I am.</li>
            <li> but I might be expecting too much from at-home straightening.</li>
            <li> And the comb is really sturdy not flimsy Like the others.</li>
            <li> and it gets very frizzy</li>
            <li> and I appreciated all the heat settings it has.</li>
            <li> I might be in the minority here, but I really like my $15 (from Walmart)</li>
            <li> have it still straight after an hour.</li>
            <li> Nothing that really sets it apart from the crowd&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I should just be more careful.  </li>
            <li> My hair is already straight, and admittedly, I&#x27;m in a hurry to give it a finished look on shampoo mornings.  </li>
            <li> (so maybe it really is me).  </li>
            <li> It is very functional, but it is not a finishing comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is really something to be said for ionic straighteners.  </li>
            <li> With multiple heat settings, I can get this straightener super hot</li>
            <li> My wife and sisters have tried many other products.</li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves your hair smooth and sleek.  </li>
            <li> half the price of this one and love them just as much.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I was happy to see how simply packed this product actually is.  </li>
            <li> Revlon straightener a little better.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair this natural shine !!</li>
            <li> My previous straightener was basic in comparison and the result is very different with this very nice straightener.  </li>
            <li> I can get my hair straight, soft and shiny in one swipe.</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine and requires a tight hold to actually go from messy/wavy to sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> and I live in the tropics</li>
            <li> but you should live</li>
            <li> Digital display shows when on, and shows when it is hot</li>
            <li> Wow I mean this flat iron is so good.</li>
            <li> No waste.  </li>
            <li> If you try to take too much hair through at a time, it will catch your hair, but when done properly with smaller sections, this isn&#x27;t really an issue.</li>
            <li> The plates meet well, and so far, I&#x27;ve had no issues with the cord</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> For this reason it makes it difficult to quickly fly through flat ironing my hair when I am in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth between rating this flat irona 2 or 3 and settled on the 3 because overall I feel it is an OK flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest design flaw for me</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s due more to the design of the straightener then to me, as I&#x27;m pretty clumsy.</li>
            <li> I really like the extra long swivel cord, and push button on/off switch.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught on the plates often and it has pulled my hair out if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the titanium coated plates - but hair comes out super smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Remington has both back-lit and has a large display which I am now a little spoiled and look for the same features in new irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair, and the sleek silver makes it look fancy.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is really pretty, and it is with a heavy heart I give it four stars because it tends to snag my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used super cheap flat irons and very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but it pulls my hair a little too much.</li>
            <li> I know this has to not be too tight, but I feel it could allow me to press down a little bit more than what I can</li>
            <li> personally is the plates, I don&#x27;t feel I can easily flat iron smoothly enough with this without tugs on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The part you hold is narrow enough for my small hands to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> With my current flat iron,</li>
            <li> On off button is really long, hard to push in the right place to turn on and off</li>
            <li> S8530 Anti Frizz Therapy Straightener, 2 Inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> probably would not recommend this flat iron to a friend because of the plate design.</li>
            <li> so I must blow dry daily and then straighten to avoid frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> With the cheap ones, I always longed for an expensive salon one (but couldn&#x27;t justify the price).</li>
            <li> I looked at  (and had several recommendations of) other flat irons that are twice the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other hair irons, but with as much hair as I have it usually turns into an achy-armed ordeal.</li>
            <li> In addition, it lacks some of the features that some of her other premium hair straightners offer such as steeam, an LCD display, or even adjustable comb brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Does not come with some of the accessories that other straightners come with such as heat resistant mat, case, etc.</li>
            <li> My wife has has very long hair</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t feel like I get a tight enough squeeze when I am shutting the clamps.  </li>
            <li> The readout is small compared to my current flat iron which is the:&lt;br /&gt;Remington</li>
            <li> The heat control can be accidently pushed as you are straightening as it is on the narrow part of the handle, this is the only feature that I think can use some improvement</li>
            <li> This flat doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as I thought it would, especially for thick hair.</li>
            <li> then other straighteners I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> other straighteners</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad heavier than other straighteners I&#x27;ve tried, but nothing that should cause any arm issues.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this straightener, but it does pull hair out :(</li>
            <li> It also cuts itself off when it has reached the desired temperature so as to not over heat or cause other problems.</li>
            <li> a minus to tone it down.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the straightener for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cut down my hair prep time in half.</li>
            <li> rat tail comb has no special properties, except that it matches the straightener.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair</li>
            <li> so I have humidity year round</li>
            <li> and you could actually stick something ultra thin under them.  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the price point as I&#x27;ve owned (and still do)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The item arrived in an appropriate sized box with no waste and it was easy to open, no molded plastic to cut through.  The instructions are in Spanish and English to assist with the simple operation of the straightener.  To turn on just press the on/off button for a second or two.  The variable heat control is a nice feature and the instructions give guidelines on where to place the temperature for your hair type. A ready light would have been a nice feature so the user would know when the desired temperature had been met. I have a short bob and I live in the tropics so I have humidity year round, my hair is wavy and has a mind of its own so I must blow dry daily and then straighten to avoid frizzy hair.  My previous straightener was basic in comparison and the result is very different with this very nice straightener.  The plates are a good size and there is no pull as I bring it down through my hair.  The part you hold is narrow enough for my small hands to be comfortable.  Heating time was minimal and there is an auto shut off after 60 minutes if you forget to turn it off (nice safety feature). The heat control can be accidently pushed as you are straightening as it is on the narrow part of the handle, this is the only feature that I think can use some improvement but it would not stop me from purchasing this product. My hair did not get frizzy or wavy so the straightener was very effective. The bonus comb is a nice comb. Update: Item stopped working June, 2015</li>
            <li> Super sleek looking and a bit heavier then other straighteners I&#x27;ve used before.  Love the simplicity of the on/off button and the +/- for the heat control.  Fancy yet simple.  Bonus comb is just that.  Bonus.  Not thrilled with the price point as I&#x27;ve owned (and still do) other straighteners half the price of this one and love them just as much.  On the other hand, I was happy to see how simply packed this product actually is.  No plastic to cut through - just a simple box the size of the straightener.  No waste.  No hassle.  Like I&#x27;ve said, I own several straightening tools that don&#x27;t have a swivel cord.  Don&#x27;t fool yourself… you have to have a swivel cord to eliminate the hassles of tangling cords.  This has the swivel cord so I&#x27;ll grab this one over the others any day!  The heat plates are a good size… not too big… not too small.  Just right.  Heats up fast.  Another bonus!!!!</li>
            <li> My tried and true hair styling product for years has been my John Freida hot blow drying brush. John Freida products have served me well and are one of the most affordable brands available. I am very pleased with the performance of this flat iron. It left my hair smooth and sleek. It eliminates any fizziness and bumps with one smooth glide over my hair. It heats up fast, it claims 10 seconds and it&#x27;s ready to go before I am. It feels solid yet lightweight  in my hand. It worked just as well as my daughters $100+ CHI iron. I really like the extra long swivel cord, and push button on/off switch. It has a digital display that adjusts the temperature. I&#x27;ll add pics to the photos section.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally liking the John Frieda straightener, another product from Conair (which seems to make every straightener in the world, no matter whose name is on it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s attractive. The smooth, sleek finish on the straightener seems to presage how your hair will look. It&#x27;s a tad heavier than other straighteners I&#x27;ve tried, but nothing that should cause any arm issues. The plates are advertised as &#x27;titanium ceramic coated,&amp;#34; and they do a nice job of ironing out the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that the straightener doesn&#x27;t get so hot you can&#x27;t handle it. It&#x27;s very straightforward to operate: an on/off switch, and a plus (to increase heat) and a minus to tone it down. Heats up quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rat tail comb has no special properties, except that it matches the straightener. This may be of interest to some people; I liked that it was easy to use in sectioning off hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lack of cabinet space and your hair appliances are out for the world to see, you couldn&#x27;t get a nicer straightener for aesthetics alone. It does a good job with your hair as well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great straightener. Heats up quickly. If you try to take too much hair through at a time, it will catch your hair, but when done properly with smaller sections, this isn&#x27;t really an issue.</li>
            <li> I like that this heats up quickly, has adjustable heat settings depending on your hair texture, and that it is lightweight and easy to hold. It does the job but doesn&#x27;t quite get my hair into that glossy look but I might be expecting too much from at-home straightening. I also tried using this as a curling iron as I know that some people use straighteners for that. When doing that it did leave dents in my hair, so I will just stick to straightening.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron--especially for the price. It has several temperature settings and comes with a really nice comb which helps--it&#x27;s nicely sized and has a pointed tip for separating strands to straighten. I looked at  (and had several recommendations of) other flat irons that are twice the price. It is also great for putting curls into hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes doesn&#x27;t heat well to straighten the hair.</li>
            <li> Wow I mean this flat iron is so good. I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find a good flat iron like my old maxiglide but I guess I did. This iron straighten my hair with just two passes,  and one pass to make my hair curly/wavy. And the comb is really sturdy not flimsy Like the others. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  THANKS JOHN FRIEDA!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair, and this straightener works great! I can get my hair straight, soft and shiny in one swipe. It&#x27;s cut down my hair prep time in half. I love this one!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this straightener, but it does pull hair out :(</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener!!! gets hot very fast, makes my hair sleek and shiny :) I have very long thick hair and it gets very frizzy and I could never find a straightener that could  get my hair super straight till I bought this product . There is some pulling and tugging but you should live it&#x27;s not that bad .&lt;br /&gt;Jess &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This flat doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as I thought it would, especially for thick hair.</li>
            <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;the best this products leaves ur hair with a beautiful shine u will enjoy it.......i wouldnt use anything else</li>
            <li> With adjustable heat settings and a nice design, this works quite well. I&#x27;ve used super cheap flat irons and very expensive ones. With the cheap ones, I always longed for an expensive salon one (but couldn&#x27;t justify the price). Since I bought this, I no longer wish I had a salon quality one. This one works great and was about a quarter of the cost! Yay for a good deal!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very very good straightener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very high temperatures, much better than others in the price bracket&lt;br /&gt;- Digital display shows when on, and shows when it is hot&lt;br /&gt;- Variable heat control, so no messing around and very good idea where to set it for personal hair conditions.&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up very quickly, much better than others in the same range&lt;br /&gt;- Works almost as well at straightening as Chi straighteners for a fraction of the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- On off button is really long, hard to push in the right place to turn on and off&lt;br /&gt;- Plants should be more rounded on the edges for easier curling, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this straightener at all... it did the job and I appreciated all the heat settings it has. I might be in the minority here, but I really like my $15 (from Walmart) Revlon straightener a little better. Though it doesn&#x27;t have as many ions or the fancy heat setting, it just holds my super fine hair better than this one. I have A LOT of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine and requires a tight hold to actually go from messy/wavy to sleek and straight. This John Frieda straightener did that, but it took more work, as I had to work in smaller sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is incredibly fine, I might get something else, otherwise, this is a perfectly nice straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener is a top of the line salon quality straightener! I have used tons of other straighteners that have worked for a little while but later in the day my hair would get to curly or frizzed out I would be disappointed by my results! I have naturally thick and curly hair so I am constantly looking for a straightener that can hold up to my hair&#x27;s thickness and especially on those rainy days have it still straight after an hour. This straightener does just that and John Frieda is one of the best salon products around. I honestly like the sleek look and the fact that I can place it in my over night bag and it not take up as much room as my previous straighteners have. It also cuts itself off when it has reached the desired temperature so as to not over heat or cause other problems. Hands down this is the straightener for me and I know plenty of other women who would love this as well!</li>
            <li> This flatiron is LOVE!! It gives my hair this natural shine !! All my friends want one now! Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair iron in the market. My wife and sisters have tried many other products. Nothing comes close to this.It is safe, because it will not got worm from the outside.</li>
            <li> This is my first hair straightener - though I&#x27;ve been in the market for one for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that tends to frizz a bit, and was looking for that sleek straight hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This delivers.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the titanium coated plates - but hair comes out super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a first time user, it&#x27;s also simple and easy to use.  On/off switch. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet.  I think that&#x27;s due more to the design of the straightener then to me, as I&#x27;m pretty clumsy.</li>
            <li> You have to get used to how you hold it. the controls are right where you would put your thumb. This was a gift for my daughter and she love the way it works. Some others do not get hot enough to do a proper job and this one works great.</li>
            <li> My wife has has very long hair and she has used several types of hair straightners over the years. She was excited to try the John Frieda hair straightner but it turned out that it did not perform any better than some of the lower costs straightners she has used.  In addition, it lacks some of the features that some of her other premium hair straightners offer such as steeam, an LCD display, or even adjustable comb brushes.  The Frieda straightner is well made and attractive but it just lacks some of the advanced features and does not offer any performance advantages to justify its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^ Positive Points: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great build quality&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive design&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Included comb matches the straightner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Negative Points: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nothing that really sets it apart from the crowd&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive&lt;br /&gt;- Does not come with some of the accessories that other straightners come with such as heat resistant mat, case, etc.</li>
            <li> The overall look and feel of this flatiron is very beautiful and stylish.  There is a digital non-back-lit display. Back-lit displays are not a requirement for me but a very nice to have.  The readout is small compared to my current flat iron which is the:&lt;br /&gt;Remington S8530 Anti Frizz Therapy Straightener, 2 Inch flat iron. The Remington has both back-lit and has a large display which I am now a little spoiled and look for the same features in new irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Controls:&lt;br /&gt;The buttons to change the heat settings and turn the unit on is a thin purple strip.  This strip does not get in the way and I do not have a problem with changing the settings on accident when the system is in use like I have with some curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord:&lt;br /&gt;The cord is longer than my Remington so some people may find this helpful.  It also has a nice plastic click that you can lock your cord in place, so make sure you do not cut it off when you are unraveling the cord as it is reusable and stays clipped to the end of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plates:&lt;br /&gt;I currently have chin length hair and I find the 1 1/2 plate size very nice and have no issues with the size.&lt;br /&gt;I actually do not at all like the actual plates though.  My hair gets caught on the plates often and it has pulled my hair out if I am not careful.The hair seems to get caught at times on the edges of the plates, they are semi raised and you could actually stick something ultra thin under them.  For this reason it makes it difficult to quickly fly through flat ironing my hair when I am in a hurry.  With my current flat iron, the Remington S8530 Anti Frizz I do not have this problem.  The sliding action is very smooth and I do not have ANY hair pulling. I also don&#x27;t feel like I get a tight enough squeeze when I am shutting the clamps.  I know this has to not be too tight, but I feel it could allow me to press down a little bit more than what I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth between rating this flat irona 2 or 3 and settled on the 3 because overall I feel it is an OK flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest design flaw for me personally is the plates, I don&#x27;t feel I can easily flat iron smoothly enough with this without tugs on my hair.  That is the biggest complaint.  I do get smooth finish on my hair so no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would not recommend this flat iron to a friend because of the plate design.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other hair irons, but with as much hair as I have it usually turns into an achy-armed ordeal. This iron is very lightweight and the plates are extremely smooth,  minimizing arm fatigue. It&#x27;s still not something I think I&#x27;ll attempt more than a couple of times a year, but it does a great job and I&#x27;m glad I have the option.</li>
            <li> When I selected this straightener, I didn&#x27;t realize it matches my [[ASIN:B004YZMKKU John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer]].  Good heavens, suddenly my bathroom looks like a salon!  This straightener is really pretty, and it is with a heavy heart I give it four stars because it tends to snag my hair.  A lot of straightening irons will do that, but my [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S8500 Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]] has never snagged it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should just be more careful.  My hair is already straight, and admittedly, I&#x27;m in a hurry to give it a finished look on shampoo mornings.  This straightener offers many heat settings, which are displayed in degrees Fahrenheit.  These temperatures are to be used as guidelines.  I set it to 310 degrees; it might actually heat to 300 or 320.  Though they aren&#x27;t exact, I prefer this display over the notched displays often found on multi-temperature styling tools.  That&#x27;s irrational, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone.  I like the variety of heat settings and the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up fast!  That&#x27;s a plus, even though it&#x27;s only a 15 second time difference from my Remington.  The 1.5 inch plates are very nice for all but short length hair.  And then there&#x27;s the snagging, which occurs just when I flip my wrist (so maybe it really is me).  The plates meet well, and so far, I&#x27;ve had no issues with the cord tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state this iron should not be used with hair products containing oils.  I don&#x27;t think this is a warning to not deep fry hair.  I think it is because the straightener can be heated beyond the smoke point for most oils used in styling products.  If you use this at a lower temperature setting, and clean it between uses, you should be able to use oil-based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a sectioning comb that is like a rat-tailed detangling comb.  It is very functional, but it is not a finishing comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener is a Conair product with the John Frieda label.  Overall, I like it.  It looks great and has great features.  I think most people would be pleased with the results - I am, despite the snags.  It makes quick work of styling.ner is a Conair product with the John Frieda label.  Overall, I like it.  It looks great and has great features.

            <li> This flat iron leaves your hair smooth and sleek.  It does not dry my hair, and the sleek silver makes it look fancy.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Such an Amazing Flat Iron/Straightener -Thanks to Seller! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> There is really something to be said for ionic straighteners.  I have naturally curly hair and when I use this, you&#x27;d never know for a second that my hair has any curl at all.  Some straighteners will leave my hair looking fuzzy, but not so with this.  My hair is totally silky and sleek.  With multiple heat settings, I can get this straightener super hot so it works faster than with most flattening irons.  I don&#x27;t need to run my hair through multiple times.  It just works.  It also heats up very quickly. The swivel cord is a very nice feature that helps keep the cord from twisting and tangling during use.  The actual surface area of the straightening plates is nice... not too small, so you can style your hair more quickly and efficiently.  The overall look and feel of this is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say that might be improved upon is the fact that the power and + / - temperature setting buttons are easy to push while in use, so it can be easy to accidentally bump them.  Not a big deal, you just need to get used to it.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but it pulls my hair a little too much. The buttons are in the way sometimes and I&#x27;ve never used the comb.</li>
