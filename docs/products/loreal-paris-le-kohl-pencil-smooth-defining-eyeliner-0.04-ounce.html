            <li>Like the title says, it&#x27;s extremely easy to use</li>

            <li>Hands down the best eyeliner there it out there.</li>
            <li>I like the liner because it goes on easily and smooth, but that is where lies the issue.</li>
            <li>It is easy to sharpen and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge away during the day.</li>
            <li>It is soft without being too soft and allows for a perfect line to be drawn!</li>
            <li>This is the first pencil eyeliner that&#x27;s gentle on my extremely sensitive eyes and still looks wonderful.</li>
            <li>I can make the little wings in the corner with this pencil, that&#x27;s how amazing it is!!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried dozens of different eyeliners and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>When I opened this product and tried it, I was surprised by how nice the line came out.</li>
            <li>nice smooth dark color and blends easily if you need it to.</li>
            <li>The line this pencil draws is exact!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and never found anything better!</li>
            <li>It is so soft and smooth that it comes off so easily, and starts to leak within 10 minutes of application.</li>
            <li>It creates a soft black color perfect for day time usage.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth and deep black color that is perfect for daily</li>
            <li>It stays on all day too, I rarely have to re-apply this liner.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this eyeliner/pencil meets all the right criteria.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal usually has great products and this one works well.</li>
            <li>Great price for an everyday eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Good, dark color, but</li>
            <li>Thank you very much and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>like a wooden pencil, because I feel I have better control with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first eyeliner I&#x27;ve come across in a while that meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend and will buy more of in the future</li>
            <li>It smudges easily and ends up all over your face if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Give it a nice pat of pressed or loose powder after application, and it stays put really well.</li>
            <li>This pencil has the petrifaction texture to make your makeup look clean and professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy enough to easily spread on your skin, but not too creamy to fall off.</li>
            <li>and I can say that it is very pigmented</li>
            <li>and Im very picky.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>however its color is not as intense as brands like MAC.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never broken either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>When I want a more dramatic look I can apply more so</li>
            <li>If they are soft and easy to apply, the color doesn&#x27;t last and they crumble when you sharpen them.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>A LOT - everything from the cheapest of drug store brands to the highest of high ends.</li>
            <li>But many of them are either too firm or too mushy.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to try something new</li>
            <li>It goes on very soft, never hurting my eye lid.</li>
            <li>(it glides on very smoothly) and comes off very black!</li>
            <li>Le Kohl Pencil Smooth Defining Eyeliner, Carbon Black, 0.04...</li>
            <li>It looks and feels great when you apply it, and for the first few minutes, but when you check in the mirror, it would be running all over your eyes and making you look like you&#x27;ve been crying or like you have dark circles.</li>
            <li>only problem is, after a few sharpens, I feel like the pencil was drying out, and the color was coming out more faded.</li>
            <li>it was still in New Jersey - 7 days later - when I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Le Kohl in Carbon Black is just right.  </li>
            <li>It does sometimes get black on the skin above my eye but one quick swipe over it with my finger</li>

            <li> Le Kohl Pencil Smooth Defining Eyeliner, Carbon Black, 0.04...</li>
            <li> It looks and feels great when you apply it, and for the first few minutes, but when you check in the mirror, it would be running all over your eyes and making you look like you&#x27;ve been crying or like you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> only problem is, after a few sharpens, I feel like the pencil was drying out, and the color was coming out more faded.</li>
            <li> it was still in New Jersey - 7 days later - when I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Le Kohl in Carbon Black is just right.  </li>
            <li> It does sometimes get black on the skin above my eye but one quick swipe over it with my finger</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new pigmented, black, eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li> I it didn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping it would.  </li>
            <li> the only thing about it, sometimes it does clump up on the inner corner of my eye, but other than that..</li>
            <li> If the color lasts, it&#x27;s because the pencil is too hard you don&#x27;t get much color.  </li>
            <li> It lasted me a long time so</li>
            <li> It lasts an insanely long time</li>
            <li> But only when sharpened properly otherwise it will be a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blendable, but it doesn&#x27;t turn into a smudgy mess the second you touch it with a sponge.  </li>
            <li> The product came as expected.</li>
            <li> I truly fell inlove with the product it does last a few hours</li>
            <li> This eyeliner lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as other eyeliners do.</li>
            <li> I had to press a little harder to get the effect I wanted.</li>
            <li> People shouldnt be treated this way when they are chosing to spend their hard earned money with your company above others.</li>
            <li> Simply because of how they handled this and how rude the email was</li>
            <li> I use the black one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fixated on this one for a reason, and I&#x27;ve been using black eyeliner for 25 years, and using this for 2 years.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried it in the twenty odd years I&#x27;ve been wearing it.  </li>
            <li> When I used the eyeliner I was truly amazed at how black it came off on the eye.</li>
            <li> (I use primer and sweep a little eye shadow over it as a seal.)  </li>
            <li> I used to order this about once a week and its not a cheap eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Very black and it  stays all day!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a pencil eyeliner like this in the stores anywhere.  Glad to have found it here. This one works well.</li>
            <li> I was given this eye liner by a close friend years ago. It lasted me a long time so when I went to go buy my next one I could find it anywhere. I am glad that I was able to find it online here. I haven&#x27;t found another eyeliner that comes even close to this one. It&#x27;s a must for me. Delivery was fast and the eye liner is AMAZING! It goes on very soft, never hurting my eye lid. It does sometimes get black on the skin above my eye but one quick swipe over it with my finger and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Ugh! Very bad purchase/ product. I like the liner because it goes on easily and smooth, but that is where lies the issue. It is so soft and smooth that it comes off so easily, and starts to leak within 10 minutes of application. It sucks! It looks and feels great when you apply it, and for the first few minutes, but when you check in the mirror, it would be running all over your eyes and making you look like you&#x27;ve been crying or like you have dark circles. Very bad product.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best eyeliner there it out there. Been using this for 6 years already starting buying it on here because the drug stores no longer sell it neither does wal-mart....</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and PERFECT IN EVERY WAY</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Le Kohl Pencil Smooth Defining Eyeliner, Carbon Black, 0.04... After reading a lot of good reviews about this Kohl pencil, I decided to buy it and I can say that it is very pigmented, I love it and will continue repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The line this pencil draws is exact! Perfect for letting you smudge it if you like or a perfect line if you prefer. Great quality and great value</li>
            <li> You can draw a fine line easily. It&#x27;s creamy enough to easily spread on your skin, but not too creamy to fall off.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected.</li>
            <li> The product is great, best eyeliner I&#x27;ve had and Im very picky. The shipping speed was supposed to take 3-5 days though and I know they take a day to process, but its been 8 days and still no product.I ordered on a Wedesday and the tracking shows they didnt ship until Friday and yesterday it was still in New Jersey - 7 days later - when I live in Arizona. When I asked the seller (beautyseller) about this they said I should have chosen a faster shipping speed if I wanted it sooner. What?!?! Are you kidding?? If I would have gotten it in 3-5 days like it said, I would have been happy. We are going on 9 days now though. They also told me I should actually check my tracking info so I can see they shipped it a day later. Umm...I did! That&#x27;s how I know they DID NOT ship it a day later. It&#x27;s called common sense and I expect at least some level of customer service when buying a product from anyone - anywhere. Simply because of how they handled this and how rude the email was I will NEVER order from this seller again and I will let others know as well. People shouldnt be treated this way when they are chosing to spend their hard earned money with your company above others. I used to order this about once a week and its not a cheap eyeliner. Be thankful you are in business in this economy!</li>
            <li> love love love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and don&#x27;t run even when you sweat. Makes a really defined line, awesome! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good, dark color, but I it didn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping it would.  Left smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> OMG! Great alternative to my MAC liner. I would purchase again. I love it because it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smear like MAC.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever! I am a contact wearer and this product does not adversely affect by lenses. I absolutely love this product! Should be brought back from retirement! I am stocking up online!</li>
            <li> I liked the color. The color does stay, removes with eyemakeup remover easily. however its color is not as intense as brands like MAC.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner! I use the black one. I hated when I suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it in stores! I&#x27;m glad that Amazon is selling it. Though I hate paying this amount for the pencil and shipping. But, it&#x27;s the only eyeliner that I found that works on my water line since my eyes water often through-out the day. It doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you literally run your fingers across it. It stays on all day too, I rarely have to re-apply this liner. I love this! I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and never found anything better!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I got a great price on this and love the product. L&#x27;oreal usually has great products and this one works well. Thank you very much and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it&#x27;s extremely easy to use (it glides on very smoothly) and comes off very black! This is the first pencil eyeliner that&#x27;s gentle on my extremely sensitive eyes and still looks wonderful. It&#x27;s super easy to fix if you&#x27;ve make mistakes, is amazing for wings, and stays on forever! LOVE! Buying again! And In multiple colors!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried dozens of different eyeliners and this one is by far the best. It lasts an insanely long time and I only have to sharpen it after using it about 10 times. It&#x27;s never broken either. Great value!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my baby eyeliner and I urge you girls NOT to buy it, so there&#x27;s more for ME.....I&#x27;m fixated on this one for a reason, and I&#x27;ve been using black eyeliner for 25 years, and using this for 2 years. Some of Revlon are the closest, the rest are crappola.....</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyeliner!! It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge away during the day. I can make the little wings in the corner with this pencil, that&#x27;s how amazing it is!! I was disappointed when they stopped selling it in stores and I could never find a brand that worked so well. When I found this I was soooo happy!! You cannot go wrong with this eyeliner!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about eyeliners.  If they are soft and easy to apply, the color doesn&#x27;t last and they crumble when you sharpen them.  If the color lasts, it&#x27;s because the pencil is too hard you don&#x27;t get much color.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this eyeliner/pencil meets all the right criteria.  The consistency is perfect, it sharpens well, and it LASTS. (I use primer and sweep a little eye shadow over it as a seal.)  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eyeliner pencil that I can use on the waterline of my eyes without any irritation. It creates a soft black color perfect for day time usage. When I want a more dramatic look I can apply more so there is a good amount of versatility with this pencil. Love the color.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazig!!! It glides on beautifully and looks awesome! It is soft without being too soft and allows for a perfect line to be drawn!</li>
            <li> the only thing about it, sometimes it does clump up on the inner corner of my eye, but other than that..it&#x27;s one of the better eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried (and for the price it&#x27;s great). i&#x27;m looking for one that doesn&#x27;t do that throughout the day. ladies you know what i&#x27;m talking about! comment with any suggestions!</li>
            <li> Great experience.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> She adores this eyeliner and we have tried many many brands.  I have purchased ones that cost 30$ and up but none compare to the staying power of this eyeliner.  It holds up in the bahamas swimming in the ocean and at pool parties in the yard.  Great product. nice smooth dark color and blends easily if you need it to.</li>
            <li> Looking for a great eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> When I opened this product and tried it, I was surprised by how nice the line came out. Nice smooth and deep black color that is perfect for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, after a few sharpens, I feel like the pencil was drying out, and the color was coming out more faded. I had to press a little harder to get the effect I wanted. I don&#x27;t know if this is because of how I store my products/my sharpener, or if that is a problem with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I found nothing wrong with the pencil. Great price for an everyday eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eyeliner.  A LOT - everything from the cheapest of drug store brands to the highest of high ends. I&#x27;ve used pencils you sharpen, &amp;#34;pencils&amp;#34; that roll out, brush on liquid, eyeliner &amp;#34;markers,&amp;#34; powders, and even one weird gel.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it in the twenty odd years I&#x27;ve been wearing it.  This is by far my favorite.  And I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a wooden pencil, because I feel I have better control with it.  But many of them are either too firm or too mushy.  And there is NOTHING that ticks me off more than a mushy eyeliner.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Le Kohl in Carbon Black is just right.  It&#x27;s blendable, but it doesn&#x27;t turn into a smudgy mess the second you touch it with a sponge.  Give it a nice pat of pressed or loose powder after application, and it stays put really well. You don&#x27;t have to constantly sharpen it, so it lasts a while.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first eyeliner I&#x27;ve come across in a while that meets my needs.  I hope Amazon and Amazon sellers continue to carry it!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as other eyeliners do. It is easy to sharpen and goes on smoothly. I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I have purchased, well pigmented, stays on all day and applies smoothly. I  plan to continue buying this products</li>
            <li> Very smooth and 10x better than the rest I&#x27;ve had, for beginners this will give extremely good results, and being pencil it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot. It is very smooth, even taking into account that it is a pencil and not liquid. Great choice for pencil eyeliners!</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t drip. This pencil has the petrifaction texture to make your makeup look clean and professional. But only when sharpened properly otherwise it will be a mess.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new pigmented, black, eyeliner pencil. I read some reviews online and decided to try this one. I absolutely love it. I wish the actual pencil was longer for the price, but the quality is awesome.</li>
            <li> I did not hesitate to buy this product as L&#x27;Or√©al always has good products but this one is not one of their better products. It smudges easily and ends up all over your face if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I usually used eyeliners from victoria secret but I decided to try something new so I purchased two of these eyeliners. To start off with shipping was alright the eyeliners arrived on time and in good condition. When I used the eyeliner I was truly amazed at how black it came off on the eye. I truly fell inlove with the product it does last a few hours and you have to retouch it here and there but truly amazing. I would recommend and will buy more of in the future</li>
            <li> I have been looking forever for a great eyeliner that really shows up. This one is the best of all I have tried. I love it!</li>
            <li> Very black and it  stays all day! love it!</li>
            <li> Not the best because it does smudge, but it last longer than a lot of others that I tried.It also doesn&#x27;t come off at once it continues to smear a day later which is hard to deal with.</li>
