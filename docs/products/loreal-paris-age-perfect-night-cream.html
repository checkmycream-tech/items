            <li>and I just love it!!  </li>
            <li>Just purchased L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day 2.5 oz, but cannot wear it because of the perfume, which smells like insecticide, and the smell stays with you for many hours.</li>

            <li>Great results at a good price.</li>
            <li>well I still have a face, so thats a good sign.</li>
            <li>smells good,</li>
            <li>I personly think is a good product.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a good price on  this, too.</li>
            <li>But it feels so good.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN FEELS GOOD  AND</li>
            <li>Good offer at a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good night cream for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, however the age spots have not changed.</li>
            <li>I have a fair to medium complexion, with some signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>I do use and am on auto ship for Loreal Revitalift, another good product with out the overbearing perfume.</li>
            <li>Good experience</li>
            <li>I just purchased this cream and I am very pleased with how it feels when applied.  </li>
            <li>I do exfoliate and do all that good stuff and honestly, I do get compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The smell is not that great and is kind of too strong for me at times.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy with the quick results!  </li>
            <li>B. Rose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being perfectly honest.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>I have been using this every night, it is an effective night cream to help reduce lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>It is nourishing, just not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The jar was in it&#x27;s own box made by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a night cream I liked as well</li>
            <li>Great success....!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and think it is a great product &amp; moisturizer - perfect for dry skin but never oily -</li>
            <li>This fragrance  of this cream is very strong.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so soft and smells very good!</li>
            <li>In 20 words or more I can honestly say without prejudice that I expect to continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream is that the cream itself is a great consistency and nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this original one on Amazon and will be buying more soon - have enjoyed it for years now</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my forties), but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It worked so much better than Revitalift to plump up and hide wrinkles on my 60 plus skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will want me to order this again when she runs out.</li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>Need a week or two more.</li>
            <li>return makes me pay more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did bought it.</li>
            <li>It is not oily as i already have skin on the more oily side.  </li>
            <li>Although I still look 58, I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>Seems to absorb into my skin so by lunchtime I need to reapply more of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about</li>
            <li>Love how my nighttime skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a realist who understands that one cannot undo many years of sun exposure, stress and age with a cream or potion.</li>
            <li>I really love this face cream.</li>
            <li>,my daughter and I used it every night , we both love this night cream.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal is my favorite go to company for face cream and hair color.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cream and the consistency.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>using LOreal skin creams for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>The cream is supposed to be a bit more oily.  </li>
            <li>I love ALL L&#x27;Oreal Paris face cream products.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for years &amp; love the feel. . .use</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it too. .</li>
            <li>I love the creamy texture of this cream, but I keep forgeting to use it</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>love this cream,I have used it for many years, It&#x60;s delicious,my face,feels,smooth and yet moistured.</li>
            <li>I do believe my skin to be better hydrated in the morning than when iI didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works well as a night cream, but not so sure about an anti-aging element.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this cream after reading MANY of the reviews and doing lots of research myself.  </li>
            <li>To most, it&#x27;s not even noticeable</li>
            <li>it seems, a more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; type cream for my now drier skin.  </li>
            <li>For me, and that&#x27;s just my preference, mind you, I would love this cream just a tad more --- dare I say it... &amp;#34;greasy!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Well... maybe &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; would be a better choice of words :-)  </li>
            <li>Feels so good on face - and it smells lovely, too - light, airy fragrance and smooth and soothing to apply day or night....</li>
            <li>I have used this product  and this product from Amazon was ok.</li>
            <li>After wearing it on my hands and  after 4 washings, the smell was still there - so in the trash it goes, too many fumes even for  my hands.</li>
            <li>This product has an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite night ceam</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>And the kids love this too on their face.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Glides</li>
            <li>Well for a cream you don&#x27;t notice is there while you&#x27;re sleeping, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>My wife says it is just okay, but each person must decide for themselves.</li>
            <li>It goes on more like a serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for almost 2 weeks and my face is already smoother and more radiant looking than before.</li>
            <li>&amp; I get many compliments on the improvement since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and viscosity of product is just right which allows easy application.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and cool and like the smell.</li>
            <li>This cream for the elder women who want to look young and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I find this a great cream to use, its light but very nourishing.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizing anti-aging night cream, firming, absorbs fast, light scent</li>
            <li>and my skin is very sensitive, so this was a great find for me.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>This cream is very clean and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I find it very cool on my skin.  </li>
            <li>While it does provide great hydration, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as what I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I was using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift but bought Age Perfect on sale (more product for less money to try it).</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Very confortable and happy with this relaxing fresh product.</li>
            <li>Also I do not like flavor too strong.</li>
            <li>and it is still so strong it makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, nothing special.</li>
            <li>and I am lucky to have pretty good skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, it moisturizes all night, smells fine, spreads fine, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and doesn&#x27;t stain the pillowcase.  </li>
            <li>I like L&#x27;Oreal products, but my skin began to show fine wrinkles after just a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells, but I find the scent pleasant and nonirritating.</li>
            <li>So far the night cream has been pleasant and I await the result.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff and feels very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, I see improvements in my skin looks smoother and firmer, fragrance leaves a rich, non-greasy, easy to spread.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 weeks and it takes bright light to even find my age spots now!</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and fresh and it makes my skin feel hydrated and silky, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>And such a great price.</li>
            <li>I wish it was unscented or just lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Night cream is very luxurious and so nice to apply before going to bed.</li>
            <li>but it was cheap and you have to put SOMETHING on your face at night,  don&#x27;t you,..</li>
            <li>I used it as a hand cream for a few hours and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you want fragrance free product.</li>
            <li>I am still using this product so far so good... BB</li>
            <li>i am 76 years old and still looking good.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and smells is clean and light.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have noticed I need a more intense moisturizer to keep my skin bright.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I have only been using this cream for about 4 days now, so maybe It needs more time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I now have essentially a full opened jar I don&#x27;t know what to do with.</li>
            <li>I will be using it more during the fall because I won&#x27;t sweat soo much</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; it helps me tremendously with skin issues (very dry).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to receive one of my favorite facial products in the mail with other necessities of my life.</li>
            <li>It is so light and goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I do use their Revitalift series, where the perfume is mild, not this type of grassy scent, and would use this one if it came in a non-perfumed version.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick shipping, though.</li>
            <li>However, on the flipside (gee, can&#x27;t I be pleased lol), I need lately</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, absorbs into the skin quickly and has definitely helped to minimize my facial age spots.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and easy, doesn&#x27;t make me itch or cry, doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or PJs, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The cream has high reviews, and granted, I think overall it seems great.  </li>
            <li>Good for a senior with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I need to use more regularly before I can give an accurate review of the benefits.  </li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>OK, LET COMPLETE IT</li>
            <li>It lasts about a month so well worth the price</li>
            <li>One thing to note: it has a strong perfume scent which is the main reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>There is no heavy feel to this product just a soothing clean light feel.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into the skin and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to strong odors and don&#x27;t want to offend those around you, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>Has a strong fragrance but it left my skin feeling nice next morning.</li>
            <li>Came back for more..</li>
            <li>This product feels great on my skin,I have not been using it long enough to know if it will do what they claim.</li>
            <li>is my age spots fading so much!</li>
            <li>Now, for probably the first 10 days, I used it twice a day (am and pm) and I think that sped things up.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have gotten the Night Cream.  </li>
            <li>She says she feel the skin much better after using several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>exactly what they say it will do.</li>
            <li>So I had to get on the computer and look up reviews, and sure enough, this product seems to be a hit.</li>
            <li>I am 74, have smooth unblemished skin and some wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Love it and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not expensive, which I like.  </li>
            <li>As for this cream, like many of the reviews, yes, it definitely is NOT greasy, which I like as well.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>I just tried this today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this product</li>
            <li>Buy it and use it frequently !!!!</li>
            <li>product is worth trying for its decent value.</li>
            <li>Got this cream after listening to a program on Dr Oz.&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped my facial pores look and feel better.</li>
            <li>People tell me my skin is lovely, and makes me look a lot younger than I really am.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my genetics help, but people are always surprised when they learn my true age.</li>
            <li>I would definitely  pay more for this cream as it is high quality and will be watching the reviews here to see if or when the perfume problem is gone.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product but am on the look out for another product that may work a bit better for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love this for my daytime cream as I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and even I cancel the order which I paid shipping as much as the product price I lose money for nothing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much hydrated and silky when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I can not tolerate the smell of this product, so I really don&#x27;t know if it works or not.</li>
            <li>If this moisturizer were fragrance free it would definitely be &amp;#34;perfect!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product really works and DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS.</li>
            <li>I really like using the Night Cream, now.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers say the product has too much perfume or smells like insecticide, unless they have received defective products-</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I like to read reviews before purchasing these kinds of products, but the price was reasonable and I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy -- just a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The consistency is different and the cream does not go on as smoothly as before.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very solf in the morning after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The scent really repells me and makes me not want to use this product.</li>
            <li>The perfume smell is so intense I would not try it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I really like this night cream.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice, not at all heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for aging skin and since you get 2.5 ounces instead of the average 1.7, one jar lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I tried this cream a few years ago and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what to expect from a night cream, but this is at least as good as anything I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, it probably isn&#x27;t right for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than a lot of other products do</li>
            <li>Distance so far was sent to the security, is really very good！Want to open more 1 can direct mail to China&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and have quit trying to look 20 years younger, so this product is fine.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, not greasy, goes on smoothly on my very dry &amp; over sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t believe it moisturizes quite as much as my other daily moisturizer, but it does a respectable job and neither of these things are a deal-breaker for me!</li>
            <li>I use it day and night, as my older skin seems to need it.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal products are usually high quality from my experience and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this on a whim and couldn&#x27;t believe how much younger my face looked after putting it on for the first time!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the way it makes my skin feel--very smooth with a little bit of a &#x27;glow&#x27; to it the next morning.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that this product is non-greasy, smells good and eases dry, tight skin without clogging my pores and causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, not greasy, I have been using it for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>My skin type is Normal....</li>
            <li>Love this product can use everyday.</li>
            <li>This will be a good test as I am more mature and hope to slow down to visual look of my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I will keep using the cream until its all gone and see if I get any new results, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
            <li>This, of course, is excellent and helps me to maintain a face that is always guessed at least 10yrs less than my actual age (64)</li>
            <li>It not only hydrated (without the heavy, greasy feeling), but my face actually looked more youthful right away!</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with very soft, moist skin.  </li>
            <li>and now he actually appreciates it very much.</li>
            <li>This seems to deliver so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars only because it&#x27;s the first day I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than any of the more expensive facial creams.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s silky and not heavy at all!  </li>
            <li>Overall, the ratings were positive, so I decided to purchase.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as I love Loreal facial products/treatments and this was a good price and much less expensive than the night cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li>clear instructions whether I could return it.  </li>
            <li>like my old tube.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of it, but so far have not noticed any changes in my complexion or&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR IT LOOKS</li>
            <li>FOR YEARS, I AM 65 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>Works wonders from me but bought off amazon and it had that old lotion smell</li>
            <li>This night cream is soft and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels soft and looks radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you cannot use this product.</li>
            <li>People are always surprised when they  learn about my age.</li>
            <li>It is my opinion Loreal, in error, added too much perfume to this batch and perhaps is trying to unload it at amazon at a low price.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I know it says night cream, but we use it on the whole family for being outside in the sun.</li>
            <li>No strong fragrance, very fresh and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have used some very expensive skin lines that worked reasonably well, but for the price, this seems better than most of those other products.  </li>
            <li>I consistently use this and the day cream and can&#x27;t imagine that the expensive department store brands would do any better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably just my opinion, but since it is in fact different than it was the first time I bought it, I likely won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It looks more moist and the little dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve recently changed this product, or at least, they are now selling &amp;#34;look-alikes&amp;#34; that smell more like&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li>It barely looks like I&#x27;ve taken anything out of the jar!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and I have had no regrets at al!</li>
            <li>The only downside of it- if you can even call it that- is that it has a slightly medicinal smell (to me), but it&#x27;s not overpowering and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t take much product, I think it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a severe headache, although I&#x27;m sensitive to such things.</li>
            <li>My facial skin feels hydrated and soft, and it also already feels firmer.  </li>
            <li>This cream is at least as good as, if not better than, the cream I&#x27;d been using--and one-tenth of the price</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the strong fragrance, but that fades after a while.  </li>
            <li>I finally replaced it, but the new formulation has a strong perfume scent that I find irritating.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she was looking for at half price.  </li>
            <li>:/ I do recommend it, just not off here, too old of shelf life!!!!!</li>
            <li>We both agreed that our neck and face skin texture is much smoother and with less age spots and darker spots have become lightened as well.</li>
            <li>I do not want my skin to be dry  and old looking.</li>
            <li>another one of those products that promises much but delivers little.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I just love it!!  </li>
            <li> Just purchased L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day 2.5 oz, but cannot wear it because of the perfume, which smells like insecticide, and the smell stays with you for many hours.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect face cream.  </li>
            <li> Great results at a good price.</li>
            <li> well I still have a face, so thats a good sign.</li>
            <li> smells good,</li>
            <li> I personly think is a good product.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good price on  this, too.</li>
            <li> But it feels so good.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS GOOD  AND</li>
            <li> Good offer at a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good night cream for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, however the age spots have not changed.</li>
            <li> I have a fair to medium complexion, with some signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> I do use and am on auto ship for Loreal Revitalift, another good product with out the overbearing perfume.</li>
            <li> Good experience</li>
            <li> I just purchased this cream and I am very pleased with how it feels when applied.  </li>
            <li> I do exfoliate and do all that good stuff and honestly, I do get compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> The smell is not that great and is kind of too strong for me at times.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy with the quick results!  </li>
            <li> B. Rose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being perfectly honest.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night, it is an effective night cream to help reduce lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> It is nourishing, just not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The jar was in it&#x27;s own box made by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a night cream I liked as well</li>
            <li> Great success....!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and think it is a great product &amp; moisturizer - perfect for dry skin but never oily -</li>
            <li> This fragrance  of this cream is very strong.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so soft and smells very good!</li>
            <li> In 20 words or more I can honestly say without prejudice that I expect to continue using this product.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream is that the cream itself is a great consistency and nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this original one on Amazon and will be buying more soon - have enjoyed it for years now</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my forties), but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It worked so much better than Revitalift to plump up and hide wrinkles on my 60 plus skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will want me to order this again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> Need a week or two more.</li>
            <li> return makes me pay more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did bought it.</li>
            <li> It is not oily as i already have skin on the more oily side.  </li>
            <li> Although I still look 58, I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> Seems to absorb into my skin so by lunchtime I need to reapply more of it.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about</li>
            <li> Love how my nighttime skin feels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a realist who understands that one cannot undo many years of sun exposure, stress and age with a cream or potion.</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream.</li>
            <li> ,my daughter and I used it every night , we both love this night cream.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal is my favorite go to company for face cream and hair color.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream and the consistency.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> using LOreal skin creams for many years</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> The cream is supposed to be a bit more oily.  </li>
            <li> I love ALL L&#x27;Oreal Paris face cream products.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for years &amp; love the feel. . .use</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love it too. .</li>
            <li> I love the creamy texture of this cream, but I keep forgeting to use it</li>
            <li> okay?</li>
            <li> love this cream,I have used it for many years, It&#x60;s delicious,my face,feels,smooth and yet moistured.</li>
            <li> I do believe my skin to be better hydrated in the morning than when iI didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It works well as a night cream, but not so sure about an anti-aging element.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this cream after reading MANY of the reviews and doing lots of research myself.  </li>
            <li> To most, it&#x27;s not even noticeable</li>
            <li> it seems, a more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; type cream for my now drier skin.  </li>
            <li> For me, and that&#x27;s just my preference, mind you, I would love this cream just a tad more --- dare I say it... &amp;#34;greasy!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Well... maybe &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; would be a better choice of words :-)  </li>
            <li> Feels so good on face - and it smells lovely, too - light, airy fragrance and smooth and soothing to apply day or night....</li>
            <li> I have used this product  and this product from Amazon was ok.</li>
            <li> After wearing it on my hands and  after 4 washings, the smell was still there - so in the trash it goes, too many fumes even for  my hands.</li>
            <li> This product has an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite night ceam</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> And the kids love this too on their face.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Glides</li>
            <li> Well for a cream you don&#x27;t notice is there while you&#x27;re sleeping, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is just okay, but each person must decide for themselves.</li>
            <li> It goes on more like a serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for almost 2 weeks and my face is already smoother and more radiant looking than before.</li>
            <li> &amp; I get many compliments on the improvement since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and viscosity of product is just right which allows easy application.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and cool and like the smell.</li>
            <li> This cream for the elder women who want to look young and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I find this a great cream to use, its light but very nourishing.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizing anti-aging night cream, firming, absorbs fast, light scent</li>
            <li> and my skin is very sensitive, so this was a great find for me.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This cream is very clean and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I find it very cool on my skin.  </li>
            <li> While it does provide great hydration, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as what I had been using.  </li>
            <li> I was using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift but bought Age Perfect on sale (more product for less money to try it).</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> Very confortable and happy with this relaxing fresh product.</li>
            <li> Also I do not like flavor too strong.</li>
            <li> and it is still so strong it makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, nothing special.</li>
            <li> and I am lucky to have pretty good skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, it moisturizes all night, smells fine, spreads fine, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and doesn&#x27;t stain the pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal products, but my skin began to show fine wrinkles after just a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells, but I find the scent pleasant and nonirritating.</li>
            <li> So far the night cream has been pleasant and I await the result.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff and feels very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> , I see improvements in my skin looks smoother and firmer, fragrance leaves a rich, non-greasy, easy to spread.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 weeks and it takes bright light to even find my age spots now!</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and fresh and it makes my skin feel hydrated and silky, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> And such a great price.</li>
            <li> I wish it was unscented or just lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Night cream is very luxurious and so nice to apply before going to bed.</li>
            <li> but it was cheap and you have to put SOMETHING on your face at night,  don&#x27;t you,..</li>
            <li> I used it as a hand cream for a few hours and was very impressed.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you want fragrance free product.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product so far so good... BB</li>
            <li> i am 76 years old and still looking good.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and smells is clean and light.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have noticed I need a more intense moisturizer to keep my skin bright.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I have only been using this cream for about 4 days now, so maybe It needs more time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I now have essentially a full opened jar I don&#x27;t know what to do with.</li>
            <li> I will be using it more during the fall because I won&#x27;t sweat soo much</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; it helps me tremendously with skin issues (very dry).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to receive one of my favorite facial products in the mail with other necessities of my life.</li>
            <li> It is so light and goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li> I do use their Revitalift series, where the perfume is mild, not this type of grassy scent, and would use this one if it came in a non-perfumed version.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick shipping, though.</li>
            <li> However, on the flipside (gee, can&#x27;t I be pleased lol), I need lately</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, absorbs into the skin quickly and has definitely helped to minimize my facial age spots.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and easy, doesn&#x27;t make me itch or cry, doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or PJs, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The cream has high reviews, and granted, I think overall it seems great.  </li>
            <li> Good for a senior with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I need to use more regularly before I can give an accurate review of the benefits.  </li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> OK, LET COMPLETE IT</li>
            <li> It lasts about a month so well worth the price</li>
            <li> One thing to note: it has a strong perfume scent which is the main reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> There is no heavy feel to this product just a soothing clean light feel.</li>
            <li> It soaks right into the skin and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to strong odors and don&#x27;t want to offend those around you, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Has a strong fragrance but it left my skin feeling nice next morning.</li>
            <li> Came back for more..</li>
            <li> This product feels great on my skin,I have not been using it long enough to know if it will do what they claim.</li>
            <li> is my age spots fading so much!</li>
            <li> Now, for probably the first 10 days, I used it twice a day (am and pm) and I think that sped things up.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have gotten the Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> She says she feel the skin much better after using several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> exactly what they say it will do.</li>
            <li> So I had to get on the computer and look up reviews, and sure enough, this product seems to be a hit.</li>
            <li> I am 74, have smooth unblemished skin and some wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Love it and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not expensive, which I like.  </li>
            <li> As for this cream, like many of the reviews, yes, it definitely is NOT greasy, which I like as well.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> I just tried this today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product</li>
            <li> Buy it and use it frequently !!!!</li>
            <li> product is worth trying for its decent value.</li>
            <li> Got this cream after listening to a program on Dr Oz.&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped my facial pores look and feel better.</li>
            <li> People tell me my skin is lovely, and makes me look a lot younger than I really am.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my genetics help, but people are always surprised when they learn my true age.</li>
            <li> I would definitely  pay more for this cream as it is high quality and will be watching the reviews here to see if or when the perfume problem is gone.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but am on the look out for another product that may work a bit better for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this for my daytime cream as I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and even I cancel the order which I paid shipping as much as the product price I lose money for nothing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much hydrated and silky when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I can not tolerate the smell of this product, so I really don&#x27;t know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> If this moisturizer were fragrance free it would definitely be &amp;#34;perfect!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product really works and DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS.</li>
            <li> I really like using the Night Cream, now.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers say the product has too much perfume or smells like insecticide, unless they have received defective products-</li>
            <li> It really hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I like to read reviews before purchasing these kinds of products, but the price was reasonable and I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy -- just a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The consistency is different and the cream does not go on as smoothly as before.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very solf in the morning after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The scent really repells me and makes me not want to use this product.</li>
            <li> The perfume smell is so intense I would not try it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I really like this night cream.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice, not at all heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for aging skin and since you get 2.5 ounces instead of the average 1.7, one jar lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I tried this cream a few years ago and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to expect from a night cream, but this is at least as good as anything I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, it probably isn&#x27;t right for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than a lot of other products do</li>
            <li> Distance so far was sent to the security, is really very good！Want to open more 1 can direct mail to China&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and have quit trying to look 20 years younger, so this product is fine.</li>
            <li> It smells ok, not greasy, goes on smoothly on my very dry &amp; over sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t believe it moisturizes quite as much as my other daily moisturizer, but it does a respectable job and neither of these things are a deal-breaker for me!</li>
            <li> I use it day and night, as my older skin seems to need it.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal products are usually high quality from my experience and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this on a whim and couldn&#x27;t believe how much younger my face looked after putting it on for the first time!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the way it makes my skin feel--very smooth with a little bit of a &#x27;glow&#x27; to it the next morning.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that this product is non-greasy, smells good and eases dry, tight skin without clogging my pores and causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, not greasy, I have been using it for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> My skin type is Normal....</li>
            <li> Love this product can use everyday.</li>
            <li> This will be a good test as I am more mature and hope to slow down to visual look of my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I will keep using the cream until its all gone and see if I get any new results, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
            <li> This, of course, is excellent and helps me to maintain a face that is always guessed at least 10yrs less than my actual age (64)</li>
            <li> It not only hydrated (without the heavy, greasy feeling), but my face actually looked more youthful right away!</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with very soft, moist skin.  </li>
            <li> and now he actually appreciates it very much.</li>
            <li> This seems to deliver so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars only because it&#x27;s the first day I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any of the more expensive facial creams.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s silky and not heavy at all!  </li>
            <li> Overall, the ratings were positive, so I decided to purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I love Loreal facial products/treatments and this was a good price and much less expensive than the night cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li> clear instructions whether I could return it.  </li>
            <li> like my old tube.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it, but so far have not noticed any changes in my complexion or&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR IT LOOKS</li>
            <li> FOR YEARS, I AM 65 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> Works wonders from me but bought off amazon and it had that old lotion smell</li>
            <li> This night cream is soft and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels soft and looks radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you cannot use this product.</li>
            <li> People are always surprised when they  learn about my age.</li>
            <li> It is my opinion Loreal, in error, added too much perfume to this batch and perhaps is trying to unload it at amazon at a low price.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I know it says night cream, but we use it on the whole family for being outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> No strong fragrance, very fresh and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have used some very expensive skin lines that worked reasonably well, but for the price, this seems better than most of those other products.  </li>
            <li> I consistently use this and the day cream and can&#x27;t imagine that the expensive department store brands would do any better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just my opinion, but since it is in fact different than it was the first time I bought it, I likely won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It looks more moist and the little dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve recently changed this product, or at least, they are now selling &amp;#34;look-alikes&amp;#34; that smell more like&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li> It barely looks like I&#x27;ve taken anything out of the jar!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I have had no regrets at al!</li>
            <li> The only downside of it- if you can even call it that- is that it has a slightly medicinal smell (to me), but it&#x27;s not overpowering and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t take much product, I think it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a severe headache, although I&#x27;m sensitive to such things.</li>
            <li> My facial skin feels hydrated and soft, and it also already feels firmer.  </li>
            <li> This cream is at least as good as, if not better than, the cream I&#x27;d been using--and one-tenth of the price</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the strong fragrance, but that fades after a while.  </li>
            <li> I finally replaced it, but the new formulation has a strong perfume scent that I find irritating.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she was looking for at half price.  </li>
            <li> :/ I do recommend it, just not off here, too old of shelf life!!!!!</li>
            <li> We both agreed that our neck and face skin texture is much smoother and with less age spots and darker spots have become lightened as well.</li>
            <li> I do not want my skin to be dry  and old looking.</li>
            <li> another one of those products that promises much but delivers little.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never seen before that  new product only has half, not full.</li>
            <li> I waited too long after it arrived to actually try it, so I couldn&#x27;t get my $$ back.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy it too because is said for \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot;, and I&#x27;m in my 40s.</li>
            <li> The skin is clear, there were few visible lines (between brows, on temples)</li>
            <li> I hope i can buy it for a long time</li>
            <li> AND  THIS PRODUCT IS MY MATE FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was expecting long shelf time.</li>
            <li> (The same could be said for other brands I&#x27;ve tried.)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and like to use a night cream for the daytime.  </li>
            <li> so it saves my dry skins .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as dry as a bone in our house</li>
            <li> Put it on my fact at night to prevent dry skin and it works.</li>
            <li> I like just using it during the day when the air seems too dry.</li>
            <li> I fund half was gone when I open tne container.</li>
            <li> It looks the same,  just less flaky.</li>
            <li> I am going with four because I have only used this product less than one week.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products but those did no better, so</li>
            <li> I thought the heavy creamy look of it when I first opened the jar was going to be too thick for my face</li>
            <li> Only draw back is that if I use it ALL the time I notice redness under my eyes on the delicate skin</li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> This is my standard product for nighttime use all year round.</li>
            <li> sorry, but I still have not tested long enough to give my opinion on this new product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always annoyed by advertisements that describe miraculous results and command extremely high prices.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much it is actually stopping the aging process, though.  </li>
            <li> and  I thought I would try this brand because I like other products by OReal.</li>
            <li> I have used l&#x27;oreal products for many years and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I do not like:  (1) the overwhelming scent of this night cream; (2) the jar packaging.  </li>
            <li> and so I am very careful not to get it too close to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth this price or any other price.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark even though it was labelled &#x27;medium&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Too keep the fumes and burning down,  </li>
            <li> and I still have to fight those little lines and other problem areas,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the spot diminisher, but my face is not as dry looking.</li>
            <li> Seems like not a new one!!!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed improved hydration and some slight tone correction in my skin.</li>
            <li> All of them ,I ordered 3, half of cream was gone .</li>
            <li> I used to have lines around my mouth and in one day I could see my lines much much less.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers packaging was all crumbled and the jar looked like it was previously opened.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this product was for 60+ skin when I bought it, so I was a little hesitant to use it</li>
            <li> As for firming...maybe a little, but</li>
            <li> It does sting a little</li>
            <li> I use this product in the neck a little skin allergies, not used again.</li>
            <li> Cleared up dried, itchy skin on my calf within three days.  </li>
            <li> Too drying on my skin and the perfume smell is so heavy</li>
            <li> I use it at night time and apply thin layer to my entire face and even neck area.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive creams that don&#x27;t even come near to comparison.</li>
            <li> My husband I are both in our 50&#x27;s and discovered this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this before bedtime for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the fragrence than is off putting to a few reviewers.</li>
            <li> It is really to heavy for me.</li>
            <li> on smoothly, rich in texture and can be used as a base for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> On my first try this product on my face before sleep, It feel greasy, and the worst sleeping with GREASY FACE, when i woke up, my skin feel worst, and small pimples on my face,probably the product is too warm for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> For the second consecutive shipment, Amazon sent me the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past year.</li>
            <li> The cream only has half!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Hard to find that quality these days...</li>
            <li> I am a guy in his late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My problem area lately has been drier skin with a bit of loss of firmness in the lower portion of my face.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick</li>
            <li> I find it too thick and it make my face feel like grease.</li>
            <li> For once, a product does what it says it will, without costing a small fortune!</li>
            <li> However, that still doesn&#x27;t mean that aging is still not creeping up on me</li>
            <li> You might as well use cold cream or any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I mean everything!</li>
            <li> THEY JUST GOT WORSE.  </li>
            <li> I cover it with a thin coat of another moisterizer.  </li>
            <li> Irritating and oily.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and is not drying as some of the expensive creams I have used.</li>
            <li> in which case they need to return the product to where they purchased it or take it up with the manufacturer- as there is something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Bought myself useless, for my wife.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li> cold</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with this price!</li>
            <li> Broke me out in a horrible rash.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> well I still have a face, so thats a good sign.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. smells good,</li>
            <li> I have used this before . Great success....!  Came back for more..</li>
            <li> Love this night cream!!</li>
            <li> works well non greasy, no break outs</li>
            <li> Cleared up dried, itchy skin on my calf within three days.  Great product.  My wife tried it and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this product was for 60+ skin when I bought it, so I was a little hesitant to use it (I&#x27;m in my forties), but I&#x27;m glad I did.  The cream has a wonderful silky feel, not greasy, and it has a really gorgeous fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, it probably isn&#x27;t right for you.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I actually look younger since I&#x27;ve started using it, but I feel as though I do.</li>
            <li> Perfection. I was using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift but bought Age Perfect on sale (more product for less money to try it). It worked so much better than Revitalift to plump up and hide wrinkles on my 60 plus skin. I&#x27;m sold on it now. Only draw back is that if I use it ALL the time I notice redness under my eyes on the delicate skin so I use it two days and switch to another cream for one or two days, as necessary.</li>
            <li> I used to put vasoline on my face at night for deep moisturizing.  My husband got me this at my request for Christmas.  I am a younger lady, but I like using these kinds of creams to prevent wrinkles.  This cream is very clean and easy to use.  A little goes a long way and I find it very cool on my skin.  I have noticed improved hydration and some slight tone correction in my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream only has half!!!!!  Not fully fill the cream up!!!  Seems like not a new one!!!! Very disappointed!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never seen before that  new product only has half, not full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the spot diminisher, but my face is not as dry looking. It looks more moist and the little dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife.  It was exactly what she was looking for at half price.  I&#x27;m sure she will want me to order this again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about three months daily and I just love it!!  I can see and feel the difference.  My skin is softer, clearer and smooth. Fragrance is nice, not at all heavy.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for a month now &amp; can see some visible result. The skin is clear, there were few visible lines (between brows, on temples) they seem to have eased than before. skin is nourished &amp; moisturised. worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I love this product . It&#x27;s fresh, not greasy, I have been using it for the last 15 years. My skin feels and looks great. There is no heavy feel to this product just a soothing clean light feel. No strong fragrance, very fresh and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  It is just what you would want when your looking for a face cream.  Perfect for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This product feels great on my skin,I have not been using it long enough to know if it will do what they claim. Need a week or two more.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing anti-aging night cream, firming, absorbs fast, light scent and you feel your skin dewy yet not greasy the next morning.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s so I use retinol and apply this night cream over it for extra anti aging boost. Good results &amp; great price!!</li>
            <li> I am still using this product so far so good... BB</li>
            <li> Just purchased L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day 2.5 oz, but cannot wear it because of the perfume, which smells like insecticide, and the smell stays with you for many hours. Otherwise product seems to perform well. I do use their Revitalift series, where the perfume is mild, not this type of grassy scent, and would use this one if it came in a non-perfumed version.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark even though it was labelled &#x27;medium&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;No clear instructions whether I could return it.  I thought I was ordering &amp;#34;LightMedium&amp;#34; like my old tube.B. Rose</li>
            <li> I always like this to put on my face at the end of a day after washing it of course. Not greasy and a absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I fund half was gone when I open tne container. All of them ,I ordered 3, half of cream was gone . I felt verybad because I paid intl shipping chare 40$ for these. return makes me pay more and even I cancel the order which I paid shipping as much as the product price I lose money for nothing. terribel experience at Amazon</li>
            <li> This cream does it&#x27;s job as a night cream. It&#x27;s heavy but it makes my skin feel very moisturized. I use it only for nighttime since it does leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth trying for its decent value.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy it too because is said for \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot;, and I&#x27;m in my 40s. I&#x27;m glad I did bought it. It smells ok, not greasy, goes on smoothly on my very dry &amp; over sensitive skin. My skin feels much hydrated and silky when I wake up in the morning. How can you go wrong with this price! I personly think is a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the minimizing/disappearance  of tiny age spots on my face.  Of the 3 larger spots, one is noticeably paler.  I&#x27;m hoping that in another month, the others will fade some,too.  My skin feels hydrated and soft. Since it doesn&#x27;t take much product, I think it will last a long time.  It barely looks like I&#x27;ve taken anything out of the jar! I use it on my face and my neck,too.  Good value! I did not find the smell a problem--It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I am a guy in his late 20&#x27;s.  It is not oily as i already have skin on the more oily side.  It does not bring up pimples or anything. I would purchase again.  I know it says night cream, but i have used it during the morning routine without any oily feeling while going about my day.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this cream and I am very pleased with how it feels when applied.  The scent is lovely and fresh and it makes my skin feel hydrated and silky, not greasy at all.  I have used some very expensive skin lines that worked reasonably well, but for the price, this seems better than most of those other products.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have noticed I need a more intense moisturizer to keep my skin bright.  This seems to deliver so far!</li>
            <li> I can not tolerate the smell of this product, so I really don&#x27;t know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; it helps me tremendously with skin issues (very dry).&lt;br /&gt;Just donot use  2xs a day. Then I break out.</li>
            <li> For the second consecutive shipment, Amazon sent me the wrong product.  My order specifically states &amp;#34;Expertise Night Creme Age Perfect&amp;#34; and I received the day cream with sunblock.  Fortunately, it&#x27;s not a bad product so I&#x27;m using it during the day.  The day cream is a lot thicker, but it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can still write a review about this product, since I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s great for aging skin and since you get 2.5 ounces instead of the average 1.7, one jar lasts for a long time.  My only complaint is the strong fragrance, but that fades after a while.  If this moisturizer were fragrance free it would definitely be &amp;#34;perfect!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although I still look 58, I love this night cream.  It leaves my face feeling so soft and smells very good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 weeks and it takes bright light to even find my age spots now! I&#x27;m being perfectly honest. As for firming...maybe a little, but what I&#x27;m really impressed by is my age spots fading so much! Now, for probably the first 10 days, I used it twice a day (am and pm) and I think that sped things up. The only downside of it- if you can even call it that- is that it has a slightly medicinal smell (to me), but it&#x27;s not overpowering and dissipates quickly. Also, I don&#x27;t believe it moisturizes quite as much as my other daily moisturizer, but it does a respectable job and neither of these things are a deal-breaker for me! This product really works and DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS. Hard to find that quality these days... Amazon has a good price on  this, too. Cheaper than drugstores.  I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74 and have been using this night cream for years.  It keeps my skin moist and is not drying as some of the expensive creams I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have tried everything. I mean everything! This is absolutely the best! What else can I say? I used to have lines around my mouth and in one day I could see my lines much much less. I do not lie. Trust me. This is a miracle cream in a jar! The soy helps on getting rid of age spots too.</li>
            <li> Seems to absorb into my skin so by lunchtime I need to reapply more of it.  I have dry skin and like to use a night cream for the daytime.  I would recommend this product but am on the look out for another product that may work a bit better for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find this a great cream to use, its light but very nourishing.  And such a great price. I hope i can buy it for a long time</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to receive one of my favorite facial products in the mail with other necessities of my life.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have gotten the Night Cream.  I have always used the Day/Night combination.  I was given the Day Cream and then I needed the Night.  I really like using the Night Cream, now.  It really works.  My skin type is Normal....</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream. I use it morning and night. Makeup goes on well after morning use.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream a few years ago and really liked it. I finally replaced it, but the new formulation has a strong perfume scent that I find irritating. It gives me a severe headache, although I&#x27;m sensitive to such things. (I do not use any scented lotions, perfumes, detergents, etc). I now have essentially a full opened jar I don&#x27;t know what to do with.</li>
            <li> Very good product, not greasy and very effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Too drying on my skin and the perfume smell is so heavy I feel like I sprayed perfume in my mouth</li>
            <li> The product info forget to mention that the  product feel GREASY on skin, when applied on face. On my first try this product on my face before sleep, It feel greasy, and the worst sleeping with GREASY FACE, when i woke up, my skin feel worst, and small pimples on my face,probably the product is too warm for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Got this cream after listening to a program on Dr Oz.&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped my facial pores look and feel better.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it, but so far have not noticed any changes in my complexion or&lt;br /&gt;skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought the programming before in Pairs airport for my Mom. She says she feel the skin much better after using several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I keep finding this product in mainland of China,but failed.&lt;br /&gt;One day, I tried to search it again in Amazon.com. I find it! and the price seems not bad.&lt;br /&gt;now, I placed the order and wait for received.&lt;br /&gt;i guess ,I will be the honor customer on Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> QUITE SIMPLY, IT DOES NOT WORK. You might as well use cold cream or any other moisturizer. It is not worth this price or any other price.</li>
            <li> I use this every night. Love it. L&#x27;Oreal puts a lot of research into their products and give excellent results.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT AND SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE IT WORKS OK, LET COMPLETE IT AND MAYBE I ASK FOR ANOTHER ONE.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS,</li>
            <li> I USED EVERY NIGHT ..  FOR YEARS, I AM 65 YEARS OLD AND  THIS PRODUCT IS MY MATE FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moisturizer, and I have no allergic reaction to it. That&#x27;s more than a lot of other products do</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect night for years.  I cannot use anything with sunscreen in it (I dont&#x27; know why manufacturer&#x27;s feel that it is their duty to toss it into every product) and my skin is very sensitive, so this was a great find for me.  I began using it when I was in my 40&#x27;s as my &#x27;youthful&#x27; skin cream just didn&#x27;t do enough in the moisturizing department.  Now about 15 years later it is still my go-to day and night cream.  I don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers say the product has too much perfume or smells like insecticide, unless they have received defective products- in which case they need to return the product to where they purchased it or take it up with the manufacturer- as there is something wrong.  The scent is very light and clean smelling.  My skin looks great...but let&#x27;s just say a nip and tuck here and there might be warranted!</li>
            <li> This is my standard product for nighttime use all year round. It absorbs quick and easy, doesn&#x27;t make me itch or cry, doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or PJs, and is reasonably priced. I am 67 years old and have quit trying to look 20 years younger, so this product is fine.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great face cream! Works wonders from me but bought off amazon and it had that old lotion smell and it made my face burn when I put it on :/ I do recommend it, just not off here, too old of shelf life!!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream is that the cream itself is a great consistency and nice and thick. I use it at night time and apply thin layer to my entire face and even neck area. The smell is not that great and is kind of too strong for me at times. I wish it was unscented or just lightly scented. Sometimes I opt to not use it at all just because of the smell</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream&lt;br /&gt;great deal for the price. I bought 2 and gave one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Love how my nighttime skin feels.  Not sure how much it is actually stopping the aging process, though.  But it feels so good.</li>
            <li> It does the job...exactly what they say it will do.</li>
            <li> Love this product can use everyday. Not  2 greesey. Can be pricey but order on a&lt;br /&gt;Amazon to save money</li>
            <li> Night cream is very luxurious and so nice to apply before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This product works and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I&#x27;m always annoyed by advertisements that describe miraculous results and command extremely high prices. I&#x27;m a realist who understands that one cannot undo many years of sun exposure, stress and age with a cream or potion. What I can say is that this product is non-greasy, smells good and eases dry, tight skin without clogging my pores and causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream. It really hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy</li>
            <li> This night cream is soft and moisturizes well. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels soft and looks radiant. I look well-rested.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I bought the day cream and I really like this product.  It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Beautifully wrapped and shipped, excellent product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I don&#x27;t even know this product is for 60+ skins until I saw the review just now!Whatever,my daughter and I used it every night , we both love this night cream.The cream is thick so it saves my dry skins .</li>
            <li> another one of those products that promises much but delivers little.  but it was cheap and you have to put SOMETHING on your face at night,  don&#x27;t you,..</li>
            <li> Used it but did not notice any differences.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect face cream.  It soaks right into the skin and is not greasy.  I use it morning and night on my face and my hands.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS GOOD  AND M OISTURIZED BUT THATS ALL.  DOES NOTHING FOR MY WRINKLES THEY JUST GOT WORSE.  HELP.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night, it is an effective night cream to help reduce lines and wrinkles. L&#x27;Oreal is my favorite go to company for face cream and hair color.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream and the consistency.  I need to use more regularly before I can give an accurate review of the benefits.  When I remember to put it on, my skin does feel divine.  I also put it on the backs of my hands and on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> Yeah it does.  It gets rid of those wrinkles around the mouth.  I love this stuff.  The price is reasonable.  I have used expensive creams that don&#x27;t even come near to comparison.</li>
            <li> Great cream for night time moisture to soften.</li>
            <li> Broke me out in a horrible rash. I waited too long after it arrived to actually try it, so I couldn&#x27;t get my $$ back. If you have sensitive skin, you cannot use this product.</li>
            <li> using LOreal skin creams for many years and I love it i am 76 years old and still looking good.  People are always surprised when they  learn about my age.</li>
            <li> I consistently use this and the day cream and can&#x27;t imagine that the expensive department store brands would do any better.  I&#x27;ve been using these products for four years and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and it&#x27;s as dry as a bone in our house and my skin was showing it. I like to read reviews before purchasing these kinds of products, but the price was reasonable and I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy -- just a moisturizer. So I bought this on a whim and couldn&#x27;t believe how much younger my face looked after putting it on for the first time! It not only hydrated (without the heavy, greasy feeling), but my face actually looked more youthful right away! It even brought some color to my washed out winter face. So I had to get on the computer and look up reviews, and sure enough, this product seems to be a hit. For once, a product does what it says it will, without costing a small fortune! I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells, but I find the scent pleasant and nonirritating. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars only because it&#x27;s the first day I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this cream before and this time the cream is not the same!  The consistency is different and the cream does not go on as smoothly as before.  The cream is supposed to be a bit more oily.  Even if the cream applied differently, I still don&#x27;t like the texture and the way it felt on my face.  It&#x27;s probably just my opinion, but since it is in fact different than it was the first time I bought it, I likely won&#x27;t buy it again.  Thank you for the quick shipping, though.</li>
            <li> I love ALL L&#x27;Oreal Paris face cream products.  This, of course, is excellent and helps me to maintain a face that is always guessed at least 10yrs less than my actual age (64)</li>
            <li> Bought myself useless, for my wife.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years &amp; love the feel. . .use the day cream too. .</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I wake up in the morning with very soft, moist skin.  It&#x27;s not greasy, so I don&#x27;t worry about ruining my pillow cases.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers packaging was all crumbled and the jar looked like it was previously opened. I am nervous to put this moisturizer on my face, but I just discovered that this item is not refundable.</li>
            <li> Love this for my daytime cream as I have dry skin.  It is not sticky.  I use the Hydra-nutrition golden balm for nights and exfoliate at least twice a week.  I am in my 60s and have no lines or wrinkles, so this has been doing the job.</li>
            <li> Good offer at a good price. Very confortable and happy with this relaxing fresh product. Buy it and use it frequently !!!!</li>
            <li> My husband I are both in our 50&#x27;s and discovered this product a few years ago. It&#x27;s affordable that we feel at ease using all over my neck and the entire face. It is not greasy and smells is clean and light. My husband who didn&#x27;t like to put anything on his face and now he actually appreciates it very much. We both agreed that our neck and face skin texture is much smoother and with less age spots and darker spots have become lightened as well. Use it and you&#x27;ll love it too. .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4months plus the day cream too.I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles for my age and  I thought I would try this brand because I like other products by OReal. I do not want my skin to be dry  and old looking.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  Don&#x27;t know what to expect from a night cream, but this is at least as good as anything I have ever tried.  I am 74, have smooth unblemished skin and some wrinkles.  Don&#x27;t think anything prevents wrinkles caused by the sun.</li>
            <li> This does help keep the wrinkles at bay, girls.</li>
            <li> I love the creamy texture of this cream, but I keep forgeting to use it and therefore I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working. I will be using it more during the fall because I won&#x27;t sweat soo much wheen I use it. I will get back to you on this item okay?</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It makes my skin feel very solf in the morning after I wash my face.  It&#x27;s a good night cream for the price you pay.  Love it and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Buy this product as a birthday gift from my mom. No doubt is the best price I found on the web, Amazon always have  great deals on these items. My mom is happy and I too!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love this cream,I have used it for many years, It&#x60;s delicious,my face,feels,smooth and yet moistured.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any of the more expensive facial creams.  I just wish it came in a larger jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this before bedtime for a few weeks.  It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer and I need to apply moisturizer anyway  before bed, so I thought, why not try something that&#x27;s anti-wrinkle as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it moisturizes all night, smells fine, spreads fine, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and doesn&#x27;t stain the pillowcase.  It&#x27;s also not expensive, which I like.  But it hasn&#x27;t make me look any younger or diminished the appearance of wrinkles.  (The same could be said for other brands I&#x27;ve tried.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this on sale.  I do believe my skin to be better hydrated in the morning than when iI didn&#x27;t use it.  It does sting a little and so I am very careful not to get it too close to my eyes.  Too keep the fumes and burning down,  I cover it with a thin coat of another moisterizer.  That seems to do the trick.  I don&#x27;t see a difference in the tartness of my skin.  It looks the same,  just less flaky.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff and feels very soft and smooth.  It lasts about a month so well worth the price</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and in perfect condition.  Love this product.  Put it on my fact at night to prevent dry skin and it works.</li>
            <li> I have used l&#x27;oreal products for many years and have not been disappointed.  This will be a good test as I am more mature and hope to slow down to visual look of my aging skin.  So far the night cream has been pleasant and I await the result.</li>
            <li> I should have read all ingredients - it has parabens in it, so returned it - I&#x27;m trying to not use products with parabens</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It works well as a night cream, but not so sure about an anti-aging element.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent.  Unfortunately it burned my eyes.  I kept it away but the fumes burned.  I am using the cream only on my neck to use it up.  I&#x27;m not usually sensitive.</li>
            <li> Helps in getting charming skin!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, however the age spots have not changed. It is nourishing, just not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have used Avon&#x27;s Ultima for years, but thought I would give this one a try.  I like L&#x27;Oreal products, but my skin began to show fine wrinkles after just a week.  Have gone back to Avon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year. When I moved there were several weeks that I didn&#x27;t use it and I could tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this cream after reading MANY of the reviews and doing lots of research myself.  Overall, the ratings were positive, so I decided to purchase. I&#x27;m almost 54 and I am lucky to have pretty good skin. I have a fair to medium complexion, with some signs of aging.  My problem area lately has been drier skin with a bit of loss of firmness in the lower portion of my face.  To most, it&#x27;s not even noticeable (I have asked lol), but to me of course, it is.  As for this cream, like many of the reviews, yes, it definitely is NOT greasy, which I like as well.  However, on the flipside (gee, can&#x27;t I be pleased lol), I need lately it seems, a more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; type cream for my now drier skin.  I do exfoliate and do all that good stuff and honestly, I do get compliments on my complexion. However, that still doesn&#x27;t mean that aging is still not creeping up on me and I still have to fight those little lines and other problem areas, etc.  I will fight them all the way!  To be honest, I have only been using this cream for about 4 days now, so maybe It needs more time.  Even though it&#x27;s considered a &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; cream, I have used it during the day as well.  I guess with someone younger or with a bit oiler skin or combination type skin this might seem &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  The cream has high reviews, and granted, I think overall it seems great.  For me, and that&#x27;s just my preference, mind you, I would love this cream just a tad more --- dare I say it... &amp;#34;greasy!&amp;#34;  Well... maybe &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; would be a better choice of words :-)  Overall, I give this cream 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on face - and it smells lovely, too - light, airy fragrance and smooth and soothing to apply day or night....recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Have been using it for the past year.</li>
            <li> I am going with four because I have only used this product less than one week.  I really like it.  My facial skin feels hydrated and soft, and it also already feels firmer.  I think I will like the additional results after longer use.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal products are usually high quality from my experience and this is no exception.  Pleasant smell and viscosity of product is just right which allows easy application.</li>
            <li> I do not like:  (1) the overwhelming scent of this night cream; (2) the jar packaging.  The scent really repells me and makes me not want to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product  and this product from Amazon was ok. I was expecting long shelf time. I might order something different next time.</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever...smells divine!!</li>
            <li> I used it as a hand cream for a few hours and was very impressed. The perfume smell is so intense I would not try it on my face.  After wearing it on my hands and  after 4 washings, the smell was still there - so in the trash it goes, too many fumes even for  my hands. It is my opinion Loreal, in error, added too much perfume to this batch and perhaps is trying to unload it at amazon at a low price.  I would definitely  pay more for this cream as it is high quality and will be watching the reviews here to see if or when the perfume problem is gone. I do use and am on auto ship for Loreal Revitalift, another good product with out the overbearing perfume.</li>
            <li> Dear sirs,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry, but I still have not tested long enough to give my opinion on this new product.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight and I am almost in pain from the smell! My eyes are watering and burning. I looked at all the reviews and can&#x27;t believe some people don&#x27;t mention the smell! Hope I can return it!</li>
            <li> I use this product in the neck a little skin allergies, not used again. I&#x27;m allergic.Also I do not like flavor too strong.</li>
            <li> Irritating and oily. Do not buy if you want fragrance free product.</li>
            <li> This cream is at least as good as, if not better than, the cream I&#x27;d been using--and one-tenth of the price</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream.  I have sensitive skin.  This cream has hydrated my skin and  helped  eliminate wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try something new. It&#x27;s OK, nothing special. One thing to note: it has a strong perfume scent which is the main reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Good experience</li>
            <li> This is what I use all the time. I don&#x27;t know if it is perfecting my ageing any or not. I am 60 and like the hydration of this cream. Feels nice and cool and like the smell.</li>
            <li> Best results in 1 week</li>
            <li> My mother is fascinated with this product and brand, loves. Adora as skin is left and is recommended to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I can tell the difference in my skin.  I will buy this product again over big store brands.</li>
            <li> This cream for the elder women who want to look young and beautiful. I bought for my niece, then I thought I should buy for myself too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nightly for about six weeks now. I enjoy the way it makes my skin feel--very smooth with a little bit of a &#x27;glow&#x27; to it the next morning. However, that&#x27;s about it! I bought this to try to fade some large-ish age spots on my cheek and jawline. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet. I will keep using the cream until its all gone and see if I get any new results, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
            <li> In 20 words or more I can honestly say without prejudice that I expect to continue using this product.  Great results at a good price.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I have been happy with another  L&#x27;Oreal product (Revitallift night cream). This product has an overwhelming fragrance. I used it once and couldn&#x27;t stand it. I may try it again - on my feet and hope I can&#x27;t smell it. If you are at all sensitive to strong odors and don&#x27;t want to offend those around you, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties and African American and my skin had begun to sag in my neck area. That has been corrected with this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite night ceam</li>
            <li> I just tried this today for the first time.  I won&#x27;t be using it again because of the odor.  It&#x27;s been five hours since I put it on and it is still so strong it makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. This showed up in great condition. No damage. The jar was in it&#x27;s own box made by L&#x27;Oreal. Amazon does a great job shipping as they used plastic bubble wrap to ship this. We are using this for this summer if someone has sunburns. I like how it helps the skin so your skin does not peel. I know it says night cream, but we use it on the whole family for being outside in the sun. Great to put on after your shower, especially love this for my children. Not greasy. Feels great on the skin. My husband loves this for the back of his neck. And the kids love this too on their face. I like just using it during the day when the air seems too dry. Makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Glides on smoothly, rich in texture and can be used as a base for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;No sticky or over applied feeling, and leaves no residue.  The price of this cream&lt;br /&gt;is what attracted me to buying it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. People tell me my skin is lovely, and makes me look a lot younger than I really am. I don&#x27;t notice the fragrence than is off putting to a few reviewers. I use it day and night, as my older skin seems to need it. Over time, I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products but those did no better, so now I stay with this. Perhaps my genetics help, but people are always surprised when they learn my true age. Fewer wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Well for a cream you don&#x27;t notice is there while you&#x27;re sleeping, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a very good face cream</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I have had no regrets at al! I would recommend this item to anyone!!! Great value.</li>
            <li> Has a strong fragrance but it left my skin feeling nice next morning.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is just okay, but each person must decide for themselves. She would not purchase it asgain</li>
            <li> the price and also the product are greaet, Yes it works so get it,  We both use it as we are elderly (LOL),.  Thank you and I recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Good for a senior with dry skin.</li>
            <li> One of my Favorites, excellent night cream.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve recently changed this product, or at least, they are now selling &amp;#34;look-alikes&amp;#34; that smell more like&lt;br /&gt;old fashioned (inexpensive!) cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;So I was delighted to find this original one on Amazon and will be buying more soon - have enjoyed it for years now&lt;br /&gt;and think it is a great product &amp; moisturizer - perfect for dry skin but never oily - I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using this for quite some time.  She loves it.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail and continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product and I am so happy with the quick results!  I thought the heavy creamy look of it when I first opened the jar was going to be too thick for my face but looks were deceiving!!  It goes on more like a serum, it&#x27;s silky and not heavy at all!  Great product and the best part IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and excellent packaging for mailing!!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> very good cream, I see improvements in my skin looks smoother and firmer, fragrance leaves a rich, non-greasy, easy to spread.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect nightcream seems to be working as stated.  I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for almost 2 weeks and my face is already smoother and more radiant looking than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a night cream I liked as well &amp; I get many compliments on the improvement since I started using it.  I&#x27;m definetly going to keep using it from now on!</li>
            <li> Distance so far was sent to the security, is really very good！Want to open more 1 can direct mail to China&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> This fragrance  of this cream is very strong. I can&#x27;t accept it.</li>
            <li> It is really to heavy for me. So, If you REALLY want to be moisturized heavy, this is for you. I find it too thick and it make my face feel like grease. Like it can&#x27;t breathe. Also....I can&#x27;t imagine wearing this in the summer. The thought gives me panic attacks. YEUCK!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I love Loreal facial products/treatments and this was a good price and much less expensive than the night cream I had been using.  While it does provide great hydration, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as what I had been using.  I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  It is so light and goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Night Creme for about 6 months. It smells wonderful, absorbs into the skin quickly and has definitely helped to minimize my facial age spots. Highly recommended!</li>
