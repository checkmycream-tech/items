            <li>Definitely a favorite!</li>
            <li>Thats amazing lipstick, one that i was looking for so loooooooooooooooong, OMG</li>
            <li>This color is absolutely amazing and my go-to lip color.</li>
            <li>It makes me so happy that it is so comfortable that I forget I am even wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li>Or this organic lipstick that has an amazing color and quality: http://goo.gl/SvK1YD</li>
            <li>But if you have greenish veins, then you have warm undertones and need a orangey-red.</li>
            <li>The color looks nice on me.  </li>
            <li>This is really one of the best MAC products out there.</li>
            <li>NICE lipstick and stays on.  </li>
            <li>Wears well, nice quality.</li>
            <li>It would be great for evening, or for an intentionally bold look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use you dont need to have a doctors pulse because its not creamy.</li>
            <li>I returned it and then ordered directly from MAC (cheaper!), and the product I received from them is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is truly amazing, stays for more than 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>It probably is more suitable for a night out than office work.  </li>
            <li>Great red for an amazing price!</li>
            <li>No. 17, I can certainly say that MAC is my happy medium.</li>
            <li>The perfect color for my fair skin and dark hair!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the color, but it took a month to get delivered to me.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>Love this purchase.</li>
            <li>will def buy more of this color</li>
            <li>I know it is a cult favorite and</li>
            <li>:):)</li>
            <li>I love this colour</li>
            <li>It is sexy and sophisticated .</li>
            <li>so glad i found it :)</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the perfect red lipsticks and this is it!</li>
            <li>and I love all things that are vintage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>and I get SOOO many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love how the texture is not too creamy.</li>
            <li>but I did mix this lipstick with Ruby Woo and got an interesting result.  </li>
            <li>They better never discontinue this color</li>
            <li>I was looking for a perfect red.  </li>
            <li>Many lipsticks, especially bright reds, are simply out of the question for women of color.</li>
            <li>Recently wore it to a five course wine dinner and even after hours of eating and drinking the color looked perfect and my lips appeared untouched.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade of red, can be worn every day.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect shade of red lipstick for quite a while now.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shade of red!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for a 1940&#x27;s wow-factor, but is an okay color in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I must have researched over twenty pinup fashion sites and beauty blogs for the perfect red lipstick.</li>
            <li>So I thought this was a safe bet.</li>
            <li>Hi - I just love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>This has become my favorite brand/color of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a MAC powder and eye shadow fan and have been for many years.</li>
            <li>Plus not even sure if its an original MAC!</li>
            <li>The red is a perfect red, very bright but the matte finish doesn&#x27;t make it feel orangey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful bright but full red color without that orange tint!</li>
            <li>The hue is so rich and application is so silky and its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Upon opening, the product was perfectly packaged, same color as shown in picture online &amp; a genuine MAC lipstick.</li>
            <li>it stains (which is good) and doesn&#x27;t give you the oily feeling of most modern lipsticks who try to be &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and she confirmed that its top quality</li>
            <li>On some days I force myself to use a different kind of lipstick, just for a change, but this is by far the best and favorite.</li>
            <li>, I find the darker the red the more it belongs on at night, this one can be great for all seasons and times.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful red matte lipstick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful red with a bluish undertone, that would compliment any complexion.</li>
            <li>While just about any woman would love to own higher-end makeup, not all of us are willing to splurge a week&#x27;s worth of groceries on a tube of lipstick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The great thing about this color is that it is literally the primary color red.</li>
            <li>Though some women may think otherwise, this bright of a red doesn&#x27;t allow for notable application of blush, bronzer, or eyeshadow without the result being too overdone.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>Everyone should have a great red lipstick at her disposal.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw a friend of mine with one and the color was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Smooth texture without shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great day time red as well</li>
            <li>When I get off work I enjoy the faded look I still have, if you don&#x27;t have time to refresh it, don&#x27;t worry, your lips will still have even color even if it&#x27;s faded a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I do not understand too much, I just asked my wife if she liked it</li>
            <li>This lipstick is not a matte and goes on almost as light as a lip gloss.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly in one coat.</li>
            <li>Such a great shade and finish.</li>
            <li>Creamy texture, no bad taste, and a beautiful shade of red.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s packaging, signature Vanilla fragrance, price and overall quality are all more than fair.</li>
            <li>I am sure this is just right for someone.</li>
            <li>It is that cool, blue red that goes with the more fair skinned but would look great on anyone.</li>
            <li>this is for you and shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li>MAC Cosmetics&#x27; most popular shade of red lipstick, \\&quot;Russian Red\\&quot;, has become a staple in the makeup collection of many women, and with good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Richly pigmented (hence the price -</li>
            <li>I have a light, cool complexion</li>
            <li>exactly that has Anne Hathaway in Devil wears Prada :)</li>
            <li>I love love love red lipstick.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much superfly! :)</li>
            <li>THIS was love at first wear.</li>
            <li>Rich color, doesn&#x27;t smudge or get on my teeth, lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I originally saw this lipstick reviewed in the Sunday Magazine of our paper and am always a bit apprehensive when a reviewer says &amp;#34;I used it on all skin types&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I gave the new, unused tube to my granddaughter as the bright color, in my opinion, was more age appropriate for a teen.</li>
            <li>MAC lipsticks \\&quot;contain natural oils which function as emollients,\\&quot; which gives the lipstick a better texture, and allows the lips to retain more moisture.</li>
            <li>Great deep red color, I love it!</li>
            <li>all day leaves a nice natural tint</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these for myself and absolutely loved it, so I bought a second for my niece.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that this color would look good on everyone, but if you are looking for a real red lipstick, this is for you.</li>
            <li>When I had originally purchased my very first MAC lipstick, I was immediately drawn to the bullet-like look of the casing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true matte but not powdery finish.</li>
            <li>I can wear true reds.</li>
            <li>Perfect for stage or everyday use!!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about buying a MAC product off amazon and not the official MAC website, but much to my relief, this product was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>With all the hype about this particular color, was absolutely sure I had.</li>
            <li>I usually look great in strong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My second favorite to Rub Woo!</li>
            <li>Really smooth for a matte lipstick--I really like how it doesn&#x27;t feel like a matte lipstick at all.  </li>
            <li>oh this is an amazing color i have ever seen, this is the real red color for the lipstick</li>
            <li>I am addicted to the legendary MAC vanilla scent and flavor!</li>
            <li>It looks great on me, and I am extremely pale.</li>
            <li>I had to have me some hot girl hoochie red to brighten up my love life, it was just a callin&#x27; my name!</li>
            <li>Russian Red is great, because it&#x27;s very intense and bright and is pretty much universally flattering on pink/red undertones.  </li>
            <li>After all, you could get four tubes of that for the price of one YSL lipstick, right?</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the endurance of the package: that lipstick had sat in my bag, battered around by the various contents, and had lasted up until I had the wore the lip product down to nothing.</li>
            <li>, I love  a bold red.</li>
            <li>It is not too dark and not too bright.</li>
            <li>Its a perfect deep cool red with unnoticeable blue undertones.</li>
            <li>Great, solid matte red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought I found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;, a red lipstick I could wear daily that would stay on and look great with everything.</li>
            <li>A true red is hard to find, this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because of an article I read on pintrest &amp; when I was lucky enough to find it here was super excited.</li>
            <li>the lipsticl got here very fast.</li>
            <li>It is also a great price for Mac lipstick, and you hardly have to re-aaply.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, rich color and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought a MAC cosmetic before -- in fact, this is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; lipstick purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s matte finish will most likely break up and cause your color to fade inconstantly.</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer &amp; I will definitely be a repeat one as well.</li>
            <li>Russian Red is the perfect red and goes well with any skin color.</li>
            <li>key determining factor for most women and choosing cosmetics is price.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want that drying effect that most matte lipsticks cause, use either mac or urban decay matte lip finish.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it will dominate your face.  </li>
            <li>If you want the real deal, go to the source!</li>
            <li>It arrived on time exactly as said.</li>
            <li>counter first, and not trust reviews on the Internet.</li>
            <li>Love this shade of red!</li>
            <li>It seemed more transparent, and a different formula.  </li>
            <li>Very classy look for a special evening.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my teeth look super white, which is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous red like the bloodiest red you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I purchased Russian Red and this lipstick in particular is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>but I honestly have not met a single person who did not look absolutely amazing in Russian Red from MAC.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate your lips before wearing, it can get a bit dry, but throw a mac lip gloss over</li>
            <li>This product does not smudge easily or smear once applied and let set for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought 2 different shades and love them both!</li>
            <li>This red is amazing and it last on your lips hours and hours.</li>
            <li>, so I didn&#x27;t want it to look too gauche and ridiculous, but sexy and very bold.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Real deal, not a knock off.</li>
            <li>however the seller sent the item in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I love the shade, just what I expected.</li>
            <li>I received my lipstick in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>on smoothly..almost goes on too much, you can keep it matte or add a lipgloss.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You definitely pay more than dept store/grocery store/CVS/Walmart, but it&#x27;s worth every penny if you want to rock some REAL red lips.</li>
            <li>It makes too much of a &amp;#34;look at my lips&amp;#34; statement for that.  </li>
            <li>It apparently is this iconic red</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you prefer a not so dark shade of red.</li>
            <li>Love this color,  I have always loved red lips but have had a hard time finding the red for me.</li>
            <li>Looks like a more purple-red as opposed to a blood red or pure red.  </li>
            <li>Not a bit of orange, true red.  </li>
            <li>Deep true color.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a more dark shade considering</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s more transparent than dark.</li>
            <li>Now, not to say that a higher price directly correlates to higher quality, because the Rouge Volupté has been known to exhibit the exact same qualities--</li>
            <li>I love this Russian red lip color.</li>
            <li>Love the Russian Red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Russian Red comes packaged in the signature gunmetal lipstick casing, as most standard MAC lipsticks do.</li>
            <li>LOVE this deep red that sticks!</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find another red lipstick that comes close to even matching this red.</li>
            <li>Overwhelmingly, women said MAC Russian Red was their go-to.</li>
            <li>I love the color Russian Red,  I like the creaminess of the lipstick.</li>
            <li>Instead of the vibrant</li>
            <li>The color is a very very pretty red.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>only complaint is that if you have dry lips, this may not be the best to wear at that time.</li>
            <li>No I really mean it.</li>
            <li>I do want it a little dryer, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, a couple minutes worth of prior lip preparation is worth it for the final result the lipstick provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re not a &#x27;lips-centric&#x27; girl like me, this red puts the focus right on your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I will use it for the Halloween party we&#x27;re going too, though it wont look quite right for that, either: Morticia Addams had REAL red</li>
            <li>Additionally, use of a good lipliner (I use NARS&#x27;s Jungle Red) prior to applying Russian Red is advisable, as the lipstick may \\&quot;bleed\\&quot; otherwise.</li>
            <li>I urge businesses to send a new one to me.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>While other more modest shades of red allow a bit more leverage as far as eyeshadow intensity, I&#x27;ve found that Russian Red does not play well with others.</li>
            <li>For my dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, &amp; fair olive skin tone, this blue-based red is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply and it&#x27;s quite long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was excited when ordering the deep and luscious MAC lipstick Russia Red.</li>
            <li>Really pretty red.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using MAC lipstick and I must say that I am definitely sold!</li>
            <li>This is more of a blue red as opposed to an orangey red.</li>
            <li>I love MAC Matte Russian Red; this is not the same as the one I got on the MAC website.  </li>
            <li>Red Lizard is definitely a vibrant, bold red hue, but I tend to feel overdone when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real RED that looks absolutely stunning with a dark lipliner.</li>
            <li>I do find that my lips get a bit tight after some time, but I will just try dabbing on a light layer of lip balm on before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was very plain to see that the lipstick sold here is not an authentic MAC Lipstick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a classic red.</li>
            <li>One MAC MAU told me to wear a clear lipglass over it, and another MAU said to never use a lipglass over it....</li>
            <li>/&gt;she looks like one of the old time pinup models.</li>
            <li>I 100% recommend it if you want the old hollywood glamour look or the pinup look</li>
            <li>I am tan with yellow undertones, this shade is very flattering.</li>
            <li>I was surprised I didn&#x27;t need to reapply in the 12 hours we were shooting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, Revlon&#x27;s \\&quot;Really Red,\\&quot; has received many negative reviews, despite being a fourth of the price of YSL&#x27;s \\&quot;Rouge Volupté</li>
            <li>Rarely, if ever do I care what the Kardashian ladies wear, but I was entranced by Khloe&#x27;s red lips and Googled to find out where oh where could I rock some red lips llke that??  </li>
            <li>I loved it but the lipstick had a weird taste to it .</li>
            <li>However, Russian Red has just the right amount of blues to compliment quite literally any skin tone imaginable.</li>
            <li>But holy cow I never feel so sexy as when I&#x27;m wearing MAC Russian Red!!!</li>
            <li>So vibrant yet so matte, this red is great.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>I never have found a red that looks decent.  </li>
            <li>but it is not work appropriate unless you mix w pink and tone it down.</li>
            <li>Purple or bluish, way too cartoonish and over the top to wear to work, and not a true, deep red, at all.</li>
            <li>Lipsticks in the same basic shade of red are available in three basic price ranges: low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li>Mac Russian Red is a true red shade that I find I can wear daily in a professional work setting as well as for dressier occasions.</li>
            <li>If you have blue veins, it means you have cool undertones and need a blue-based red, like Russian Red.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Can be a bit cakey after a full day...but most lipstick can, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;2) Stains clothes and skin even worse than other red lipsticks, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having tried other similar lip products, such as MAC&#x27;s \\&quot;Red,\\&quot; Smashbox&#x27;s \\&quot;Bacio,\\&quot; and NARS&#x27; \\&quot;Jungle Red,\\&quot; among many others, Russian Red takes the cake.</li>
            <li>No other product provides a universally classic, Marilyn Monroe-esque look quite as well as Russian Red.</li>
            <li>To me, it is a shade or two lighter than a classic red, and it has an almost pink/orange undertone that gives it some extra brightness.  </li>
            <li>When the proposal delivery or open to have a look to confirm goods is shipped complete.</li>
            <li>It strikes me as spicy and makes me look mature and mysterious.</li>
            <li>But was pleasantly surprised that it arrived and did not melt in the southern heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MAC&#x27;s Russian Red lipstick is a classified as a matte finish, with an intense blue undertone.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lipstick because MAC is frequently touted as one of the longest lasting brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this one only one time so far, but it does seem to stay on.  </li>
            <li>I can wear neutral and pastel clothing, but not brights saturated with intense color and certainly not orange or purple.</li>
            <li>For example, a shade of red Revlon lipstick from CVS Drugstore might cost about seven to eight dollars, while a tube of red lipstick from Yves-Saint Laurent&#x27;s cosmetic counter should be upwards of $32.50, putting MAC&#x27;s product right about center.</li>
            <li>As someone who personally prefers the satin finish over any of the other formulas offered by MAC, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the fluidity of the lipstick was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>I will wear it again but only in high-maintenance friendly situations and stick with my usual no-mirror-needed translucent otherwise.  </li>
            <li>MAC&#x27;s Russian Red, along with all of their other lip products I&#x27;ve tried so far, really does emphasize the notion of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\</li>
            <li>Unlike many other lipsticks that advertise the \\&quot;matte look\\&quot; as the end result, Russian Red goes on without leaving the lips feeling parched or stiff.</li>
            <li>meaning they transfer instantly to glasses, napkins, teeth, and well, you know, in general on everything.</li>
            <li>When the order arrived in a clear sealed package stamped Russian Red on the label upon opening it the lipstick inside was not red.</li>
            <li>Use a lip liner, because it can get pretty messy.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a red lipstick, not orange, not dark red, but crayon red.  </li>
            <li>I had to apply several coats to get a true red color on my lips, and after blotting, it was hardly the impact I was going for.</li>
            <li>The packaging is simple yet elegant, and the dark, shimmery color scheme adds an edgy touch.</li>
            <li>Lip stick was old hard and very sticky to apply .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thats amazing lipstick, one that i was looking for so loooooooooooooooong, OMG</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely amazing and my go-to lip color.</li>
            <li> It makes me so happy that it is so comfortable that I forget I am even wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li> Or this organic lipstick that has an amazing color and quality: http://goo.gl/SvK1YD</li>
            <li> But if you have greenish veins, then you have warm undertones and need a orangey-red.</li>
            <li> The color looks nice on me.  </li>
            <li> This is really one of the best MAC products out there.</li>
            <li> NICE lipstick and stays on.  </li>
            <li> Wears well, nice quality.</li>
            <li> It would be great for evening, or for an intentionally bold look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use you dont need to have a doctors pulse because its not creamy.</li>
            <li> I returned it and then ordered directly from MAC (cheaper!), and the product I received from them is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is truly amazing, stays for more than 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> It probably is more suitable for a night out than office work.  </li>
            <li> Great red for an amazing price!</li>
            <li> No. 17, I can certainly say that MAC is my happy medium.</li>
            <li> The perfect color for my fair skin and dark hair!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the color, but it took a month to get delivered to me.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase.</li>
            <li> will def buy more of this color</li>
            <li> I know it is a cult favorite and</li>
            <li> :):)</li>
            <li> I love this colour</li>
            <li> It is sexy and sophisticated .</li>
            <li> so glad i found it :)</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the perfect red lipsticks and this is it!</li>
            <li> and I love all things that are vintage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it</li>
            <li> and I get SOOO many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love how the texture is not too creamy.</li>
            <li> but I did mix this lipstick with Ruby Woo and got an interesting result.  </li>
            <li> They better never discontinue this color</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfect red.  </li>
            <li> Many lipsticks, especially bright reds, are simply out of the question for women of color.</li>
            <li> Recently wore it to a five course wine dinner and even after hours of eating and drinking the color looked perfect and my lips appeared untouched.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red, can be worn every day.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect shade of red lipstick for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shade of red!  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for a 1940&#x27;s wow-factor, but is an okay color in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I must have researched over twenty pinup fashion sites and beauty blogs for the perfect red lipstick.</li>
            <li> So I thought this was a safe bet.</li>
            <li> Hi - I just love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li> This has become my favorite brand/color of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a MAC powder and eye shadow fan and have been for many years.</li>
            <li> Plus not even sure if its an original MAC!</li>
            <li> The red is a perfect red, very bright but the matte finish doesn&#x27;t make it feel orangey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful bright but full red color without that orange tint!</li>
            <li> The hue is so rich and application is so silky and its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Upon opening, the product was perfectly packaged, same color as shown in picture online &amp; a genuine MAC lipstick.</li>
            <li> it stains (which is good) and doesn&#x27;t give you the oily feeling of most modern lipsticks who try to be &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and she confirmed that its top quality</li>
            <li> On some days I force myself to use a different kind of lipstick, just for a change, but this is by far the best and favorite.</li>
            <li> , I find the darker the red the more it belongs on at night, this one can be great for all seasons and times.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful red matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful red with a bluish undertone, that would compliment any complexion.</li>
            <li> While just about any woman would love to own higher-end makeup, not all of us are willing to splurge a week&#x27;s worth of groceries on a tube of lipstick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The great thing about this color is that it is literally the primary color red.</li>
            <li> Though some women may think otherwise, this bright of a red doesn&#x27;t allow for notable application of blush, bronzer, or eyeshadow without the result being too overdone.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have a great red lipstick at her disposal.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a friend of mine with one and the color was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Smooth texture without shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great day time red as well</li>
            <li> When I get off work I enjoy the faded look I still have, if you don&#x27;t have time to refresh it, don&#x27;t worry, your lips will still have even color even if it&#x27;s faded a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I do not understand too much, I just asked my wife if she liked it</li>
            <li> This lipstick is not a matte and goes on almost as light as a lip gloss.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly in one coat.</li>
            <li> Such a great shade and finish.</li>
            <li> Creamy texture, no bad taste, and a beautiful shade of red.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s packaging, signature Vanilla fragrance, price and overall quality are all more than fair.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is just right for someone.</li>
            <li> It is that cool, blue red that goes with the more fair skinned but would look great on anyone.</li>
            <li> this is for you and shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> MAC Cosmetics&#x27; most popular shade of red lipstick, \\&quot;Russian Red\\&quot;, has become a staple in the makeup collection of many women, and with good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Richly pigmented (hence the price -</li>
            <li> I have a light, cool complexion</li>
            <li> exactly that has Anne Hathaway in Devil wears Prada :)</li>
            <li> I love love love red lipstick.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much superfly! :)</li>
            <li> THIS was love at first wear.</li>
            <li> Rich color, doesn&#x27;t smudge or get on my teeth, lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I originally saw this lipstick reviewed in the Sunday Magazine of our paper and am always a bit apprehensive when a reviewer says &amp;#34;I used it on all skin types&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I gave the new, unused tube to my granddaughter as the bright color, in my opinion, was more age appropriate for a teen.</li>
            <li> MAC lipsticks \\&quot;contain natural oils which function as emollients,\\&quot; which gives the lipstick a better texture, and allows the lips to retain more moisture.</li>
            <li> Great deep red color, I love it!</li>
            <li> all day leaves a nice natural tint</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these for myself and absolutely loved it, so I bought a second for my niece.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that this color would look good on everyone, but if you are looking for a real red lipstick, this is for you.</li>
            <li> When I had originally purchased my very first MAC lipstick, I was immediately drawn to the bullet-like look of the casing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true matte but not powdery finish.</li>
            <li> I can wear true reds.</li>
            <li> Perfect for stage or everyday use!!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying a MAC product off amazon and not the official MAC website, but much to my relief, this product was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> With all the hype about this particular color, was absolutely sure I had.</li>
            <li> I usually look great in strong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My second favorite to Rub Woo!</li>
            <li> Really smooth for a matte lipstick--I really like how it doesn&#x27;t feel like a matte lipstick at all.  </li>
            <li> oh this is an amazing color i have ever seen, this is the real red color for the lipstick</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the legendary MAC vanilla scent and flavor!</li>
            <li> It looks great on me, and I am extremely pale.</li>
            <li> I had to have me some hot girl hoochie red to brighten up my love life, it was just a callin&#x27; my name!</li>
            <li> Russian Red is great, because it&#x27;s very intense and bright and is pretty much universally flattering on pink/red undertones.  </li>
            <li> After all, you could get four tubes of that for the price of one YSL lipstick, right?</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the endurance of the package: that lipstick had sat in my bag, battered around by the various contents, and had lasted up until I had the wore the lip product down to nothing.</li>
            <li> , I love  a bold red.</li>
            <li> It is not too dark and not too bright.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect deep cool red with unnoticeable blue undertones.</li>
            <li> Great, solid matte red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought I found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;, a red lipstick I could wear daily that would stay on and look great with everything.</li>
            <li> A true red is hard to find, this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because of an article I read on pintrest &amp; when I was lucky enough to find it here was super excited.</li>
            <li> the lipsticl got here very fast.</li>
            <li> It is also a great price for Mac lipstick, and you hardly have to re-aaply.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, rich color and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a MAC cosmetic before -- in fact, this is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; lipstick purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s matte finish will most likely break up and cause your color to fade inconstantly.</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer &amp; I will definitely be a repeat one as well.</li>
            <li> Russian Red is the perfect red and goes well with any skin color.</li>
            <li> key determining factor for most women and choosing cosmetics is price.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want that drying effect that most matte lipsticks cause, use either mac or urban decay matte lip finish.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it will dominate your face.  </li>
            <li> If you want the real deal, go to the source!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time exactly as said.</li>
            <li> counter first, and not trust reviews on the Internet.</li>
            <li> Love this shade of red!</li>
            <li> It seemed more transparent, and a different formula.  </li>
            <li> Very classy look for a special evening.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my teeth look super white, which is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous red like the bloodiest red you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I purchased Russian Red and this lipstick in particular is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> but I honestly have not met a single person who did not look absolutely amazing in Russian Red from MAC.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate your lips before wearing, it can get a bit dry, but throw a mac lip gloss over</li>
            <li> This product does not smudge easily or smear once applied and let set for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought 2 different shades and love them both!</li>
            <li> This red is amazing and it last on your lips hours and hours.</li>
            <li> , so I didn&#x27;t want it to look too gauche and ridiculous, but sexy and very bold.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Real deal, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> however the seller sent the item in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I love the shade, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I received my lipstick in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> on smoothly..almost goes on too much, you can keep it matte or add a lipgloss.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You definitely pay more than dept store/grocery store/CVS/Walmart, but it&#x27;s worth every penny if you want to rock some REAL red lips.</li>
            <li> It makes too much of a &amp;#34;look at my lips&amp;#34; statement for that.  </li>
            <li> It apparently is this iconic red</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you prefer a not so dark shade of red.</li>
            <li> Love this color,  I have always loved red lips but have had a hard time finding the red for me.</li>
            <li> Looks like a more purple-red as opposed to a blood red or pure red.  </li>
            <li> Not a bit of orange, true red.  </li>
            <li> Deep true color.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a more dark shade considering</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s more transparent than dark.</li>
            <li> Now, not to say that a higher price directly correlates to higher quality, because the Rouge Volupté has been known to exhibit the exact same qualities--</li>
            <li> I love this Russian red lip color.</li>
            <li> Love the Russian Red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Russian Red comes packaged in the signature gunmetal lipstick casing, as most standard MAC lipsticks do.</li>
            <li> LOVE this deep red that sticks!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find another red lipstick that comes close to even matching this red.</li>
            <li> Overwhelmingly, women said MAC Russian Red was their go-to.</li>
            <li> I love the color Russian Red,  I like the creaminess of the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Instead of the vibrant</li>
            <li> The color is a very very pretty red.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> only complaint is that if you have dry lips, this may not be the best to wear at that time.</li>
            <li> No I really mean it.</li>
            <li> I do want it a little dryer, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, a couple minutes worth of prior lip preparation is worth it for the final result the lipstick provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re not a &#x27;lips-centric&#x27; girl like me, this red puts the focus right on your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I will use it for the Halloween party we&#x27;re going too, though it wont look quite right for that, either: Morticia Addams had REAL red</li>
            <li> Additionally, use of a good lipliner (I use NARS&#x27;s Jungle Red) prior to applying Russian Red is advisable, as the lipstick may \\&quot;bleed\\&quot; otherwise.</li>
            <li> I urge businesses to send a new one to me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> While other more modest shades of red allow a bit more leverage as far as eyeshadow intensity, I&#x27;ve found that Russian Red does not play well with others.</li>
            <li> For my dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, &amp; fair olive skin tone, this blue-based red is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply and it&#x27;s quite long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was excited when ordering the deep and luscious MAC lipstick Russia Red.</li>
            <li> Really pretty red.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using MAC lipstick and I must say that I am definitely sold!</li>
            <li> This is more of a blue red as opposed to an orangey red.</li>
            <li> I love MAC Matte Russian Red; this is not the same as the one I got on the MAC website.  </li>
            <li> Red Lizard is definitely a vibrant, bold red hue, but I tend to feel overdone when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real RED that looks absolutely stunning with a dark lipliner.</li>
            <li> I do find that my lips get a bit tight after some time, but I will just try dabbing on a light layer of lip balm on before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was very plain to see that the lipstick sold here is not an authentic MAC Lipstick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a classic red.</li>
            <li> One MAC MAU told me to wear a clear lipglass over it, and another MAU said to never use a lipglass over it....</li>
            <li> /&gt;she looks like one of the old time pinup models.</li>
            <li> I 100% recommend it if you want the old hollywood glamour look or the pinup look</li>
            <li> I am tan with yellow undertones, this shade is very flattering.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I didn&#x27;t need to reapply in the 12 hours we were shooting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Revlon&#x27;s \\&quot;Really Red,\\&quot; has received many negative reviews, despite being a fourth of the price of YSL&#x27;s \\&quot;Rouge Volupté</li>
            <li> Rarely, if ever do I care what the Kardashian ladies wear, but I was entranced by Khloe&#x27;s red lips and Googled to find out where oh where could I rock some red lips llke that??  </li>
            <li> I loved it but the lipstick had a weird taste to it .</li>
            <li> However, Russian Red has just the right amount of blues to compliment quite literally any skin tone imaginable.</li>
            <li> But holy cow I never feel so sexy as when I&#x27;m wearing MAC Russian Red!!!</li>
            <li> So vibrant yet so matte, this red is great.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> I never have found a red that looks decent.  </li>
            <li> but it is not work appropriate unless you mix w pink and tone it down.</li>
            <li> Purple or bluish, way too cartoonish and over the top to wear to work, and not a true, deep red, at all.</li>
            <li> Lipsticks in the same basic shade of red are available in three basic price ranges: low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li> Mac Russian Red is a true red shade that I find I can wear daily in a professional work setting as well as for dressier occasions.</li>
            <li> If you have blue veins, it means you have cool undertones and need a blue-based red, like Russian Red.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Can be a bit cakey after a full day...but most lipstick can, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;2) Stains clothes and skin even worse than other red lipsticks, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having tried other similar lip products, such as MAC&#x27;s \\&quot;Red,\\&quot; Smashbox&#x27;s \\&quot;Bacio,\\&quot; and NARS&#x27; \\&quot;Jungle Red,\\&quot; among many others, Russian Red takes the cake.</li>
            <li> No other product provides a universally classic, Marilyn Monroe-esque look quite as well as Russian Red.</li>
            <li> To me, it is a shade or two lighter than a classic red, and it has an almost pink/orange undertone that gives it some extra brightness.  </li>
            <li> When the proposal delivery or open to have a look to confirm goods is shipped complete.</li>
            <li> It strikes me as spicy and makes me look mature and mysterious.</li>
            <li> But was pleasantly surprised that it arrived and did not melt in the southern heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MAC&#x27;s Russian Red lipstick is a classified as a matte finish, with an intense blue undertone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lipstick because MAC is frequently touted as one of the longest lasting brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this one only one time so far, but it does seem to stay on.  </li>
            <li> I can wear neutral and pastel clothing, but not brights saturated with intense color and certainly not orange or purple.</li>
            <li> For example, a shade of red Revlon lipstick from CVS Drugstore might cost about seven to eight dollars, while a tube of red lipstick from Yves-Saint Laurent&#x27;s cosmetic counter should be upwards of $32.50, putting MAC&#x27;s product right about center.</li>
            <li> As someone who personally prefers the satin finish over any of the other formulas offered by MAC, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the fluidity of the lipstick was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I will wear it again but only in high-maintenance friendly situations and stick with my usual no-mirror-needed translucent otherwise.  </li>
            <li> MAC&#x27;s Russian Red, along with all of their other lip products I&#x27;ve tried so far, really does emphasize the notion of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\</li>
            <li> Unlike many other lipsticks that advertise the \\&quot;matte look\\&quot; as the end result, Russian Red goes on without leaving the lips feeling parched or stiff.</li>
            <li> meaning they transfer instantly to glasses, napkins, teeth, and well, you know, in general on everything.</li>
            <li> When the order arrived in a clear sealed package stamped Russian Red on the label upon opening it the lipstick inside was not red.</li>
            <li> Use a lip liner, because it can get pretty messy.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a red lipstick, not orange, not dark red, but crayon red.  </li>
            <li> I had to apply several coats to get a true red color on my lips, and after blotting, it was hardly the impact I was going for.</li>
            <li> The packaging is simple yet elegant, and the dark, shimmery color scheme adds an edgy touch.</li>
            <li> Lip stick was old hard and very sticky to apply .</li>
            <li> I decided to order,MAC Matte Russian Red directly from MAC.When compared next to each other</li>
            <li> This red has blue undertones which leads to a vibrant sensual red, unlike lipsticks with orange undertones that bring out an uneven skin tone, and make your teeth look yellow.  </li>
            <li> generally do not wear a lot of red lipsticks, but when I do, this is my &#x27;go to&#x27; color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very dramatic and captivating red.</li>
            <li> Fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> The color last all day long</li>
            <li> it is long lasting, and the color is just what i thought it was and stays just like you put it on</li>
            <li> this is s***ty (excuse my French) lipstick.</li>
            <li> &quot; Revlon&#x27;s shade has been known to bleed horrendously, require numerous re-applications, and dry the lips out throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The only downfall to such an electric shade is that it must be the center of attention.</li>
            <li> This is not real MAC brand Russian Red.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick because there is very little feathering, and for us older gals in our 40&#x27;s, feathering is an issue.  </li>
            <li> I had originally wanted to replace a Maybelline lipstick that broke in my purse (which left an awful, irremovable mess that ultimately left me having to replace the bag), but instead opted for one of my very first \\&quot;high end\\&quot; makeup</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very fair-skinned, with dark brown hair and medium brown eyes and little to no natural color to my lips or cheeks.</li>
            <li> It is not a deep, dark red like it looks in the picture.  </li>
            <li> You may need to touch up every few hours after eating or drinking, but not too frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stayed on for a long time, a plus.</li>
            <li> , BLACK, LATINA, ASIAN, WHITE , ETC .&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s purely color, maybe prep your lips with some serious lip balm -</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on its other qualities since I haven&#x27;t worn it outside of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> They just have an established brand but there are other lippies that women need to try especially those that are paraben-free.</li>
            <li> Lasts very long on your lips even after having dinner and drinks.</li>
            <li> but it can dry out your lips</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.  </li>
            <li> Too dark red and cannot stay long on my lips.</li>
            <li> Not a russian red color..its like pale orange like peach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sour taste, overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Africa American women and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well, my skin type is a little tough - brunette with yellow undertones and blue eyes (as well as older) but thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li> It could be a old lipstick they sent me but the color is almost orange red on me not successful for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mistake the word deep for dark!</li>
            <li> I want to like it, but it&#x27;s just a little too glaring on me for daily use.  </li>
            <li> It stays on for a LOONNG time, but it&#x27;s matte, so it&#x27;s not very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a real Mac product</li>
            <li> Was drying on my lips and had to keep putting on gloss to moisturize, a minus.</li>
            <li> Not that matte as expected.</li>
            <li> I have found that without having exfoliated and moisturized my lips thoroughly, the product tends to look dry, flaky and overall unappealing shortly after application.</li>
            <li> this is clearly a knockoff,  and not a good one.</li>
            <li> but it is not exactly a mat lipstick</li>
            <li> I never had problems with other brands of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> - SHE IS SOLD ON THE PRODUCT AND WILL NOT USE ANY OTHER.  </li>
            <li> Any tube of standard finish lipstick from MAC will usually range from $14.50, and increase from there.</li>
            <li> When looking at the lable on the bottom of the black tube the color in the container was</li>
            <li> And also half of the bottle is MELTED.</li>
            <li> Gross, because we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this fake red.</li>
            <li> The shade looks like the picture when applied little.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the shipping of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get to me but now that i have it, I feel like a little girl playing in her mothers lipstick again.</li>
            <li> though matte red, it appears to be a very dull version.</li>
            <li> It did smear badly when drinking coffee just after applying it, another minus, though what was left did last for hours after that, a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaging is no problem, but when you open to paste has been broken into two pieces.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick almost everyday</li>
            <li> But it leaves stain on lips by the end of the day like an old and expired lipstick:( Not sure if the seller sold me an old one, since the box doesn&#x27;t have any info.</li>
            <li> With shipping, I just wasted twenty-one bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale (NW15)</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried go on way too thick or are the wrong shade of red.</li>
            <li> It lasts for at least a few hours on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being an NC45 in MAC foundation, it is quite difficult to find a shade of red that complements my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have ever purchased a mac lipstick before its small.</li>
            <li> Not a very good red color for it to be so expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have put up with any of the above if it had looked halfway decent on me, but it looked awful, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to judge a color when purchasing online, of course, so</li>
            <li> I ordered this with over night shipping (came late) to match a dress I have.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I don&#x27;t see what all that fuss was about, and for as expensive as it is, this was a total waste.</li>
            <li> The color was wrong and the logo was not genuine.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> It is not even a matte lipstick at least!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is completely different as well the color!&lt;br /&gt;The seller should tell people that he sells some lipstick but for shore not MAC lipsctick!&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff is fake as a $2.00 bill</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t gO wrong with Mac.</li>
            <li> Theirs not a sensation of stickiness, or weird taste.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with mac lipstick</li>
            <li> this is fake Mac lipstick.</li>
            <li> FAKE.  </li>
            <li> The smell was of stale wax, face powder/liquid foundation and petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> I expected that the writers were insane, but purchased it anyway in the off chance that it worked....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so mad.</li>
            <li> But I just hate this lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and feel swindled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tasted and smelled awful according to my husband, who kissed me when I wore it.</li>
            <li> Smelled awful to me, just wearing it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I had read that this was the red for every complexion. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t for me.  I can&#x27;t comment on its other qualities since I haven&#x27;t worn it outside of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick because there is very little feathering, and for us older gals in our 40&#x27;s, feathering is an issue.  Everyone should have a great red lipstick at her disposal.</li>
            <li> I had to have me some hot girl hoochie red to brighten up my love life, it was just a callin&#x27; my name! I purchased me some and it arrived lick-iddy split! Best dang part was that it smells and tastes a lil&#x27; like candy. I won&#x27;t eat it if you don&#x27;t! Just kidding, I&#x27;m totally going to eat it. All of it.</li>
            <li> Not a russian red color..its like pale orange like peach.</li>
            <li> Lives up to ALL the hype, thank goodness. I&#x27;ve never bought a MAC cosmetic before -- in fact, this is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; lipstick purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) For my dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, &amp; fair olive skin tone, this blue-based red is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;2) Richly pigmented (hence the price - but you are getting what you pay for)&lt;br /&gt;3) Haven&#x27;t had the &amp;#34;over-dry&amp;#34; lips problem that some reviewers mentioned, and it does stay on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Can be a bit cakey after a full day...but most lipstick can, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;2) Stains clothes and skin even worse than other red lipsticks, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ADVICE: Give it a try. PS: DO use lip liner...and...DON&#x27;T skip the lip liner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the color, but it took a month to get delivered to me.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it I&#x27;m dusky skin but it is not exactly a mat lipstick</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great quality. I use it in combination of Mac Bombshell. Very classy look for a special evening. I also wore this lipstick for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I like this product n its quality is too good n if u like red color you can choose this one , i like its quality n i get this item from amazon n delivery is earlier as they mentioned</li>
            <li> Really smooth for a matte lipstick--I really like how it doesn&#x27;t feel like a matte lipstick at all.  I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Packaging is no problem, but when you open to paste has been broken into two pieces. It&#x27;s incredible. When the proposal delivery or open to have a look to confirm goods is shipped complete. I urge businesses to send a new one to me. Or you can choose to return.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a friend of mine with one and the color was fantastic.  However, it caused me to have cracked lips.  I had a Mac lipstick about 10 years ago and it also gave me cracked lips.  I never had problems with other brands of lipstick.  So maybe Mac is not for me.  I just gave this one to my friend.</li>
            <li> I love this Russian red lip color. It is not too dark and not too bright. It strikes me as spicy and makes me look mature and mysterious. It came in great condition and on time. Lasts me almost 3 hours before i need to reapply. It was a great buy. Love this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick almost everyday this is a very beautiful color stay power is awsome last me all day leaves a nice natural tint will def buy more of this color</li>
            <li> Elias review: tamem product</li>
            <li> I was excited when ordering the deep and luscious MAC lipstick Russia Red. When the order arrived in a clear sealed package stamped Russian Red on the label upon opening it the lipstick inside was not red. When looking at the lable on the bottom of the black tube the color in the container was \\&quot;Candy Yum Yum,\\&quot;  Guess mix-ups happen. I gave the new, unused tube to my granddaughter as the bright color, in my opinion, was more age appropriate for a teen.</li>
            <li> Lip stick was old hard and very sticky to apply .</li>
            <li> This is the softest red lipstick.  The texture is matte; apply with a lipstick brush for an even perfect outline.  Smooth texture without shine.</li>
            <li> My second favorite to Rub Woo!</li>
            <li> Awesome lipstick, purchase it you will never regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Russian Red. It is that cool, blue red that goes with the more fair skinned but would look great on anyone.</li>
            <li> No smudge, great smell, smooth application, if I could by 1000 of these I would best lipstick I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> This is another item I purchased for my daughter for her Rockabilly phase.&lt;br /&gt;When she puts her hair up in victory curls, puts on this very red lipstick with her swing dress&lt;br /&gt;she looks like one of the old time pinup models. She is over 21.</li>
            <li> I know it is a cult favorite and Marilyn Monroe used it.  I have a light, cool complexion and it is really good for me.  On online dating sites men will comment on my red lipstick--yes, ladies, it is true--men like red lipstick!</li>
            <li> I was suspicious when this arrived.It was pinkish red and looked nothing like pictures I&#x27;ve seen of people wearing, MAC Matte Russian Red.It went on sheer,not Matte at all.I decided to order,MAC Matte Russian Red directly from MAC.When compared next to each other it was very plain to see that the lipstick sold here is not an authentic MAC Lipstick.The one I bought from, http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/shaded/168/310/Products/Lips/Lipstick/Lipstick/index.tmpl number is AA3.The one I bought from this seller is A12.I took pictures to show the difference,I wish I could post them.Very disappointed and feel swindled.I&#x27;m sending it back,hopefully I&#x27;ll get a refund.</li>
            <li> This item was counterfeit. The color was wrong and the logo was not genuine. Don&#x27;t buy this item, go to the MAC store.</li>
            <li> I loved it but the lipstick had a weird taste to it . It&#x27;s a sour taste, overall it&#x27;s very nice</li>
            <li> This lipstick is truly amazing, stays for more than 4 hours.  I love it and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> It is not a MAC lipstick!! It is not even a matte lipstick at least!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is completely different as well the color!&lt;br /&gt;The seller should tell people that he sells some lipstick but for shore not MAC lipsctick!&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed! Don&#x27;t buy this lipstick ever!!!</li>
            <li> The perfect color for my fair skin and dark hair! I am addicted to the legendary MAC vanilla scent and flavor! Make sure you exfoliate your lips before wearing, it can get a bit dry, but throw a mac lip gloss over and you&#x27;re good :):)</li>
            <li> Really pretty red. Fairly long lasting. Doesn&#x27;t bleed. I highly recommend this as a classic red. I imagine it would look good on all skin tones. It looks great on me, and I am extremely pale.</li>
            <li> Real deal, not a knock off. The lipstick was matte and lasted for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this colour it is the best I ever had !! It is sexy and sophisticated . I love it !!!</li>
            <li> Definitely get a liner for this one. The red is a perfect red, very bright but the matte finish doesn&#x27;t make it feel orangey, it lets it be itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great day time red as well, I find the darker the red the more it belongs on at night, this one can be great for all seasons and times.  It lasts for at least a few hours on. When I get off work I enjoy the faded look I still have, if you don&#x27;t have time to refresh it, don&#x27;t worry, your lips will still have even color even if it&#x27;s faded a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that if you have dry lips, this may not be the best to wear at that time. I find that it does not moisturize, it&#x27;s purely color, maybe prep your lips with some serious lip balm - let it sit for a while, then remove before applying, this color should not be topped with gloss either, it&#x27;s matte finish will most likely break up and cause your color to fade inconstantly.</li>
            <li> GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER - SHE IS SOLD ON THE PRODUCT AND WILL NOT USE ANY OTHER.  IF SHE DOES NOT HAVE IT SHE GOES WITHOUT!.</li>
            <li> Thats amazing lipstick, one that i was looking for so loooooooooooooooong, OMG im so glad i found it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its exactly that has Anne Hathaway in Devil wears Prada :)</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these for myself and absolutely loved it, so I bought a second for my niece.  It is also a great price for Mac lipstick, and you hardly have to re-aaply.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new.  I&#x27;ve heard that MAC products are good and I wanted to try the matted feel.  When I wear it, I feel like people are staring at me.  My 2 year looked at me and thought I had blood on my lips.  It probably is more suitable for a night out than office work.  When I kissed my son, it did show on him, but just a bit. It is a statement lipstick.  Delivery was great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of an article I read on pintrest &amp; when I was lucky enough to find it here was super excited. It&#x27;s a great wear &amp; my husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I just love it. This red is amazing and it last on your lips hours and hours. It is very easy to use you dont need to have a doctors pulse because its not creamy.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using MAC lipstick and I must say that I am definitely sold! I actually bought 2 different shades and love them both!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and it has almost a mint/chocolate smell! The color last all day long but it can dry out your lips but it&#x27;s matte and they all tend to do that. I 100% recommend it if you want the old hollywood glamour look or the pinup look this is for you and shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful red matte lipstick. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Turn your wrist upwards to see the color of your veins.  If you have blue veins, it means you have cool undertones and need a blue-based red, like Russian Red.  But if you have greenish veins, then you have warm undertones and need a orangey-red.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the perfect red lipsticks and this is it!</li>
            <li> This is a MAC product só As I do not understand too much, I just asked my wife if she liked it and she confirmed that its top quality</li>
            <li> I love love love red lipstick. It is my go-to color and I love all things that are vintage. I feel like a pinup girl when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this color is that it is literally the primary color red. It worked well on my skintone since I am on the fair side of medium, so it worked for me. This is more of a blue red as opposed to an orangey red. I can&#x27;t imagine that this color would look good on everyone, but if you are looking for a real red lipstick, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and I get SOOO many compliments when I wear it. I work in a restaurant and I&#x27;m always at the grill and the heat/greasy air doesn&#x27;t affect the way the lipstick stays on. &amp;#60;3 MAC!!</li>
            <li> THIS COLOR IS GREAT FOR ALL WOMEN OF COLOR !!! , BLACK, LATINA, ASIAN, WHITE , ETC .&lt;br /&gt;YES # 1 GREAT COLOR , lovely color on any woman, I love  a bold red.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is perfect on others, not for me.Too dark red and cannot stay long on my lips. Smell is so good.</li>
            <li> It is not the red that I was looking for (I think I need to go the store, so I can actually see the color I am looking for) however the seller sent the item in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. The color is a very very pretty red. it lasts a good while also. Great product, would def. recommend.</li>
            <li> A true red is hard to find, this one is perfect.  Not a bit of orange, true red.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect Color and shipped so fast!</li>
            <li> I love MAC Matte Russian Red; this is not the same as the one I got on the MAC website.  This one says A12 and mine says A33 on the bottom.  This lipstick is not a matte and goes on almost as light as a lip gloss. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Perfect lips... perfect lipstick</li>
            <li> Great, solid matte red. Deep true color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a very special Lady and she loved it! She never had this color before. I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love how the texture is not too creamy. it&#x27;s easy to apply and it&#x27;s quite long lasting. the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that when I apply it on my nude lips I can see that there&#x27;s an orange undertone to it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a more dark shade considering it&#x27;s \\&quot;matte.\\&quot; It&#x27;s more transparent than dark. It&#x27;s good if you prefer a not so dark shade of red.</li>
            <li> I wanted a red similar to Scarlett Johanson....I have yet to discover...but I did mix this lipstick with Ruby Woo and got an interesting result.  The color looks nice on me.  I am a brown complected individual so I can wear reds.  I like using the two together.</li>
            <li> I love the shade, just what I expected. But it leaves stain on lips by the end of the day like an old and expired lipstick:( Not sure if the seller sold me an old one, since the box doesn&#x27;t have any info. Plus not even sure if its an original MAC! But shade is awesome. The shade looks like the picture when applied little.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying a MAC product off amazon and not the official MAC website, but much to my relief, this product was perfect. This color is absolutely amazing and my go-to lip color. Red lipstick can be tricky. Not every shade goes with every complexion but I honestly have not met a single person who did not look absolutely amazing in Russian Red from MAC. Also, it&#x27;s Matte. Matte lipstick is the best, in my opinion. This is really one of the best MAC products out there. They better never discontinue this color or I&#x27;m pulling an Elaine from Seinfeld with the Sponge.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product &amp; this seller. I received my lipstick in a very timely fashion. Upon opening, the product was perfectly packaged, same color as shown in picture online &amp; a genuine MAC lipstick. I am a satisfied customer &amp; I will definitely be a repeat one as well. Thank you so much superfly! :)</li>
            <li> Russian Red is the perfect red and goes well with any skin color. This lipstick also lasts FOREVER. No I really mean it. I have to take it off with baby wipes at the end of the night from applying it in the AM. But, that&#x27;s what ALL woman want is lip color that last ALL day. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfect red.  I&#x27;m pale (NW15), so I didn&#x27;t want it to look too gauche and ridiculous, but sexy and very bold.  Russian Red is great, because it&#x27;s very intense and bright and is pretty much universally flattering on pink/red undertones.  It actually makes my teeth look super white, which is really nice.  It stays on for a LOONNG time, but it&#x27;s matte, so it&#x27;s not very hydrating.  Use a lip liner, because it can get pretty messy.  One MAC MAU told me to wear a clear lipglass over it, and another MAU said to never use a lipglass over it....so, it just depends on my mood.  Great red for an amazing price!</li>
            <li> A friend wore this to a Christmas Party 2013. She told me it was rated the &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; red lipstick among all lipsticks! Though pricey, it looks great on ANYONE! Creamy texture, no bad taste, and a beautiful shade of red. I am so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the shipping of cosmetics. But was pleasantly surprised that it arrived and did not melt in the southern heat.</li>
            <li> So vibrant yet so matte, this red is great.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly..almost goes on too much, you can keep it matte or add a lipgloss.</li>
            <li> Looking for a red lipstick, not orange, not dark red, but crayon red.  I put it on and it was beautiful.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this color,  I have always loved red lips but have had a hard time finding the red for me. THIS was love at first wear. It lasted throughout the night and turned heads constantly.</li>
            <li> The best color I have had in a while. I wish it didn&#x27;t come off on my hand or nails if I get too close to my lips.  It looks dryer than it is. I do want it a little dryer, but I still love it.  My mouth looks so sensual. Beautiful tube too.</li>
            <li> Looks good on ME !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> oh this is an amazing color i have ever seen, this is the real red color for the lipstick</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is fake as a $2.00 bill no thank you never again! It could be a old lipstick they sent me but the color is almost orange red on me not successful for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Came in good timing! Amazing quality and works with my skin tone! I&#x27;m a Africa American women and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s really good!</li>
            <li> MAC Cosmetics&#x27; most popular shade of red lipstick, \\&quot;Russian Red\\&quot;, has become a staple in the makeup collection of many women, and with good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russian Red comes packaged in the signature gunmetal lipstick casing, as most standard MAC lipsticks do. The packaging is simple yet elegant, and the dark, shimmery color scheme adds an edgy touch. When I had originally purchased my very first MAC lipstick, I was immediately drawn to the bullet-like look of the casing. I had originally wanted to replace a Maybelline lipstick that broke in my purse (which left an awful, irremovable mess that ultimately left me having to replace the bag), but instead opted for one of my very first \\&quot;high end\\&quot; makeup products-- MAC&#x27;s \\&quot;Captive\\&quot;, another matte finish, plum lipstick. I was very impressed by the endurance of the package: that lipstick had sat in my bag, battered around by the various contents, and had lasted up until I had the wore the lip product down to nothing. Not once did the lid pop off and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAC&#x27;s Russian Red lipstick is a classified as a matte finish, with an intense blue undertone. As someone who personally prefers the satin finish over any of the other formulas offered by MAC, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the fluidity of the lipstick was quite reasonable. Unlike many other lipsticks that advertise the \\&quot;matte look\\&quot; as the end result, Russian Red goes on without leaving the lips feeling parched or stiff. MAC lipsticks \\&quot;contain natural oils which function as emollients,\\&quot; which gives the lipstick a better texture, and allows the lips to retain more moisture. However, prepping my lips with an exfoliating lip scrub as well as a bit of Carmex, may be to thank for the consistency of the product. I have found that without having exfoliated and moisturized my lips thoroughly, the product tends to look dry, flaky and overall unappealing shortly after application. Additionally, use of a good lipliner (I use NARS&#x27;s Jungle Red) prior to applying Russian Red is advisable, as the lipstick may \\&quot;bleed\\&quot; otherwise. Regardless, a couple minutes worth of prior lip preparation is worth it for the final result the lipstick provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an NC45 in MAC foundation, it is quite difficult to find a shade of red that complements my skin. Many lipsticks, especially bright reds, are simply out of the question for women of color. However, Russian Red has just the right amount of blues to compliment quite literally any skin tone imaginable. Having tried other similar lip products, such as MAC&#x27;s \\&quot;Red,\\&quot; Smashbox&#x27;s \\&quot;Bacio,\\&quot; and NARS&#x27; \\&quot;Jungle Red,\\&quot; among many others, Russian Red takes the cake. No other product provides a universally classic, Marilyn Monroe-esque look quite as well as Russian Red. The only downfall to such an electric shade is that it must be the center of attention. While other more modest shades of red allow a bit more leverage as far as eyeshadow intensity, I&#x27;ve found that Russian Red does not play well with others. Though some women may think otherwise, this bright of a red doesn&#x27;t allow for notable application of blush, bronzer, or eyeshadow without the result being too overdone. If you&#x27;re aiming for attention at the lips, then Russian Red is the shade for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A key determining factor for most women and choosing cosmetics is price. While just about any woman would love to own higher-end makeup, not all of us are willing to splurge a week&#x27;s worth of groceries on a tube of lipstick. Any tube of standard finish lipstick from MAC will usually range from $14.50, and increase from there. Lipsticks in the same basic shade of red are available in three basic price ranges: low, medium and high.  For example, a shade of red Revlon lipstick from CVS Drugstore might cost about seven to eight dollars, while a tube of red lipstick from Yves-Saint Laurent&#x27;s cosmetic counter should be upwards of $32.50, putting MAC&#x27;s product right about center. For some, the Revlon lipstick is the way to go.After all, you could get four tubes of that for the price of one YSL lipstick, right? In theory, that might seem like a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Revlon&#x27;s \\&quot;Really Red,\\&quot; has received many negative reviews, despite being a fourth of the price of YSL&#x27;s \\&quot;Rouge Volupté No. 17.\\&quot; Revlon&#x27;s shade has been known to bleed horrendously, require numerous re-applications, and dry the lips out throughout the day. Now, not to say that a higher price directly correlates to higher quality, because the Rouge Volupté has been known to exhibit the exact same qualities-- at four times the price. As an owner of all three shades, Russian Red, Really Red, and Rouge Volupté No. 17, I can certainly say that MAC is my happy medium. MAC&#x27;s Russian Red, along with all of their other lip products I&#x27;ve tried so far, really does emphasize the notion of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot; I would happily pay a bit more for a product that I know works the way that I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, MAC&#x27;s Russian Red is a product that I would purchase again, without a second thought about it. The product&#x27;s packaging, signature Vanilla fragrance, price and overall quality are all more than fair. As someone who has tried their hand with just about every shade of red across the board, I&#x27;ve found that Russian Red is the one I always find myself emptying tubes of, and hurrying off to the nearest MAC to replace. I would recommend this product to any girl who is still hunting for that \\&quot;perfect red.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great deep red color, I love it! Stays on all night. I would definitely recommend. You can&#x27;t gO wrong with Mac.</li>
            <li> Mac Russian Red lasts forever and is probably the best/truest red color out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally do not wear a lot of red lipsticks, but when I do, this is my &#x27;go to&#x27; color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped in a timely fashion and I was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased Russian Red and this lipstick in particular is absolutely amazing! The hue is so rich and application is so silky and its very easy to apply. Theirs not a sensation of stickiness, or weird taste. You don&#x27;t even to use a lot on your lips all you need is around 2 good swipes across the lips and there you go. As for lasting, it lasts awhile. P.S. this lipstick smells REALLY good, smells like candy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Rich color, doesn&#x27;t smudge or get on my teeth, lasts for hours. Recently wore it to a five course wine dinner and even after hours of eating and drinking the color looked perfect and my lips appeared untouched. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red, can be worn every day. It&#x27;s a beautiful red with a bluish undertone, that would compliment any complexion. I am tan with yellow undertones, this shade is very flattering. In comparison to Nars Red Lizard, it almost beats it out. Red Lizard is definitely a vibrant, bold red hue, but I tend to feel overdone when I wear it. Sephora Red 04 is just to costumey for my taste. Mac Russian Red is a true red shade that I find I can wear daily in a professional work setting as well as for dressier occasions. Longlasting, doesn&#x27;t feather. I apply with a lip brush. Lovely.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect shade of red lipstick for quite a while now. Other products that I have tried go on way too thick or are the wrong shade of red. It makes me so happy that it is so comfortable that I forget I am even wearing lipstick. I do find that my lips get a bit tight after some time, but I will just try dabbing on a light layer of lip balm on before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I am going to have is keeping away from my mom and sister!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this deep red that sticks! It&#x27;s a real RED that looks absolutely stunning with a dark lipliner. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I originally saw this lipstick reviewed in the Sunday Magazine of our paper and am always a bit apprehensive when a reviewer says &amp;#34;I used it on all skin types&amp;#34;.  Well, my skin type is a little tough - brunette with yellow undertones and blue eyes (as well as older) but thought I would try it.  NICE lipstick and stays on.  Almost like the lipsticks of the 50&#x27;s in that it stains (which is good) and doesn&#x27;t give you the oily feeling of most modern lipsticks who try to be &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; meaning they transfer instantly to glasses, napkins, teeth, and well, you know, in general on everything.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect deep cool red with unnoticeable blue undertones. If you have a cool skin tone this is perfect! Don&#x27;t mistake the word deep for dark! It&#x27;s a beautiful bright but full red color without that orange tint! It&#x27;s a true matte but not powdery finish. If you don&#x27;t want that drying effect that most matte lipsticks cause, use either mac or urban decay matte lip finish. It holds in the moisture without sacrificing the matte look.</li>
            <li> This lipstick jumped out at me from Khloe Kardashian&#x27;s face.  Rarely, if ever do I care what the Kardashian ladies wear, but I was entranced by Khloe&#x27;s red lips and Googled to find out where oh where could I rock some red lips llke that??  Found out it was Russian Red and Amazon&#x27;d myself a tube.  It didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Gorgeous red like the bloodiest red you&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;m African-American so it worked as well on me as it did on her.  Be aware that it will dominate your face.  So, if you&#x27;re not a &#x27;lips-centric&#x27; girl like me, this red puts the focus right on your mouth.  Also, the consistency is not like the department store brands. All you need is to swab it on once. It goes on smoothly in one coat. I&#x27;ve NEVER applied just one coat of a red lipstick before.  To make it uniform, you always have to &#x27;play&#x27; with it by dabbing here and there, adding a coat, blotting a coat.  Not with this lipstick.  You definitely pay more than dept store/grocery store/CVS/Walmart, but it&#x27;s worth every penny if you want to rock some REAL red lips.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say...look good on me.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with mac lipstick</li>
            <li> This is a very dramatic and captivating red. Perfect for stage or everyday use!! People always ask what it is when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shade of red!  This red has blue undertones which leads to a vibrant sensual red, unlike lipsticks with orange undertones that bring out an uneven skin tone, and make your teeth look yellow.  This product does not smudge easily or smear once applied and let set for several minutes.  You may need to touch up every few hours after eating or drinking, but not too frequently.</li>
            <li> Item was perfect! Was purchased for my daughter&#x27;s dance recital and it was a great color choice. It goes on smooth, not sticky, and the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> My mom took it from and i had to order another one .. :)  It was so red!!! If you don&#x27;t like the matte look this is not for you</li>
            <li> This lipstick is the red of all reds. I have not been able to find another red lipstick that comes close to even matching this red. It is the &amp;#34;candy apple&amp;#34; everyone looks for.</li>
            <li> Looks like a more purple-red as opposed to a blood red or pure red.  Doesn&#x27;t work for a 1940&#x27;s wow-factor, but is an okay color in a pinch.</li>
            <li> the lipsticl got here very fast. it is long lasting, and the color is just what i thought it was and stays just like you put it on</li>
            <li> I purchased this lipstick because MAC is frequently touted as one of the longest lasting brands.  I&#x27;ve worn this one only one time so far, but it does seem to stay on.  No complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality aside, though, I&#x27;m writing this review to comment on the color.  It&#x27;s hard to judge a color when purchasing online, of course, so here&#x27;s my take on it if anyone (like I was) is unsure if it is the red they are looking for.  It is not a deep, dark red like it looks in the picture.  It is not a blood red or even a rusty red. To me, it is a shade or two lighter than a classic red, and it has an almost pink/orange undertone that gives it some extra brightness.  I want to like it, but it&#x27;s just a little too glaring on me for daily use.  It makes too much of a &amp;#34;look at my lips&amp;#34; statement for that.  It would be great for evening, or for an intentionally bold look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s what you want, you&#x27;re in luck. It is a quality lipstick.</li>
            <li> this is fake Mac lipstick. it is runny. and too creamy. I&#x27;ve never been so mad. I ordered this with over night shipping (came late) to match a dress I have. looks nothing like the color. And also half of the bottle is MELTED. this is s***ty (excuse my French) lipstick. Never again will I buy this brand. FAKE.  If you have ever purchased a mac lipstick before its small. This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> I must have researched over twenty pinup fashion sites and beauty blogs for the perfect red lipstick. Overwhelmingly, women said MAC Russian Red was their go-to. So I thought this was a safe bet. I had to apply several coats to get a true red color on my lips, and after blotting, it was hardly the impact I was going for. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t see what all that fuss was about, and for as expensive as it is, this was a total waste. I&#x27;ll stick with Besame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this is clearly a knockoff,  and not a good one. I returned it and then ordered directly from MAC (cheaper!), and the product I received from them is wonderful. Gorgeous, rich color and very long lasting. If you want the real deal, go to the source!</li>
            <li> Hi - I just love this lipstick.  Because of my gray hair, I put a touch of bronzed peach under it - even my husband noticed and complimented me.  Yea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M in love with this colour!! Such a great shade and finish. Lasts very long on your lips even after having dinner and drinks. I have been getting compliments whenever I wear it. Definitely for women of colour.</li>
            <li> Great! It arrived on time exactly as said.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get to me but now that i have it, I feel like a little girl playing in her mothers lipstick again. Lol</li>
            <li> Definitely not a real Mac product</li>
            <li> This is a deeper red than I thought. It apparently is this iconic red and it&#x27;s gorgeous but it is not work appropriate unless you mix w pink and tone it down.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite brand/color of lipstick.  Wears well, nice quality.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is just right for someone. But not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tasted and smelled awful according to my husband, who kissed me when I wore it. Smelled awful to me, just wearing it. The smell was of stale wax, face powder/liquid foundation and petroleum jelly mixed together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have put up with any of the above if it had looked halfway decent on me, but it looked awful, too! Purple or bluish, way too cartoonish and over the top to wear to work, and not a true, deep red, at all. I will use it for the Halloween party we&#x27;re going too, though it wont look quite right for that, either: Morticia Addams had REAL red lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stayed on for a long time, a plus. Was drying on my lips and had to keep putting on gloss to moisturize, a minus. It did smear badly when drinking coffee just after applying it, another minus, though what was left did last for hours after that, a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a MAC powder and eye shadow fan and have been for many years. But I just hate this lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair-skinned, with dark brown hair and medium brown eyes and little to no natural color to my lips or cheeks. I can wear true reds. Rose-y pinks, garnet shades and cherry reds, too. I wear jewel colors in clothes which look great with fair skin; but I do have to stay away from magenta pinks or neon pinks. I can wear neutral and pastel clothing, but not brights saturated with intense color and certainly not orange or purple. I usually look great in strong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;, a red lipstick I could wear daily that would stay on and look great with everything. With all the hype about this particular color, was absolutely sure I had. Nope. I&#x27;ll be giving it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will do the best thing for me and go try it on at the department store counter first, and not trust reviews on the Internet. With shipping, I just wasted twenty-one bucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 10$ cheaper on the official Mac website.</li>
            <li> Mac is overrated. They just have an established brand but there are other lippies that women need to try especially those that are paraben-free. Check out this fab one: http://goo.gl/RUywh0 -it&#x27;s not cheaper but it&#x27;s cheaper than Mac.  Or this organic lipstick that has an amazing color and quality: http://goo.gl/SvK1YD</li>
            <li> This has become my very favorite lipstick---the color is great for me, it goes with everything and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.  Can&#x27;t wait until I can put it on in the mornings.  On some days I force myself to use a different kind of lipstick, just for a change, but this is by far the best and favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use lipstick often. I bought this based on a requirement for extras in a movie. I was surprised I didn&#x27;t need to reapply in the 12 hours we were shooting. Any future lipsticks I purchase will definitely be MAC.</li>
            <li> I love the color Russian Red,  I like the creaminess of the lipstick. It lasts a petty good while.  Will order again</li>
            <li> Not that matte as expected.</li>
            <li> Love this shade of red! Definitely a favorite!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.  This is not real MAC brand Russian Red. It seemed more transparent, and a different formula.  Yesterday, I showed my three online tubes to the folks at the MAC counter in Nordstrom&#x27;s. They showed me how the metal casing is plastic here, and yes, the color is different. Gross, because we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this fake red.</li>
            <li> Not a very good red color for it to be so expensive.  Instead of the vibrant though matte red, it appears to be a very dull version.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read an article that said this is the red for everyone.  Everyone?  I never have found a red that looks decent.  I expected that the writers were insane, but purchased it anyway in the off chance that it worked.... It works!  I can now sport that red pout I&#x27;ve always wanted!  BUT it gets everywhere.  Perhaps it is so with all reds?  After a couple hours I checked in the mirror and it was on my chin and teeth even though I blotted.  I will wear it again but only in high-maintenance friendly situations and stick with my usual no-mirror-needed translucent otherwise.  But holy cow I never feel so sexy as when I&#x27;m wearing MAC Russian Red!!!</li>
