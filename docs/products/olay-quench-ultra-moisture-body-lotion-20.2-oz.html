            <li>Lasts all day long &#x3D;D &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>Out of all the body lotions I have, Oil of Olay is my favorite : it lasts and the scent is great too.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>

            <li>This is my favorite body lotion!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and it has sparkles!</li>
            <li>This lotion is very nice, not greasy, and easily absorbs into her skin.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>maybe rose?.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>very strong floral scent-</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon, and she was thrilled as well.</li>
            <li>By far the best lotion out there for the price.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely with no greasy residue, the smell is nice and mild, my skin feels better immediately and the effect lasts.  </li>
            <li>I love the olay line of moisture lotion.  </li>
            <li>but Aveeno did not have as nice of a texture and was supposed to be fragrance free (which smelled medicinal to me)</li>
            <li>Thank goodness I can get it here on Amazon because in most stores I can&#x27;t get this size for this price.</li>
            <li>To be able to cleanse your body then put this product on, helps with time.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite</li>
            <li>Smells lovely but the pump stopped working after one use</li>
            <li>but this scent is overwhelming even after trying to wash it off and NOT vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Oil of play are my favorite skin productsw</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have tryed many others and they do not hold up to this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I will order som more</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>and I love that I can get it every 2 months through the Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>most importantly it WORKS!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how your skin feels</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and most importantly, it absorbs and dries fairly quickly with no tacky feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other moisturizers; but this is the best...</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice body lotion that does the job right.</li>
            <li>(Pack of 2): this is an Excellent cream, great for Dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The 2, 20 oz bottles will last you all Winter.</li>
            <li>smell not to strong......</li>
            <li>Comes on easy and smoothly, super light, and just stops dryness in its tracks!</li>
            <li>Olay is the right way to finding incredibly 24-hr soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge the texture is  very velvety scent is nice</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep my skin from drying out, but it smells great.</li>
            <li>and this enable me to go without stockings and my legs are smooth.</li>
            <li>I have searched for a lotion that makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so smooth</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth, silky, moisten and does not require additional application throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I purchased the pack of 2.</li>
            <li>keeps your skin shiney.amd smooth.....</li>
            <li>Not only was it inexpensive, it smells great and</li>
            <li>It smells good, but does not irritate my sometime sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am more than aware after I got it all over my clothes and glistened in the sun like a Twilight vampire.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Far superior in moisture delivery than the regular &amp;#34;Quench.&amp;#34;  Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed this...</li>
            <li>It has a fragrance that is very pleasing to me, and I can&#x27;t say that of many lotions.</li>
            <li>nice scent and keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li>Absorbs right into your skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Unlike some very moisturizing lotions, this one absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin gets VERY dry in the colder months, but most of the lotions that promise to hydrate feel sticky or like they&#x27;re just sitting on top of my skin and smothering it.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really delivers moisture, it absorbs fast and has a light scent that I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>My sister turned me on to this stuff years back when I forgot my own lotion and had to use hers.  </li>
            <li>We use this daily and helps revitalize the skin, makes it smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Had eczema all my life, nothing works better than this - the only 24 hour moisturiser that really works for 24 hours and makes your skin better over time.</li>
            <li>Anyone that touches my skin were like, what a soft smooth skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;my hand and body so soft, I love the lotion</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft, elastic and more durable.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I shower in the morning</li>
            <li>Found her exact lotion and in the right size with a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable through the Olay bundling also.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of them including the ones in the purple containers (which I think smells better).  </li>
            <li>I fell in love instantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many different hand/body moisturizers but have landed on this one!  </li>
            <li>I read that in a magazine article, then looked at the ingredients label, and sure enough, this stuff has dimethicone.  </li>
            <li>Olay Moisture Lotion had done exactly that.</li>
            <li>Her first purchase was from Wal Mart, but they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>In addition, I like that the lotion is soft, light and</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra smooth and soft all the time.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than purchasing at Sam&#x27;s Club or Walmart!</li>
            <li>I got my sexy legs back.</li>
            <li>my first impression was it went on greasy</li>
            <li>my skin after using for a few days felt so soft and looked super healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would work and stop the dryness every night like a body-butter, but it really does!</li>
            <li>Pure luxury at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>and better it left this very soft feeling.</li>
            <li>is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It really hydrates like the rest of the olay lotions I have tried... very well.  </li>
            <li>and it really has made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it smells very feminine....not over powering.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>After using it for a week straight, after days of not using it, it still works.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending it so promptly....</li>
            <li>it’s not greasy; for me it moisturizes my body very well.  </li>
            <li>Too much scent for me</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion a lot.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive lotions that were not as effective.</li>
            <li>Olay Quench Ultra Moisture is one of the few lotions that is truly effective.  </li>
            <li>Quench keeps my skin from becoming dry and stops the cracking in the winter.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Moisture lotion keeps my skin soft and subtle, has a great smell</li>
            <li>high recommend</li>
            <li>i am so glad to finally find a lotion that actually is for moisture and feels the same way, it makes my skin so soft and smooth and the scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t overpower other fragrances</li>
            <li>The product is gentle and not heavily perfumed so you can wear it anywhere and not worry about offending others with allergies to scents.  </li>
            <li>love olay last long and not watery</li>
            <li>as well I can say we all love this lotion, absorbs quickly, no oily residue and leaves skin feeling silky soft,</li>
            <li>If I use this product I have no problems getting through the entire day dry skin free!  </li>
            <li>it gets so dry and flakes off and turns red and itchy but with this lotion its never been better.</li>
            <li>I will find some other lotions to use (paraben free)</li>
            <li>My skin feels like an old woman&#x27;s now!</li>
            <li>Better than other similar products we used.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin smooth and moist with no powerful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I expected this lotion to be unscented, but it has a pretty strong smell that is a little too much like sunscreen for my taste.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and minimal scent.  </li>
            <li>Go back to the previous formulation because I cannot and will not buy this stinky lotion even if I love the way it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product review site, this lotion came with very high marks so decided to give it a try... actually purchased 4 bottles and after having family and friends try it</li>
            <li>Luv how it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soooo soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>I buy products like this from Amazon for my 87 year old mom.</li>
            <li>My husband comments on how soft my skin is all the time</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This lotion keeps my skin moist and soft without leaving an oily residue...</li>
            <li>I am 71 and my doctor&#x27;s nurse wanted to know how I keep my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>When I was a teenager, I sure never have guessed that I would ever have trouble with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It works well as long as you are a girl that wants to shimmer.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and this is absolutely what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really helps with dry, winter skin.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>the only issue I have is the baby powder like scent which tho not overwhelming is unnecessary and competes with other scented products, hence 1 star detraction, otherwise a perfect product!</li>
            <li>but if i rubbed it in a little more and let a few minutes go by it</li>
            <li>But sometimes it gets a bit heavy and hot with that extra layer, and so I bought this.</li>
            <li>shea butter is theee best moisturizer imho but very expensive and consistency too thick to apply with ease...</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel soft and silky and actually adds a little sparkle!</li>
            <li>My skin was extremely dry and itchy and I spent lots of money trying different products without seeing any real result, until I found the Olay body wash and Quench lotion with Shea butter.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite body lotion!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and it has sparkles!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice, not greasy, and easily absorbs into her skin.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing</li>
            <li> maybe rose?.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> very strong floral scent-</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it on Amazon, and she was thrilled as well.</li>
            <li> By far the best lotion out there for the price.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely with no greasy residue, the smell is nice and mild, my skin feels better immediately and the effect lasts.  </li>
            <li> I love the olay line of moisture lotion.  </li>
            <li> but Aveeno did not have as nice of a texture and was supposed to be fragrance free (which smelled medicinal to me)</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I can get it here on Amazon because in most stores I can&#x27;t get this size for this price.</li>
            <li> To be able to cleanse your body then put this product on, helps with time.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite</li>
            <li> Smells lovely but the pump stopped working after one use</li>
            <li> but this scent is overwhelming even after trying to wash it off and NOT vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Oil of play are my favorite skin productsw</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have tryed many others and they do not hold up to this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> I will order som more</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> and I love that I can get it every 2 months through the Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> most importantly it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how your skin feels</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and most importantly, it absorbs and dries fairly quickly with no tacky feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other moisturizers; but this is the best...</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice body lotion that does the job right.</li>
            <li> (Pack of 2): this is an Excellent cream, great for Dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The 2, 20 oz bottles will last you all Winter.</li>
            <li> smell not to strong......</li>
            <li> Comes on easy and smoothly, super light, and just stops dryness in its tracks!</li>
            <li> Olay is the right way to finding incredibly 24-hr soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge the texture is  very velvety scent is nice</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep my skin from drying out, but it smells great.</li>
            <li> and this enable me to go without stockings and my legs are smooth.</li>
            <li> I have searched for a lotion that makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so smooth</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth, silky, moisten and does not require additional application throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I purchased the pack of 2.</li>
            <li> keeps your skin shiney.amd smooth.....</li>
            <li> Not only was it inexpensive, it smells great and</li>
            <li> It smells good, but does not irritate my sometime sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am more than aware after I got it all over my clothes and glistened in the sun like a Twilight vampire.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Far superior in moisture delivery than the regular &amp;#34;Quench.&amp;#34;  Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed this...</li>
            <li> It has a fragrance that is very pleasing to me, and I can&#x27;t say that of many lotions.</li>
            <li> nice scent and keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> Absorbs right into your skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Unlike some very moisturizing lotions, this one absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin gets VERY dry in the colder months, but most of the lotions that promise to hydrate feel sticky or like they&#x27;re just sitting on top of my skin and smothering it.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really delivers moisture, it absorbs fast and has a light scent that I enjoy.  </li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to this stuff years back when I forgot my own lotion and had to use hers.  </li>
            <li> We use this daily and helps revitalize the skin, makes it smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> Had eczema all my life, nothing works better than this - the only 24 hour moisturiser that really works for 24 hours and makes your skin better over time.</li>
            <li> Anyone that touches my skin were like, what a soft smooth skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;my hand and body so soft, I love the lotion</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft, elastic and more durable.</li>
            <li> I use it right after I shower in the morning</li>
            <li> Found her exact lotion and in the right size with a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable through the Olay bundling also.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of them including the ones in the purple containers (which I think smells better).  </li>
            <li> I fell in love instantly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many different hand/body moisturizers but have landed on this one!  </li>
            <li> I read that in a magazine article, then looked at the ingredients label, and sure enough, this stuff has dimethicone.  </li>
            <li> Olay Moisture Lotion had done exactly that.</li>
            <li> Her first purchase was from Wal Mart, but they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> In addition, I like that the lotion is soft, light and</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra smooth and soft all the time.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than purchasing at Sam&#x27;s Club or Walmart!</li>
            <li> I got my sexy legs back.</li>
            <li> my first impression was it went on greasy</li>
            <li> my skin after using for a few days felt so soft and looked super healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it would work and stop the dryness every night like a body-butter, but it really does!</li>
            <li> Pure luxury at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> and better it left this very soft feeling.</li>
            <li> is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It really hydrates like the rest of the olay lotions I have tried... very well.  </li>
            <li> and it really has made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it smells very feminine....not over powering.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week straight, after days of not using it, it still works.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending it so promptly....</li>
            <li> it’s not greasy; for me it moisturizes my body very well.  </li>
            <li> Too much scent for me</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion a lot.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive lotions that were not as effective.</li>
            <li> Olay Quench Ultra Moisture is one of the few lotions that is truly effective.  </li>
            <li> Quench keeps my skin from becoming dry and stops the cracking in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Moisture lotion keeps my skin soft and subtle, has a great smell</li>
            <li> high recommend</li>
            <li> i am so glad to finally find a lotion that actually is for moisture and feels the same way, it makes my skin so soft and smooth and the scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t overpower other fragrances</li>
            <li> The product is gentle and not heavily perfumed so you can wear it anywhere and not worry about offending others with allergies to scents.  </li>
            <li> love olay last long and not watery</li>
            <li> as well I can say we all love this lotion, absorbs quickly, no oily residue and leaves skin feeling silky soft,</li>
            <li> If I use this product I have no problems getting through the entire day dry skin free!  </li>
            <li> it gets so dry and flakes off and turns red and itchy but with this lotion its never been better.</li>
            <li> I will find some other lotions to use (paraben free)</li>
            <li> My skin feels like an old woman&#x27;s now!</li>
            <li> Better than other similar products we used.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin smooth and moist with no powerful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I expected this lotion to be unscented, but it has a pretty strong smell that is a little too much like sunscreen for my taste.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and minimal scent.  </li>
            <li> Go back to the previous formulation because I cannot and will not buy this stinky lotion even if I love the way it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product review site, this lotion came with very high marks so decided to give it a try... actually purchased 4 bottles and after having family and friends try it</li>
            <li> Luv how it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin soooo soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> I buy products like this from Amazon for my 87 year old mom.</li>
            <li> My husband comments on how soft my skin is all the time</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my skin moist and soft without leaving an oily residue...</li>
            <li> I am 71 and my doctor&#x27;s nurse wanted to know how I keep my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, I sure never have guessed that I would ever have trouble with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It works well as long as you are a girl that wants to shimmer.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and this is absolutely what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really helps with dry, winter skin.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> the only issue I have is the baby powder like scent which tho not overwhelming is unnecessary and competes with other scented products, hence 1 star detraction, otherwise a perfect product!</li>
            <li> but if i rubbed it in a little more and let a few minutes go by it</li>
            <li> But sometimes it gets a bit heavy and hot with that extra layer, and so I bought this.</li>
            <li> shea butter is theee best moisturizer imho but very expensive and consistency too thick to apply with ease...</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel soft and silky and actually adds a little sparkle!</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely dry and itchy and I spent lots of money trying different products without seeing any real result, until I found the Olay body wash and Quench lotion with Shea butter.</li>
            <li> so dry hands is a major problem for me.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I do not have those dry, pimples on my upper arms and thighs that I usually get every winter.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this lotion - it had disappeared and is very soft - AND HAS NOT COME BACK!  </li>
            <li> and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so no lotion would ever work on me, only actual body butter.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry itchy skin, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Well, now I do - lots of dry, flaky, itchy skin, especially on my shins.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin then I would definitely recommend buying this lotion.</li>
            <li> I like feeling my skin getting hydrated, especially in this dry heat.  </li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that has helped my dry skin out here in the desert.</li>
            <li> how well it works because the smell is too strong and wrong for me.  </li>
            <li> More money wasted by a false description.  </li>
            <li> soft but without a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> And the moisture stays for a long time....</li>
            <li> long time on the body</li>
            <li> Besides reducing the duration and temperature of my showers, the other key to keeping it under control is to use Olay Quench.  </li>
            <li> Due to illness in family, I am constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial gel.  </li>
            <li> I got this to use after showers since my swimming began to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin was slightly dry</li>
            <li> She has some dry skin on her knees and legs.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for those with dry skin</li>
            <li> I am always battling dry skin.  </li>
            <li> helps my hands from feeling dry and like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels dry.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get down there to hunt for and pick up the specific items she needs as often as I would like.</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very, very dry.</li>
            <li> I also had a very dry spot on my hand from having 2 casts over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wet lotion, as opposed to the dry sensation I get from some other lotions.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after only a few weeks of using this lotion once a week that my skin was a lot smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> It has a strange feel on the skin and a odd smell.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in moisturization from other products like Jergens...</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive brands, i.e. Victoria&#x27;s Secret, etc.  </li>
            <li> Sinks in quickly, not greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry after a few hours</li>
            <li> The Olay Body Ultra Moisture Lotion, Shea butter, 20.2 Oz (pack of 2) has a very faint floral smell (I am currently pregnant</li>
            <li> But I have tried a few other products, and nothing else comes close.  </li>
            <li> I even have a slight case of eczema.  </li>
            <li> She lives an hour and a half away from me</li>
            <li> my skin is super sensitive and bumpy from the terrible shower water.</li>
            <li> Uses it everyday</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for the past 2 years and I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> The Arizona desert is brutal on my skin, we&#x27;re talking dry, dry, dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Very thick &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a lotion that makes your skin feel moisturized without leaving that annoying greasy feeling behind</li>
            <li> Unfair!</li>
            <li> Olay products contain almost 5hree types of paraben aka bad stuff for the body.</li>
            <li> This winter has been the worst every for my skin.</li>
            <li> Update October 9, 2016:&lt;br /&gt;They changed the smell of this product and it is horrible!</li>

            <li> Only lotion I use!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Far superior in moisture delivery than the regular &amp;#34;Quench.&amp;#34;  Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> Olay products contain almost 5hree types of paraben aka bad stuff for the body. I have used their products for years, and never bothered to read the ingredients until today. I will find some other lotions to use (paraben free)</li>

            <li> shea butter is theee best moisturizer imho but very expensive and consistency too thick to apply with ease... after reviewing the comments on Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautypedia (sp?) product review site, this lotion came with very high marks so decided to give it a try... actually purchased 4 bottles and after having family and friends try it as well I can say we all love this lotion, absorbs quickly, no oily residue and leaves skin feeling silky soft, the only issue I have is the baby powder like scent which tho not overwhelming is unnecessary and competes with other scented products, hence 1 star detraction, otherwise a perfect product! high recommend</li>

The Olay Body Ultra Moisture Lotion, Shea butter, 20.2 Oz (pack of 2) has a very faint floral smell (I am currently pregnant so I have a heightened sense of smell anyways).  It really hydrates like the rest of the olay lotions I have tried... very well.  I use it right after I shower in the morning and it leaves my skin soooo soft.

I used to use Aveeno before this one but Aveeno did not have as nice of a texture and was supposed to be fragrance free (which smelled medicinal to me) and I felt it left a sticky residue on my skin (although it did do the job).

            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Says its the best moisturizing lotion she has tried. Uses it everyday and I&#x27;ve tried it a few times. Its good</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for the past 2 years and I have no complaints.  It lasts all day and keeps my skin moisturized. Thank goodness I can get it here on Amazon because in most stores I can&#x27;t get this size for this price.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but smell leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived on time. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many different hand/body moisturizers but have landed on this one!  It has a pleasant smell and most importantly, it absorbs and dries fairly quickly with no tacky feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Olay products are great. I have used the body was and bar soap, but this ultra moisture lotion is awesome.  To be able to cleanse your body then put this product on, helps with time.  The price is good.  I have dry skin and this enable me to go without stockings and my legs are smooth. The product is gentle and not heavily perfumed so you can wear it anywhere and not worry about offending others with allergies to scents.  I would recommend this to both male and female.  It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Not too greasy. Absorbs right into your skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth. I have been on a quest for years for the perfect hand lotion, and this is it!</li>
            <li> The only lotion I&#x27;ll ever use</li>

I won&#x27;t lie and say that I&#x27;ve tried everything.  But I have tried a few other products, and nothing else comes close.  The key ingredient is dimethicone, which does actually seal in moisture.  I read that in a magazine article, then looked at the ingredients label, and sure enough, this stuff has dimethicone.  Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Makes my wife smoother than she already was.  Unfair!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions Ive used. It&#x27;s really soft on my skin. I have reccommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I buy products like this from Amazon for my 87 year old mom.

            <li> I ordered this lotion for my Mom, and she loves it. It provides just enough moiturizer without being too greasy. Her first purchase was from Wal Mart, but they no longer carry it. I was glad to find it on Amazon, and she was thrilled as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for almost a year now and it really has made a difference in my skin. My skin was slightly dry and I decided I wanted to find a lotion to improve and moisturize my skin so I went to Wal-Mart and I found this lotion and immediately decided I wanted to buy it after smelling it. It smells soooo good. I noticed after only a few weeks of using this lotion once a week that my skin was a lot smoother and softer. I don&#x27;t even have to use this lotion daily to see results. If you have dry skin then I would definitely recommend buying this lotion. This is definitely my favorite and I don&#x27;t have any plans to stop using it!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely but the pump stopped working after one use</li>
            <li> This lotion will make your skin feel amazing! I just went on vacation without this lotion, big mistake! My skin feels like an old woman&#x27;s now! I will never be without this again! My husband comments on how soft my skin is all the time and I&#x27;m 52! Do yourself a favor and use this lotion!!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and this is absolutely what I needed.  This makes my skin feel so smooth and it smells very feminine....not over powering.</li>
            <li> We use this daily and helps revitalize the skin, makes it smooth and healthy. Better than other similar products we used.</li>
            <li> I have known Oil of Olay for decades and it never ceases to improve! Please ,keep up the good job!</li>
            <li> She uses it regularly and loves it. She has some dry skin on her knees and legs. This lotion is very nice, not greasy, and easily absorbs into her skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth, silky, moisten and does not require additional application throughout the day. Lasts all day long &#x3D;D &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I chose this product as part of a care package that I sent to mother on Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves the oil of Olay products .The price and choices of products via Amazon. Amazon helps me pamper my mother every year. I would recommended the product and service to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! The price is very reasonable through the Olay bundling also. I order all my Olay products now and don&#x27;t worry about clipping coupons or running out.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Keeps your skin smooth and moist with no powerful fragrance. Would recommend for those with dry skin</li>
            <li> very strong floral scent- maybe rose?.  NOT vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;I like vanilla but this scent is overwhelming even after trying to wash it off and NOT vanilla.  More money wasted by a false description.  I have no idea how well it works because the smell is too strong and wrong for me.  If that is not a problem for you then ignore this review.</li>
            <li> I did not like this lotion. It has a strange feel on the skin and a odd smell. I also did not think it moisturized well through the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Quench Ultra Moisture during my vacation.  It&#x27;s a wet lotion, as opposed to the dry sensation I get from some other lotions.  I like feeling my skin getting hydrated, especially in this dry heat.  It works well and has that pleasant shea butter scent, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion on the market! Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells amazing</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Leaves hands soft but without a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my hands feel. Doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion! I have used it for years. It has a fragrance that is very pleasing to me, and I can&#x27;t say that of many lotions. It really makes my skin feel soft and silky and actually adds a little sparkle! I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Wow. The product arrived fast and it smells so good. Feels great on the skin and it last a long time. Oil of play are my favorite skin productsw</li>
            <li> Received on time. Love the smell</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps with dry, winter skin.  I also had a very dry spot on my hand from having 2 casts over the last few years.  It did not go away, even after my dermatologist had me use a prescription cream.  Within a few days of using this lotion - it had disappeared and is very soft - AND HAS NOT COME BACK!  For the first time, I do not have those dry, pimples on my upper arms and thighs that I usually get every winter.  Not greasy and smells great.  Absoloutely the best!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a great scent as well as of a very good consistency. Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is great to use before toweling off as it mixes well with the water still on your skin after bathing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time. After using it for a week straight, after days of not using it, it still works. By far the best lotion out there for the price. I have tried more expensive lotions that were not as effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other moisturizers; but this is the best...And the moisture stays for a long time....Thanks for sending it so promptly....</li>
            <li> Olay quench Ultra Moisture Lotion withShey Butter 20.2 Fl Oz (Pack of 2): this is an Excellent cream, great for Dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The 2, 20 oz bottles will last you all Winter. All over great body &amp; hand lotion. Very thick &amp; creamy. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin hydrated and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful.  It feels great on my skin and make my skin feel great to the touch.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my skin moist and soft without leaving an oily residue...I&#x27;m definitely hooked and goes well with the Oil of Olay body wash!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very, very dry. I have gone through numerous lotions and stumbled on this one by accident, found a sample for my purse. I liked it so much that I purchased the pack of 2. The Olay Moisture lotion keeps my skin soft and subtle, has a great smell and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so no lotion would ever work on me, only actual body butter. But sometimes it gets a bit heavy and hot with that extra layer, and so I bought this. I really didn&#x27;t think it would work and stop the dryness every night like a body-butter, but it really does! Comes on easy and smoothly, super light, and just stops dryness in its tracks!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I am always battling dry skin.  I have used more expensive brands, i.e. Victoria&#x27;s Secret, etc.  They don&#x27;t hold a candle to this.  Pure luxury at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Due to illness in family, I am constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial gel.  I like Olay products and this lotion helps my hands from feeling dry and like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best. I have tryed many others and they do not hold up to this lotion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion!  I have been looking for a lotion that makes your skin feel moisturized without leaving that annoying greasy feeling behind and I&#x27;ve finally found it!  I&#x27;m a nurse so dry hands is a major problem for me.  A co-worked happened to have this lotion one night and I tried it.  When I got home that night I immediately ordered 2 big bottles for myself.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> love olay last long and not watery</li>
            <li> I specifically purchase this lotion because I like the shea butter scent. In addition, I like that the lotion is soft, light and it’s not greasy; for me it moisturizes my body very well.  I’ve been using it for years and have no complaints…</li>
            <li> Had eczema all my life, nothing works better than this - the only 24 hour moisturiser that really works for 24 hours and makes your skin better over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude and I&#x27;ve been using Olay lotion for about 6 years now. My skin is ultra smooth and soft all the time. Anyone that touches my skin were like, what a soft smooth skin! Yeah baby! This is going to be my lotion now forever and ever!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectation</li>
            <li> YOU WANT BEST RESULTS WITH LOTION THIS IS THE BRAND TO BUY</li>
            <li> My second  time ordering this lotion</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best! The price is great also. I recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I love it....smooths on great....smell not to strong......keeps your skin shiney.amd smooth.....and the price was great....I will order som more</li>
            <li> Too much scent for me</li>
            <li> Like my wife told me:&lt;br /&gt;It is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good texture and very nice odor&lt;br /&gt;stays long time on the body</li>
            <li> This moisture lotion makes my skin feel so good and it is not oily.</li>
            <li> Best body lotion I&#x27;ve used.  Sinks in quickly, not greasy. My skin never feels dry.  Recommended on Paula&#x27;s Choice as one of the best.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my skin silky smooth for 24 hours and the best part is the shimmer it leaves on your body!</li>
            <li> Great body lotion.  Absorbs quickly and minimal scent.  Great for summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years and tried to switch to cheaper lotions.  My skin was dry after a few hours and I just missed my Oil of Olay!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion and I love that I can get it every 2 months through the Subscribe and Save. So much cheaper than purchasing at Sam&#x27;s Club or Walmart!</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to tell my ladies about this product because it saved my skin (no pun intended). This winter has been the worst every for my skin. My skin was extremely dry and itchy and I spent lots of money trying different products without seeing any real result, until I found the Olay body wash and Quench lotion with Shea butter. Not only was it inexpensive, it smells great and most importantly it WORKS! I&#x27;m looking out for my ladies! ... I got my sexy legs back. haha</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturiser, very light and not greasy at all unlike some moisturisers which just coat the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> best lotion i have ever used. i used to think aveeno was the best and then i tried this specific brand because the px on post had it on sale. my first impression was it went on greasy but if i rubbed it in a little more and let a few minutes go by it didnt feel that way at all anymore and better it left this very soft feeling. my skin after using for a few days felt so soft and looked super healthy and smooth. my skin is super sensitive and bumpy from the terrible shower water. it gets so dry and flakes off and turns red and itchy but with this lotion its never been better.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that has helped my dry skin out here in the desert. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and it has sparkles!</li>
            <li> The Arizona desert is brutal on my skin, we&#x27;re talking dry, dry, dry.  Olay Quench Ultra Moisture is one of the few lotions that is truly effective.  It absorbs nicely with no greasy residue, the smell is nice and mild, my skin feels better immediately and the effect lasts.  This is not one of those watery lotions that evaporates as soon as you put it on.  Here in AZ I do have to use a lot when I use it, but it does not have the be reapplied throughout the day (except for hands).</li>
            <li> thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;my hand and body so soft, I love the lotion&lt;br /&gt;I bought from 1 year and I bought again</li>
            <li> I am 71 and my doctor&#x27;s nurse wanted to know how I keep my skin so soft.  I haven&#x27;t used anything but this lotion for several years.</li>
            <li> Great quality product! Makes my skin feel soft, elastic and more durable. Noticeable difference in moisturization from other products like Jergens...</li>
            <li> one of the lotions I will continue to buy. nice scent and keeps skin soft. My husband also uses this and he loves the scent.</li>
            <li> No problems with order.  Great service.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how your skin feels</li>
            <li> Update October 9, 2016:&lt;br /&gt;They changed the smell of this product and it is horrible! It smells like processed chemicals and coconut. Go back to the previous formulation because I cannot and will not buy this stinky lotion even if I love the way it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best lotion ever!!! Also buying the two pack from Amazon is almost the same as buying one  bottle from Target.</li>
            <li> This product should have the words &amp;#34;contains fragrance&amp;#34; written conspicuously in the description.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it in a purple bottle which I don&#x27;t see anywhere anymore, so I decided to try this one and I&#x27;m very happy with it.This lotion is an excellent product. Very pleasant scent, very nice lotion. Feels very nice on a skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Smells great and I have used it for years.  Works really well on dry skin.  Not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Great price.  Pleasant light fragrance.  Soaks in fast.  Feels great.</li>
            <li> Out of all the body lotions I have, Oil of Olay is my favorite : it lasts and the scent is great too.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion a lot.  My skin gets VERY dry in the colder months, but most of the lotions that promise to hydrate feel sticky or like they&#x27;re just sitting on top of my skin and smothering it.  This lotion really delivers moisture, it absorbs fast and has a light scent that I enjoy.  I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Soft and non-greasy.  Great value and size. You just can&#x27;t beat Olay Body Ultra Moisture Lotion, Shea Butter. Olay is the right way to finding incredibly 24-hr soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Great scent, works for my skin</li>
            <li> very good and smells wonderful.</li>
