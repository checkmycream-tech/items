    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best way I can describe the smell, it smells like a barber shop aftershave.</li>
            <li>Use with a spongy loofa is best.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time,as advertised and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice body wash!</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, not overpowering, just there...</li>
            <li>The Good</li>
            <li>Rinses off good, &amp; lathers good.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job on the hair</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is so good, and it smells so good, that you want to keep on using it.  </li>
            <li>It really is good.  </li>
            <li>Very clean, refreshing smell and it lathers and rinses excellently.</li>
            <li>I thought it had a very pleasant and fresh scent - it reminds me of a day in the forest.</li>
            <li>I can kind of smell a hint of mint.</li>
            <li>I did kind of feel clean/fresh after using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback was that it did not have the nice smell the soap used to have.</li>
            <li>He liked the scent and thought it did well as a body soap.  </li>
            <li>product smells good and makes a person smell good and clean.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and nice mint smell.</li>
            <li>Honestly the best Irish Spring body wash, I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>...missed the scent and great lather too much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like substituting body wash when you forgot to get more shampoo.</li>
            <li>But if you have longer hair, you&#x27;re better off sticking with something like the Dove Men+Care line or getting a separate shampoo, which sort of defeats the purpose of a three in one product.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks more like a cough syrup bottle or an oil bottle than a body wash.</li>
            <li>love this and will buy again.</li>
            <li>The scent is very subdued (a nice thing in my opinion) and it makes a good lather when washing.</li>
            <li>1 Body Wash.  I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, the way it cleans, everything about it.  </li>
            <li>men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is my favorite thing about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it does seem to moisturize and hydrate better than their bar</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on hair, though it claims it is shampoo too, but I can imagine it&#x27;d work out fine.</li>
            <li>Works well as a shampoo too, which isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d use the bar soap for (even though it might work just fine).  </li>
            <li>Combination body washes are so convenient and while the scent is strong, it is very fresh and we like it alot.</li>
            <li>I needed something for showering at the gym and thought this might fit the bill.</li>
            <li>smooth skin (so says the wife), can use on hair, face, body.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>If you have relatively short hair this will be great for you.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a feeling of moisture on the skin after bath and gives a clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Several</li>
            <li>The price is right as well!</li>
            <li>It does a good job, I like the scent and texture, and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the positive side, it did clean well, rinsed off easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong though and it leave you smelling like you are wearing a mens cologne - which is why they probably label this as a mens product.  </li>
            <li>This has a mild musky like smell.</li>
            <li>A lot of the three in one body washes are sort of like shampoo that&#x27;s adequate for a body wash.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a brown envelope and since the top was not sealed more than enough leaked out into the package.</li>
            <li>I like that the scent doesn&#x27;t really come off your body strong.</li>
            <li>It has a light manly scent and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves most of my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit on the thick side, so it is best to not squeeze out a whole lot at a time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems like a nice addition to the Irish Spring lineup.  </li>
            <li>Smelled good when I sniffed the bottle, but when I use it, it has an odd smell I can&#x27;t place, almost like honey.  </li>
            <li>For men who are less picky than women about shampoo, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it had only a very light scent if any.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I aways say that the 2 in 1 products rarely do either well, but this one is actually a 3 in 1 that seems to fare ok as a Body Wash/ shampoo and face wash, lathers up nicely although not really sufficient for a shower shave...</li>
            <li>A nice soap for men that covers the main 3 needs, a facial soap, body wash and hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Since I had most of a bottle left, I decided to try using it as a bubble bath for my son...</li>
            <li>love soaps, both solid and liquids.  </li>
            <li>For less than 4 bucks, Irish Spring Signature 3 provides a nice minty fresh scent and a wash that is easy to use and saves money from having to purchase additional products.  </li>
            <li>: It rinses off easy, lathers good, &amp; didn&#x27;t leave my body feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li>If you do not like strong scents, you may wish to use a different product.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t smell all that much like standard Irish Spring soap, the scent is pleasant and tilts towards the masculine side.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very musky.</li>
            <li>After using it I don&#x27;t really smell it on me.</li>
            <li>It does feel very bracing on the skin in a very invigorating way.  </li>
            <li>The Irish Spring Signature wash has the clean as a whistle soapiness you&#x27;d expect from them, but for the purposes of washing your hair</li>
            <li>My husband usually uses bar soap but was happy to try out this Irish Spring hair, face, and body wash.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fine and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a soapy residue, but there was just nothing special about this 3-in-1 to make me give up my usual shampoo and bar soap.</li>
            <li>He usually uses a dandruff shampoo but tried this on his hair and liked the result.  </li>
            <li>If I see it in a supermarket I may not have picked it up (except for the Irish spring label), but luckily I got it as a vine sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it seems highly concentrated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, if you use 3 in 1 body wash and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent...wish it were a little stronger though.</li>
            <li>it makes lots of suds and is surprisingly gentle on his young skin.</li>
            <li>As you&#x27;d expect, since it&#x27;s Irish Spring it smells like the wonderful green striped  bars of old and is of course, green.</li>
            <li>The scent seems strong while showering but half an hour after getting out of the shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a 3n1 body wash that you can use for your hair, body and face although I feel like it may be a little too strong for your face and drying for your hair.</li>
            <li>Says ok for hair... but its not very good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d argue that there&#x27;s no really distinction for most men between what they&#x27;re using to wash there face and body (outside of actual shaving creams).</li>
            <li>: missing that strong/fresh Irish Spring scent, low lather factor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a nice change of pace</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle, but the $9 price seems a bit on the high side.</li>
            <li>I love those scents on my husband, especially Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, which this reminds me of slightly (only slightly, though.)  </li>
            <li>I do think this wash is better overall vs the 3 in 1 version, but it&#x27;s not a good body wash.</li>
            <li>As the old commercial said, &amp;#34;Manly, yes, but</li>
            <li>I only had to use a small amount in my hand to get a full wash</li>
            <li>It washed well enough and has a strong enough scent to compensate for all the sweat and grime after a tough workout.</li>

            <li> In my hair it left it feeling dry &amp; on my face</li>
            <li> It washed well and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Irish Spring products in the past and have generally favorable opinions of them, but other than when testing this product for review, I never found myself reaching for this body wash in the shower.</li>
            <li> it left my skin dry &amp; tight.</li>
            <li> it left it feeling tight.</li>
            <li> It may have been handled rough because the top of the body wash was slightly cracked causing the product to pour out at an awkward angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a few problems with this body wash.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, Irish Spring is the brand of soap products that I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thick and sticky enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it sliding off my hands as I wash.</li>
            <li> , might be slightly too aggressive.</li>
            <li> The mild musk smell can be bad.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I think that it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, but from thickeners rather than active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It has mint extract, but it hardly had any mint scent.</li>
            <li> very poor &#x27;foaming&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The Bad: Besides smelling like barber shop aftershave, I didn&#x27;t feel clean/fresh after using this.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a review of both the 3 in 1 &amp; Hydrating body wash.  3 in 1 body wash. The smell is very musky. I can kind of smell a hint of mint. Best way I can describe the smell, it smells like a barber shop aftershave. The Good: It rinses off easy, lathers good, &amp; didn&#x27;t leave my body feeling dry or tight. The Bad: Besides smelling like barber shop aftershave, I didn&#x27;t feel clean/fresh after using this. In my hair it left it feeling dry &amp; on my face it left it feeling tight. I wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  Hydrating body wash. This has a mild musky like smell. Not bad, but not good. This stuff leaves most of my skin feeling soft. I did kind of feel clean/fresh after using. Rinses off good, &amp; lathers good. I like that the scent doesn&#x27;t really come off your body strong. After using it I don&#x27;t really smell it on me. Which I like. Only a few problems with this body wash. When I do smell the scent coming off my body, I don&#x27;t like. The mild musk smell can be bad. Some areas of my body it left my skin dry &amp; tight. &amp; Sometimes I didn&#x27;t feel fresh/clean after using this wash. (Felt like I needed to re-wash myself.) I do think this wash is better overall vs the 3 in 1 version, but it&#x27;s not a good body wash.</li>
            <li> I aways say that the 2 in 1 products rarely do either well, but this one is actually a 3 in 1 that seems to fare ok as a Body Wash/ shampoo and face wash, lathers up nicely although not really sufficient for a shower shave... but I&#x27;d argue that there&#x27;s no really distinction for most men between what they&#x27;re using to wash there face and body (outside of actual shaving creams). I&#x27;ll grant this is a softer mix overall and that&#x27;s likely the distinction that Irish Spring is making. As you&#x27;d expect, since it&#x27;s Irish Spring it smells like the wonderful green striped  bars of old and is of course, green.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very clean, refreshing smell and it lathers and rinses excellently.</li>
            <li> I needed something for showering at the gym and thought this might fit the bill. After a few uses I think that it does. It washed well enough and has a strong enough scent to compensate for all the sweat and grime after a tough workout. It also does a good job on the hair but I&#x27;m not too picky about that as I have short hair. It&#x27;s also thick and sticky enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it sliding off my hands as I wash.</li>
            <li> Pros: smooth skin (so says the wife), can use on hair, face, body.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: missing that strong/fresh Irish Spring scent, low lather factor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a nice change of pace but I&#x27;m switching back to the traditional Irish Spring body wash...missed the scent and great lather too much.</li>
            <li> A lot of the three in one body washes are sort of like shampoo that&#x27;s adequate for a body wash. The Irish Spring Signature wash has the clean as a whistle soapiness you&#x27;d expect from them, but for the purposes of washing your hair it&#x27;s like substituting body wash when you forgot to get more shampoo. If you have relatively short hair this will be great for you. But if you have longer hair, you&#x27;re better off sticking with something like the Dove Men+Care line or getting a separate shampoo, which sort of defeats the purpose of a three in one product.</li>
            <li> very poor &#x27;foaming&#x27;. Says ok for hair... but its not very good.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, not overpowering, just there...&lt;br /&gt;Not too sudsy, again just enough lather..&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a feeling of moisture on the skin after bath and gives a clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Several things going for this body wash... except.... the packaging. The bottle looks more like a cough syrup bottle or an oil bottle than a body wash. If I see it in a supermarket I may not have picked it up (except for the Irish spring label), but luckily I got it as a vine sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice body wash! I haven&#x27;t tried it on hair, though it claims it is shampoo too, but I can imagine it&#x27;d work out fine. The scent is very subdued (a nice thing in my opinion) and it makes a good lather when washing. Use with a spongy loofa is best. The price is right as well! No problems with this wash.. I don&#x27;t think I would use it as a facial wash though, might be slightly too aggressive.</li>
            <li> Smelled good when I sniffed the bottle, but when I use it, it has an odd smell I can&#x27;t place, almost like honey.  The bottle is on the small side, so I thought maybe the product was very concentrated, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s very thick, but from thickeners rather than active ingredients.  The scent seems strong while showering but half an hour after getting out of the shower there&#x27;s no residual scent, so that could be a plus or minus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it did clean well, rinsed off easily.  I&#x27;ll use all of it to be frugal, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll re-order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually big on body washes, but I used to like Irish Spring soap, and this is also a shampoo, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked it. It lathered up well on my wash cloth and stayed lathery which is a plus. Did well as a shampoo too - I used it on my head and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit on the thick side, so it is best to not squeeze out a whole lot at a time. It does work in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback was that it did not have the nice smell the soap used to have. It has mint extract, but it hardly had any mint scent. In fact, it had only a very light scent if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle, but the $9 price seems a bit on the high side.</li>
            <li> My husband usually uses bar soap but was happy to try out this Irish Spring hair, face, and body wash.  He liked the scent and thought it did well as a body soap.  He usually uses a dandruff shampoo but tried this on his hair and liked the result.  It doesn&#x27;t promise to do anything with dandruff, so he probably won&#x27;t use it as a shampoo too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried it too.  As the old commercial said, &amp;#34;Manly, yes, but I like it too.&amp;#34;  I thought it had a very pleasant and fresh scent - it reminds me of a day in the forest. I love those scents on my husband, especially Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, which this reminds me of slightly (only slightly, though.)  While I used it as a shampoo, I still had to use a conditioner to get my tangles out.  It washed well and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.  I only had to use a small amount in my hand to get a full wash so it seems highly concentrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Irish Spring products in the past and have generally favorable opinions of them, but other than when testing this product for review, I never found myself reaching for this body wash in the shower. The scent is fine and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a soapy residue, but there was just nothing special about this 3-in-1 to make me give up my usual shampoo and bar soap. Since I had most of a bottle left, I decided to try using it as a bubble bath for my son... it makes lots of suds and is surprisingly gentle on his young skin. Thus, recommended!</li>
            <li> Combination body washes are so convenient and while the scent is strong, it is very fresh and we like it alot. We do not limit its use to &amp;#34;men only&amp;#34; in our house. If you do not like strong scents, you may wish to use a different product.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best Irish Spring body wash, I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love the scent...wish it were a little stronger though.</li>
            <li> My s/o loves this body wash. It has a light manly scent and lathers very well. ( I hope they come out with one for women)&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this except for the packaging. It arrived in a brown envelope and since the top was not sealed more than enough leaked out into the package. It may have been handled rough because the top of the body wash was slightly cracked causing the product to pour out at an awkward angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 3n1 body wash that you can use for your hair, body and face although I feel like it may be a little too strong for your face and drying for your hair. Just stick to using this on your body is my recommendation.</li>
            <li> A nice soap for men that covers the main 3 needs, a facial soap, body wash and hair shampoo.  For men who are less picky than women about shampoo, this is a good product.  For less than 4 bucks, Irish Spring Signature 3 provides a nice minty fresh scent and a wash that is easy to use and saves money from having to purchase additional products.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring  in 1 Body Wash.  I love this product.  I love the smell of it, the way it cleans, everything about it.  In fact, it is so good, and it smells so good, that you want to keep on using it.  But you have to stop so that there will be some for next time!  It really is good.  I highly recommend this product, if you use 3 in 1 body wash and shampoo.  Minty scent.  For men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is my favorite thing about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love soaps, both solid and liquids.  I love smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells good and makes a person smell good and clean.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time,as advertised and in perfect condition.Refreshing and nice mint smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is like Irish Spring soap.  It&#x27;s pretty strong though and it leave you smelling like you are wearing a mens cologne - which is why they probably label this as a mens product.  It does feel very bracing on the skin in a very invigorating way.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my hair but I suppose a man with very short hair who doesn&#x27;t want to use a lot of products to take a shower would like it.  I do like the way that it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, Irish Spring is the brand of soap products that I usually buy.  It does a good job, I like the scent and texture, and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irish Spring Signature 3 in 1 Body Wash also meets this criteria.  While it doesn&#x27;t smell all that much like standard Irish Spring soap, the scent is pleasant and tilts towards the masculine side.  Works well as a shampoo too, which isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d use the bar soap for (even though it might work just fine).  And it does seem to moisturize and hydrate better than their bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a nice addition to the Irish Spring lineup.  I like it and recommend it.  5 stars.</li>
