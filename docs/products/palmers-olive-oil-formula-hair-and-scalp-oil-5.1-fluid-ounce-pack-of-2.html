            <li>FOR SURE</li>
            <li>I love to use this on my curls to hydrate them and make them healthy.</li>

            <li>just make sure you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>sure my review will help a lot of people, but, I will continue to purchase this</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and this is way better than using baby oil.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more when I run out and hope to be able to find it again.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it to moisturize my hair overnight.</li>
            <li>Love how the oil spritz on my hair lightly.</li>
            <li>This product is fairly greasy and can leave your hair greasy if you put to much.</li>
            <li>The combo of the other 3 products is amazing, this is not so amazing, but like I said the ingredients are good</li>
            <li>this use, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>The oil is light in both color and in absorbance.</li>
            <li>BUT I DOOOOOO love this stuff VERY much</li>
            <li>, It brought my hair out too a great shine, made it soft and more natural looking</li>
            <li>It really adds shine to my hair, and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>I have locs in my hair near my waist area and this keeps my oil thirsty hair nice, shiny and well nourished.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair look super greasy</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I sprayed it on washed hair.</li>
            <li>it works wonders and it leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I took a chance of purchasing this - especially as a two pack item.</li>
            <li>It styles so much easier.  </li>
            <li>i really like this oil for my braids.</li>
            <li>it really coats and protects the hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>This one I do not see much help from unlike the others, and the directions seem to be designed for another product.</li>
            <li>I spray it over my whole head, and rub it into the scalp.</li>
            <li>I also use this with DAX Pomade, which really does seem to help a lot.</li>
            <li>It leaves my head feeling greasy much like</li>
            <li>this does, but it really does seem to help, and it helps me style my hair.</li>
            <li>It defined my curls, which I didn&#x27;t really want.</li>
            <li>if I knew that I was going to pay this much for one bottle.</li>
            <li>and i dont have much breakage either using this stuff</li>
            <li>so the smell isn&#x27;t has intense.</li>
            <li>maybe i put too much on?</li>
            <li>I am sure it helps with the hair, but due to the directions being incorrect it lost a star.</li>
            <li>This product contains some great ingredients especially for those with natural hair who are trying to avoid harsh chemicals and those who are sporting locs.</li>
            <li>my only negative is that the smell is great</li>
            <li>main ingredient is canola oil ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t go on heavy.</li>
            <li>This is the second time that I have tried to contact them to make it right.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair just the right amount of oil before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I pump some directly on my scalp</li>
            <li>This was sliding down my face for a full 24 hours after I used it.</li>
            <li>The directions say to use on dry hair, so be aware.</li>
            <li>Daily use is easy and unmessy with a few sprays.</li>
            <li>If I am very very careful I can put a tiny dab in dry hair but more than that</li>
            <li>It does work very well when used as directed as a sheen spray on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Im not gonna spend time writing a whole paragraph about this stuff like some of the other people on here about spray!</li>

            <li> I have mostly white (a little gray) and it was very dry, damaged and lifeless.  I started using all-natural hair products which have made a huge, wonderful difference.  I still wanted healthy looking and shiny looking hair, however.  I was at the store and saw Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil and decided to buy it (I had read that olive oil was good for gray hair).  It really adds shine to my hair, and it looks so healthy. Palmer&#x27;s oil also makes my hair more manageable.  It styles so much easier.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> i really like this oil for my braids. i spray on wet braids and sit under the dryer.  it really coats and protects the hair and scalp.  my only negative is that the smell is great but it does not last for long; the oil also does not leave your hair with a sheen.  i would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;veronica</li>
            <li> Love this in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this to use with other Palmer&#x27;s olive oil products, namely the shampoo &amp; conditioner. This one I do not see much help from unlike the others, and the directions seem to be designed for another product. They state to use a few drops as needed, and it comes with a sprayer, not a drip nozzle. The shampoo and conditioner are wonderful, but I do not notice much difference from this. I am sure it helps with the hair, but due to the directions being incorrect it lost a star. I spray it over my whole head, and rub it into the scalp.

The combo of the other 3 products is amazing, this is not so amazing, but like I said the ingredients are good so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This  oil is very good . i would recommend it</li>
            <li> it didnt do any good to my daughters hair ...</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I sprayed it on washed hair. The directions say to use on dry hair, so be aware. I then went under the hood dryer for 20 minutes or so. It defined my curls, which I didn&#x27;t really want. I wanted my hair stretched out. It has a pleasant smell. However, you cannot use a lot of this stuff. This was sliding down my face for a full 24 hours after I used it. I have done this exact same thing with another spray oil, and have never experienced this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not an ingredient Nazi-natural. I don&#x27;t closely read the ingredients if it works well. However, the second ingredient is Isopropyl Myristate, which encourages breakouts. And after using, lets say I could see where the oil was sliding down my face by a couple of pimples. I would recommend washing your face thoroughly after using, which is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to finish the rest of the bottle using it as a sheen spray on dry hair after styling, while trying to avoid all contact with my face. If you buy this, I would recommend using it the same way as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve used this product for a solid week. It does work very well when used as directed as a sheen spray on dry hair. I would buy again IF it didn&#x27;t make me break out. Seriously, try to keep this away from your face! I would recommend that they take Isopropyl Myristate out of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Gives my hair just the right amount of oil before flat ironing. Use sparingly!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but when ordered it,I was suppose to have been a package of two. I only received one bottle. I could have gotten it somewhere else if I knew that I was going to pay this much for one bottle. This is the second time that I have tried to contact them to make it right. This is the reason I haven&#x27;t ordered anything since .</li>
            <li> Im not gonna spend time writing a whole paragraph about this stuff like some of the other people on here about spray! lol BUT I DOOOOOO love this stuff VERY much it works wonders and it leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth and i dont have much breakage either using this stuff also smells great if you have a boo who like to run his fingers through your hair ... FOR SURE MY GO TO SPRAY !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I  ordered this product Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil Formula Hair and Scalp Oil, not knowing what It was gonna do and all, but too my surprise, It brought my hair out too a great shine, made it soft and more natural looking it&#x27;s a great product, use it now!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ive seen improvement in my hair texture</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my curls to hydrate them and make them healthy. I mix it in with my conditioner or mousse and scrunch it into my hair. The product is really great for your scalp and your hair. This product is fairly greasy and can leave your hair greasy if you put to much. I recommend this for people with thick and curly, dry, or damaged hair.I have very dry , thick ,curly hair so this products helps a bunch . I don&#x27;t recommend using this product and then straightening or curling your hair. Oil plus heat equals frying and steaming. Then your hair will be more damaged than before. This product does like olive oil which grosses me out a bit. That&#x27;s why i mix it with something else so the smell isn&#x27;t has intense. I&#x27;m a big fan of this product just make sure you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hairs are dry. The only problem with this product is its smell. My husband also hates the smell.</li>
            <li> Love how the oil spritz on my hair lightly.</li>
            <li> I use this product on SHOW DOGS.&lt;br /&gt;For this use, it&#x27;s fabulous. It keeps their hair supple for in between showing.&lt;br /&gt;The spray works great giving it&#x27;s spraying an oil.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure my review will help a lot of people, but, I will continue to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;(p.s. I use it on Yorkie - who have HAIR!!)</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant smell. It also makes my hair soft. The oil is light in both color and in absorbance. Unlike a lot of oils, it doesn&#x27;t leave yellowish residue on clothing or on anything where the head can rest. I would recommend this product for hair that is rough around the edges. It can soften rough edges for a day. Daily use is easy and unmessy with a few sprays.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil Formula Hair and Scalp Oil is a very good product. Second time using it on my hair while i am in Afghanistan. Not to oily, really good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> toooo greasy ... main ingredient is canola oil ... what??? why not call it canola oil formula... my hair felt like i just got through swimming in a pool of chicken grease ... maybe i put too much on? im a little amazed at the reviews that no one else found this too greasy ... ? gone are the days of greasy hair and press and curls ... this is NOT the 80&#x27;s ... try again palmers!</li>
            <li> I was so glad that I took a chance of purchasing this - especially as a two pack item. I love it. I have locs in my hair near my waist area and this keeps my oil thirsty hair nice, shiny and well nourished. The smell is intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an asthmatic, I couldn&#x27;t deal with the aerosol spray Olive Oil in the can any longer as it was affecting my lungs, so I had to go with the pump in the bottle. It&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t go on heavy. I pump some directly on my scalp and then I would pump some in my hands to rub throughout my hair during my massages. I rub the excess on my hands and arms. I have dry skin and this is way better than using baby oil. This product contains some great ingredients especially for those with natural hair who are trying to avoid harsh chemicals and those who are sporting locs. I plan to purchase more when I run out and hope to be able to find it again. I even recommended this to one of my friends.</li>
            <li> My husband got this to use on his braids and didn&#x27;t like the smell so I tired it out.  I brush it through my hair before going to bed and then wash in the morning.  If I am very very careful I can put a tiny dab in dry hair but more than that and it makes my hair look super greasy but I absolutely love it to moisturize my hair overnight.</li>
            <li> I use these for the &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; portion of my L.O.C. routine. Lightweight and provides good coverage.</li>
