            <li>Not something fun or attractive to wear on your nails for a week or 2.</li>
            <li>Most of these went into the trash</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased so many of these</li>
            <li>I hope that they will still be on teh market when I need to order more.</li>
            <li>Love these things....</li>

            <li>Reasonable price for what you get, which are pretty much just sheets of less than great designs on a film.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used a product like this</li>
            <li>Only positive I can give this company is I received everything very quick.</li>
            <li>Once applied, they disintegrate after a day or two and the designs themselves don&#x27;t really stand out.</li>
            <li>The ones I really wanted (silver) were not sent to me.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast, most of the designs I did not like but for the price the few I did like was worth it.</li>
            <li>Dresses up a plain nail quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I have only used 2 decals on my big toes, but they are cute.</li>
            <li>I ordered metallic transfers and received mostly colored childish ones.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply at least.</li>
            <li>very old decals</li>
            <li>Pretty designs with lots of choices and different metallic finishes.</li>
            <li>You can not do a full manicure with the same design....there is not enough of any one design.  </li>
            <li>Not worth my time sending them back just to receive more junk</li>
            <li>, none work wasted time trying to get them on,they stick to the plastic cover and don&#x27;t last either way, Not returning them because it would probably cost me more to do so.</li>
            <li>there are so many designs to choose from and the slide right off with just a little water to wet the back</li>
            <li>They sent some cheap color decals that were juvenile</li>
            <li>I received the 12 items, however, I don´t have complete options (I can not prepare a manicure for 10 nails because I don´t have 10 flowers with the same figure or color)</li>
            <li>how many women, ladies, or teens want a cow,  donkey,  camel, giraffe, duck, one tiny golf green (I think), or a legless rooster put on one maybe two nails?  </li>

            <li> very inexpensive but not cheaply made!!!!!</li>
            <li> you have to wet the sticker then take it off and then apply it!!</li>

            <li> ,it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> The reason 1 only gave it 4 stars is because it was a little hard to figure it out!!</li>
            <li> Received a lot of poor  transfers that are BBQ grills, lobsters, crabs, corn, bowling pins and baby bottles.</li>
            <li> It was kinda hard to figure it out!!</li>
            <li> I agree  that some of the decals are weird, but whatever floats your boat.</li>
            <li> Very, Very disappointed!!</li>

            <li> These nail decals don&#x27;t last very long. Very easy to apply at least. Once applied, they disintegrate after a day or two and the designs themselves don&#x27;t really stand out. Reasonable price for what you get, which are pretty much just sheets of less than great designs on a film. Won&#x27;t be buying them again; I&#x27;m giving the rest of these away to the girls I babysit.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and they work perfectly.  A great bunch of products for yourself or children, with parental aid. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is great for what you pay and you get a lot for your money. If you are looking for a gift or something for yourself you should pick these up, you get a lot of different designs and some packs have 2 or 3 sheets.</li>
            <li> So many great choices. Easily applied and look great on my nails. Only one negative and I would say, the gold ones don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast, most of the designs I did not like but for the price the few I did like was worth it. This was the first time I used a product like this and it was really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> You can not do a full manicure with the same design....there is not enough of any one design.  Some decals would not detach from the paper without tearing and the other decals were just plain undesirable (about the nicest word I could come up with) how many women, ladies, or teens want a cow,  donkey,  camel, giraffe, duck, one tiny golf green (I think), or a legless rooster put on one maybe two nails?  Not me, but if that&#x27;s what appeals to you then this is your deal. Most of these went into the trash or I let my granddaughters play with them.</li>
            <li> very old decals, none work wasted time trying to get them on,they stick to the plastic cover and don&#x27;t last either way, Not returning them because it would probably cost me more to do so.</li>
            <li> I love the design and it stays on for days to weeks!! The reason 1 only gave it 4 stars is because it was a little hard to figure it out!! you have to wet the sticker then take it off and then apply it!! It was kinda hard to figure it out!! but i love the design!!</li>
            <li> Fuji water transfer decals for nails did not slide off the paper as instructed they broke up in tiny pieces and i cant use the,it was a waste of money and no I wont buy again.</li>
            <li> The pictures of these nail decals were not what I received. The ones I really wanted (silver) were not sent to me. They sent some cheap color decals that were juvenile so I gave them to a teenager. The gold ones are good. The bronze ones just don&#x27;t work with what I wear in nail polish. I contacted the seller and even asked if they could make a custom pack that included the silver in the brand that was in the pic. They did not communicate with me at all. I sent numerous messages that went unanswered. Finally I contacted Amazon and told them what was going on and they gave me a refund.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price</li>
            <li> I received the 12 items, however, I don´t have complete options (I can not prepare a manicure for 10 nails because I don´t have 10 flowers with the same figure or color)</li>

            <li> Very nice nail decals.  They apply nicely and are long wearing. Would recommend to professionals great way to increase your profits on nail services.  Great product and seller.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have purchased so many of these I hope that they will still be on teh market when I need to order more.</li>
            <li> there are so many designs to choose from and the slide right off with just a little water to wet the back</li>
            <li> great product lots of designs have used some of the designs &amp; love them. stayed on for over a week. put on a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Love these things.... I buy them as often as I can so that I have them on hand at all times.... very inexpensive but not cheaply made!!!!! cant wait to order more :)</li>
            <li> Great price. I have only used 2 decals on my big toes, but they are cute. I agree  that some of the decals are weird, but whatever floats your boat. When compared to the price you pay at a salon, if you only got one application, you&#x27;ve made your money back.</li>
            <li> I ordered metallic transfers and received mostly colored childish ones. Had I known I wasn&#x27;t ordering what was pictured simple, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered them. Besides being childish horrible graphics several are very large and can&#x27;t be cut down to fit on the nail. Received a lot of poor  transfers that are BBQ grills, lobsters, crabs, corn, bowling pins and baby bottles. HUH?? Not something fun or attractive to wear on your nails for a week or 2. Very, Very disappointed!! Not worth my time sending them back just to receive more junk, would rather just say I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. Only positive I can give this company is I received everything very quick.</li>
            <li> Pretty designs with lots of choices and different metallic finishes. Such as gold, copper, and metallic rainbows. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
