            <li> This product is very hard to find but worth the time in locating it.</li>
            <li> Moreover, a little of this mouthwash goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Just need a little bit diluted in water.</li>
            <li> as soon as I feel a &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; in my throat I start using it as a gargle &amp; within a few days</li>
            <li> Put some on a cotton swab, apply it to the sore, it burns, but sore goes away in a few days.</li>
            <li> Hard to find concentrated product that allows you mix to meet your needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 35 years.  </li>
            <li> I still get the cold, but I never get the sore throat, or cough that comes with it</li>

            <li> the &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; is gone &amp; it NEVER developes into a cold!</li>

            <li> My wife has been using Astringosol for two decades. She has found it effective in helping with sore throats and oral hygiene. Moreover, a little of this mouthwash goes a long way. A pack of three lasts us months. The only con is the steep price. Especially since the same  product is one fourth the price in Mexico.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even know they still made this.  Used it as a kid.  Also the teaberry flavor is so naustalgic as we had teaberries growing down by the creek while I was growing up.  Strong and needs to be greatly diluted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 35 years.  My dentist used it at his office in the 70s!  Love the taste too.</li>
            <li> I had been looking a long time for this product and finally found it here. I used to get it from Mexico, but it was discontinued and replaced by a watered-down version that doesn&#x27;t give me the same results. It prevents my gums from getting swollen or itchy.</li>
            <li> Hard to find concentrated product that allows you mix to meet your needs. Great for sore throat gargle, or to make your breath mint fresh. I like to use after brushing my teeth to kill any leftover bacteria. If you try it, start with a couple drops on a table spoon of water. Do not try it full strength...</li>
            <li> My family used this mouthwash years ago. It&#x27;s why I now love wintergreen flavor over all other &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; flavors. I was happy to find it again on Amazon. The best part, is that my quarterly periodontal cleanings have been easier, and my periodontist says continue using it, as it&#x27;s improved my gum issues more than ever. Very powerful. Just need a little bit diluted in water. The Best!!</li>
            <li> Only mouth wash that has taken away severe ginivitis.</li>
            <li> I always use it to add some mouthwash in my waterpik flosser. way cheaper than adding regular mouthwash.  handy too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since recommended by a doctor in 1969!  as soon as I feel a &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; in my throat I start using it as a gargle &amp; within a few days the &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; is gone &amp; it NEVER developes into a cold!</li>
            <li> Hard to find product, perfect for use with Water Pic, just a few drops in the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly at (expected) high price.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that takes your breath away and leaves your mouth feeling clean this is it. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Very Strong and works well ......... ! Hard to fine ......... My Dad use this in his practice for years !</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found that I could order this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that it wasn&#x27;t being made anymore.  It is good stuff.</li>
            <li> The best product I ever try</li>
            <li> This is product is strong and works very well with my Water-Pic.  Leaves your mouth feeling so refreshed!  This product is very hard to find but worth the time in locating it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this for a while. I&#x27;m glad I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m NOT A DOCTOR, but this is how I use it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I feel that I&#x27;m getting a sore throat or some kind of cold, I gargle this a bit stronger than the recommended dilution, and I mean just a bit, because this is VERY strong. I still get the cold, but I never get the sore throat, or cough that comes with it, it&#x27;s one less symptom to deal with and it&#x27;s beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive gums? use this. Sensitive teeth? use this. Bad breath? you know what do do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: try to gargle this at the strongest you can handle, the keywords here are what YOU CAN HANDLE, because if you gargle this without diluting it, it&#x27;ll peel skin off your mouth...been there done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, be careful how you use this, learn your limits, and this will keep your mouth and throat healthy as can be.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for sores in the mouth.  I use it full strength for tat purpose.  Put some on a cotton swab, apply it to the sore, it burns, but sore goes away in a few days.</li>
