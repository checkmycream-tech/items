            <li>Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to chemicals from strong fragrances, so I was very happy that this one didn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li>The company ships fast and has great customer service, too.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>( But i love the product:)</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the vitamin c product.</li>
            <li>but I will be ordering another for sure.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love vitamin C serum and what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>Then they said that they were offering more quantities and yet again...</li>

            <li>I will be buying more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely more plump.</li>
            <li>It has a pump style top and is a 2 ounce size.  </li>
            <li>Impressive results in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it has excellent ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Having no parabens too is a plus :-)</li>
            <li>Serum is smooth and absorbs nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>I love vitamin C cleansers and serums.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that most vitamin C serums also use hyaluronic acid serum and that includes this one.  </li>
            <li>When my husband came home from a work trip out of town he asked me what I changed because my skin looked so much better.</li>
            <li>definitely not the best.</li>
            <li>I encourage everyone to try azure naturals amazon I have purchased it three times already and love it</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite serum contains Retinol and literally costs four times the price per ounce as this Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the way it leaves my skin feeling after I apply it unless I use it</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product and love the lower price.</li>
            <li>It, like most vitamin C serums, feels a bit sticky when applied...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li>The things I like better with VoiBella</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Rich texture, quickly assimilated, luscious feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, packaging excellent, and they sure will have a returning customer with me...</li>
            <li>This is such a great product and it&#x27;s so nice that it comes in  this 2 oz quantity.</li>
            <li>The serum certainly contains ingredients that have been well publicized to be good for your complexion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is advertised like this and it is very true</li>
            <li>Then I unscrewed the top and found that the bottle was filled with the mass with almost the thickness of jello</li>
            <li>I have been using a Vitamin C 20% Serum for several months, but this one is superior and you cannot beat the price!  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice makes my skin feel amazing and does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes my face feel really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is dispensed easily through a pump</li>
            <li>Many of the others are just 1 ounce for the same,  or more money,  so this is really a good</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re just using it at night that might be fine</li>
            <li>I can see a difference in the reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li>However, it spreads easily and smoothly, and it isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Have used several brands of vit c serums with a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic quality for the price</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it would be useful for others</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>formula has a smooth soothing texture when applied to&lt;br /&gt;the face.</li>
            <li>This reviewer asked for and received a free product</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a week to test and review it (offered free from the manufacturer) and find that my skin responds well to it.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that itâ€™s in a gel form; itâ€™s non-greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging: the product arrived on schedule, packaged securely in bubble wrap and a padded envelope.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Great product - great price for quantity -  no bad smell, dries quickly on face skin without being sticky; no irritation; after 2 weeks wrinkles appear less visible - I intend to buy again!!!</li>
            <li>I really feel cheated!!!  </li>
            <li>My face is very smooth and in the morning my face looks pretty</li>
            <li>I saw significant improvement in my face appearance within one week.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Easily spread, the gel is absorbed rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use this serum as I purchased two bottles as a special.  </li>
            <li>The great foumula provides everything needed for our face, restore skin moisture, rebuild collagen and repair aged damage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just at reasonable affordable price, it also is a pretty nice serum to use.</li>
            <li>Now let&#x27;s see how good it actually works.</li>
            <li>In fact I saw an aesthetician earlier this week and she - as well as another technician in the office - remarked on how good my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using.    </li>
            <li>but no worries because once you let it dry for a minute and apply your moisturizer on top, your skin feels AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My skin really does feel and look firmer, more \\&quot;plumped\\&quot;, and has from very first application.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a very nice serum for keeping your skin smooth and looking younger and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first weeks she started to some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I wear this under make up and it dries quickly after applying.</li>
            <li>I have been really impressed with the results in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>but it subsided quickly.  </li>
            <li>Still the Best price around and same quality as the others, But the second order comes with dropper instead of pump.</li>
            <li>This little bottle will give you that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has made a difference from the very first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far!</li>
            <li>VoiBella offers an advanced skin serum which is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;and apply.</li>
            <li>I hope they can reformulate into something more natural and holistic.</li>
            <li>I am noticing forehead lines softening and smile and nasal labia lines smoothing as well.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my makeup looks better than before I used VoiBella Advanced to absorb moisture.  </li>
            <li>it is the most transparent, clear serum I have tried</li>
            <li>therefore my assumption is how much of it actually penetrate your skin to be effective.</li>
            <li>so it is nice to have one that actually comes through when it says it will.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has no odor, hydrates and gives a healthy glow to my 60+ year old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely affordable, pleasantly non-scented (I detest the smell of so many skin products), and has a wondrous, thick gel formula that glides easily and more importantly, absorbs readily into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started using this product right after I received it.</li>
            <li>The serum goes on smoothly and is odorless and does a good job of tightening the skin and removing small wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>serum goes on smoothly and is odorless and does a good job of tightening the skin and removing small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a very nice serum for keeping your skin smooth and looking younger and I would highly recommend it, especially at the price</li>
            <li>serum itself please me a lot and seem very promising.</li>
            <li>I woke up to a soft face this morning and can notice my fine lines diminishing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth as soft , I highly recommend this for any one!!</li>
            <li>I suspect that it will get better with time and if necessary would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because I believe this serum is still working it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>I know I use more than the recommended amount, but I apply on face, neck, and bust area twice daily.  </li>
            <li>I predict it lasting more than 6 months and am thrilled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started using the serum about 2 weeks ago and so far I have noticed the pores on my face appear smaller, my forehead looks smoother and wrinkle free and my face looks more youthful.</li>
            <li>First time user</li>
            <li>so it will be interesting to see the progression for the next couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Do not know what the first order was.</li>
            <li>one has many features that I especially like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also love the money back guarantee that shows the confidence the manufacturer has in their product!  </li>
            <li>After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance.</li>
            <li>it is not the best sorry.</li>
            <li>If I use more than that my skin is left feeling sticky</li>
            <li>I will be looking forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face for better than two weeks now and the initial results are in.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>, she has no idea where she got it in the first place.</li>
            <li>although I prefer the eye dropper kind of applicator, the pump on this serum works extremely well</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid has been on television a lot lately for several hundred dollars, but adding the Ferulic Acid and 20% Vitamin C to the formula make this serum unique and much more effective on my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin and break out easily with most products but have had absolutely no issue with your product.  </li>
            <li>I think I may be using too much as I have almost finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that dries out quickly, the once a day application worked well for me: applying each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly has some sort of illuminating effect.  </li>
            <li>but only time will tell if it will do anything for my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is huge (2 oz) for regular serum bottle.</li>
            <li>It really does minimize facial lines and makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I didnt break out and has left my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The product delivers on its promises and is set at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t worry for it to run out fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much smoother now</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so much smoother and gives it the vitamins it needs.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product twice now and really like it.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>At almost 38 it is even working really well for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much change at this time, will keep using it</li>
            <li>so the bottle goes very far&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product really works.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product this summer and find that I really prefer the consistency.</li>
            <li>This is a very sticky serum not all serums need to be so sticky and it also coagulate s</li>
            <li>how can it really work</li>
            <li>and I have had no problem regulating how much comes out.  </li>
            <li>very sparingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this Vitamin C Serum is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li>The combination of ingredients in this products really helps with moisturizing the skin and keeping it protected.</li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently have been looking into more natural ways to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have recently just started using this product and use others much like it, but this is so refreshing and clean smelling and absorbs so quickly that I love it - not sure if it will replace other products, but will be part of my regimen.</li>
            <li>This serum is a bit thicker than other Vitamin C products, making it easier to apply and leaving my face with a better feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no noticeable scent for the serum, a difference from many of the other products out there</li>
            <li>like most of the other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do see a difference in that my skin is more even, brown spots are much less visible</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a gel - it&#x27;s not greasy or oily like some of the other serums I have reviewed which is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad the serum doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, and the gel texture isn&#x27;t runny and doesn&#x27;t drip down my face or fingers.</li>
            <li>Wow, it&#x27;s a really big bottle, really a double size than I usually get and with a great sale price!</li>
            <li>She is about 70 years old and she doesn&#x27;t really use facial products so when I gave her the serum to try, she was excited.</li>
            <li>a 20+ years type 2 diabetic and dry skin has been a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li>Second, it absorbs quickly, I can go from serum to makeup in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>the gel feels slightly sticky at first, but dries to a smooth, shiny finish in</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>First time I have used this product and actually noticed quite a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbed into the skin instantly.  </li>
            <li>In just a few days my skin looked brighter and more elasticity in it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was surprisingly quick, therefore, I did not have to wait long to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s my question we&#x27;ll see how my hands and chest look August half of it on one side of my body and see if there&#x27;s a difference if so I&#x27;ll report back a more positive review.</li>
            <li>plus there are other important ingredients in the serum to replace what we lose as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can live with this, but some people may not.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula or was affected by the heat during delivery.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida so anything that is oily makes me look like I&#x27;ve sat in the sauna all day without a towel.</li>
            <li>I wanted to tried new products, my mistake I should buy  what I was using before Austin poppy vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and there have been no breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li>Generally I&#x27;ve found that pushing the pump down only half way gives me an ideal amount of serum.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that gives my face an instant glow.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy at all!</li>
            <li>This product has made my face and neck smoother, softer with less fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I found this serum the next day and it is even more concentrated than the other at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BEST 100% Pure Vitamin C 20% Serum For Face (2 Oz &#x3D; DOUBLE SIZE) with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid &amp; Vitamin E and B - TRIPLE ACTION Anti Aging Skin Serum</li>
            <li>and I already noticed a huge difference; the dark spots started to disappear and my face look brighter in general.  </li>
            <li>It helps clear my skin--</li>
            <li>Would absolutely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C 20% Serum I&#x27;ve seen so far.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 week and can already tell a marked improvement in the moisture retained in my aging skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it both day and night and it has been keeping my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>figured if I did not like it that much I would just use it on my neck chest area elbows and back of hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably too early to see any noticeable results, but the scars are fading bit by bit (and I&#x27;ll update again after I use it longer).</li>
            <li>We were really surprised to see results in just s couple of days.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft every morning</li>
            <li>This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Complete satisfaction with the quality and price of VoiBella Vitamin C Serum.    </li>
            <li>Also not as thick as it was before, more like oil than serum.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the expensive Vitamin C serums do...maybe even better.</li>
            <li>For being such a small bottle, surprisingly it does last very long!</li>
            <li>is a loose gelatinous suspension, a little more amber in color than clear, not greasy or cloudy, but thick and light in feel.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Vit C serum for the last 2 years and this does seem to be one of new favorites.  </li>
            <li>It was very sticky and took a while to dry on my face.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so refreshed and soaks in quickly enough that I can apply my make up without having to wait as long as I do when applying creams or lotions first.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this serum as it contains all the ingredients necessary to &amp;#34;turn back the hands of time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It goes on cleanly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it , I felt a slight tingle on my skin</li>
            <li>First order was clear white, the second a dark yellow/orange in color.</li>
            <li>After using the serum for a few weeks the results are in and even though she doesn&#x27;t like it quite as much as the other serum she agreed that the results for the price difference are pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;Iâ€™ve tried several different preparations, and pricing varies widely from a 2 â€“ 4 % solution that is easily found through â€˜eliteâ€™ brands at 10 times the price of this product, with half of the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>My skin, which over the years has seen a lot of sun and wind, is definitely moister and smoother than it was when I started, and my mild case of rosacea, which I&#x27;ve had primarily on my right cheek for the past few years, is less noticeable than it was when I began this regimen.</li>

            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Rich texture, quickly assimilated, luscious feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, packaging excellent, and they sure will have a returning customer with me...</li>
            <li> This is such a great product and it&#x27;s so nice that it comes in  this 2 oz quantity.</li>
            <li> The serum certainly contains ingredients that have been well publicized to be good for your complexion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is advertised like this and it is very true</li>
            <li> Then I unscrewed the top and found that the bottle was filled with the mass with almost the thickness of jello</li>
            <li> I have been using a Vitamin C 20% Serum for several months, but this one is superior and you cannot beat the price!  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice makes my skin feel amazing and does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes my face feel really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is dispensed easily through a pump</li>
            <li> Many of the others are just 1 ounce for the same,  or more money,  so this is really a good</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re just using it at night that might be fine</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in the reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> However, it spreads easily and smoothly, and it isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Have used several brands of vit c serums with a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic quality for the price</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it would be useful for others</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> formula has a smooth soothing texture when applied to&lt;br /&gt;the face.</li>
            <li> This reviewer asked for and received a free product</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a week to test and review it (offered free from the manufacturer) and find that my skin responds well to it.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that itâ€™s in a gel form; itâ€™s non-greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: the product arrived on schedule, packaged securely in bubble wrap and a padded envelope.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Great product - great price for quantity -  no bad smell, dries quickly on face skin without being sticky; no irritation; after 2 weeks wrinkles appear less visible - I intend to buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I really feel cheated!!!  </li>
            <li> My face is very smooth and in the morning my face looks pretty</li>
            <li> I saw significant improvement in my face appearance within one week.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Easily spread, the gel is absorbed rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use this serum as I purchased two bottles as a special.  </li>
            <li> The great foumula provides everything needed for our face, restore skin moisture, rebuild collagen and repair aged damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just at reasonable affordable price, it also is a pretty nice serum to use.</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s see how good it actually works.</li>
            <li> In fact I saw an aesthetician earlier this week and she - as well as another technician in the office - remarked on how good my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using.    </li>
            <li> but no worries because once you let it dry for a minute and apply your moisturizer on top, your skin feels AMAZING.</li>
            <li> My skin really does feel and look firmer, more \\&quot;plumped\\&quot;, and has from very first application.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a very nice serum for keeping your skin smooth and looking younger and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first weeks she started to some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I wear this under make up and it dries quickly after applying.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with the results in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> but it subsided quickly.  </li>
            <li> Still the Best price around and same quality as the others, But the second order comes with dropper instead of pump.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will give you that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one has made a difference from the very first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far!</li>
            <li> VoiBella offers an advanced skin serum which is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;and apply.</li>
            <li> I hope they can reformulate into something more natural and holistic.</li>
            <li> I am noticing forehead lines softening and smile and nasal labia lines smoothing as well.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my makeup looks better than before I used VoiBella Advanced to absorb moisture.  </li>
            <li> it is the most transparent, clear serum I have tried</li>
            <li> therefore my assumption is how much of it actually penetrate your skin to be effective.</li>
            <li> so it is nice to have one that actually comes through when it says it will.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has no odor, hydrates and gives a healthy glow to my 60+ year old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely affordable, pleasantly non-scented (I detest the smell of so many skin products), and has a wondrous, thick gel formula that glides easily and more importantly, absorbs readily into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started using this product right after I received it.</li>
            <li> The serum goes on smoothly and is odorless and does a good job of tightening the skin and removing small wrinkles.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I woke up to a soft face this morning and can notice my fine lines diminishing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth as soft , I highly recommend this for any one!!</li>
            <li> I suspect that it will get better with time and if necessary would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because I believe this serum is still working it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> I know I use more than the recommended amount, but I apply on face, neck, and bust area twice daily.  </li>
            <li> I predict it lasting more than 6 months and am thrilled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started using the serum about 2 weeks ago and so far I have noticed the pores on my face appear smaller, my forehead looks smoother and wrinkle free and my face looks more youthful.</li>
            <li> First time user</li>
            <li> so it will be interesting to see the progression for the next couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Do not know what the first order was.</li>
            <li> one has many features that I especially like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also love the money back guarantee that shows the confidence the manufacturer has in their product!  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance.</li>
            <li> it is not the best sorry.</li>
            <li> If I use more than that my skin is left feeling sticky</li>
            <li> I will be looking forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face for better than two weeks now and the initial results are in.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> , she has no idea where she got it in the first place.</li>
            <li> although I prefer the eye dropper kind of applicator, the pump on this serum works extremely well</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid has been on television a lot lately for several hundred dollars, but adding the Ferulic Acid and 20% Vitamin C to the formula make this serum unique and much more effective on my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin and break out easily with most products but have had absolutely no issue with your product.  </li>
            <li> I think I may be using too much as I have almost finished my first bottle</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that dries out quickly, the once a day application worked well for me: applying each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly has some sort of illuminating effect.  </li>
            <li> but only time will tell if it will do anything for my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is huge (2 oz) for regular serum bottle.</li>
            <li> It really does minimize facial lines and makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I didnt break out and has left my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The product delivers on its promises and is set at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t worry for it to run out fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much smoother now</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so much smoother and gives it the vitamins it needs.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and really like it.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> At almost 38 it is even working really well for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change at this time, will keep using it</li>
            <li> so the bottle goes very far&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product really works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product this summer and find that I really prefer the consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a very sticky serum not all serums need to be so sticky and it also coagulate s</li>
            <li> how can it really work</li>
            <li> and I have had no problem regulating how much comes out.  </li>
            <li> very sparingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this Vitamin C Serum is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li> The combination of ingredients in this products really helps with moisturizing the skin and keeping it protected.</li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently have been looking into more natural ways to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have recently just started using this product and use others much like it, but this is so refreshing and clean smelling and absorbs so quickly that I love it - not sure if it will replace other products, but will be part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> This serum is a bit thicker than other Vitamin C products, making it easier to apply and leaving my face with a better feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no noticeable scent for the serum, a difference from many of the other products out there</li>
            <li> like most of the other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do see a difference in that my skin is more even, brown spots are much less visible</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a gel - it&#x27;s not greasy or oily like some of the other serums I have reviewed which is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad the serum doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, and the gel texture isn&#x27;t runny and doesn&#x27;t drip down my face or fingers.</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s a really big bottle, really a double size than I usually get and with a great sale price!</li>
            <li> She is about 70 years old and she doesn&#x27;t really use facial products so when I gave her the serum to try, she was excited.</li>
            <li> a 20+ years type 2 diabetic and dry skin has been a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li> Second, it absorbs quickly, I can go from serum to makeup in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> the gel feels slightly sticky at first, but dries to a smooth, shiny finish in</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> First time I have used this product and actually noticed quite a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbed into the skin instantly.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days my skin looked brighter and more elasticity in it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was surprisingly quick, therefore, I did not have to wait long to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my question we&#x27;ll see how my hands and chest look August half of it on one side of my body and see if there&#x27;s a difference if so I&#x27;ll report back a more positive review.</li>
            <li> plus there are other important ingredients in the serum to replace what we lose as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can live with this, but some people may not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula or was affected by the heat during delivery.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida so anything that is oily makes me look like I&#x27;ve sat in the sauna all day without a towel.</li>
            <li> I wanted to tried new products, my mistake I should buy  what I was using before Austin poppy vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and there have been no breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li> Generally I&#x27;ve found that pushing the pump down only half way gives me an ideal amount of serum.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that gives my face an instant glow.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy at all!</li>
            <li> This product has made my face and neck smoother, softer with less fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I found this serum the next day and it is even more concentrated than the other at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BEST 100% Pure Vitamin C 20% Serum For Face (2 Oz &#x3D; DOUBLE SIZE) with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid &amp; Vitamin E and B - TRIPLE ACTION Anti Aging Skin Serum</li>
            <li> and I already noticed a huge difference; the dark spots started to disappear and my face look brighter in general.  </li>
            <li> It helps clear my skin--</li>
            <li> Would absolutely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C 20% Serum I&#x27;ve seen so far.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 week and can already tell a marked improvement in the moisture retained in my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it both day and night and it has been keeping my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> figured if I did not like it that much I would just use it on my neck chest area elbows and back of hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably too early to see any noticeable results, but the scars are fading bit by bit (and I&#x27;ll update again after I use it longer).</li>
            <li> We were really surprised to see results in just s couple of days.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so soft every morning</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Complete satisfaction with the quality and price of VoiBella Vitamin C Serum.    </li>
            <li> Also not as thick as it was before, more like oil than serum.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the expensive Vitamin C serums do...maybe even better.</li>
            <li> For being such a small bottle, surprisingly it does last very long!</li>
            <li> is a loose gelatinous suspension, a little more amber in color than clear, not greasy or cloudy, but thick and light in feel.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Vit C serum for the last 2 years and this does seem to be one of new favorites.  </li>
            <li> It was very sticky and took a while to dry on my face.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so refreshed and soaks in quickly enough that I can apply my make up without having to wait as long as I do when applying creams or lotions first.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this serum as it contains all the ingredients necessary to &amp;#34;turn back the hands of time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It goes on cleanly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it , I felt a slight tingle on my skin</li>
            <li> First order was clear white, the second a dark yellow/orange in color.</li>
            <li> After using the serum for a few weeks the results are in and even though she doesn&#x27;t like it quite as much as the other serum she agreed that the results for the price difference are pretty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Iâ€™ve tried several different preparations, and pricing varies widely from a 2 â€“ 4 % solution that is easily found through â€˜eliteâ€™ brands at 10 times the price of this product, with half of the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> My skin, which over the years has seen a lot of sun and wind, is definitely moister and smoother than it was when I started, and my mild case of rosacea, which I&#x27;ve had primarily on my right cheek for the past few years, is less noticeable than it was when I began this regimen.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as some vitamin C serums, but seems to be easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, I know from past experience that my skin responds very positively to vitamin C type products.</li>
            <li> This bottle should go a long way I have used it daily for three weeks</li>
            <li> size of the product was much bigger than expected, it should last me a long time with daily use!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days, but have noticed some positive slight changes already.</li>
            <li> I tested the product on a dry patch around my nose and by the next day, the dry patch was gone.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer and less tight.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this  product as long as I can</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had it so long</li>
            <li> I find that hyaluronic acid serums offer softening, wrinkle smoothing, and moisturizing to my skin and vitamin C serums augment those qualities plus adding a shiny, smooth base that makes a perfect base for my moisturizer and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Last thing to mention is that this serum is less expensive than many of the other Vitamin C serums out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price per ounce this one is currently about half the price of the other brand I tried, the price point is the same (currently about $20) but this is 2 oz.</li>
            <li> You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and after approximately three weeks of using it, my facial lines seem to have softened, somewhat, but not completely diminish ...</li>
            <li> The other one is from a different make.</li>
            <li> but you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> it will turn into tiny little balls and flake off your skin</li>
            <li> After careful review, I found that Vit C serums have a yellow/orange tinge and an oil type of consistency.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much harder to apply</li>
            <li> What I got was just pink water.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin.</li>
            <li> and I really do not see a difference.</li>
            <li> She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it.</li>
            <li> However, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> if you compare to other suppliers on Amazon, Ebay or elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> other Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> Nothing like the 2 other previous Vitamin C serums I have gotten from other companies.</li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way and the skin feels firmer almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> L. Braganca&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, even my dark marks are shedding.</li>
            <li> and this is well packed in a dark bottle.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight, hint of a medicine smell per say.</li>
            <li> I am half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> I miss a sale the previous day).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I miss a sale the previous day).</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use I&#x27;ve used less than a quarter of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just a little upset because my cat decided to throw it on the floor &amp; i lost half of it:</li>
            <li> It leaves a freshen feeling without pulling skin tight.</li>
            <li> and once you have it on your skin wait a few minutes or even a half hour</li>
            <li> it takes just a little serum to spread out</li>
            <li> so it has little impact on my &amp;#34;get out the door&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The skin is smoother after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, my skin</li>
            <li> I received this Vitamin C Serum just a few days ago and I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it feels a bit sticky on my face once it has dried.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use I notice that my face is just brighter.  </li>
            <li> just a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> This product really dried out my skin, I had to stop using it after three weeks.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, that quality is bad, feel like gel and sticky</li>
            <li> Ill probably come back with an update review and let you guys know.</li>
            <li> Unable to contact seller, contact information a blank page.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> bottle is fairly small, just 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> Not very good flavor .</li>
            <li> I think ill have to use it a little longer to find out!</li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t thick and stinky like the others that i have used!</li>
            <li> ( ...even tough</li>
            <li> ( ...even tough</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed as I expected a serum in a pump bottle - what I got was a dropper bottle with pink liquid.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that if the serum was oily or greasy, it would make matters worse.</li>
            <li> I have also broken out after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick it is difficult to pump it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This one was by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether I received a bad bottle, but I think that I am scratching this one off my list.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive,  why you want to buy the expensive one when they works the same?&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> At 2 ounces for just under $20 â€“ you canâ€™t go wrong with this, and you wonâ€™t break your bank.</li>
            <li> I have used was very thin and runny almost like water.  </li>
            <li> I would pay for the correct amount so at least give me the correct amount.... just sooo disappointed....</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing that I will make it a point not to order from this place again.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested that I use Vitamin C on my face and wanted me to buy it from him at an outrageous price.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days, but have noticed some positive slight changes already. Thank you! Would absolutely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all.  It absorbed into the skin instantly.  I tested the product on a dry patch around my nose and by the next day, the dry patch was gone.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product all around.  Fantastic quality for the price -- you cannot beat it! It does exactly what the expensive Vitamin C serums do...maybe even better. The company ships fast and has great customer service, too. You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I love this product . I use it twice a day and have had amazing results . It leaves my skin smooth as soft , I highly recommend this for any one!!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product and it&#x27;s so nice that it comes in  this 2 oz quantity. It goes on nice makes my skin feel amazing and does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice size bottle! It came in a bubble wrap pouch, protecting the bottle. I did notice a slight, hint of a medicine smell per say. I didnt break out and has left my face feeling smooth. I like the feel of it and it absorbs very nice.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I would recommend to anyone. The serum isn&#x27;t thick and stinky like the others that i have used! I woke up to a soft face this morning and can notice my fine lines diminishing. I have always heard the wonders of vitamin C for your face and now i believe them!! Thank you ! great product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product right after I received it. Very good product. In just a few days my skin looked brighter and more elasticity in it. Very pleased! I wear this under make up and it dries quickly after applying. No residue .left on skin and my skin felt nice after application. I would recommend this .&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised like this and it is very true&lt;br /&gt;BEST 100% Pure Vitamin C 20% Serum For Face (2 Oz &#x3D; DOUBLE SIZE) with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid &amp; Vitamin E and B - TRIPLE ACTION Anti Aging Skin Serum That Works</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far! Ive been using it for about a week not.  The first thing I noticed is that gives my face an instant glow. I wear it at night before my moisturizer and I wake up to glowing, bright skin. but only time will tell if it will do anything for my fine lines and wrinkles.  I think ill have to use it a little longer to find out! Ill probably come back with an update review and let you guys know. I do recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking to brighten up your complexion and even out your skintone.</li>
            <li> very good and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased for $1 in exchange for my review. I did not care for this product. To me it smelled and looked like chemically kool-aid. Left skin feeling sticky. Have used several brands of vit c serums with a more pleasant experience. I hope they can reformulate into something more natural and holistic.</li>
            <li> great product!!! Just a little upset because my cat decided to throw it on the floor &amp; i lost half of it:( But i love the product:) great job!</li>
            <li> Awesome, this stuff is amazing I use it daily</li>
            <li> Received the VoiBella Vitamin C Serum and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The product delivers on its promises and is set at a reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;Thank  you for your good customer service and outstanding products.</li>
            <li> I am half way through the bottle and I can see some results.  I suspect that it will get better with time and if necessary would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because I believe this serum is still working it&#x27;s magic.  I know I use more than the recommended amount, but I apply on face, neck, and bust area twice daily.  I use this serum in conjunction with antioxidant vitamin C cream. I am noticing forehead lines softening and smile and nasal labia lines smoothing as well. The bottle is truly generous,  and I use a lot.  I predict it lasting more than 6 months and am thrilled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum as it contains all the ingredients necessary to &amp;#34;turn back the hands of time&amp;#34;. Collegen and vitamin C aid in helping rebuild the skin plus there are other important ingredients in the serum to replace what we lose as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this serum as I purchased two bottles as a special.  I feel good about using it. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the vitamin c product. I use it every morning and night. I am extremely happy with the way it works and think that my skin has improved since using it. I also have extremely sensitive skin and break out easily with most products but have had absolutely no issue with your product.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have been using the Vitamin C serum for almost 2 months. I like the results . I think I may be using too much as I have almost finished my first bottle but I will be ordering another for sure. Very moisturizing without feeling sticky or greasy. Cant wait to see if it holds up to winter weather.</li>
            <li> It helps clear my skin-- but you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> Even a man doesn&#x27;t like bags under his eyes. This has helped lessen the bags under mine. The skin is smoother after just a few days.</li>
            <li> L. Braganca&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, even my dark marks are shedding. I will try again another bottle as soon as I finish this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the product! It helps my skin and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Thank you for checking in with me. I use it every morning when I wake up and in the evening before I go to sleep. For being such a small bottle, surprisingly it does last very long! So I don&#x27;t worry for it to run out fast. My skin feels great and I can already see the difference.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product because I have oily skin. I was concerned that if the serum was oily or greasy, it would make matters worse. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy at all! It&#x27;s very light. It feels nice on the skin, and I have been using it twice a day under moisturizers and creams as well as under makeup. My skin is noticeably softer and smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently have been looking into more natural ways to take care of my skin.  This vitamin c is a of really good quality and I got it at a great price.</li>
            <li> I loved these product! I use it everyday, my skin it&#x27;s much smoother now</li>
            <li> I tried pumping the and nothing would come out. Then I unscrewed the top and found that the bottle was filled with the mass with almost the thickness of jello (no wonder the pump wouldn&#x27;t work). Tasted it and was surprised that there was absolutely no Vitamin C tartness. Not sure whether I received a bad bottle, but I think that I am scratching this one off my list. The fact that this formulation contains propylene glycol was the final straw.</li>
            <li> Got my serum!!! And only for $1.00 using Amazon Prime!!! Best purchase I&#x27;ve made so far. Now let&#x27;s see how good it actually works.</li>
            <li> I received the package intact and on time ... Directions are to put ten drops in hand and massage into face and neck in an upward motion ... It&#x27;s very soothing and after approximately three weeks of using it, my facial lines seem to have softened, somewhat, but not completely diminish ...I have very good skin for my age and this serum made a difference so I&#x27;m sure it would be useful for others, I would definitely recommend this to my friends a well as anyone else ... I&#x27;ve had no skin reactions or breakouts or complications  from this product at all ...</li>
            <li> This bottle should go a long way I have used it daily for three weeks and there is still lots left. It has made my complexion clearer ans firmer. that takes years off of my age!</li>
            <li> Exfoliated and improved on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Wonderful formulation!!  Great customer service follow-up.  I purchased this product at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Wow, it&#x27;s a really big bottle, really a double size than I usually get and with a great sale price! I&#x27;m amazed! This serum is not only with vitamin C but also with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E and B. The great foumula provides everything needed for our face, restore skin moisture, rebuild collagen and repair aged damage. You just have to try it to believe it! I use it mostly every night, and hope to see more visible result day after day! Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love vitamin C serum and what it does for my skin. It makes my skin so much smoother and gives it the vitamins it needs.</li>
            <li> Started using the serum about 2 weeks ago and so far I have noticed the pores on my face appear smaller, my forehead looks smoother and wrinkle free and my face looks more youthful. I have been really impressed with the results in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to try this, but when I tried to order it wouldn&#x27;t accept the coupon and then it said that quantities were gone. Then they said that they were offering more quantities and yet again...the coupon code wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. ...</li>
            <li> It received the goods well . Not very good flavor .</li>
            <li> This product has made my face and neck smoother, softer with less fine lines.  My pores are smaller and my makeup looks better than before I used VoiBella Advanced to absorb moisture.  Hyaluronic Acid has been on television a lot lately for several hundred dollars, but adding the Ferulic Acid and 20% Vitamin C to the formula make this serum unique and much more effective on my aging skin.  I have receive many compliments from family and friends since using this product.  My plan is to keep using this amazing  anti-aging formula and tell everyone about it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer and less tight. I have only used it for 4 days but feel it is a product I will continue to use. I have very sensitive skin and there have been no breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li> The serum goes on smoothly and is odorless and does a good job of tightening the skin and removing small wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very nice serum for keeping your skin smooth and looking younger and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The best value Vitamin C 20% Serum I&#x27;ve seen so far.  I like the gentleness of the serums absorption on my skin. My face feels and look more toned. This jar is so big that I plan to use it day and night to help even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t break out or get redness at all. I love it. I will be buying more when I finish this bottle. It makes my face feel so refreshed and soaks in quickly enough that I can apply my make up without having to wait as long as I do when applying creams or lotions first. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and really like it. I began to receive compliments on my skin which is really nice. Did all my wrinkles disappear...no, but my skin has a healthier glow and it is definitely more plump. It is also a great deal. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 week and can already tell a marked improvement in the moisture retained in my aging skin. Will continue to use this  product as long as I can</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge (2 oz) for regular serum bottle. Therefore, for the price, this is a steal. It&#x27;s not just at reasonable affordable price, it also is a pretty nice serum to use. I gave it to my aunt to try. She absolutely loves it. She is about 70 years old and she doesn&#x27;t really use facial products so when I gave her the serum to try, she was excited. It&#x27;s been a month, I can tell from her glowing skin, it is brighter and smoother. She likes the texture of this serum too. Very easy to absorb, doesn&#x27;t take time to wait. It moisturizes her face instantly. Her wrinkles seem to be smoother too. I just like how it makes her to look and she loves the feeling of this serum too.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at discount in exchange for an honest review. My aunt gives this serum thumb up.</li>
            <li> This serum is really good for my skin. It clears and tightens it and each morning I look younger. At almost 38 it is even working really well for me. Great product and an awesome value</li>
            <li> First time user and I&#x27;m a Fan.  It really does minimize facial lines and makes my skin feel so smooth.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this Vitamin C Serum just a few days ago and I can already see a difference in my skin. The fines lines and crows feet around my eyes seem to be plumped up. My pore size seems smaller and just overall my skin tone/texture seems to be improved.&lt;br /&gt;This serum contains Vitamins C,B, and E as well as Hyaluronic Acid and Ferulic Acid.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It has a pump style top and is a 2 ounce size.  Many of the others are just 1 ounce for the same,  or more money,  so this is really a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a promotional price and I am happy to share my opinion of this product with others considering whether or not to buy it.  I recommend this to those wanting to work in the facial issues that I mentioned. My experience has been a younger looking face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the product itself yet, but I feel cheated!!!  I ordered this 2oz bottle so it would last longer.  I poured the contents into a 1oz spray bottle that I like to use and it took the entire contents (just like a 1oz bottle). Nothing was left over!!!  I really feel cheated!!!  This is so disappointing that I will make it a point not to order from this place again.  I would pay for the correct amount so at least give me the correct amount.... just sooo disappointed....</li>
            <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients in this serum. It feels nice and soothing when I&#x27;m applying it to my face. The problem is that it feels a bit sticky on my face once it has dried. I can live with this, but some people may not.</li>
            <li> The serum certainly contains ingredients that have been well publicized to be good for your complexion.  Very little goes a long way and the skin feels firmer almost immediately.  Impressive results in a short amount of time.  Used for 3 days now so it will be interesting to see the progression for the next couple weeks.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use I notice that my face is just brighter.  It certainly has some sort of illuminating effect.  When I first used it , I felt a slight tingle on my skin but it subsided quickly.  Overall, it has excellent ingredients.  I have used a Vit C serum for the last 2 years and this does seem to be one of new favorites.  Having no parabens too is a plus :-)</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of Hyaluronic acid plus the added vitamin C is great for anti-aging. Serum is smooth and absorbs nicely into my skin. I apply it both day and night and it has been keeping my skin feeling soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the product was much bigger than expected, it should last me a long time with daily use!</li>
            <li> First time I have used this product and actually noticed quite a positive difference in my skin. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Still the Best price around and same quality as the others, But the second order comes with dropper instead of pump. Also not as thick as it was before, more like oil than serum. First order was clear white, the second a dark yellow/orange in color. Don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula or was affected by the heat during delivery.  Unable to contact seller, contact information a blank page. After careful review, I found that Vit C serums have a yellow/orange tinge and an oil type of consistency. Do not know what the first order was. Believe the order was mislabeled.</li>
            <li> I am loving this serum!  My dermatologist suggested that I use Vitamin C on my face and wanted me to buy it from him at an outrageous price.  I found this serum the next day and it is even more concentrated than the other at a fraction of the price.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the results to be so noticeable this soon but my face has a beautiful glow to it and feels firmer.  So glad I tried it!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I like this serum .&lt;br /&gt;make my skin moisture and&lt;br /&gt;bright smooth&lt;br /&gt;I will by  again thank.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change at this time, will keep using it</li>
            <li> Very light, pleasant smelling oil. It is not as thick as some vitamin C serums, but seems to be easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> I love vitamin C cleansers and serums. Used to make them myself using a DIY approach using ascorbic acid. Easier to get the ones and this is well packed in a dark bottle. Had no side effects and was excellent. A sample was sent in exchange of a review.</li>
            <li> VoiBella offers an advanced skin serum which is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;and apply. It&#x27;s constituent ingredients include Vitamin C and&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid designed to restore skin moisture, rebuild&lt;br /&gt;collagen and repair age-related damage. Vitamin C is a&lt;br /&gt;known antioxidant to deal with cellular repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula has a smooth soothing texture when applied to&lt;br /&gt;the face. This reviewer asked for and received a free product&lt;br /&gt;sample.</li>
            <li> I hope that anyone searching for solutions to soften wrinkles and lines and make their facial skin look and feel brighter will try both hyaluronic acid serums and vitamin C serums.  My disclaimer is that I have benefited from each and every one I have tried.  I love the fact that most vitamin C serums also use hyaluronic acid serum and that includes this one.  The manufacturer also emphasizes that it is \\&quot;made to the highest standards in the USA in GMP and FDA certified facilities\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has many features that I especially like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the serum seems to be odorless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it is the most transparent, clear serum I have tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- although I prefer the eye dropper kind of applicator, the pump on this serum works extremely well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it takes just a little serum to spread out so the bottle goes very far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the gel feels slightly sticky at first, but dries to a smooth, shiny finish in just a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can find no negatives with the serum.  I have been using it for almost a week to test and review it (offered free from the manufacturer) and find that my skin responds well to it.  I find that hyaluronic acid serums offer softening, wrinkle smoothing, and moisturizing to my skin and vitamin C serums augment those qualities plus adding a shiny, smooth base that makes a perfect base for my moisturizer and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the money back guarantee that shows the confidence the manufacturer has in their product!  I definitely recommend it to others to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided]</li>
            <li> I have to tell you, there is a lot I like about this serum. First, it&#x27;s a gel - it&#x27;s not greasy or oily like some of the other serums I have reviewed which is a huge plus in my book. I live in Florida so anything that is oily makes me look like I&#x27;ve sat in the sauna all day without a towel. Second, it absorbs quickly, I can go from serum to makeup in about 5 minutes so it has little impact on my &amp;#34;get out the door&amp;#34; time. Also because it isn&#x27;t oily and absorbs quickly I&#x27;m actually using it. I have this habit of not using products that are time-consuming or make me feel like I need to wash my face again after putting it on, this product defeats both issues for me. Third, it works. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week now. When my husband came home from a work trip out of town he asked me what I changed because my skin looked so much better. Last thing to mention is that this serum is less expensive than many of the other Vitamin C serums out there. I will definitely be a returning customer. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, that quality is bad, feel like gel and sticky don&#x27;t  blend good w make up , after 2 day my face star peeling off, I&#x27;m used others vitamin c serum before i never have that problem. I wanted to tried new products, my mistake I should buy  what I was using before Austin poppy vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, works well, and was delivered in a timely manner.  I will buy from this merchant again!</li>
            <li> This recently purchased product is a winner. While I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, I know from past experience that my skin responds very positively to vitamin C type products. It&#x27;s extremely affordable, pleasantly non-scented (I detest the smell of so many skin products), and has a wondrous, thick gel formula that glides easily and more importantly, absorbs readily into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Alot!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I saw significant improvement in my face appearance within one week. The product really works.</li>
            <li> The Voibela vitamin C serum is one of the best serums I have used thus far. I like the fact that itâ€™s in a gel form; itâ€™s non-greasy and goes on smoothly. Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few weeks and I already noticed a huge difference; the dark spots started to disappear and my face look brighter in general.  The best part is that itâ€™s affordable and a great quality product. Shipping was surprisingly quick, therefore, I did not have to wait long to get it in the mail. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will give you that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to only use this product besides her nightly facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first weeks she started to some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance. Her skin had a fuller youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this serum. This is coming from a woman that has been using \\&quot;St. Ives\\&quot;, since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C with Obagi for years.  I ordered this product this summer and find that I really prefer the consistency. This serum is a bit thicker than other Vitamin C products, making it easier to apply and leaving my face with a better feel. After I wash my face, this is the next thing I turn to, using it before going on to the Obagi creams.</li>
            <li> definitely not the best. This is a very sticky serum not all serums need to be so sticky and it also coagulate s and once you have it on your skin wait a few minutes or even a half hour rub your hand across your forehead or the back of your palm wherever you put the serum it will turn into tiny little balls and flake off your skin therefore my assumption is how much of it actually penetrate your skin to be effective. I bought it because the price was good but I use azure naturals. Same product type and it absorbs on your skin you can even wear your makeup over it and I see results as I said I just purchased this on sale and figured if I did not like it that much I would just use it on my neck chest area elbows and back of hands. I am NOT putting this on my face it is not the best sorry. I encourage everyone to try azure naturals amazon I have purchased it three times already and love it I wish it came in a gallon size I put it all over my body yes it is going to be watery compared to this product but then again it works this product I have no idea if it just comes off your skin how can it really work that&#x27;s my question we&#x27;ll see how my hands and chest look August half of it on one side of my body and see if there&#x27;s a difference if so I&#x27;ll report back a more positive review. Also if you don&#x27;t mind having sticky serum all over your face and you&#x27;re just using it at night that might be fine but I would think it would clog your pores</li>
            <li> I have recently just started using this product and use others much like it, but this is so refreshing and clean smelling and absorbs so quickly that I love it - not sure if it will replace other products, but will be part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed as I expected a serum in a pump bottle - what I got was a dropper bottle with pink liquid. Nothing like the 2 other previous Vitamin C serums I have gotten from other companies. It&#x27;s much harder to apply and I&#x27;m wondering what it is I&#x27;m actually putting on my skin...</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite serum contains Retinol and literally costs four times the price per ounce as this Vitamin C serum so I figured she would be the perfect person to try this out.  After using the serum for a few weeks the results are in and even though she doesn&#x27;t like it quite as much as the other serum she agreed that the results for the price difference are pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smoothly and is odorless and does a good job of tightening the skin and removing small wrinkles.  If my wife likes it then it is a home run in my book.  There are a lot of products out there that claim to do things that they do not so it is nice to have one that actually comes through when it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very nice serum for keeping your skin smooth and looking younger and I would highly recommend it, especially at the price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help fade my acne scars on my jawline. It&#x27;s probably too early to see any noticeable results, but the scars are fading bit by bit (and I&#x27;ll update again after I use it longer). I&#x27;m also glad the serum doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, and the gel texture isn&#x27;t runny and doesn&#x27;t drip down my face or fingers. Plus, I prefer this pump (which reduces bacterial contamination and makes application easier) than a dropper.</li>
            <li> Some words to tell how happy I was with these serum ( ...even tough I miss a sale the previous day).&lt;br /&gt;Price is excellent  ( ...even tough I miss a sale the previous day). if you compare to other suppliers on Amazon, Ebay or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself please me a lot and seem very promising. Rich texture, quickly assimilated, luscious feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, packaging excellent, and they sure will have a returning customer with me...</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  It goes on cleanly and a little goes a long way.  I definitely recommend it for use under your moisturizer and/or makeup or even alone.</li>
            <li> My face is very smooth and in the morning my face looks pretty it&#x27;s glowing,  you should try it for yourself, I will buy it again of course. I have used the C serum 22 it works too but it&#x27;s expensive,  why you want to buy the expensive one when they works the same?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your product,  may your company will exist forever.</li>
            <li> very nice will buy again</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. We were really surprised to see results in just s couple of days. Would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by the VoiBella company and asked to test their 20% Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: the product arrived on schedule, packaged securely in bubble wrap and a padded envelope. There was no damage to the packaging or the glass spray bottle within.&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;Scent â€“&lt;br /&gt;There is no noticeable scent for the serum, a difference from many of the other products out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture â€“&lt;br /&gt;This is a loose gelatinous suspension, a little more amber in color than clear, not greasy or cloudy, but thick and light in feel.  Easily spread, the gel is absorbed rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;What I did notice is that for about an hour after application there was a decided â€˜slipperinessâ€™ to my skin â€“Iâ€™m not a makeup wearer, but if I were, that would prevent me from using the preparation before putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;I do see a difference in the elasticity and overall appearance of my skin,  I have sensitive skin that dries out quickly, the once a day application worked well for me: applying each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value:&lt;br /&gt;Iâ€™ve tried several different preparations, and pricing varies widely from a 2 â€“ 4 % solution that is easily found through â€˜eliteâ€™ brands at 10 times the price of this product, with half of the active ingredient.  At 2 ounces for just under $20 â€“ you canâ€™t go wrong with this, and you wonâ€™t break your bank.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of Vitamin C Serum I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price per ounce this one is currently about half the price of the other brand I tried, the price point is the same (currently about $20) but this is 2 oz. of product instead of just 1 oz. like most of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other Vitamin C Serum I have used was very thin and runny almost like water.  VoiBella Vitamin C Serum is gel like. It is dispensed easily through a pump and I have had no problem regulating how much comes out.  Generally I&#x27;ve found that pushing the pump down only half way gives me an ideal amount of serum.  If I use more than that my skin is left feeling sticky and I feel like I need to wash my hands after applying this. I don&#x27;t love the way it leaves my skin feeling after I apply it unless I use it very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try an affordably priced Vitamin C Serum then this VioBella Serum is a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of vitamin c. This one was by far the worst. It was very sticky and took a while to dry on my face. I have also broken out after using this for a week. I plan to toss it out and order from another brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent! This is my second bottle of vit C. The other one is from a different make. This one is not drying on skin as you apply it. It leaves a freshen feeling without pulling skin tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days and I can already see and feel my skin feeling and looking healthier and moister. I am a believer this Vitamin C Serum is the real deal. If you want to improve the tightness and moisture of your facial skin I would encourage you to give this product a try. You will not be disappointed. I am a 20+ years type 2 diabetic and dry skin has been a huge issue for me. I have tried so many products that didn&#x27;t help at all. This one has made a difference from the very first application.</li>
            <li> This product really dried out my skin, I had to stop using it after three weeks. I Think it may be a good product for some skin types, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have item</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great and makes my face feel really smooth and soft. I will be looking forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in the reduction of fine lines. I am satisfied with this product and love the lower price.</li>
            <li> What I got was just pink water. Waste of money! Too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product I have purchased from this company.  This serum slides on your&lt;br /&gt;skin like silk.  It has no odor, hydrates and gives a healthy glow to my 60+ year old face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need no makeup.  I do apply SPF 30 every day.</li>
            <li> When I received this VoiBella Vitamin C Serum from the company in exchange for writing an honest review I decided to give it a two-week trial. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face for better than two weeks now and the initial results are in. This product works. My skin, which over the years has seen a lot of sun and wind, is definitely moister and smoother than it was when I started, and my mild case of rosacea, which I&#x27;ve had primarily on my right cheek for the past few years, is less noticeable than it was when I began this regimen. Overall, my facial skin definitely looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is fairly small, just 2 ounces. However, a little goes a long way. After two weeks of use I&#x27;ve used less than a quarter of the bottle. The consistency is that of a gel rather than a liquid. However, it spreads easily and smoothly, and it isn&#x27;t at all greasy. It has no appreciable smell, which is also nice. (After all, it&#x27;s not supposed to be a cologne.) All in all, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have really been enjoying the VoBella vitamin c 20% serum!!! It has made my skin so soft every morning and I really enjoy the consistency of the product. My skin is sensitive to chemicals from strong fragrances, so I was very happy that this one didn&#x27;t have that. It, like most vitamin C serums, feels a bit sticky when applied... but no worries because once you let it dry for a minute and apply your moisturizer on top, your skin feels AMAZING. As someone who received this product in exchange for an honest review, I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Great product - great price for quantity -  no bad smell, dries quickly on face skin without being sticky; no irritation; after 2 weeks wrinkles appear less visible - I intend to buy again!!!</li>
            <li> This product is so thick it is difficult to pump it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller! I bought this for my wife and she felt a difference in a matter of days. The combination of ingredients in this products really helps with moisturizing the skin and keeping it protected. She&#x27;s been trying different types of Vitamin C products for a while and she likes this one the best, so now I&#x27;m using it! I&#x27;ll be purchasing again for sure. Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you. The things I like better with VoiBella Best Pure  Vitamin C serum is they list all their ingredients and they give you directions how to use the product. It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly. My wife got rid of a wart with Vitamin C Serum. She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it. She&#x27;s had it so long, she has no idea where she got it in the first place. Vitamin C Serum is doing wonders for her skin. I&#x27;m wondering if it works on boils, which I am going to try today to see what the results will be. This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned. It won&#x27;t make you younger, but it will make your skin look younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Vitamin C 20% Serum for several months, but this one is superior and you cannot beat the price!  It has the best combination of products:  Vitamin C 20%, hyaluronic acid and Ferulic acid, as well as Vitamin E.  I really do see a difference in that my skin is more even, brown spots are much less visible (some have disappeared).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased another bottle so I can keep one at my  place and one at my boyfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Complete satisfaction with the quality and price of VoiBella Vitamin C Serum.    This is my third bottle and I&#x27;ve been delighted with the results.  My skin really does feel and look firmer, more \\&quot;plumped\\&quot;, and has from very first application.  In fact I saw an aesthetician earlier this week and she - as well as another technician in the office - remarked on how good my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using.    Speed of delivery and condition of packaging were excellent.  You have a committed customer here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 6 weeks and I really do not see a difference.</li>
