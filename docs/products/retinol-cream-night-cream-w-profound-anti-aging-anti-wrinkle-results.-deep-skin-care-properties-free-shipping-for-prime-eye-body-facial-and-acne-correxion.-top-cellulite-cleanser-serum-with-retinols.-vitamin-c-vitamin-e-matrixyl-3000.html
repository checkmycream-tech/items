            <li>Nice scent!</li>
            <li>This feels so great on my face and smells good, too.</li>
            <li>The reason why night cream works best (and it made for nighttime) is that while we sleep, our body is healing and regenerating itself and that is when we need the replenishment and nutrients most.</li>
            <li>It is very light and has a pleasant scent!  </li>
            <li>really good cream</li>
            <li>While I know that it takes a good face cream weeks to work, I can see the difference in my skin after a week of using this.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my mother and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this cream.</li>

            <li>Love everything about  the product!</li>
            <li>This would make an amazing gift for someone looking to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and citrusy and provides great clarity and smoothness to the skin.</li>
            <li>All reviews are 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this retinol anti aging night cream and am loving it.</li>
            <li>The container is really nice as well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>A very nice light face cream that has improved the texture of my skin and help lighten &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Fast, perfect, thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and my husband has commented on how fresh my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and it melts into my skin.</li>
            <li>My make up goes on and my face looks very smooth.  </li>
            <li>BUT it does make my face softer and more supple</li>
            <li>I really love it, goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams and this is the one I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this night cream.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer of the cream was very gracious and offered amends,  I did not take advantage of their offer, but their response was immediate and they are proud of their products.  </li>
            <li>I know this one is going to be even better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle creams that I wasn&#x27;t sure what was working and what wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>, my face was back to that awesome glow, smoothed eyes, softer skin!</li>
            <li>I have already seen a difference in reduced redness and a more even skin tone as well as smoother skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>Even if something  working well in my routine, I still love changing it up.    </li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>My nighttime routine is my favorite time of night.</li>
            <li>I love washing my face, sometimes using masks, vitamin c serum, chapstick, night moisturizer, and hand cream.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a night time routine, you really should, and this would be a great cream to add to it.</li>
            <li>She says that it is very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My face still felt very clean after it dried&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this cream, light but wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>since I wear it to bed and do not like strong odors on my skin at night.</li>
            <li>Not alot of them, just one or two huge ones.</li>
            <li>So, a great night cream is essential.</li>
            <li>but you would never tell (I look 10 years younger) because of the great products I use, and this night cream has just become part of my regimen.</li>
            <li>As soon as I rub the cream in my face, it makes my skin smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Because if the cheap store brand did wonders for my face</li>
            <li>The cream itself goes on smooth and does not leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and light scent of the cream</li>
            <li>one is slightly fragrant, nice and light and feels so good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>this produce is worth the price!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if this was going to work or not, but so far I am pleased and my skin feels better.</li>
            <li>Light weight, absorbs quickly, and does not leave my face feeling sticky after applying it.</li>
            <li>Always use it on clean skin, that goes without saying.</li>
            <li>This cream is very light and creamy and spreads very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering again right now!</li>
            <li>The cream is soft to touch, goes on very easily.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>The cream is very silky &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is fun, I think I ‘ll keep the mystery going.  </li>
            <li>Great for Dark Spots, Packaged so pretty it could be presented as a gift.</li>
            <li>but any difference would be worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and feels lovely.</li>
            <li>Long time customer for sure!</li>
            <li>with my new workout dvd and this product I will be ready :)</li>
            <li>It has made my skin look much better, lines are less visible ,more moisturized.</li>
            <li>You do not have to use very much</li>
            <li>She doesn’t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>so I am sure this jar will last some time.</li>
            <li>First time I used this retinol night cream.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using it a couple times a week at first , to avoid any redness as your skin get used to the product, until you can use it every night.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Haven’t felt confident enough to do that in over 10 years</li>
            <li>but I will most likely not purchase again.</li>
            <li>Now that I am done with my first jar and have ordered my second one I may just brave going to work with a little makeup.  </li>
            <li>So far, this cream is making my face feel and look softer , it feels fresh and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in texture but actually makes a difference to those pesky lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have much praise for the customer service people who responded to an email question I had &amp; were very gracious.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I was buying the last jar Amazon had available, hopefully they will replenish their stock.</li>
            <li>Very sleek looking, and a lot heavier than it looks.</li>
            <li>It really reduced the puffiness under my eyes for that alone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy like so many other night cream ( you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to soak in).</li>
            <li>years of jumping from one to another moisturizer, I have at last found exactly the right one!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Younger skin is coming your way :) I am in my mid thirties</li>
            <li>In not using it, my face doesn&#x27;t glow, my eyes look like I&#x27;m 10 yrs older.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>it seems to get the dead layer off and show better skin after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be convinced it works better</li>
            <li>I can tell that my husband has notice because at times he just stares at me as if trying to figure out what is new.  </li>
            <li>I have a habit of trying new things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, and not many fine lines, but I use cream like this because  want to prevent that stuff!    </li>
            <li>Well let’s just say I believe enough now that I am purchasing a higher end retinol cream this time.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want anyone to think you are telling them you look old!</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount of this night cream to make your face and neck feel amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes it A LOT worse, then better!</li>
            <li>It was my second time to order this cream, and I think it&#x27;s really works. </li>
            <li>SO FAR no results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but this cream did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>So far I like the cream and will follow up to edit the review in a month to show the results.</li>
            <li>The cream leaves absolutely no greasy film and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit at first I was skeptical, however after using this cream for more than 30 days</li>
            <li>I received the item on time, and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It works like no other.</li>
            <li>At first, use it every other night until you are used to it.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed, every other night for the first week.</li>
            <li>Considering all I know of this product and the results that I have seen so far, I would definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I can barely see the scar anymore</li>
            <li>And it was very watered down.  </li>

            <li> Well let’s just say I believe enough now that I am purchasing a higher end retinol cream this time.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want anyone to think you are telling them you look old!</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of this night cream to make your face and neck feel amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes it A LOT worse, then better!</li>
            <li> It was my second time to order this cream, and I think it&#x27;s really works. </li>
            <li> SO FAR no results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but this cream did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> So far I like the cream and will follow up to edit the review in a month to show the results.</li>
            <li> The cream leaves absolutely no greasy film and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit at first I was skeptical, however after using this cream for more than 30 days</li>
            <li> I received the item on time, and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It works like no other.</li>
            <li> At first, use it every other night until you are used to it.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed, every other night for the first week.</li>
            <li> Considering all I know of this product and the results that I have seen so far, I would definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I can barely see the scar anymore</li>
            <li> And it was very watered down.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past couple months and have found my skin much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t use it long enough!</li>
            <li> And, with a 60 day money back guarantee even after the jar is empty</li>
            <li> BUT the bottle did not say how long it took to lessen the wrinkles</li>
            <li> and it is thick enough where it is not messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is creamy, and a little bit is enough.</li>
            <li> You really do not need a lot to spread on your face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for another 30 days to see if I notice any other differences</li>
            <li> I got to tell you that I was very skeptical with purchasing a retinol cream because I thought nothing could stop those smile lines or those few age spots that I am starting to notice.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight tingling feeling which is associated with Retinol products.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles seemy to be finner and slightly less visible.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that because I hate putting anything on such delicate skin, like my face, that has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I would have never done it a few years ago, but then again a few years ago I didn&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> so I’ll have to update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a few small wrinkle and they are less noticeable after using this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if she has any less wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> As I started using it every night, I got pretty bad pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying that any product that contains Retinol will help to diminish small lines and wrinkles and help lessen the deeper lines.  </li>
            <li> Yes it was small</li>
            <li> I read a review where ppl complained that it made them break out.</li>
            <li> It is thick but still absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li> The absolute worst night cream with zero active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nightly for approximately 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> He is too chicken to ask me because he is afraid of getting into trouble if he guesses wrong.  </li>
            <li> you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was honestly skeptical and my friends told me it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference</li>
            <li> Appendicitis stinks, then you wind up with a scar.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this cream.  </li>
            <li> It is oily, awful, does NOTHING!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So far, this cream is making my face feel and look softer , it feels fresh and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in texture but actually makes a difference to those pesky lines and wrinkles. Nice scent!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if this was going to work or not, but so far I am pleased and my skin feels better. it seems to get the dead layer off and show better skin after a couple of weeks. really good cream</li>
            <li> I have a few small wrinkle and they are less noticeable after using this product.</li>
            <li> It was my second time to order this cream, and I think it&#x27;s really works. I received the item on time, and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this night time retinol face cream! Light weight, absorbs quickly, and does not leave my face feeling sticky after applying it. I can tell a difference already and am going to see if they have a daytime retinol day cream as well. You do not have to use very much so I am sure this jar will last some time. And, with a 60 day money back guarantee even after the jar is empty you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Best anti wrinkle cream ever.</li>
            <li> This feels so great on my face and smells good, too.</li>
            <li> SO FAR no results.  BUT the bottle did not say how long it took to lessen the wrinkles so I will continue to use it  BUT it does make my face softer and more supple</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this cream. I really love it, goes on nice and smooth and it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin... I love the look, the feel and the amazing results!</li>
            <li> The cream is very silky &amp; smooth.  I have much praise for the customer service people who responded to an email question I had &amp; were very gracious.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams and this is the one I will continue to use. My skin feels great and my husband has commented on how fresh my skin looks. love this product.</li>
            <li> First time I used this retinol night cream. The following morning I felt already the difference. My face feels smooth and soft. It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nightly for approximately 4 weeks. It feels soothing to my face. My skin looks and feels softer.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this night cream. It&#x27;s very smooth and it melts into my skin. The reason why night cream works best (and it made for nighttime) is that while we sleep, our body is healing and regenerating itself and that is when we need the replenishment and nutrients most. So, a great night cream is essential. As a licensed Esthetician, I am a fan of Retinol, but it has to be used properly. You don&#x27;t need much. Just a bit. I would recommend using it a couple times a week at first , to avoid any redness as your skin get used to the product, until you can use it every night. Always use it on clean skin, that goes without saying. Enjoy! Younger skin is coming your way :) I am in my mid thirties but you would never tell (I look 10 years younger) because of the great products I use, and this night cream has just become part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have to admit at first I was skeptical, however after using this cream for more than 30 days I can see the difference. Not only can I see the difference so can my friends. I even got asked if I was using botox. Love everything about  the product!</li>
            <li> Best Retinol product I have used. As soon as I rub the cream in my face, it makes my skin smooth to the touch. In 3 weeks, I have noticed a decrease in my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. It has made my skin look much better, lines are less visible ,more moisturized. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> My jar was broke and I did not get to try it.  I was buying the last jar Amazon had available, hopefully they will replenish their stock.The manufacturer of the cream was very gracious and offered amends,  I did not take advantage of their offer, but their response was immediate and they are proud of their products.  My star rating is for the company.</li>
            <li> Everyone is talking about retinol these days so I am giving it a try. I would have never done it a few years ago, but then again a few years ago I didn&#x27;t need it.  I&#x27;ve got a family wedding coming up in a couple of months and with my new workout dvd and this product I will be ready :)</li>
            <li> I got to tell you that I was very skeptical with purchasing a retinol cream because I thought nothing could stop those smile lines or those few age spots that I am starting to notice.  Well let’s just say I believe enough now that I am purchasing a higher end retinol cream this time.  Because if the cheap store brand did wonders for my face I know this one is going to be even better.  (I have used this company’s scar cream and even my surgeon was amazed so I know this one is going to be great too).</li>
            <li> The absolute worst night cream with zero active ingredients. I have over 20 years experience using night creams. I feel I was robbed buying this product. Do not buy. It is oily, awful, does NOTHING!</li>
            <li> This cream worked MIRACLES! I went alittle over the 21 days that they said it would work. I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle creams that I wasn&#x27;t sure what was working and what wasn&#x27;t. Every morning my face glowed. My eyes looked the best ever. I returned it. WHAT A MISTAKE!! In not using it, my face doesn&#x27;t glow, my eyes look like I&#x27;m 10 yrs older.    Order this product! I just didn&#x27;t use it long enough! I&#x27;m ordering again right now! 2 jars of it! It works like no other. And trust me, I&#x27;ve tried all of the others! UPDATE: just got my order and in 2 days, my face was back to that awesome glow, smoothed eyes, softer skin! I read a review where ppl complained that it made them break out. Any type of Retinol DOES NOT break you out! It brings out the pimples or cysts that were under the skin. That is why Dermatolgists give you Retin A. It makes it A LOT worse, then better! Don&#x27;t blame the product, it&#x27;s not what caused the breakouts. Sry about the lesson, but some ppl just don&#x27;t get it! This is an AMAZING PRODUCT! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the wife and she is using it as a night cream. She says that it is very rich and moisturizing. She doesn’t have to use very much. Not sure if she has any less wrinkles yet but she has only used it for a couple of weeks on her face and neck. She’s had no redness, peeling or itching. She says that she plans to keep using it so I’ll have to update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Now that I am done with my first jar and have ordered my second one I may just brave going to work with a little makeup.  Yep, I just said that.  Haven’t felt confident enough to do that in over 10 years but my face seems like it just got some life back into it.  I can tell that my husband has notice because at times he just stares at me as if trying to figure out what is new.  He is too chicken to ask me because he is afraid of getting into trouble if he guesses wrong.  This is fun, I think I ‘ll keep the mystery going.  The cream is soft to touch, goes on very easily.  I did not experience the tingling that some people mention with retinol but I am experiencing all its glory.  Long time customer for sure!</li>
            <li> A very nice light face cream that has improved the texture of my skin and help lighten &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;. Great customer service from this company too. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This arrived 2 days in a beautiful package. This would make an amazing gift for someone looking to fight the signs of aging. I would highly recommend this product to others. The cream itself goes on smooth and does not leave a sticky residue. My face still felt very clean after it dried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this retinol anti aging night cream and am loving it. The scent is light and citrusy and provides great clarity and smoothness to the skin. I&#x27;ll definitely keep this in my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait and post my review after using this product for several days.  I like the texture and light scent of the cream and it is thick enough where it is not messy to apply.  It does seem to tingle a bit upon application, but it is not too bothersome.  Considering all I know of this product and the results that I have seen so far, I would definitely recommend this product.  I have already seen a difference in reduced redness and a more even skin tone as well as smoother skin on my face.</li>
            <li> no difference here ladies.  I was very disappointed with this cream.  And it was very watered down.  No stars from me.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended retinol to me. I love the texture and consistency of this product. It is thick but still absorbs well into my skin. I was using lumene night cream before trying this product. The Healing Touch&#x27;s night cream works as well. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be convinced it works better but I look forward to seeing results!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> fantacetic, Thank you.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream so I will definitely have to do a follow up n a month to see if there are any noticeable differences. I&#x27;d like to start by saying that any product that contains Retinol will help to diminish small lines and wrinkles and help lessen the deeper lines.  This cream is very light and creamy and spreads very well. You really do not need a lot to spread on your face. At first, use it every other night until you are used to it. There is a slight tingling feeling which is associated with Retinol products. My skin is sensitive but this cream did not bother me at all. I also like the smell which is a plus since I wear it to bed and do not like strong odors on my skin at night. So far I like the cream and will follow up to edit the review in a month to show the results.</li>
            <li> While I know that it takes a good face cream weeks to work, I can see the difference in my skin after a week of using this.  My make up goes on and my face looks very smooth.  The cream leaves absolutely no greasy film and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  It is very light and has a pleasant scent!  I cannot wait to see the effects in the next several weeks!</li>
            <li> I have a habit of trying new things. Even if something  working well in my routine, I still love changing it up.    I had been using Argan oil on my face during he day and a different cream at night. Because this one is specifically a night cream, I just had to try it.    It comes wrapped in bubble wrap, and it is placed inside a silver satin drawstring bag. I love that. The container is really nice as well. Very sleek looking, and a lot heavier than it looks. This night cream I think would make a very nice gift for someone. (Well, someone who wouldn&#x27;t be offended by anti aging stuff! You don&#x27;t want anyone to think you are telling them you look old! Ha!)    It is creamy, and a little bit is enough. It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I appreciate that because I hate putting anything on such delicate skin, like my face, that has a strong smell. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, and not many fine lines, but I use cream like this because  want to prevent that stuff!    My nighttime routine is my favorite time of night. I love washing my face, sometimes using masks, vitamin c serum, chapstick, night moisturizer, and hand cream. If you don&#x27;t have a night time routine, you really should, and this would be a great cream to add to it.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed, every other night for the first week. As I started using it every night, I got pretty bad pimples. Not alot of them, just one or two huge ones. So then I would use the product only in areas where I wasn&#x27;t getting pimples. I took a before picture and a picture after 30 days and noticed no difference in wrinkles around my eyes or on my forehead. I will continue to use it for another 30 days to see if I notice any other differences but I will most likely not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past couple months and have found my skin much smoother and softer. My wrinkles seemy to be finner and slightly less visible.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller!! Fast, perfect, thank you very much!!! Love this cream, light but wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;After years of jumping from one to another moisturizer, I have at last found exactly the right one!&lt;br /&gt;This one is slightly fragrant, nice and light and feels so good on the skin.  I think it is the Best&lt;br /&gt;I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best skin cream every. Great for Dark Spots, Packaged so pretty it could be presented as a gift.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of this night cream to make your face and neck feel amazing. It&#x27;s not greasy like so many other night cream ( you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to soak in). It really reduced the puffiness under my eyes for that alone this produce is worth the price! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Appendicitis stinks, then you wind up with a scar. Yes it was small but it bothered me. I just couldn&#x27;t leave it alone so I decided to invest in what appeared to be a premium scar product hoping it would work. I was honestly skeptical and my friends told me it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference but any difference would be worth it for me. Jackpot! I can barely see the scar anymore, this scar gel turned out to be a great investment. You have to try it!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and feels lovely. Will be back for more!</li>
