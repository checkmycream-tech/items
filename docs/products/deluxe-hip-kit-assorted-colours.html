            <li>This kit was a good buy.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this set.  </li>
            <li>I though am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this kit.  </li>
            <li>This also comes with like 6 elastic shoe laces that I love!  </li>
            <li>Nice to have a one stop shop experience for hip needs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if there were a carrying case for these</li>
            <li>Most of the tools seem to be of good quality, but the reacher is a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li>but I found this one with more items and a good price.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have used every&lt;br /&gt;item</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent, very well made.  </li>
            <li>I got it quick,, exactly what they said would be in it,, it was packaged well,, very happy with my order and company</li>
            <li>You really DO need these items and after looking at the many options available, this one had the best combination.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this kit.</li>
            <li>Kit did not include the leg lifter which is prominently displayed on the picture.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to still use the reacher to pull up my clothes.</li>
            <li>There are many uses the for the tools.  </li>
            <li>The sock tool is ingenious...</li>
            <li>So the picker upper and the sponge are the two best items IMO.</li>
            <li>I love having the leg-lifter even now.</li>
            <li>but I use it many times each day and plan to just  buy a more &#x27;profession&#x27; item --</li>
            <li>I just got my hip replaced and am so glad I bought this kit.</li>
            <li>This is the better style of sock dresser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the three piece one that is covered in felt.</li>
            <li>I love the leg lifter and reacher/grabber.  </li>
            <li>I love the leg lifter and the sock putter onner.  </li>
            <li>The hip kit had everything I needed and more.</li>
            <li>Sock helper works great and shoe horn but priced too high for type of products</li>
            <li>this was the best money spent.</li>
            <li>Also the sponge came in handy -- you can&#x27;t shower without something like this -- and the shoe horn was useful too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and met needs after hip replacement.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying this kit if you are having hip or knee surgery.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid the full $40 for the leg lifter alone if where wasn&#x27;t  a better value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is pretty sturdy and the handle hangs nicely on the front rung of your walker</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up using all the items on the kit but the ones I used were fine.</li>
            <li>My hip is doing fine</li>
            <li>Great set of items for persons having hip issues like my relative.</li>
            <li>Sock aid is fantastic in getting my socks on without any help.</li>
            <li>It works well for getting dressed and picking up light objects.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my mother-in-law who broke her leg in two places and has significant nerve damage.  </li>
            <li>It is worthwhile to get the whole package and see what works for you.</li>
            <li>Luckily the reacher has a poker that sticks out on the end</li>
            <li>Quick tip to users,</li>
            <li>But for the price, this is a super idea.</li>
            <li>This kit was bought before 2 weeks before hip replacement surgery and proved its worth then and post-operatively.  </li>
            <li>- they&#x27;re kind of big and bulky to carry around unless you have the right-size backpack (and one that won&#x27;t tip over...</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is the piece used to lift your own leg, into bed or such.  </li>
            <li>Get it right away.  </li>
            <li>Good to have after surgery when you cannot get down to your shoes.  </li>
            <li>Before hand you do not know exactly what you will need.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need the leg lifter for the first 2 weeks to get your leg onto the bed or lift it into the car.  </li>
            <li>For example, a part fell off the grabber the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to buy local but not for almost twice the price.</li>
            <li>This one has held up very well!</li>
            <li>The sponge was a little to soft for me; if it was more rigid, I could have cleaned up better.</li>
            <li>sock thing was easy to use even though I didn&#x27;t practice much (my mobility is coming back in record</li>
            <li>very helpful for knee replacement patients</li>
            <li>Very helpful in her accident recovery.</li>
            <li>The sponge and shoe horn have worked very well.  </li>
            <li>My wife used it with a hip replacement and found various parts to be indispensable.</li>
            <li>Velcro is much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li>This hip kit allowed her to maintain much of her independence.  </li>
            <li>No invoice plus no instructions, I don&#x27;t know how to use much of it</li>
            <li>Once your muscles strengthen up, you won&#x27;t need it as much.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>and I am getting along well thanks in part to this kit.  </li>
            <li>Every item exceeded my expectations and proved invaluable to my fast recovery.</li>
            <li>Very help/full.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bev Wallace</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at the sock helper...</li>
            <li>The design and quality of the items in this kit are far superior to those offered by my local medical equipment supplier.</li>
            <li>Very useful during the initial phase after surgery.</li>
            <li>This kit had more items in it than the one the hospital sold me for my first hip surgery - and at half the price.</li>
            <li>The leg lifter was very helpful in the hospital right after surgery and meant I could be pretty independent in the hospital getting in an out of bed by myself.</li>
            <li>The grabber has been a reliable shorts and pants dressing aid (while it may not be the strongest tool, it did allow me to pull down a window shade that had rolled to the top).  </li>
            <li>All the items were ok however the teacher broke the first day I used it when I was picking up a small bottle of water that fell to the ground.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality on everything.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone in that situation.</li>
            <li>Again, I Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>shoe horn is high quality</li>
            <li>The sock aid will give me a little more independence as I won&#x27;t have to ask my husband to get my TEDs on for me.</li>
            <li>The grabber is ok, but not particularly strong.  </li>
            <li>had a new one sent to me immediately.</li>
            <li>The shipping was unbelievable quick!!  </li>
            <li>You will use the &amp;#34;grabber&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;leg lifter&amp;#34; immediately (the &amp;#34;leg lifter&amp;#34; was the only way I could manage to get my leg up onto the bed at first).  </li>
            <li>Following hip replacement this collection of aids was exactly what my surgeon and physiotherapist recommended.  </li>
            <li>The grabber claw/clamp isn&#x27;t very strong or well-made, but I didn&#x27;t downgrade the overall package because it works well enough and the other items all add to the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish I had had the sock device before as I had limited mobility in the right hip</li>
            <li>We purchased through Amazon because it was significantly cheaper than purchasing from the hospital pharmacy by about half.  </li>
            <li>I have another grabber that&#x27;s a little sturdier and has a different mechanism that works better for heavier items.</li>
            <li>I also read several reviews on other kits that talked about the reacher breaking easily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know it came with all that was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>This was a far lower cost then found at stores in my area.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty long, plus you can use it to push your shoes off too.</li>
            <li>Purchased this item as I was scheduled for and recently had a total joint replacement (right hip).  </li>
            <li>The items in this kit work well and have lasted well enough so far -- through the first week of my Bilateral Total Knee</li>
            <li>There is a device in this particular set that is not available in most other kits.  </li>
            <li>and I was trying to make them work in athletic shoes; they might work better in casual shoes (but I would go with shoes you don&#x27;t have to tie in the first place).</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I did find this useful, after less than a week, I didn&#x27;t need the leg lifter anymore.</li>
            <li>The leg lift, the grabber, and the sock helper were all too short to be of much help initially.</li>
            <li>Three or four weeks after surgery I could bend over far enough to make use of them -</li>
            <li>Reaching down to the floor is still too much.</li>
            <li>For the first few days, I used the leg lifter and picker upper</li>
            <li>And besides you can just use your good leg to lift up the bad leg.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend to anyone in that situation.</li>
            <li> Again, I Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> shoe horn is high quality</li>
            <li> The sock aid will give me a little more independence as I won&#x27;t have to ask my husband to get my TEDs on for me.</li>
            <li> The grabber is ok, but not particularly strong.  </li>
            <li> had a new one sent to me immediately.</li>
            <li> The shipping was unbelievable quick!!  </li>
            <li> You will use the &amp;#34;grabber&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;leg lifter&amp;#34; immediately (the &amp;#34;leg lifter&amp;#34; was the only way I could manage to get my leg up onto the bed at first).  </li>
            <li> Following hip replacement this collection of aids was exactly what my surgeon and physiotherapist recommended.  </li>
            <li> The grabber claw/clamp isn&#x27;t very strong or well-made, but I didn&#x27;t downgrade the overall package because it works well enough and the other items all add to the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had had the sock device before as I had limited mobility in the right hip</li>
            <li> We purchased through Amazon because it was significantly cheaper than purchasing from the hospital pharmacy by about half.  </li>
            <li> I have another grabber that&#x27;s a little sturdier and has a different mechanism that works better for heavier items.</li>
            <li> I also read several reviews on other kits that talked about the reacher breaking easily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know it came with all that was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This was a far lower cost then found at stores in my area.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty long, plus you can use it to push your shoes off too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as I was scheduled for and recently had a total joint replacement (right hip).  </li>
            <li> The items in this kit work well and have lasted well enough so far -- through the first week of my Bilateral Total Knee</li>
            <li> There is a device in this particular set that is not available in most other kits.  </li>
            <li> and I was trying to make them work in athletic shoes; they might work better in casual shoes (but I would go with shoes you don&#x27;t have to tie in the first place).</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I did find this useful, after less than a week, I didn&#x27;t need the leg lifter anymore.</li>
            <li> The leg lift, the grabber, and the sock helper were all too short to be of much help initially.</li>
            <li> Three or four weeks after surgery I could bend over far enough to make use of them -</li>
            <li> Reaching down to the floor is still too much.</li>
            <li> For the first few days, I used the leg lifter and picker upper</li>
            <li> And besides you can just use your good leg to lift up the bad leg.</li>
            <li> a little lubricant, baby oil, petroleum jelly, cooking oil or  grease will make both sock ease, the blue device with jump rope handles, and the long handled shoe horn work much slicker.</li>
            <li> The price was comparable to other offers</li>
            <li> The implement to put on the socks was a bit large for my small feet -</li>
            <li> The long shoe horn is a big help as is the device that help you put your socks on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be using the shower sponge on a stick for as long as it lasts -- though I been doing pool therapy almost every day and not showering at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the same equipment they had at the rehab center my mom stayed in.  </li>
            <li> For a preview on what is expected of this equipment please look on line for Willamette Valley Medical Center, The Joint Replacement Institute  Guidebook for Hips.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the sock tool does not have jump rope type handles as pictured and is not long enough.  </li>
            <li> My other one is a 36&amp;#34; one, and that&#x27;s too long to be helpful to me in getting dressed.</li>
            <li> Thank you this was quality beyond what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Still to try the sock assistant, seems a bit wide for women&#x27;s socks, but fingers crossed.  </li>
            <li> The long handled grabber picks up even tiny things but don&#x27;t plan on using it for anything very heavy.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheaper here than any other place I researched.  </li>
            <li> would be hard for anyone with arthritis to hold the tiny knots.</li>
            <li> The grabber is so helpful with getting dressed and for other little things around the house.</li>
            <li> Once you heal a bit, the &amp;#34;Sock-it&amp;#34; will allow you to put your socks on by yourself, and the long 2-ft shoe horn will allow you to put on shoes without bending over (which will be hard for a while).  </li>
            <li> Maybe mine was missing those handles</li>
            <li> Sent it back because it was so poorly made.</li>
            <li> The grabber was a life saver and the shoe horn - well I use it for a few things.</li>
            <li> It is missing the dressing stick, so buy that separately.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few pointers.</li>
            <li> Several of the items were poorly made.  </li>
            <li> This is one less item to worry about before surgery, again thank you!</li>
            <li> The sock pull, while a little tight for my wide feet, also has been helpful, and I wish I had known of this months before actual surgery, since putting socks on was very difficult and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> The sponge is a little weak, (a common problem in these kits), but the sock assist was a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> Has made my getting dressed a lot easier, isn&#x27;t hard to use</li>
            <li> They are also less expensive.</li>
            <li> This had everything she needed in one kit, cutting down on the cost of purchasing one item at a time.  </li>
            <li> My wife broke her hip and she had hip precautions that would had made everyday tasks virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to put socks on.  </li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if not for sock tool :(</li>
            <li> Also the spong is worthless</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this kit. It has everything you will need to aid you while recouperating from surgery or for aid with disabilities.</li>
            <li> The design and quality of the items in this kit are far superior to those offered by my local medical equipment supplier. They are also less expensive. They arrived on time and well packaged. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great hip kit my only complaint is that the sock tool does not have jump rope type handles as pictured and is not long enough.  Maybe mine was missing those handles but mine just had two knots.  would be hard for anyone with arthritis to hold the tiny knots.This also comes with like 6 elastic shoe laces that I love!  Didn&#x27;t know it came with all that was pleasantly surprised.  Would have given 5 stars if not for sock tool :(</li>
            <li> Used this after my second hip replacement in March. The leg lifter was very helpful in the hospital right after surgery and meant I could be pretty independent in the hospital getting in an out of bed by myself. This kit had more items in it than the one the hospital sold me for my first hip surgery - and at half the price.</li>
            <li> Kit did not include the leg lifter which is prominently displayed on the picture.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me after my hip replacement operation. I especially like the tool to pick up my leg. It helped me in getting in and out of bed, or to lift my leg up to rest on the coffee table. Also like the reacher/grabber. I still use this to get things from the bottom of the washing machine. I&#x27;m short and it is deep.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a one stop shop experience for hip needs.  Before hand you do not know exactly what you will need.  At difference stages of recovery I used each of these devices.</li>
            <li> Has made my getting dressed a lot easier, isn&#x27;t hard to use</li>
            <li> very helpful for knee replacement patients</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She loved it. Very helpful in her accident recovery.</li>
            <li> Great set of items for persons having hip issues like my relative. She was having problems getting shoes on and off, putting on socks, and lifting her foot.  This had everything she needed in one kit, cutting down on the cost of purchasing one item at a time.  All items were of good quality, and no problems or issues found.  This was a far lower cost then found at stores in my area.</li>
            <li> This kit was bought before 2 weeks before hip replacement surgery and proved its worth then and post-operatively.  The grabber has been a reliable shorts and pants dressing aid (while it may not be the strongest tool, it did allow me to pull down a window shade that had rolled to the top).  The sponge and shoe horn have worked very well.  The sock pull, while a little tight for my wide feet, also has been helpful, and I wish I had known of this months before actual surgery, since putting socks on was very difficult and time consuming.  The foot loop has assisted in physical therapy exercises.  The only kit item not used has been the elastic shoe laces.  The kit was delivered promptly.  Thank you Mercer County for making home rehab easier.</li>
            <li> Great help. Sock aid is fantastic in getting my socks on without any help. Have used all of the individual pieces.</li>
            <li> Not all pieces are for everyone, but there is something for everyone. It is worthwhile to get the whole package and see what works for you. My wife used it with a hip replacement and found various parts to be indispensable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and met needs after hip replacement.  The price was comparable to other offers but this kit had all the recommended items by the hospitals staff and doctors.</li>
            <li> All the items were ok however the teacher broke the first day I used it when I was picking up a small bottle of water that fell to the ground.  Also the spong is worthless you can&#x27;t get enough pressure to feel like you are actually scrubbing your lower legs and feet.</li>
            <li> The clothes reacher broke. The string that controlled it broke. I called the company whose number was on it and they said they would have replaced it if I&#x27;d bought it through them. Luckily the reacher has a poker that sticks out on the end so I&#x27;m able to still use the reacher to pull up my clothes.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Just as expected!  I suggest this kit for anyone under going hip replacement surgery!</li>
            <li> Decent quality on everything.  (have not used the shoestrings).  The long handled grabber picks up even tiny things but don&#x27;t plan on using it for anything very heavy.</li>
            <li> Whoever invented these items should be sainted--especially SOCK AID and leg lifter.  A must when recovering from incapacitating surgeries.  Kept on hand after and have loaned to numerous people at church.  A God send.</li>
            <li> There are many uses the for the tools.  Great for someone who needs aid in lifting their leg.  I purchased for my mother-in-law who broke her leg in two places and has significant nerve damage.  She uses several of the tools.</li>
            <li> I needed 3 of the items offered in this package for my mother. Items will be excellent in helping her recover from her hip surgery. Big Plus is that it was cheaper to order from Amazon than it was from the local medical supply company. Items are sturdy, and well made. Mother is happy so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Definitely a wonderful kit to have after hip surgery. Highly recommend to anyone in that situation. It&#x27;s been two months since my surgery and I still use the shoe horn.  Again, I Highly recommend.  It&#x27;s also cheaper here than any other place I researched.  Amazon \\&quot;Rocks.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit in preparation for arthroscopic hip surgery to repair a labral tear. For the first few days, I used the leg lifter and picker upper A LOT. Also the sponge came in handy -- you can&#x27;t shower without something like this -- and the shoe horn was useful too. The shoe laces did not work out for me at all. They were very short and I was trying to make them work in athletic shoes; they might work better in casual shoes (but I would go with shoes you don&#x27;t have to tie in the first place). The sock tool is ingenious... but because it&#x27;s July, I didn&#x27;t need to use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if there were a carrying case for these - they&#x27;re kind of big and bulky to carry around unless you have the right-size backpack (and one that won&#x27;t tip over... because once it tips over, it defeats the purpose of having it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did find this useful, after less than a week, I didn&#x27;t need the leg lifter anymore. And besides you can just use your good leg to lift up the bad leg. I still use the picker upper every now and then. Reaching down to the floor is still too much. And after a few days I gave up on real shoes and started wearing my Tevas. Velcro is much easier to deal with. So the picker upper and the sponge are the two best items IMO.</li>
            <li> Recommend by my therapist.  Very useful.</li>
            <li> Receive ita timely manner. Been a great help. Every home should have this kit.</li>
            <li> This kit was beyond my expectations.  We purchased through Amazon because it was significantly cheaper than purchasing from the hospital pharmacy by about half.  For those having a hip replacement, this has just about everything you need and a couple of extra items not represented in the description.  I was very pleased with this set.  It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sent it back because it was so poorly made. The gripper was held with a string so couldn&#x27;t pick up a tiny plastic glass. Didn&#x27;t bother to try anything else but would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Flimsy grabber and shoe horn</li>
            <li> Thank you this was quality beyond what I expected.  Each item was sturdy.  Still to try the sock assistant, seems a bit wide for women&#x27;s socks, but fingers crossed.  The shipping was unbelievable quick!!  This is one less item to worry about before surgery, again thank you!</li>
            <li> A great set of tools for those coming home from hip replacement surgery.</li>
            <li> My wife broke her hip and she had hip precautions that would had made everyday tasks virtually impossible. This hip kit allowed her to maintain much of her independence.  I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Everything you need for knee replacement rehab supplies. This package deal is a Great Buy! Fast shipper, received it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> This kit was a good buy. I looked all over. And this gave me the biggest bang for the buck. The shoe laces make such a difference. The grabber was a life saver and the shoe horn - well I use it for a few things. I am very independent and this kit allowed me to be independent...  this was the best money spent.</li>
            <li> No invoice plus no instructions, I don&#x27;t know how to use much of it</li>
            <li> I got it quick,, exactly what they said would be in it,, it was packaged well,, very happy with my order and company</li>
            <li> Bought for a hip replacement.  The sponge is a little weak, (a common problem in these kits), but the sock assist was a lifesaver.  Good quality at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Did everything it was supposed to do.  I used every item except the shoelaces which I did not need because of the shoes I use.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this kit for the leg lift</li>
            <li> Bought this hip kit to use at home after hip replacement surgery.  Have only used the grabber tool and shoehorn, have had help at home for putting stockings and socks on, so haven&#x27;t tried those products. The grabber is ok, but not particularly strong.  It works well for getting dressed and picking up light objects. I purchased a larger, stronger grabber with a different mechanism to also use.</li>
            <li> With the exception shoe ties, every one of these products was put to use on a daily basis after each one of my hip replacement surgeries.  I could not have managed doing anything for myself if I didn&#x27;t have this kit.  I strongly recommend buying this kit if you are having hip or knee surgery.  I would suggest ordering it before surgery so the kit is at home when you return from the hospital.  You will use the &amp;#34;grabber&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;leg lifter&amp;#34; immediately (the &amp;#34;leg lifter&amp;#34; was the only way I could manage to get my leg up onto the bed at first).  Once you heal a bit, the &amp;#34;Sock-it&amp;#34; will allow you to put your socks on by yourself, and the long 2-ft shoe horn will allow you to put on shoes without bending over (which will be hard for a while).  The long-handled sponge helps you to reach your feet and back without doing any harm to yourself while healing.  The sponge was a little to soft for me; if it was more rigid, I could have cleaned up better.</li>
            <li> There are close to a million hip surgeries in this country ever year. As part of the recovery and rehabilitation process the patient needs this equipment.  Mercer Rehab and Amazon do a service to everyone in the process with this kit,  the good quality, the good price, and the good availability. Quick tip to users, a little lubricant, baby oil, petroleum jelly, cooking oil or  grease will make both sock ease, the blue device with jump rope handles, and the long handled shoe horn work much slicker. For a preview on what is expected of this equipment please look on line for Willamette Valley Medical Center, The Joint Replacement Institute  Guidebook for Hips.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Get it right away.  By the time I got it I no longer needed the &amp;#34;leash.&amp;#34;  The implement to put on the socks was a bit large for my small feet - I wear a size 6 shoe.  Overall,  it does the&lt;br /&gt;job and let me dress myself.</li>
            <li> Just got my hip kit today - 5 days post surgery. Most of the tools seem to be of good quality, but the reacher is a bit flimsy. It will be great for getting dressed. I have another grabber that&#x27;s a little sturdier and has a different mechanism that works better for heavier items. I like that the grabber is shorter. My other one is a 36&amp;#34; one, and that&#x27;s too long to be helpful to me in getting dressed. I love having the leg-lifter even now. I wish I&#x27;d had that while I was in the hospital. The sock aid will give me a little more independence as I won&#x27;t have to ask my husband to get my TEDs on for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> A god send if you have a hip replacement</li>
            <li> The items in this kit work well and have lasted well enough so far -- through the first week of my Bilateral Total Knee Replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usefulness of the leg lifter has been a continuous surprise.  I would have paid the full $40 for the leg lifter alone if where wasn&#x27;t  a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picker is lacking in quality a bit but I use it many times each day and plan to just  buy a more &#x27;profession&#x27; item -- The grabber claw/clamp isn&#x27;t very strong or well-made, but I didn&#x27;t downgrade the overall package because it works well enough and the other items all add to the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shoe horn is high quality but I haven&#x27;t needed it much, or enough to justify carrying it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using the shower sponge on a stick for as long as it lasts -- though I been doing pool therapy almost every day and not showering at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sock thing was easy to use even though I didn&#x27;t practice much (my mobility is coming back in record time/</li>
            <li> I just got my hip replaced and am so glad I bought this kit. You really DO need these items and after looking at the many options available, this one had the best combination. It is missing the dressing stick, so buy that separately.  Here&#x27;s a few pointers. This shoe horn is metal so it won&#x27;t break and it&#x27;s pretty long, plus you can use it to push your shoes off too. You&#x27;ll need the leg lifter for the first 2 weeks to get your leg onto the bed or lift it into the car.  Once your muscles strengthen up, you won&#x27;t need it as much. This is the better style of sock dresser. It&#x27;s better than the three piece one that is covered in felt. I&#x27;ve tried both. And the pick up stick is your valuable tool. This one is pretty sturdy and the handle hangs nicely on the front rung of your walker so you always have it with you. Speaking of walker, get a bicycle wire basket and attach it to your walker. Then you can carry stuff around the house. The only thing I didn&#x27;t use we&#x27;re the shoe laces. Best of luck, and speedy recovery.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I were not a tad on the tall side, the shortcomings would not have been as pronounced. The leg lift, the grabber, and the sock helper were all too short to be of much help initially. Three or four weeks after surgery I could bend over far enough to make use of them - but by then I could get by without.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using all the items on the kit but the ones I used were fine.</li>
            <li> Several of the items were poorly made.  For example, a part fell off the grabber the first time it was used.  I would go to a medical supply store next time.</li>
            <li> The hospital was recommending a similar kit that they sold but I found this one with more items and a good price.  Good to have after surgery when you cannot get down to your shoes.  Very helpful.</li>
            <li> It was as discribed, however the thereapist re commended it but I havnt used anything but the grasping tool, to pick up litter in the yard.</li>
            <li> This is the same equipment they had at the rehab center my mom stayed in.  Except, it did not include the hook for removing socks.</li>
            <li> There is everything in this kit that you will need if you are scheduled for hip replacement.  There is a device in this particular set that is not available in most other kits.  It is the piece used to lift your own leg, into bed or such.  Very useful during the initial phase after surgery.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of hospital staff giving a seminar on hip replacement surgery. Best thing I ever purchased. Thank goodness it was my wife who had the surgery, too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as I was scheduled for and recently had a total joint replacement (right hip).  I love the leg lifter and reacher/grabber.  The long shoe horn is a big help as is the device that help you put your socks on.  Wish I had had the sock device before as I had limited mobility in the right hip and it was difficult to put socks on.  Be advised that if you go into a rehab facility as I did that they might also give you some of these same items.  I though am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Sock helper works great and shoe horn but priced too high for type of products</li>
            <li> This hip replacement rehab kit is great.  I love the leg lifter and the sock putter onner.  I use the picker upper every day.  My hip is doing fine and I am getting along well thanks in part to this kit.  I can honestly say I have used every&lt;br /&gt;item in this kit except the elastic shoe laces.  But for the price, this is a super idea.</li>
            <li> Following hip replacement this collection of aids was exactly what my surgeon and physiotherapist recommended.  Every item exceeded my expectations and proved invaluable to my fast recovery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit for post-hip replacement recovery. It has all the items one needs to assist in dressing, bathing and reaching items around the house. The reaching/grabbing tool broke and a call to the 800# had a new one sent to me immediately. Great customer service. The price is excellent. Similar set at a local medical equipment store was $50+. I&#x27;d love to buy local but not for almost twice the price.</li>
            <li> Everything in this kit seemed to be well made and has held up well!  The leg lift has been great! I ended up with foot drop as a result of a nerve injury during my hip replacement and this strap has been great for my stretches and exercises!  I also read several reviews on other kits that talked about the reacher breaking easily. This one has held up very well!</li>
            <li> Very help/full. All items were of good quality.</li>
            <li> The hip kit had everything I needed and more.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this kit.  The quality is excellent, very well made.  I ordered for my knee replacement and wish it also had a clothes puller in it ( a stick with a hook on the end).  I would order from them again.  Thanks Bev Wallace</li>
            <li> The reacher broke within two days of use.  Rest of the tools work great.</li>
            <li> If you are going to have hip surgery, this is a must have. Don&#x27;t know what I would have done without this kit. I was really amazed at the sock helper...whoever thought this up is a genius! The grabber is so helpful with getting dressed and for other little things around the house. The leg lifter has helped me in and out of bed and with my physical therapy.  It did take a while for delivery so order ahead of time so that you have when you get home.</li>
