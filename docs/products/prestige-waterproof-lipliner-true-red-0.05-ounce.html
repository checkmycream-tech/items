            <li> vibrant red color and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> but other then that you can barely tell if you put on a lip stain before hand!</li>
            <li> product inside all of the awful packaging is, however, very good.</li>
            <li> Just a deep dark red.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to re apply and it didn&#x27;t dry out my lips!</li>
            <li> I will only use this a few times, so I will not buy the sharpener.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t orangy, or pink, like some reds are.  </li>
            <li> I can kiss the kids and sip on my coffee with minimal color smearing.  </li>
            <li> no really i love the dark red it has</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink!!</li>
            <li> Sharpening requires a very sharp knife, or as they suggest, their Prestige sharpener.</li>
            <li> However, being waterproof, this liner is very thick, and at times your lips might feel dry if you wear it for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> results- unlike messy lipstick.</li>
            <li> I had difficulties getting out of the plastic wrapping, which is very stiff and the perforation doesn&#x27;t even help.</li>
            <li> I have thin lips.</li>

            <li> Beautiful lip liner. Great price.</li>
            <li> Its not as red as I would of liked and it does feather after awhile.</li>
            <li> This is more pink than red</li>
            <li> Beautiful red, stays on all day, exactly as described.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. I had difficulties getting out of the plastic wrapping, which is very stiff and the perforation doesn&#x27;t even help. The pencil is not wooden, the barrel is made of plastic. Sharpening requires a very sharp knife, or as they suggest, their Prestige sharpener. I will only use this a few times, so I will not buy the sharpener. I will struggle with the knife instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product inside all of the awful packaging is, however, very good. It is a nice creamy, bright red. It is not dark at all. In the picture, I also have lip stain and gloss on, which renders very good results- unlike messy lipstick.</li>
            <li> I have thin lips.This is the only liner I can use. I use it as a liner and then fill in my lips. The color stays and does not bleed and stain my teeth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the feel of this lipliner! The color is absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, goes on smooth and matches the matte red lip crayon I have perfectly. Adds great definition and Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the color, it&#x27;s a very nice pencil, the waterproof status is questionable but all in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> loves the arterial like color &amp;#60;3.&lt;br /&gt;now my lips can match my blood when i&#x27;m in dialysis lol ;3.&lt;br /&gt;but no really i love the dark red it has</li>
            <li> Beautiful color goes well with my more pinkish reds.</li>
            <li> Love it, stays on long.</li>
            <li> its a little more pinky/magenta its not just red. but other then that you can barely tell if you put on a lip stain before hand!</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of my make up for a flapper costume.  This is just as nice as the Nars liner I have for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this lip liner, it doesn&#x27;t bleed and it&#x27;s not too dry, so the application is smooth. A must have if you love rocking red lipstick.</li>
            <li> I own a few of these, in various colors.  This &#x27;true red&#x27; is beautiful.  It isn&#x27;t orangy, or pink, like some reds are.  Isn&#x27;t burgandy either!  Yay!  Just a deep dark red.  Love it.  I line with it, and then add chap stick.  Stays on and doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.  I can kiss the kids and sip on my coffee with minimal color smearing.  Really happy with my purchase.  My favorite colors of prestige lip liner are true red, tomango, and  spice :)</li>
            <li> What a beautiful rich red color! But my... this is really waterproof! In fact,  I also believe it is weatherproof, smudge-proof, and even bullet proof!(don&#x27;t actually try that one) Any ways, it is  very waterproof and stays on REALLY well. If I put a coat of this on with lipstick  I usually only have to reapply lipstick once in an entire day. I even went shopping in a warm building for at least three hours with this liner on and I didn&#x27;t reapply lipstick once, when I walked out my lipstick looked the same as it did when I walked in. However, being waterproof, this liner is very thick, and at times your lips might feel dry if you wear it for long periods of time. This does not bother me though, and I love the color and how long it lasts. Naturally, five stars.</li>
            <li> vibrant red color and stays on for a long time. Happy with my purchase. Only problem is sharpening these kind of pencils!</li>
            <li> Very light.....  Didn&#x27;t really like it....</li>
            <li> True red is NOT red. It&#x27;s pink!!</li>
            <li> Great product and great color</li>
            <li> looks absolutely amazing! I didn&#x27;t even have to use chap stick to keep it from drying out my lips, it just stayed on all night I didn&#x27;t have to re apply and it didn&#x27;t dry out my lips! I love it! the color was beautiful, bright and am amazing red!</li>
