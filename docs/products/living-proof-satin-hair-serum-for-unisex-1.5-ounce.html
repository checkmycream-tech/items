            <li>and I am impressed with all.  </li>
            <li>The best I have found.</li>
            <li>great transaction, great product!</li>
            <li>A great item.</li>
            <li>Really great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>My hair looks great for two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The difference was quite amazing!</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing and works great on combating frizz.</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d be a good tester for this serum.  </li>
            <li>If Jennifer Anniston uses it , it must be good right?Only if you have her hair type, which I dont.</li>
            <li>this is a really good serum for finishing touch smell good and not sticky.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and it makes it curly, light-weight, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>I normally love this line...</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>Sticky and there are products for $5 that are so much better.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this item and I must say, I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>Love this brand</li>
            <li>top of the sent not being very pleasant, the actual results the product produced were not favorable.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth it considering the good results and the decrease in time and styling damage to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>I love to find great natural and cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny (in a healthy way) and its light and airy.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair, with some wave to it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have A LOT of it</li>
            <li>Great product (which I am not surprised about, because love the shampoo and conditioner).  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super frizzy anyway, so I may not be the best judge of this product, but I do notice added shine, less flyaways, and more touchable volume after using the serum.</li>
            <li>The LP serum is silicone free and supposed to control frizz.  </li>
            <li>Compared to Moroccan Oil, this product is light and watery and I found myself doubting if it would work.</li>
            <li>Product was nice and did not leave buildup, but my hair is a sponge and requires alot much control.</li>
            <li>Why spread it through the lower layers of your mane where light doesn&#x27;t reflect anyway?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I like the fact that its silicone and oil free</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, lasts all day, and very small amount does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this serum in a Sephora set and had high hopes that it would be better than a silicone serum.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sticking with my old favorite.  </li>
            <li>Proves that just because Jennifer Aniston &amp;#34;uses&amp;#34; it, doesnt make it worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love it fast delivery thanks</li>
            <li>This has been an issue with other brands for me, so I definitely didn&#x27;t put any product on my roots and it has worked perfect.</li>
            <li>If I want to smooth it out, it normally takes lots of heat and product.  </li>
            <li>so I expected it to be better than my really cheap silicone one.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for straight thin hair.</li>
            <li>It costs a good $3 less here than at the Brick &amp; Mortar</li>
            <li>I like this, but u cant use very much or u get a greasy look</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine with lots of natural curl.  </li>
            <li>My hair takes a lot less time to dry and style when I use it, but the best part is the shine and sleekness lasts for days!</li>
            <li>It seems to do exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I tried just this product on my hair, one squirt, with the diffuser, and WA-LAH, frizzball.</li>
            <li>I use to be consistent user of Moroccan oil until I discovered this product.  </li>
            <li>Works better on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and, not completely fizz free, but almost!</li>
            <li>So I certainly won&#x27;t spend the money for the LP product.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted THIS product to work but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I live in the tropics, so this really helps.</li>
            <li>I found that the top half of my hair looked like it needed to be washed.  </li>
            <li>my hair felt very silky, it looked glossy and most importantly NO</li>
            <li>I only used a small drop and smoothed it over just the top of my hair where the light catches.</li>
            <li>I am careful not to apply it too close to the roots, I feel like if I did that it would look greasy pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price of this serum is high</li>
            <li>There was absolutely no difference, they both control frizz just fine.  </li>
            <li>This product smooth&#x27;s frizzy and straightens my mane when applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t any more responsive to my styling routine than usual.  </li>
            <li>only wished I&#x27;d seen it here on Amazon first.</li>
            <li>My hair is an ashy medium brown that seems to suck light into it like a black hole.</li>
            <li>And silicone washes right out and certainly doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have thick fairly curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron straight.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, color damaged hair.</li>
            <li>If you have &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hair, a couple drops of this will cure it completely.  </li>
            <li>I do use more than directed (1.5 pumps vs .5 pumps) but my hair is fairly long, almost down to my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li>Do not bother - I have relatively straight and healthy hair and have been utilizing Moroccan oil, but decided to give this a try , but was not impressed.</li>
            <li>If anything my straight hair did not last as long as it would have if I used my go to product \\&quot;Paul Mitchell Skinny Balm and Serum\\</li>
            <li>However, this product, even though it is a small part of the overall quantity of stuff that goes in my hair actually made a big difference adding more softness and shine.  </li>
            <li>He told me to dry my hair using a paddle brush, brushing my hair over my head and then back again (left to right and back again</li>
            <li>&quot; I got my hair done on Friday and by Sunday night it was a hot slave pickin cotton mess.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the product, but do wish it was less expensive especially since I have to use so much at a time.  </li>

            <li> I have soft, thick and tight spiral curls and sometimes it gets pretty wild...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and you do not need to apply much to the roots of your hair.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair look greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in Sephora and had my stylist use it as she was flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s not a tremendous change, the difference is modest.</li>
            <li> I can make a single blowout last 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> noticed a few other reviewers talking about how much product they had to use.</li>
            <li> I can see this stuff going a long way if that&#x27;s all it takes to give me some</li>
            <li> I really could not see a difference in this product that other products that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> you just use a little amount on wet hair and do not go near the scalp</li>
            <li> ^-^ I have used it on dry hair after styling it, just working it through and then combing my hair again.</li>
            <li> and I did it form front to back and back to front a few times too)</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t advise it to be used on dry hair unless you like the slightly wet look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the organix kukui oil curl cream, a pump and a half</li>
            <li> I can get equal product in results for less.</li>
            <li> I use to apply two pumps of Moroccan oil in my hair, but Living Proof only requires a half of one pump otherwise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that could give it a little natural looking shine without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> My Got2be serum is $5, so there&#x27;s really no question.  </li>
            <li> It feels a bit greasy when I applied on wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent</li>
            <li> The second time, I tried two squirts, the diffuser, and WAL-LAH greasy and heavy, and somewhat &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; results.</li>
            <li> When applying wet keep</li>
            <li> it actually made my tightly curly hair frizzier and less defined.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way on this one.</li>
            <li> I needed only a very little amount of product for lots of results.</li>
            <li> she said not to use it with other products</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true that it only takes a few drops of LP&#x27;s serum ( my hair is shoulder length), I was rather disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Makes the hair shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Feel like my hair was any shinier or had less frizz.</li>
            <li> I did as the bottle said and avoided my roots, just by spreading a half pump</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not wanting to wait until tomorrow to give it a go, I stole away into my office restroom to apply a little.</li>
            <li> a few drops rubbed into my hands and then through my hair and its shiny, manageable and no frizz.</li>
            <li> but so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am just really disappointed right now.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, but a lot of it (about shoulder length, maybe a little longer), and it&#x27;s wavy/curly depending on how I style it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend if you have curly , thick hair.</li>
            <li> I only used a tiny bit ran it through my hair when I dried it hated the feeling felt like I didn&#x27;t even wash my hair :(</li>
            <li> Satin is a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> my hair can get thin and a bit greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> Im so wrong.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> Sorry Living Proof!</li>
            <li> But for hair like mine that always looks like a bad wig this stuff is a dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> horrible for the price.</li>
            <li> Too bad!!!</li>
            <li> The smell was awful..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a lot thicker/stickier than I thought it would be.  Okay.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this serum in a Sephora set and had high hopes that it would be better than a silicone serum.  The LP serum is silicone free and supposed to control frizz.  I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious so I figured I&#x27;d be a good tester for this serum.  But the results were the same as my silicone serum.  My hair wasn&#x27;t any more responsive to my styling routine than usual.  While it&#x27;s true that it only takes a few drops of LP&#x27;s serum ( my hair is shoulder length), I was rather disappointed.  The price of this serum is high so I expected it to be better than my really cheap silicone one.  Not so.  There was absolutely no difference, they both control frizz just fine.  So I certainly won&#x27;t spend the money for the LP product.  It comes in a tiny container and retails for about $29 at Sephora.  No way.  My Got2be serum is $5, so there&#x27;s really no question.  And silicone washes right out and certainly doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  So I&#x27;m sticking with my old favorite.  Sorry Living Proof!</li>
            <li> A great item. a few drops rubbed into my hands and then through my hair and its shiny, manageable and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Do not bother - I have relatively straight and healthy hair and have been utilizing Moroccan oil, but decided to give this a try , but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Works better on dry hair. Makes the hair shiny without weighing it down. It feels a bit greasy when I applied on wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super frizzy anyway, so I may not be the best judge of this product, but I do notice added shine, less flyaways, and more touchable volume after using the serum. It seems to do exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have thick fairly curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron straight. Satin is a game changer for me. Compared to Moroccan Oil, this product is light and watery and I found myself doubting if it would work. Was stunned at how my hair felt after blow drying. Smooth and silky! My hair takes a lot less time to dry and style when I use it, but the best part is the shine and sleekness lasts for days! I can make a single blowout last 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> I normally love this line...This one did nothing for me....it actually made my tightly curly hair frizzier and less defined.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all made my hair greasy I only used a tiny bit ran it through my hair when I dried it hated the feeling felt like I didn&#x27;t even wash my hair :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum!!!! It gives you perfect hair. My FAVORITE! ^-^ I have used it on dry hair after styling it, just working it through and then combing my hair again. Make sure you follow the instructions. It says to not put on the roots. This has been an issue with other brands for me, so I definitely didn&#x27;t put any product on my roots and it has worked perfect. I get compliments on the smell of my hair all the time now.</li>
            <li> I thought hair serums solved the issue of being sticky years ago! horrible for the price. Sticky and there are products for $5 that are so much better. Proves that just because Jennifer Aniston &amp;#34;uses&amp;#34; it, doesnt make it worth the price.</li>
            <li> There is a demo for this product online where they claim it will reduce blowdryer time by 40 percent. The model in the demo has curly hair similar to mine so I decided to try the product. When I did, I found that my blow drying time was not reduced at all. I contacted them about their claim and the person who responded by email said it did cut hers...she said not to use it with other products so I did try that but again no reduction. I didn&#x27;t. Feel like my hair was any shinier or had less frizz. If anything it felt like my hair was coated. I would not recommend if you have curly , thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and added this to my overall hair &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of products after reading a review of it in Allure.  Any product I ever heard of before where you only use 2-3 drops never did anything for my hair.  However, this product, even though it is a small part of the overall quantity of stuff that goes in my hair actually made a big difference adding more softness and shine.  Really great.</li>
            <li> Love it fast delivery thanks</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair, with some wave to it. My hairstylist gave me some samples and I just tried it. He told me to dry my hair using a paddle brush, brushing my hair over my head and then back again (left to right and back again and I did it form front to back and back to front a few times too) I had tried that without this product just to see with and without. The difference was quite amazing! My hair looks fantastic! Very sleek and, not completely fizz free, but almost! I am definitely going to buy a bottle! I love to find great natural and cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> great transaction, great product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted THIS product to work but it didn&#x27;t. It just made my hair look greasy and flat. Too bad!!!</li>
            <li> If Jennifer Anniston uses it , it must be good right?Only if you have her hair type, which I dont.Product was nice and did not leave buildup, but my hair is a sponge and requires alot much control.Perfect for straight thin hair.</li>
            <li> After using according to directions...[and I&#x27;ve used a lot of this type of product..] I found that the top half of my hair looked like it needed to be washed.  I only used a bit [after washing and on damp hair] and my hair is shoulder length...I used a blow dryer after.  I am just really disappointed right now.</li>
            <li> My hair is an ashy medium brown that seems to suck light into it like a black hole. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that could give it a little natural looking shine without feeling greasy or heavy. I found it with this Hair Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to wait until tomorrow to give it a go, I stole away into my office restroom to apply a little. I did as the bottle said and avoided my roots, just by spreading a half pump cross my palms and smoothing my palms over my hair. I don&#x27;t have a frizz problem, so I didn&#x27;t note any difference there, but it was as if I were painting on a bit of shine! I saw my hair transform before my eyes! Now, it&#x27;s not a tremendous change, the difference is modest. But for hair like mine that always looks like a bad wig this stuff is a dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few other reviewers talking about how much product they had to use. I only used a small drop and smoothed it over just the top of my hair where the light catches. Why spread it through the lower layers of your mane where light doesn&#x27;t reflect anyway? I can see this stuff going a long way if that&#x27;s all it takes to give me some shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wished I&#x27;d seen it here on Amazon first. It costs a good $3 less here than at the Brick &amp; Mortar I bought it at.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this item and I must say, I LOVE IT!!!! I have soft, thick and tight spiral curls and sometimes it gets pretty wild... but since I started using the Living Proof Satin Hair Serum my hair felt very silky, it looked glossy and most importantly NO FRIZZ :D This was money well spent and I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Living Proof Satin Hair Serum arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I have just started trying Living Proof products and I am impressed with all.  Just remember with Hair Serum you just use a little amount on wet hair and do not go near the scalp, I don&#x27;t advise it to be used on dry hair unless you like the slightly wet look.</li>
            <li> Hi! Love this brand this is a really good serum for finishing touch smell good and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have short hair and everytime I use it, I look like I just came back from the salon. A little goes a long way and you do not need to apply much to the roots of your hair. The residue that is left on my hand once I apply to the rest of my hair is all I put on my roots! Makes my hair shiny (in a healthy way) and its light and airy.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful.. Why would you have a &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; sent for something like this anyway? That&#x27;s what they make male hair products for.&lt;br /&gt;On top of the sent not being very pleasant, the actual results the product produced were not favorable. I have thin hair, but a lot of it (about shoulder length, maybe a little longer), and it&#x27;s wavy/curly depending on how I style it. The first time I used it, I tried just this product on my hair, one squirt, with the diffuser, and WA-LAH, frizzball. The second time, I tried two squirts, the diffuser, and WAL-LAH greasy and heavy, and somewhat &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; results. Not a fan. I&#x27;m going back to the organix kukui oil curl cream, a pump and a half and it makes it curly, light-weight, and smells amazing. Returning the product via UPS today.</li>
            <li> Living proof products continue to surprise me with their quality. I combine this with another of their products and like the results</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in Sephora and had my stylist use it as she was flat ironing my hair. I didnt notice anything different. If anything my straight hair did not last as long as it would have if I used my go to product \\&quot;Paul Mitchell Skinny Balm and Serum\\&quot; I got my hair done on Friday and by Sunday night it was a hot slave pickin cotton mess. (I can make that joke cause Im colored lol Im so wrong. Im sorry yall) lolol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I like the fact that its silicone and oil free and I will give it a second try but so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I like this, but u cant use very much or u get a greasy look</li>
            <li> I needed only a very little amount of product for lots of results. My hair is fine, but I have A LOT of it and I live in the tropics, so this really helps. I use it along with the no frizz conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really could not see a difference in this product that other products that I have used in the past.  I can get equal product in results for less.</li>
            <li> I use to be consistent user of Moroccan oil until I discovered this product.  It smells wonderful, lasts all day, and very small amount does the trick.  I have naturally curly, color damaged hair. This product smooth&#x27;s frizzy and straightens my mane when applied to wet hair.  I use to apply two pumps of Moroccan oil in my hair, but Living Proof only requires a half of one pump otherwise my hair can get thin and a bit greasy looking.  When applying wet keep this product away from your roots.  My hair looks great for two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only draw back is that I have to apply a heat protectant when using this serum as a straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine with lots of natural curl.  If I want to smooth it out, it normally takes lots of heat and product.  With Living Proof Satin Hair Serum, and I can almost (but not quite) eliminate flat-ironing my hair.  I do use more than directed (1.5 pumps vs .5 pumps) but my hair is fairly long, almost down to my shoulder blades.  I am careful not to apply it too close to the roots, I feel like if I did that it would look greasy pretty quickly.  I am really pleased with the product, but do wish it was less expensive especially since I have to use so much at a time.  Still, it&#x27;s worth it considering the good results and the decrease in time and styling damage to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hair, a couple drops of this will cure it completely.  The best I have found.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> Great product (which I am not surprised about, because love the shampoo and conditioner).  It also smells amazing and works great on combating frizz.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way on this one.</li>
