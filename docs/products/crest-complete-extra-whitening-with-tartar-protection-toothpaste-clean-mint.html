    <ol>
            <li>of course, that may not produce the best breath.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest is the brand I&#x27;ve been using for years, so I know I&#x27;m happy with the flavor.  </li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for whitening, this is the best in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I am glad I asked information on this as it helped someelse too..a very good product and with the flip lid</li>
            <li>Good product, recommended.</li>
            <li>Tastes good and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying in the store.</li>
            <li>I loved that stuff.</li>
            <li>I liked that the toothpaste on Amazon is sometimes cheaper than brick and mortar stores, so it&#x27;s convenient for me to order from here.</li>
            <li>I have been using crest for many years and have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to get used to it (because I bought a 6-pack), but this is a very strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Buy it if you like more Fluoride for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Amazon packed the Crest boxes in their own box with bubble wrap, so the package arrived securely.</li>
            <li>Probably purchased more than was needed for this application and yet that&#x27;s my way.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Doug</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>The kids love the taste as well.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s Polishing Beads make you teeth look clean and bright, but more than that, they keep your mouth feeling Dentist Clean.</li>
            <li>I rarely have cavities, so I know it is also an effective brand.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use..</li>
            <li>Glad to get it on-line and quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste at the store a few months ago because it looked impressive.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product, and when I need more I will order it in the future.  </li>
            <li>received 6 full-sized tubes of toothpaste in their original boxes.  </li>
            <li>It has given me clean teeth</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon directly and the toothpaste boxes were nicely bundled with no dents or scuffs on any of the boxes.</li>
            <li>The mint favor tastes fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my breath fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of mint flavor, but as far as mint flavored toothpastes go, this one is better than the others.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a familiar product at a reasonable price a quick service!</li>
            <li>Very fast time to receive.</li>
            <li>matter what toothpaste you choose, be sure to brush shortly after eating acidic food if you haven&#x27;t any tooth enamel and/or exposed nerves.  </li>
            <li>Now I am totally scared of using this and will chuck it in the garbage right after I write this review.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these to restore our cars headlamp covers to new.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores, my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>I am a coffee drinker, so I like the whitening action of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use this toothpaste with no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>forward to this week when I was in the middle of moving and had packed all my normal toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>Started using it again for the last few days and right away, breakouts have appeared.  </li>

            <li> I liked that the toothpaste on Amazon is sometimes cheaper than brick and mortar stores, so it&#x27;s convenient for me to order from here. They&#x27;re just like what you get off the store shelves, but with the convenience of having it delivered to your doorstep. I ordered from Amazon directly and the toothpaste boxes were nicely bundled with no dents or scuffs on any of the boxes.</li>
            <li> I am glad I asked information on this as it helped someelse too..a very good product and with the flip lid it is easy to use..</li>
            <li> No rocket science here.  Just some toothpaste with mint and scope.  Buy it if you like more Fluoride for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Good product, recommended.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> I hate going grocery shopping: long lines, screaming kids, people riding electric shopping carts, parking, dents in my doors from people who leave the carts in the lots.  I will look for any excuse not stop at the grocery store.  So when I was running low on toothpaste, I signed up for the subscribe and save Crest on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest is the brand I&#x27;ve been using for years, so I know I&#x27;m happy with the flavor.  The mint favor tastes fresh and clean. I rarely have cavities, so I know it is also an effective brand. I am a coffee drinker, so I like the whitening action of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 6 full-sized tubes of toothpaste in their original boxes.  Amazon packed the Crest boxes in their own box with bubble wrap, so the package arrived securely. It took 2 days to receive the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an excuse not to go grocery shopping, sign up.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to restore our cars headlamp covers to new. Probably purchased more than was needed for this application and yet that&#x27;s my way. Besides we now have a lifetime supply of household tooth paste. Thanks for a familiar product at a reasonable price a quick service! Sincerely, Doug</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It makes my breath fresh and I always get compliments from friends and even my dentist about the whiteness of my teeth! Afterall, isn&#x27;t that the reason we buy a whitening toothpaste?  I have tried many products for whitening, this is the best in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Tartar control by mail.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tooth paste.  I don&#x27;t know why it would be someone else&#x27;s.  It has given me clean teeth and it has a taste that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of mint flavor, but as far as mint flavored toothpastes go, this one is better than the others. I tried the Crest Pro health, and it was fine, but your tongue gets sick of it after a while. This one does not have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only they would make chocolate flavored toothpastes. Or salami flavored... of course, that may not produce the best breath.</li>
            <li> Bought a different Crest by mistake and almost immediately had Tatar build up. Returned to this toothpaste and  tartar is controlled.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying in the store. I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening tho, but who cares. I didn&#x27;t expect to.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s Polishing Beads make you teeth look clean and bright, but more than that, they keep your mouth feeling Dentist Clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste at the store a few months ago because it looked impressive.  Extra whitening, tartar protection, multi-benefit, and it was on sale.  A few days after using it, I noticed breakouts in my chin area.  The breakouts made no sense so I decided to stop using this toothpaste to see if that was the culprit.  Immediately the acne went away after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this week when I was in the middle of moving and had packed all my normal toothpastes.  This one was still sitting in my closet since I last stopped using it.  Started using it again for the last few days and right away, breakouts have appeared.  Now I am totally scared of using this and will chuck it in the garbage right after I write this review.  Perhaps other people don&#x27;t have this reaction, but I know for myself, I can&#x27;t use this product because it causes a serious chin breakout reaction for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to get used to it (because I bought a 6-pack), but this is a very strong mint flavor. Really too harsh for my liking and my kids definitely won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The pic is wrong and shows the old extra whitening Crest. I loved that stuff. But this is \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; which tastes SO horrible. So beware.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any enamel on my teeth and also have some exposed nerves.  I can use this toothpaste with no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what toothpaste you choose, be sure to brush shortly after eating acidic food if you haven&#x27;t any tooth enamel and/or exposed nerves.  The acid will make those nerves go crazy!!</li>
            <li> I have been using crest for many years and have nothing but good things to say about it. The kids love the taste as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this flavor anymore in stores. Glad to get it on-line and quickly. Very fast time to receive. Great</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, and when I need more I will order it in the future.  Thank you!</li>
