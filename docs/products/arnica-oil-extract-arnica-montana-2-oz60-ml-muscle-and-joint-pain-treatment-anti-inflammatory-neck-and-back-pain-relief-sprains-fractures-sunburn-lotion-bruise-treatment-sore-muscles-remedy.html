            <li>THE OIL DID NOT HELP ME,BUT TO BE FAIR WITH MY ARTHRITIS</li>
            <li>It is good to know where I can get it.</li>

            <li>This is a really good arnica extract.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Not that good.</li>
            <li>Always good to have onhand</li>
            <li>I loved this Arnica Oil Extract, I was battling bursitis in my hip, and I did not want cortisone shots,</li>
            <li>He was very impressed how quickly the injury healed.  </li>
            <li>I am super impressed, even astounded, and wish I had tried an arnica product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, well packaged and impressive service.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have this oil at hand :)</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This is the best pure oil I could locate.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately have not had a great need for the application for injury, but am prepared should the need arise.  </li>
            <li>But it does reduce inflammation, and to an amazing degree for me.  </li>
            <li>Used as advised I found the arnica extract to be effective in a medicinal salve.</li>
            <li>Covering it with a warm moist towel seems to intensify it&#x27;s effect.  </li>
            <li>Nice timely delivery service.</li>
            <li>will buy again use this oil to mix with a muscle /joint balm sold on arnica will  purchase again great buy quick service</li>
            <li>I bruise very easily</li>
            <li>I add it to CT Cream to make it more effective.</li>
            <li>I HAVE RA AND WAS HOPING FOR BETTER RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I guess there is not a big demand for arnica oil, although it is a wonderful muscle, joint, and tendon pain reliever.</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition and in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Great oil, really works well with swelling</li>
            <li>Most of the pain has gone away, and there is no bruising.  </li>
            <li>and I really love how it works.</li>
            <li>I figured one more try wouldn&#x27;t break the bank and so ordered Arnica Montana.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>Must be vigilant in using 2-3 times a day for best/fastest and most thorough elimination of bruises.</li>
            <li>I would have been better served rubbing my money on my arm than spending it on this product.</li>
            <li>I love it and it does do as advertised.</li>
            <li>excellent product and not mixed with petroleum.</li>
            <li>It is just OK.</li>
            <li>I thank this vendor for providing such a wonderful product, and because of it I can sit again.</li>
            <li>lovely stuff</li>
            <li>With that being said I think that that if the oil was fresher it would have been a better quality product.</li>
            <li>I am very aware of what good quality Arnica smells like, it does have a strong smell but this smelled like rancid oil.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I think I will try and find a dropper top to replace the original cap.</li>
            <li>Worked very quickly on my sprained ankle from trail running.</li>
            <li>I have tried things for years, I bruise so easily.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great for muscle and aches in general.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>And it helps tremendously!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is a high-quality product and deserves more loyal customers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know the oil was available, until I looked online.  </li>
            <li>Originally, it was a gift from her sister who is an E.R. registered nurse.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that provides several natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to be ready for the muscle soreness that will accompany our 3-day hike in the Grand Canyon!</li>
            <li>Healed quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I am frankly amazed at how well it works to relieve my muscle/tendon pain, and how quickly.  </li>
            <li>The relief is quick to follow.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and relaxing.</li>
            <li>After being diagnosed with leukemia, I bruised easily and needed something to help them heal fast.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best remedy to quickly clear up a bruise.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>The oil is absorbed by the skin without trace, not greasy.</li>
            <li>The oil is gentle and smooth and absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is good at bringing down swelling and alleviating the pain.</li>
            <li>I have received this product from seller super fast.  </li>
            <li>Ground shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>While there is no reference as to strength or dilution, I doubt there is very much Arnica Oil in this mix.</li>
            <li>Apply to wet fresh out of shower skin then apply &amp; rub in pure, clean, DMSO on top to fully activate anti-inflammatory effect.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>so this has been very helpful!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>really works for me!</li>
            <li>Again, as with all homeopathic remedies you have to be consistent with their use, and massaging this product in to the skin worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have an autoimmune inflammatory arthritis and this really helped with swelling in my knees!</li>
            <li>I am trying to make my own mentholated arnica rub for migraine relief due to stress.</li>
            <li>I mix 80 drops of this oil into an 8 oz mix of pure shea butter and almond oil.  </li>
            <li>This is not 100% Pure Arnica Oil Extract.</li>
            <li>Pure Oil.</li>
            <li>I ordered pure Arnica Extract and received Arnica extract in a soybean oil with Rosemary.</li>
            <li>As others have said it is not 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>She was absolutely correct.&lt;br /&gt;Arnica</li>
            <li>The pain around the knee area was much diminished.  </li>
            <li>The muscles became very sore and some felt burning to touch.  </li>
            <li>Use very liberally.</li>
            <li>How much you add of each depends on your preference.  </li>
            <li>I also do a mix of 80 drops in straight almond oil.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I reach for my arnica when the arthritis starts hurting, amazed at how much it helps.</li>
            <li>Really helps with inflammation.</li>
            <li>very helpful for arthritis pain.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t praise much.</li>
            <li>This product is an oil with a very astringent odor.</li>
            <li>Love this product but the smell brought it down.</li>
            <li>Squeeze bottle better than typical glass bottle for getting the oil a drop at a time.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>But based on my results, I highly recommend giving it a try, because for the price it has been a miracle.</li>
            <li>but it arrived without a seal on the bottle top which made me a little concerned.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a complete pain relief, this is not it, however, it does work very well for bruising and muscle aches.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a crazy dramatic instant anti-swelling remedy, but it for sure makes a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I am a first time arnica user, so I can&#x27;t compare this particular product to any similar product.  </li>
            <li>But 80 drops is enough to be effective, and so this bottle will last a long time!  </li>
            <li>Bottle is small, but the oil is very concentrated and strong.  </li>
            <li>Pure Arnica Montana Oil Extract,\\&quot; when the Arnica Oil is mixed with Soybean Oil, Rosemary, and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>ALSO, if the folks who complain about the &amp;#34;arnica content&amp;#34; had read the product details... which clearly state the additives that prevent spoilage - Some issues would never surfaced.</li>
            <li>Everything went smoothly, fast shipping and a really low price, thank you!!</li>
            <li>General use so far has been satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>A step above normal oils.</li>
            <li>We have tried numerous creams etc over the last 3 years and only one offers real relief.</li>
            <li>Usually put it on at night and will be pain free the next day.</li>
            <li>My wife is in her mid 50&#x27;s and is stricken with a nearly incessant case of POLYMYALGIA.</li>
            <li>For those of us who live with daily pain, one day at a time is enough.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I put it inside a plastic baggie and then into my purse, standing upright, but a little oil still leaked out into the baggie, despite the cap being tight and the flip top not being depressed.  </li>
            <li>I used it straight, never mixing it with other oils.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle fragrance and seems to impart a curative effect when applied with other essential oils to reduce inflammation and swelling from arthritis pain.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of blemeshes and sores on my skin from sun damage and various other problems, and the Arnica oil seems to really work.</li>

            <li> The muscles became very sore and some felt burning to touch.  </li>
            <li> Use very liberally.</li>
            <li> How much you add of each depends on your preference.  </li>
            <li> I also do a mix of 80 drops in straight almond oil.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I reach for my arnica when the arthritis starts hurting, amazed at how much it helps.</li>
            <li> Really helps with inflammation.</li>
            <li> very helpful for arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t praise much.</li>
            <li> This product is an oil with a very astringent odor.</li>
            <li> Love this product but the smell brought it down.</li>
            <li> Squeeze bottle better than typical glass bottle for getting the oil a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> But based on my results, I highly recommend giving it a try, because for the price it has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> but it arrived without a seal on the bottle top which made me a little concerned.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a complete pain relief, this is not it, however, it does work very well for bruising and muscle aches.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a crazy dramatic instant anti-swelling remedy, but it for sure makes a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I am a first time arnica user, so I can&#x27;t compare this particular product to any similar product.  </li>
            <li> But 80 drops is enough to be effective, and so this bottle will last a long time!  </li>
            <li> Bottle is small, but the oil is very concentrated and strong.  </li>
            <li> Pure Arnica Montana Oil Extract,\\&quot; when the Arnica Oil is mixed with Soybean Oil, Rosemary, and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> ALSO, if the folks who complain about the &amp;#34;arnica content&amp;#34; had read the product details... which clearly state the additives that prevent spoilage - Some issues would never surfaced.</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly, fast shipping and a really low price, thank you!!</li>
            <li> General use so far has been satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> A step above normal oils.</li>
            <li> We have tried numerous creams etc over the last 3 years and only one offers real relief.</li>
            <li> Usually put it on at night and will be pain free the next day.</li>
            <li> My wife is in her mid 50&#x27;s and is stricken with a nearly incessant case of POLYMYALGIA.</li>
            <li> For those of us who live with daily pain, one day at a time is enough.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I put it inside a plastic baggie and then into my purse, standing upright, but a little oil still leaked out into the baggie, despite the cap being tight and the flip top not being depressed.  </li>
            <li> I used it straight, never mixing it with other oils.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle fragrance and seems to impart a curative effect when applied with other essential oils to reduce inflammation and swelling from arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of blemeshes and sores on my skin from sun damage and various other problems, and the Arnica oil seems to really work.</li>
            <li> I have heard that other Arnica products can be dangerous, but I am living proof that is good.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter mix is quite greasy until it absorbs, but it allows me to massage my hands and do physical therapy to my knuckles, the almond oil mix penetrates faster, and I use it when I have a flare up, but no time for a long massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have been taking OTC pain relievers, but since the pain is continuing, I decided to look for other possible remedies besides numerous doses of pain pills every day.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with other essential oils in producing a topical arthritis medicine.</li>
            <li> Also, the aperture (opening) on the cap is too big for something you are meant to dispense a few drops of at a time, as the product comes out far too fast, and invariably a few drops leak and run down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Will it continue to work long term?</li>
            <li> This product does not directly decrease pain.  </li>
            <li> Now, I said it does not directly decrease pain like an analgesic; but as my inflammation subsides,  so does my pain and stiffness as a result of the inflammation decrease.  </li>
            <li> It works on bug bites, minor scratches, aches and pains, swelling.</li>
            <li> A typical event causes the muscles in her neck, upper chest and back tighten up so severely that she looses muscle definition in the affected areas.</li>
            <li> Just wish it cost a little less, but it really works on bringing down the pain levels caused by disk deterioration in my neck and back,</li>
            <li> I also added some other essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product has proved itself over and over again and seems to flat out outperform other &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This oil is a little different than other brands I have used before.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually cover one side of a cotton ball and wrap the cotton ball around the pain with some cloth over night and definitely relieves the pain.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply just the arnica alone when I&#x27;m in big inflammation trouble, which usually is the case with ankylosing spondylitis.</li>
            <li> This oil helped me with the pain, since I literally had to either stand or lay down with this pain</li>
            <li> and I could not sit down.</li>
            <li> The doctor went in through my right side, moving muscles instead of cutting muscles.  </li>
            <li> A few drops will work.</li>
            <li> In other words, the wing bones and spine are hardly distinguishable and if you feel the areas</li>
            <li> it is unbelievable how tight those muscles are wound.</li>
            <li> Effect is not easy to judge.  </li>
            <li> I make an inflammation cream with it of raw peanut oil, raw castor oil, rice bran oil, &amp; arnica oil.</li>
            <li> The relief usually lasts for  a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how they justify the claim of, \\&quot;100%</li>
            <li> The healing effects are subtle and may take a few days to see results.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find arnica oil</li>
            <li> Put a drop or two in my bath with epsiom salts after a hard work out.  </li>
            <li> The press-flip cap sucks, if you plan to transport this anywhere or put it anywhere except sitting upright and untouched in your medicine cabinet.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product but the smell brought it down. I am trying to add in essential oils to hide the smell.</li>
            <li> I HAVE RA AND WAS HOPING FOR BETTER RESULTS. THE OIL DID NOT HELP ME,BUT TO BE FAIR WITH MY ARTHRITIS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYTHING THAT WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> This smells so bad I can&#x27;t use it.  I tried, but the smell stays for hours.  It smells rancid and like it was heated or cooked to make the rancid smell go away.  I should have returned it, but will instead throw it away.</li>
            <li> Worked very quickly on my sprained ankle from trail running. Healed quickly. I usually cover one side of a cotton ball and wrap the cotton ball around the pain with some cloth over night and definitely relieves the pain.</li>
            <li> Good quality product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Good product, fast delivery. I mix it with oil as a topical. Works well.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. It was reasonably priced. I guess there is not a big demand for arnica oil, although it is a wonderful muscle, joint, and tendon pain reliever. I was unhappy that the oil was rancid. It still works, but doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived in perfect condition and in a short amount of time. I use this in a pain cream I make, this being only one of the ingredients. It is good to know where I can get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I get a lot of blemeshes and sores on my skin from sun damage and various other problems, and the Arnica oil seems to really work.</li>
            <li> Great oil, really works well with swelling</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Just wish it cost a little less, but it really works on bringing down the pain levels caused by disk deterioration in my neck and back,</li>
            <li> Always a 5 star rating. This is a high quality product. I make an inflammation cream with it of raw peanut oil, raw castor oil, rice bran oil, &amp; arnica oil. Apply to wet fresh out of shower skin then apply &amp; rub in pure, clean, DMSO on top to fully activate anti-inflammatory effect. Sometimes I apply just the arnica alone when I&#x27;m in big inflammation trouble, which usually is the case with ankylosing spondylitis.</li>
            <li> did not help pain and caused a burning  did not think is was a good product</li>
            <li> At work, I sit by a lady that swears arnica oil works like a miracle.  So I purchased a bottle of this oil.  She was absolutely correct.&lt;br /&gt;Arnica Oil works like a miracle.  I have 2 examples:  My husband had a total knee replacement in November 2013.  I started rubbing the oil on the bruising area around his knee, thigh and calf.  Within 3 days, the bruising was almost gone.  The pain around the knee area was much diminished.  I continued to rub his knee, thigh and calf for another 2 weeks.  His recovery went great.  Another example:  I had spacers put in my back in January 2014.  The doctor went in through my right side, moving muscles instead of cutting muscles.  The muscles became very sore and some felt burning to touch.  I started rubbing the Arnica Oil on my thigh and around the incision.  Most of the pain has gone away, and there is no bruising.  Arnica Oil does not take away all the pains, however, it has shortened the pain time.  I will NEVER be without this oil. Another example:  My son was running and injured his calf.  I gave him some of this oil to use.  He was very impressed how quickly the injury healed.  If you are looking for a complete pain relief, this is not it, however, it does work very well for bruising and muscle aches.  Give it a try.  NOTE:  I used it straight, never mixing it with other oils.</li>
            <li> Ground shipping was very fast.  I didn&#x27;t know the oil was available, until I looked online.  Bottle is small, but the oil is very concentrated and strong.  Use very liberally.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I am frankly amazed at how well it works to relieve my muscle/tendon pain, and how quickly.  I have been having pain in my forearm, and have started wearing a brace part time, which helps some, but not enough.  I have been taking OTC pain relievers, but since the pain is continuing, I decided to look for other possible remedies besides numerous doses of pain pills every day.  This arnica oil actually works, and reduces the pain in my forearm within minutes.  The relief usually lasts for  a couple hours.  I am super impressed, even astounded, and wish I had tried an arnica product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply about 5-10 drops of the oil to my arm, and rub it in well.  The relief is quick to follow.  I am a first time arnica user, so I can&#x27;t compare this particular product to any similar product.  I chose this one because it seemed from reading descriptions and reviews that it was a stronger concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do NOT like about this product is the cap on the bottle.  The press-flip cap sucks, if you plan to transport this anywhere or put it anywhere except sitting upright and untouched in your medicine cabinet.  I want to carry it in my purse so I can use it whenever needed.  Thankfully, I put it inside a plastic baggie and then into my purse, standing upright, but a little oil still leaked out into the baggie, despite the cap being tight and the flip top not being depressed.  Also, the aperture (opening) on the cap is too big for something you are meant to dispense a few drops of at a time, as the product comes out far too fast, and invariably a few drops leak and run down the side of the bottle. Use care when dispensing.  I think I will try and find a dropper top to replace the original cap. I would give the crummy cap 0 stars out of 5, however, I decided to review this product based on the medication quality only, and just mention the inadequate packaging in my review.</li>
            <li> Used as advised I found the arnica extract to be effective in a medicinal salve. Will purchase this product again</li>
            <li> My wife is in her mid 50&#x27;s and is stricken with a nearly incessant case of POLYMYALGIA. She has a pain threshold that makes me look to be something of a wimp, and when she hurts it is very serious pain. A typical event causes the muscles in her neck, upper chest and back tighten up so severely that she looses muscle definition in the affected areas. In other words, the wing bones and spine are hardly distinguishable and if you feel the areas it is unbelievable how tight those muscles are wound. Something like a spasm that does not subside. We have tried numerous creams etc over the last 3 years and only one offers real relief. Arnica ...  This product has proved itself over and over again and seems to flat out outperform other &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; we&#x27;ve used. Originally, it was a gift from her sister who is an E.R. registered nurse.  ALSO, if the folks who complain about the &amp;#34;arnica content&amp;#34; had read the product details... which clearly state the additives that prevent spoilage - Some issues would never surfaced. That&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m stickin&#x27; to it !!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! i use on my muscles when they are sore and also to help get rid of bruises faster. I bruise very easily so this has been very helpful!</li>
            <li> I have always used arnica gel to treat bruises.  Now I use this oil and I really love how it works.</li>
            <li> All I have here is this is one amazing product!!!!!!!! But please read about it on Web Md before you buy! It is not a &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; it has amazing properties and will work !</li>
            <li> Good product and works great in the massage bars I made.</li>
            <li> will buy again use this oil to mix with a muscle /joint balm sold on arnica will  purchase again great buy quick service</li>
            <li> For two years, I&#x27;ve battled chronic pain from a back condition that affects my left leg. I&#x27;ve ordered oils, herbal supplements, OTC pain relievers. And those are in addition to costly medical treatments. I figured one more try wouldn&#x27;t break the bank and so ordered Arnica Montana. No, it does cure my back nor does it eliminate 100% of the pain. What it does is take the edge off the pain so I can exercise or even walk through a grocery store without hobbling. A little goes a long way. A few drops will work. Does it work for everyone? Don&#x27;t know. Will it continue to work long term? Don&#x27;t know that either. For those of us who live with daily pain, one day at a time is enough.</li>
            <li> Fortunately have not had a great need for the application for injury, but am prepared should the need arise.  General use so far has been satisfactory.  Quick delivery, well packaged and impressive service.</li>
            <li> great for my bruise prone body</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with results. Must be vigilant in using 2-3 times a day for best/fastest and most thorough elimination of bruises.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but it is a great product to use for massaging!  The scent is mild and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Added this to my collection</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and although I am taking a number of medications for it, I still have joint flare ups.  This product does not directly decrease pain.  But it does reduce inflammation, and to an amazing degree for me.  Couldn&#x27;t guarantee that it will work as well for others, but for me it is miraculous.  Once I put it on, I notice the effects with in 1-2 hours.  Now, I said it does not directly decrease pain like an analgesic; but as my inflammation subsides,  so does my pain and stiffness as a result of the inflammation decrease.  I mix 80 drops of this oil into an 8 oz mix of pure shea butter and almond oil.  The almond oil helps turn the shea butter creamy.  How much you add of each depends on your preference.  But 80 drops is enough to be effective, and so this bottle will last a long time!  I also do a mix of 80 drops in straight almond oil.  The shea butter mix is quite greasy until it absorbs, but it allows me to massage my hands and do physical therapy to my knuckles, the almond oil mix penetrates faster, and I use it when I have a flare up, but no time for a long massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it work for you?  I don&#x27;t know.  But based on my results, I highly recommend giving it a try, because for the price it has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> The Title and Labeling are misleading. This is not 100% Pure Arnica Oil Extract. I am not sure how they justify the claim of, \\&quot;100% Pure Arnica Montana Oil Extract,\\&quot; when the Arnica Oil is mixed with Soybean Oil, Rosemary, and Vitamin E. While there is no reference as to strength or dilution, I doubt there is very much Arnica Oil in this mix. There is not the slightest scent of Arnica. The bottle I received smelled horribly rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller who assured me that this \\&quot;smell\\&quot; was the rosemary. I know what Rosemary smells like and I know what rancid smells like. This ws rancid oil, not the scent of Rosemary. I gave this product a chance. I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle, without the slightest bit of pain relief or reduction of inflammation. I would have been better served rubbing my money on my arm than spending it on this product.</li>
            <li> BEST DEAL OUT THERE!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this oil. I add it to CT Cream to make it more effective. And it helps tremendously! In my opinion, this is a high-quality product and deserves more loyal customers. Why not try a bottle for yourself? A little goes a long way. God bless all in their search for healing.</li>
            <li> This is a really good arnica extract. I would most definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone. Healing.</li>
            <li> A must have oil for anyone who regularly gets or gives a massage. My massage therapist loves it. I love it and it does do as advertised. Very relaxing. A step above normal oils.</li>
            <li> I have received this product from seller super fast.  I use arnica for my widespread fibromyalgia pain with great results.  I do also use essential oils,  but now can add to my shea pain formula I made.  Tyvm.</li>
            <li> This is the best pure oil I could locate.  A tiny tiny bit goes along way.  excellent product and not mixed with petroleum. Pure Oil.</li>
            <li> I reach for my arnica when the arthritis starts hurting, amazed at how much it helps. Usually put it on at night and will be pain free the next day.</li>
            <li> I am trying to make my own mentholated arnica rub for migraine relief due to stress. Arnica soothes sore muscles and helps them to relax. This oil was perfect for my needs. I added it to coconut oil, beeswax, petroleum, camphor and menthol crystals. I also added some other essential oils. It is really hard to find arnica oil so I was happy when I got this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! After being diagnosed with leukemia, I bruised easily and needed something to help them heal fast. It works on bug bites, minor scratches, aches and pains, swelling. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Really helps with inflammation. Excellent product. Have reordered &amp; will continue too! I recommend this product for anyone who has suffered an injury with inflammation.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Put a drop or two in my bath with epsiom salts after a hard work out.  It helps to take away muscle pain.</li>
            <li> very helpful for arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> I got it for carpal tunnel type pain, that was keeping me awake at night.&lt;br /&gt;This really works for me! I would give 5 stars, but my husband says it doesn&#x27;t help him that much.&lt;br /&gt;He has a bad ankle from a previous fracture. He is going to keep using it though in case it&lt;br /&gt;just takes longer for him.</li>
            <li> This oil is a little different than other brands I have used before. but it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> Good product. Squeeze bottle better than typical glass bottle for getting the oil a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to be ready for the muscle soreness that will accompany our 3-day hike in the Grand Canyon!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t praise much. It is just OK. Not that good.</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly, fast shipping and a really low price, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m sure the product is very good.  It was not what I thought I was ordering.  I ordered pure Arnica Extract and received Arnica extract in a soybean oil with Rosemary.</li>
            <li> Great Product, well packaged. Happy Camper in Maine, a yah.</li>
            <li> Always good to have onhand</li>
            <li> This product is an oil with a very astringent odor. Effect is not easy to judge.  Sore just seems to stay sore and w/ a bad odor.  I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  Maybe the &#x27;pills&#x27; are the way to go with Arnica!!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best remedy to quickly clear up a bruise. I have tried things for years, I bruise so easily.  I&#x27;ve let friends use it, and they are now ordering it.</li>
            <li> I loved this Arnica Oil Extract, I was battling bursitis in my hip, and I did not want cortisone shots, so, I opted for the Arnica Oil Extract. This oil helped me with the pain, since I literally had to either stand or lay down with this pain and I could not sit down. Over time all pain went away, but again you must me diligent with the use of this product. This product is good at bringing down swelling and alleviating the pain. I have heard that other Arnica products can be dangerous, but I am living proof that is good.  Again, as with all homeopathic remedies you have to be consistent with their use, and massaging this product in to the skin worked for me. Very happy with my purchase, and the excellent service this vendor provided. I thank this vendor for providing such a wonderful product, and because of it I can sit again. Of course, my habits have changed so that bursitis in the area does not happen again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works great for pain relief and inflammation.</li>
            <li> Oil arrived swiftly. Have used it and it works how Arnica oil is supposed to work for muscle aches, bruises and the like. Whenever I fall, twist my ankle, have a shocking injury, drop anything on my toes (yes, I&#x27;m clumsy that way) I am happy to have this oil at hand :)</li>
            <li> As others have said it is not 100% pure.  I was expecting an essential oil type of a thing.  This is just carrier oil, no hint of arnica smell and no results when placed on the body.  And my bottle was rancid too.</li>
            <li> The oil is absorbed by the skin without trace, not greasy. it works well on bruises and sore muscles. lovely stuff</li>
            <li> I was looking for the essential oil, when I happened on your product. It eliminated bruising and healed my skin. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune inflammatory arthritis and this really helped with swelling in my knees! It&#x27;s not a crazy dramatic instant anti-swelling remedy, but it for sure makes a significant difference. I use 3-4 drops on each knee every night and massage it in.  The oil is gentle and smooth and absorbs pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles and will order again once it runs out. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Great for muscle and aches in general.  Covering it with a warm moist towel seems to intensify it&#x27;s effect.  I have recommended it to others who also agree that it helped reduce and/or eliminate pain.</li>
            <li> I am very aware of what good quality Arnica smells like, it does have a strong smell but this smelled like rancid oil. With that being said I think that that if the oil was fresher it would have been a better quality product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that provides several natural remedies. I mix it with other essential oils in producing a topical arthritis medicine. It takes three weeks to render the oil-like mountain flowers Arnica extract is made from. It has a nice subtle fragrance and seems to impart a curative effect when applied with other essential oils to reduce inflammation and swelling from arthritis pain. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties. The healing effects are subtle and may take a few days to see results. The arnica oil was delivered cross country to my home in Florida in about four days. Nice timely delivery service.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product but it arrived without a seal on the bottle top which made me a little concerned. It meets my needs!</li>
