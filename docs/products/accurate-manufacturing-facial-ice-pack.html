            <li>It&#x27;s a nice idea</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great product!</li>
            <li>Having the straps is nice but the contents can shift around.</li>
            <li>Came Super fast excellent protective packaging.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I just wished it was more durable...</li>
            <li>This is perfect to use after facials or to treat any type of facial swelling.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>it could contour to the face better, and be a bit softer but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, but straps could be better.</li>
            <li>Or maybe a over the top of head add on strap.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;inner lining to make it more</li>
            <li>better then sticking bags of frozen peas on your face :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Great ice pack - product has soft felt on one side to place against face.</li>
            <li>The straps are a good length, so they can be adjusted to anyone&#x27;s head, but there is so much velcro on them that my hair always gets caught and torn no matter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to throw in the freezer and strap on the face.</li>
            <li>It works fine, I used it after a laser procedure to treat my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit well.  </li>
            <li>The purchase went smoothly with the masks arriving in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>So what I do is to place a couple of folded handkerchiefs on my face, and then I place the smooth side of the mask over them.</li>
            <li>THis is such a great mask.</li>
            <li>We purchased two a month ago and they have been used lightly.  </li>
            <li>One size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li>Its smooth and comfortable and would get 5 stars if it stayed cool longer.</li>
            <li>After two uses, it has about 1/2 of the liquid that it originally had in it.  </li>
            <li>This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This was the most comfortable one to lay on my face and kinda keep whole thing chilled.</li>
            <li>By the time it&#x27;s softened up enough to feel OK, it&#x27;s too warm to be therapeutic.  </li>
            <li>its cool, but</li>
            <li>very adaptable for fitting face and head.  </li>
            <li>It froze quickly</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly but one of them had leaked the gel into the package during shipment.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a laser surgery on my face, Did not find it useful at all.</li>
            <li>so I made a cloth cover that it just lays on my face and after a while I remove it and put the mask directly to my face and wow nice and cool.</li>
            <li>I was able to return the defective for a full refund but only had one I could use when I preferred to have both.</li>
            <li>They are flexible, dont freeze solid, and have one side covered with a soft cloth like film which is great for using them (comfortably) straight out of the freezer.</li>
            <li>Good product, it would be been better if the strap was a rubber band instead of this tough material that gets stuck to the hair and rips it off.</li>
            <li>Loved this item when purchased previously but this one arrived damaged.</li>
            <li>If this mask came in different sizes &amp; contained more gel, it probably would work well, but at this point, it is just taking up space in my freezer!(Maybe</li>
            <li>Add a wet towel on top to keep the cool contacting the contour of your face.</li>
            <li>Love using this, especially when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>The mask does exactly as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>reading some reviews I was aware that some people found the mask slippery while on the face.</li>
            <li>Good, but definitely not built to last.  </li>
            <li>This product really work, it fit as intended and keep cool for a long time.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the opening for the nose in particular!  </li>
            <li>this works very well when I&#x27;m having a migraine.</li>
            <li>I have laser treatments on my face, and it really helps with the pain and swelling.  </li>
            <li>They worked very well.</li>
            <li>This mask is really neat.</li>
            <li>This is the best cold mask I have yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since not all faces are created equal, getting it to fit and stay in place can be tricky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>shrink baggy under eyes and morning wrinkles, fells very soothing, and help relieve head</li>
            <li>However, this would probably be a decent product for say, somebody with a migraine problem or a fever.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this on my face but it drapes nicely over the knees, on elevated feet and ankles, and folds over to apply icy pressure on the back.  </li>
            <li>one side of the mask was open and most of the gel had leaked out, no way I could get the gel back in again, and then seal the mask.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, very good and cold which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it had a felt type side/a soft side to which you really don&#x27;t need a cloth to put between the skin and the face.</li>
            <li>This facial ice pack has the right coverage to hit all those spots, but it just isn&#x27;t soothing.  </li>
            <li>It also made a mess on my nice white couch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty much have to ware this while lying on your back, cant really walk around the house with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps</li>
            <li>I suffer from hot flashes and night sweats and this product helps immensely!  </li>
            <li>Purpose is for ice only, but did use with a hot water soak and application and did not show any damage.</li>
            <li>Before freezing the gel can be pressed to one side of the mask or contoured and adjusted to rest where pain relief is needed most and the pack stays cold easily for the maximum of 20 minutes</li>
            <li>how carefully I tie it back and secure the straps.</li>
            <li>Product remains soft even when frozen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a soft, paper-like fabric backing.</li>
            <li>It really does take up your entire face.</li>
            <li>You have to have it super tight.</li>
            <li>I am giving this facial mask 4 stars because it feels so heavy on the face and there was not enough gel for the contour around the nose where I had most of my surgery done.</li>
            <li>But if you have the time to lie down and reap the benefits of a full frozen facial mask, then go for it.</li>
            <li>I definitely handled it with care and not sure why it&#x27;d break so easily like that.</li>
            <li>Then there&#x27;s the back side of the mask, which is constructed of some kind of cheap, scratchy paper which is rough and unpleasant to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It does not freeze solid, and has a soft fabric&lt;</li>
            <li>The thing I disliked most was that the nose area had little to no gel availability.    </li>
            <li>These freezer gelpacks for yr whole face are SO much better than having to hold/ strap reg cold packs to your head after getting a peel or injectables..</li>
            <li>By the time I got it in the mail, the swelling had gone down, but I know it would have been exactly what I needed initially.  </li>

            <li> By the time I got it in the mail, the swelling had gone down, but I know it would have been exactly what I needed initially.  </li>
            <li> during normal use (laying down.</li>
            <li> Nose and lip area hard to keep cooling gel placed; velcro very strong and hair gets caught so not suitable for moving around with mask on as it is heavy but sitting in a reclined position, the mask works very well in other regards.</li>
            <li> It will need to lay flat to ensure that it freezes evenly.</li>
            <li> near the nasal area, around the mouth, and down to the jaw.</li>
            <li> Other ice packs only work on one area of the face; this product gets the entire face.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s why I needed there to be more cold gel on my nose area.    </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so cold and a better straps system so it doesn&#x27;t slide off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty heavy and stiff.</li>
            <li> I should have returned it at that point but part of me thought that perhaps there was simply some residual liquid in the bag due to the packaging process rather than leakage from the mask.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one, as often the pain concentrates on one side of the face under the eye, or cheekbone; jaw pain is also common.</li>
            <li> I almost always end up using one of my many other cold packs instead.</li>
            <li> not as expected.</li>
            <li> but I see no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t perform as expected.  </li>
            <li> The mask has a fabric like side to it so can lay on face without another cloth between like the other mask i bought</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and probably will not use the item more than the one time I used it.</li>
            <li> The other is still in use.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the back of this mask which was made of paper sheet because it is hard to wash.</li>
            <li> I look like the bad guy from a cheap 1980s sci-fi horror movie when I wear it..</li>
            <li> not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is very cold and comfortable on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so heavy and ineffective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also heavy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Too stiff and heavy when frozen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit heavy but certainly not more so</li>

            <li> Not sure how to rate this.</li>
            <li> but as I used it I found that it did indeed have a leak as the gel like liquid was all over my face (in small quantities).</li>
            <li> The atual nose and eyes and lips are cut outs and kinda small.  </li>
            <li> works well, however need something to protect skin from direct cold exposure</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cold at first</li>
            <li> So sadly I probably won&#x27;t keep it very long.</li>
            <li> have a fairly small thin face, had to cut a few inches off the Velcro strap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to make a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; mask.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is wonderful to use for headaches.  I suffer from hot flashes and night sweats and this product helps immensely!  You won&#x27;t regret the purchase!</li>
            <li> I purchased two and one leak before I removed it from the freezer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate this. It works fine, I used it after a laser procedure to treat my rosacea.  I don&#x27;t strap it on, I just laid it on my face as I reclined just a bit. It&#x27;s a little bit heavy but certainly not more so than any ice pack would be. I appreciated the opening for the nose in particular!  It arrived on time but it appeared to perhaps have a leak as some of the blue liquid was in the plastic bag that contained the facial ice pack.  I should have returned it at that point but part of me thought that perhaps there was simply some residual liquid in the bag due to the packaging process rather than leakage from the mask.  It froze quickly but as I used it I found that it did indeed have a leak as the gel like liquid was all over my face (in small quantities). There was a leak around the mouth area that I taped shut, but some of it seems to ooze out elsewhere. After two uses, it has about 1/2 of the liquid that it originally had in it.  I guess in my case, I&#x27;ll only get a couple of uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the back of this mask which was made of paper sheet because it is hard to wash.</li>
            <li> Only get if you want it for beauty treatments. Frozen it&#x27;s pretty heavy and stiff. Would hurt to put over a sunburn or after plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> Only issue the Velcro would get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice idea but it&#x27;s hard to make a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; mask.    The gel moves around even after being &#x27;frozen&#x27; and it takes effort to evenly disperse it across the mask.    The thing I disliked most was that the nose area had little to no gel availability.    My purpose for this was to use it in concordance with &#x27;The Acne Cure&#x27; where you ice your face after using Benzoil Peroxide in order for it to penetrate deeper into the pores. And that&#x27;s why I needed there to be more cold gel on my nose area.    However, this would probably be a decent product for say, somebody with a migraine problem or a fever.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for sinus relief. There is not enough gel in the mask and I found myself manipulating the gel to where my pain was located..near the nasal area, around the mouth, and down to the jaw. It is not a good mask if you have a small face like I do. If this mask came in different sizes &amp; contained more gel, it probably would work well, but at this point, it is just taking up space in my freezer!(Maybe I could dig it out on Halloween) It may work for surgical procedures, but not sinus relief!</li>
            <li> Loved this item when purchased previously but this one arrived damaged. Was very disappointed bc this works very well when I&#x27;m having a migraine. Am hesitant to reorder bc I saw this happened to several people. Think I&#x27;ll try a different one.</li>
            <li> only feels frozen on the forehead area....good idea , just doesn&#x27;t work.  Sorry</li>
            <li> Mask already broke after two days! It also made a mess on my nice white couch. I definitely handled it with care and not sure why it&#x27;d break so easily like that. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> so heavy and ineffective. not worth the price. quality sucks. not as expected.</li>
            <li> Fits better than I could have imagined great for decreasing bruising after Botox which is what I bought it for. You can also scare the dog with it LOL</li>
            <li> its cool, but I look like the bad guy from a cheap 1980s sci-fi horror movie when I wear it..</li>
            <li> It does not mold properly to your face and you need to hold it using your hand which gets very cold.</li>
            <li> These freezer gelpacks for yr whole face are SO much better than having to hold/ strap reg cold packs to your head after getting a peel or injectables..my dermatologist&#x27;s office should sell these! They are flexible, dont freeze solid, and have one side covered with a soft cloth like film which is great for using them (comfortably) straight out of the freezer. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Love this. I even use it on my back when it is sore.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this product yet but I see no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t perform as expected.  It will need to lay flat to ensure that it freezes evenly.</li>
            <li> I have laser treatments on my face, and it really helps with the pain and swelling.  Other ice packs only work on one area of the face; this product gets the entire face.</li>
            <li> This Facial Ice Pack was a god sent. I use it twice a month every time after I use the proactive in my face. it&#x27;s very cold at first so I made a cloth cover that it just lays on my face and after a while I remove it and put the mask directly to my face and wow nice and cool. I like it a lot I just wish it had a thicker cover so it&#x27;s not so cold and a better straps system so it doesn&#x27;t slide off. I find my self adjusting it quite often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsito..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this on my face but it drapes nicely over the knees, on elevated feet and ankles, and folds over to apply icy pressure on the back.  This is a great comfort after a workout.</li>
            <li> Great relief for sinus or migraine headaches.  Add a wet towel on top to keep the cool contacting the contour of your face.</li>
            <li> I used after having facial surgery. Nose, eyes and lips.  This was the most comfortable one to lay on my face and kinda keep whole thing chilled. The atual nose and eyes and lips are cut outs and kinda small.  The mask has a fabric like side to it so can lay on face without another cloth between like the other mask i bought it was all plastic and stiffer and didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> DELIVERED AS PROMISED</li>
            <li> Was perfect for sinus surgery</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic migraines, so I have tried dozens of different face masks, eye masks, head packs, neck packs, etc....I had high hopes for this one, as often the pain concentrates on one side of the face under the eye, or cheekbone; jaw pain is also common. This facial ice pack has the right coverage to hit all those spots, but it just isn&#x27;t soothing.  The gel part of the pack is thin and when it&#x27;s frozen, it&#x27;s rather hard and uncomfortable -- it doesn&#x27;t conform to your face at all.  By the time it&#x27;s softened up enough to feel OK, it&#x27;s too warm to be therapeutic.  Then there&#x27;s the back side of the mask, which is constructed of some kind of cheap, scratchy paper which is rough and unpleasant to the touch.  The straps are a good length, so they can be adjusted to anyone&#x27;s head, but there is so much velcro on them that my hair always gets caught and torn no matter how carefully I tie it back and secure the straps. As anyone who has migraines knows, our sensitivity to sensory input during an attack is so acute that these seemingly small details become horribly magnified. I almost always end up using one of my many other cold packs instead. Disappointing, because this full-face mask has so much potential!!! It just isn&#x27;t well-executed.</li>
            <li> They worked very well.</li>
            <li> Great ice mask! Love using this, especially when it&#x27;s hot. I just wished it was more durable...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit well.  Very uncomfortable  I was disappointed and probably will not use the item more than the one time I used it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Work so well for our Patients.</li>
            <li> This product really work, it fit as intended and keep cool for a long time. Good.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and in excellent condition.  Works well.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great ice pack - product has soft felt on one side to place against face. This is perfect to use after facials or to treat any type of facial swelling. Product remains soft even when frozen.</li>
            <li> Nose and lip area hard to keep cooling gel placed; velcro very strong and hair gets caught so not suitable for moving around with mask on as it is heavy but sitting in a reclined position, the mask works very well in other regards. Stays cold quite a long time. Served its purpose especially for post IPL treatments.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this for post op swelling. Before freezing the gel can be pressed to one side of the mask or contoured and adjusted to rest where pain relief is needed most and the pack stays cold easily for the maximum of 20 minutes it is advised to have cold compresses applied to skin.</li>
            <li> The mask does exactly as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a laser surgery on my face, Did not find it useful at all. Too stiff and heavy when frozen.</li>
            <li> works well, however need something to protect skin from direct cold exposure</li>
            <li> The purchase went smoothly with the masks arriving in a timely manner. I ordered two and one had a seam that leaked the gel. I was able to return the defective for a full refund but only had one I could use when I preferred to have both.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product!</li>
            <li> It is a comfort.  Everyone&#x27;s needs are going to be different. Had dental surgery and needed this to help with the inevitable swelling. Came Super fast excellent protective packaging.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my aunt who has severe nerve facial pain.  She said it helps.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft, paper-like fabric backing. It is very cold and comfortable on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I had no idea when I bought this how big it would be. It really does take up your entire face. It&#x27;s also heavy. There&#x27;s not way to walk around with this on your face unless you want to scare everyone in your family including the dogs, plus it&#x27;s really too heavy to stay on your head. You have to have it super tight. But if you have the time to lie down and reap the benefits of a full frozen facial mask, then go for it. I wish I would have bought the smaller - eyes only one. Plus it takes up a lot of room in my freezer. So sadly I probably won&#x27;t keep it very long.</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged and was unable to use.</li>
            <li> 10 days after delivery and i&#x27;m arranging the return of this item. during normal use (laying down. not man-handling it at all.) the seam split and emptied blue goo into my hair.... awesome....</li>
            <li> Absolutly the best thing I have bought for my TMJ. It also helps reduce swelling in the sinus areas. I appreciate that even the nose strip has the freezable substance as well. This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of these for an upcoming surgery. They arrived quickly but one of them had leaked the gel into the package during shipment.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time but when it arrived the gel inside the mask was oozing out and all over the outside of the mask. Had to return item</li>
            <li> it could contour to the face better, and be a bit softer but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This mask is really neat. Using it helps me to take some time out for myself, and listen to some music, or audio book material.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews I was aware that some people found the mask slippery while on the face. - So what I do is to place a couple of folded handkerchiefs on my face, and then I place the smooth side of the mask over them. It works great.</li>
            <li> one of two ice mask in package came damaged, Great ice mask</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, when mask arrived it hadn&#x27;t sealed correctly...one side of the mask was open and most of the gel had leaked out, no way I could get the gel back in again, and then seal the mask.  Too late to return as it was needed within the week for post operative dental work.  Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> THis is such a great mask. It can be used not only for puffiness but also if your child has a fever.</li>
            <li> Good, but definitely not built to last.  We purchased two a month ago and they have been used lightly.  One started leaking.  The other is still in use.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone needing ice on their face. Its smooth and comfortable and would get 5 stars if it stayed cool longer.</li>
            <li> Product came with no explanation enclosed regarding which side should be put against face, or recommended duration. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from my phone on the way home after a facial laser treatment.  I swelled up beyond belief, and I wish I had ordered it sooner.  By the time I got it in the mail, the swelling had gone down, but I know it would have been exactly what I needed initially.  I had to jerry-rig several ice packs together, which was a pain. Anyone having a similar procedure should definitely have one of these.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, but straps could be better. Or maybe a over the top of head add on strap. Keeps her face cold after lazer treatment.</li>
            <li> very adaptable for fitting face and head.  Purpose is for ice only, but did use with a hot water soak and application and did not show any damage.</li>
            <li> This is the best cold mask I have yet tried.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for sinus head aches, and those puffy, swollen eyes I get when I sleep on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has lots of blue stuff inside and it is distributed well. It does not freeze solid, and has a soft fabric&lt;br /&gt;inner lining to make it more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Stays cold a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since not all faces are created equal, getting it to fit and stay in place can be tricky.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly small thin face, had to cut a few inches off the Velcro strap.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much have to ware this while lying on your back, cant really walk around the house with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps shrink baggy under eyes and morning wrinkles, fells very soothing, and help relieve head aches.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made, and I&#x27;m not worried and it cracking and leaking blue goo everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way better then sticking bags of frozen peas on your face :)</li>
            <li> gel migrates to lower portion</li>
            <li> Works great. The strap can slip causing the mask to fall if not fastened in an upward fashion. Otherwise, very good and cold which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Good product, it would be been better if the strap was a rubber band instead of this tough material that gets stuck to the hair and rips it off. Other than that. Good</li>
            <li> Having the straps is nice but the contents can shift around.</li>
            <li> One size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li> I would have bought it sooner it the description was more thorough! See I didn&#x27;t know if it had a felt type side/a soft side to which you really don&#x27;t need a cloth to put between the skin and the face. Had I known I would have bought this months ago! I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I used this mask to recover from oral surgery and it served its purpose. I am giving this facial mask 4 stars because it feels so heavy on the face and there was not enough gel for the contour around the nose where I had most of my surgery done. But besides that, everything is great. It&#x27;s easy to throw in the freezer and strap on the face.</li>
