            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>appears to be of good quality, but I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li>looks like good product</li>
            <li>Very Very Happy, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good and nice product...</li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose of using a tapered barrel.</li>
            <li>and it does the job fine!</li>
            <li>Very smooth filing on nails.</li>
            <li>It files a very precise area and won&#x27;t gouge out the acrylic or gel.  </li>
            <li>Love how close I can get to the cuticle with this bit.</li>
            <li>Shipping was wonderful and will definitely work with this vender again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>I love this bit.  </li>
            <li>Awesome Carbonate bit, works fantastic, has never dulled after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Arrives really quick!</li>
            <li>Great carbide bit - go gently as you grind, especially if you haven&#x27;t used carbide bits before --- they are &amp;#34;mighty&amp;#34; efficient and effective.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sharp at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bits that came with my Kupa were sharp, excellent and lasted along time.</li>
            <li>This little gem works great for shaping acrylic nail.</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>This bit works and is exactly as it describes</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to receive the product pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>The tapered end is very helpful.</li>
            <li>but I really have to adjust my angles to not cut the natural nail.</li>
            <li>If you use large barrel bits regularly you will have no trouble.</li>
            <li>But please be sure u how to use the electric file machine if you are not trained how to use the drill u can seriously injure yourself.</li>

            <li> Great for taking gel polish off sculptured nails.</li>
            <li> Great carbide bit - go gently as you grind, especially if you haven&#x27;t used carbide bits before --- they are &amp;#34;mighty&amp;#34; efficient and effective. Start with slower speed on your grinder if necessary, too. Both suggestions helped me a lot!</li>
            <li> This is not a quality bit. Not sharp at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bits that came with my Kupa were sharp, excellent and lasted along time. Will reorder from Kupa.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! I used one time already and I&#x27;m fascinated.. Good and nice product... Arrives really quick! Thanks !</li>
            <li> Works very well.  The tapered end is very helpful.</li>

            <li> Great product, works good! Happy my acrylic nails looked amazing! I was very surprised to receive the product pretty fast!</li>
            <li> This bit works great for filing. It does not tear up nails like sanding bands do. Easier to use. Very smooth filing on nails.</li>
            <li> Awesome Carbonate bit, works fantastic, has never dulled after multiple uses. Very Very Happy, well worth the price. Would buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly. was as described. appears to be of good quality, but I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Love this bit!!</li>
            <li> Love how close I can get to the cuticle with this bit. Since I am not a professionl I needed something that would help me get that look. Shipping was wonderful and will definitely work with this vender again.</li>
            <li> looks like good product</li>
            <li> I did not receive the same item as shown my is rounded at tip I&#x27;m dissatisfied not what I wanted. .</li>
            <li> this is also a item that you must have in a salondoing acryl or gels ! a lot of the items i bought till now are satisfying!i choose them care fully and was afraid at firt but now a know them so i buy all the time when its needed is very good</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and I&#x27;m so glad I have it.  I use it on acrylic and gel and it does the job fine!</li>
            <li> The barrel is a bit shorter than I am used to and it&#x27;s also a bit bigger around at the tip. It works fine but I really have to adjust my angles to not cut the natural nail. Cost me quite a bit of time and I was running behind all day.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This bit works and is exactly as it describes but I use small barrel carbide bits and this one is the same diameter at the tip as those. Kind of defeats the purpose of using a tapered barrel. If you use large barrel bits regularly you will have no trouble.</li>
            <li> I CAN NOT SAY ANY THING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVEN&#x27;T GOT IT YET SO THAT&#x27;S WHY . I CAN&#x27;T SAY</li>
            <li> I love this bit.  It files a very precise area and won&#x27;t gouge out the acrylic or gel.  I use this for my gel nails when doing fill-ins.  I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these in different shapes and corsenesses.  I love them all!!</li>
            <li> Great product n came to me fast,love this for paws n claws love,love,love it!!!</li>
            <li> cant be sanitized/disinfected it turned copper in less than a week had to dispose! &#x3D;(</li>
