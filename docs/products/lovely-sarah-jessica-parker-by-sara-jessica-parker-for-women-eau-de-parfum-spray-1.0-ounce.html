            <li>This perfume is just Lovely!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I had heard that is was a nice fragrance, plus a lot of people gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad she loved bc</li>
            <li>Nice perfume for every day.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and great prices.</li>
            <li>Once I got it and tried it on, I can honestly say it is simply lovely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and does not fill a room when I walk in.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and great for every day wear or on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I loved this perfume the first time I smelled it!</li>
            <li>I disagree, I love it&#x27;s earthiness and musk tones.</li>
            <li>The top note is lovely</li>
            <li>(the title of the perfume is appropriate).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sent.</li>
            <li>Well I should have known better?</li>
            <li>I have been using Lovely for awhile now.</li>
            <li>So glad I took the chance and bought it.</li>
            <li>I notice the amber and musk more than  anything else.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the product and the manner in which the order was handled.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better reason for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT AND PRICE</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this  perfume.</li>
            <li>Really is LOVELY.</li>
            <li>As far as the scent goes, the first sprays on my wrist smelled like really strong rubbing alcohol (in a not so good way) but after 3 seconds, that upper-upper top note faded into something so beautiful and sweet, it just took my breath away.</li>
            <li>and I cannot emphasize enough how beautiful the scent is and how elegant the bottle.</li>
            <li>I wish it was available at more locations rather than online</li>
            <li>Too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I love that the scent won&#x27;t knock people over if they get too close, yet, it reels people in around me without even really</li>
            <li>if you dont already know this, realize that it takes a while for the true smell of the perfume to come up as it mixes with the bodies oils and chemistry.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell, its not overpowering but very light and is good to be used year round.</li>
            <li>The middle note of the perfume has the slightest hint of citrus, and in some ways, resembles a fresh ripe oranges (the good smell).</li>
            <li>I know many have said they thought it smelled like an &#x27;old lady&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Everyone said it was Lovely, soft etc.</li>
            <li>This is a sophisticated and mature scent without smelling \\&quot;old\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My daughter mentioned she had smelled this fragrance on a lady at work and how fresh it smelled.  </li>
            <li>If you like fresh, light,floral scents this is a keeper.</li>
            <li>but sure enough, each was in its original packaging and they were not testers.  </li>
            <li>came a little late but it is in perfect condition upon arrival and smells awsome not too strong and not flowery light and pretty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, fresh &amp; clean scent that isn&#x27;t heavy at all &amp; reminds me of spring.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Got for a gift, not even close to the real scent, returned!</li>
            <li>It smelled like it has a stong alcohol when first sprayed, however then the flowery notes come out.</li>
            <li>The first order was lost, but Amazon called us to let us know and reshipped the order.  </li>
            <li>Although I usually don&#x27;t buy items associated with a \\&quot;movie star\\&quot;, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>and she certainly approved.</li>
            <li>Colleagues have noted that I smell very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t judge it by how it smells coming straight from the bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Just one squirt will do for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I heard so much about it  for years that I have to order it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little peppery at first and reminiscent but not as strong as Estee Lauder&#x27;s Dazzling Gold</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>From first impressions alone, the bottle is very simple and elegant and underneath the glass bottle top is a gray cloth band which was a little hard to see from the photos.</li>
            <li>The price was also pretty low.</li>
            <li>then it settles into a soft floral.</li>
            <li>It smells old.</li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes to get the true scent of any perfume</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>I like the way it will leave a clean, subtle, feminine scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume had cellophane open on the bottom and was very watered down.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was very disappointed in the price and 1oz bottle , was able to purchase a large bottle for cheaper then what I paid here</li>
            <li> The scent is supposed to have a clean crisp smell and this is awful.</li>
            <li> And the base note is very light.</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with that fragrance, but of course 30-year-olds know all about perfumes and make-up and other girly things</li>
            <li> You have to wait a little while to know what it&#x27;s going to smell like.</li>
            <li> I use just a little spritz or spray it on a cotton ball and dab it on.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a knock-off from the seller?</li>
            <li> I had secretly wanted to try this perfume for about a year</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> and we were still skeptical that they were testers</li>
            <li> and I was aghast at one reviewer who after spraying it on threw it in the garbage!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will not be buying anything from this seller again.</li>

            <li> I loved this perfume the first time I smelled it! I know many have said they thought it smelled like an &#x27;old lady&#x27;. I disagree, I love it&#x27;s earthiness and musk tones. I was really happy to find it for sale online.</li>
            <li> I had secretly wanted to try this perfume for about a year and I finally received it in the mail from Amazon. From first impressions alone, the bottle is very simple and elegant and underneath the glass bottle top is a gray cloth band which was a little hard to see from the photos. As far as the scent goes, the first sprays on my wrist smelled like really strong rubbing alcohol (in a not so good way) but after 3 seconds, that upper-upper top note faded into something so beautiful and sweet, it just took my breath away. The top note is lovely (the title of the perfume is appropriate). The middle note of the perfume has the slightest hint of citrus, and in some ways, resembles a fresh ripe oranges (the good smell). It also smells floral without being overpowering. And the base note is very light. If you look for the smell, you will find it. I love that the scent won&#x27;t knock people over if they get too close, yet, it reels people in around me without even really trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wearing it now. Breathing it in... oh yes. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my d/in-law along with the body butter.  Very nice packaging and great scent.  She was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not the fragrance I thought it was.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sent. It&#x27;s very light and does not fill a room when I walk in. Colleagues have noted that I smell very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. I wash every day, so it must be the perfume.</li>
            <li> Well I should have known better? I bought this fragrance based on the hundreds of reviews on this products. Everyone said it was Lovely, soft etc. And one of the best. So I thought I&#x27;d try it? Oops, never again will I do that! This was one of the stinkiest fragrances that I have ever smelled! It was a combination of bug spray and lighter fluid! Thank God I sprayed it on while outdoors! Not sure if this was a knock-off from the seller? But in the trash it went!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last..I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and this one seemed different</li>
            <li> Did not like the scent at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lovely for awhile now. This perfume had cellophane open on the bottom and was very watered down. I was very disappointed and will not be buying anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I bought this without ever smelling it before. I had heard that is was a nice fragrance, plus a lot of people gave it 5 stars. So glad I took the chance and bought it. It is \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a nice, fresh &amp; clean scent that isn&#x27;t heavy at all &amp; reminds me of spring. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a sophisticated and mature scent without smelling \\&quot;old\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t judge it by how it smells coming straight from the bottle. You have to wait a little while to know what it&#x27;s going to smell like. I notice the amber and musk more than  anything else. It&#x27;s a little peppery at first and reminiscent but not as strong as Estee Lauder&#x27;s Dazzling Gold then it settles into a soft floral. I like it a lot but probably won&#x27;t consider it my signature scent. Still on the hunt.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent at a great price! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My daughter mentioned she had smelled this fragrance on a lady at work and how fresh it smelled.  As a surprise, I purchased it for my daughter.  She loved it.  Although I usually don&#x27;t buy items associated with a \\&quot;movie star\\&quot;, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product and the manner in which the order was handled.</li>
            <li> Got for a gift, not even close to the real scent, returned!</li>
            <li> I received this for Mothers Day along with some pearls and I cannot emphasize enough how beautiful the scent is and how elegant the bottle. It does take a few minutes to get the true scent of any perfume and I was aghast at one reviewer who after spraying it on threw it in the garbage!  Please ladies if you dont already know this, realize that it takes a while for the true smell of the perfume to come up as it mixes with the bodies oils and chemistry. Please give it a while.  This perfume is just Lovely! Also this is a great price for a quality perfume that will end up being one of the Timeless Fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and when she is happy, I am happy.  Can&#x27;t find a better reason for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for Inner Grace, which was discontinued. My mother seemed to like it and even mentioned that it was similar to inner grace. It smelled like it has a stong alcohol when first sprayed, however then the flowery notes come out.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND PRICE WAS VERY GOOD. RECIEVED IT PRONTO.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> came a little late but it is in perfect condition upon arrival and smells awsome not too strong and not flowery light and pretty!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Smelling Fragrance &amp; I Love The Way It Smells On Me!! Received Product Within A Couple Of Days When Ordering &amp; I&#x27;m Very Satisfied With My Purchase.......Thanks</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in the price and 1oz bottle , was able to purchase a large bottle for cheaper then what I paid here</li>

            <li> I loved the smell of this perfume, i gave it as a gift for christmas. The price was also pretty low.</li>
            <li> Scent is very nice.  My wife got this as a gift, and had been eyeing it locally ever since but its well over $70.00 per bottle in town.  When she saw it on Amazon an over 50% off, she ended up buying it.  The first order was lost, but Amazon called us to let us know and reshipped the order.  Arrived and we were still skeptical that they were testers but sure enough, each was in its original packaging and they were not testers.  My wife loves the smell, its not overpowering but very light and is good to be used year round.</li>

            <li> Too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my sister. She loved it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great prices.</li>
            <li> If you like fresh, light,floral scents this is a keeper. I wear this daily..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Just one squirt will do for the whole day. I wish it was available at more locations rather than online</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying a fragrance before I smelled it. Once I got it and tried it on, I can honestly say it is simply lovely.  I use just a little spritz or spray it on a cotton ball and dab it on. I like the way it will leave a clean, subtle, feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume for every day. I really love this  perfume. I heard so much about it  for years that I have to order it. Really is LOVELY.</li>
