            <li>great item, great quality and awesome value, quick delivery and great packaging</li>
            <li>Product seems good.</li>
            <li>But this seems good like the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I use it on my body to soften up my skin before shaving and then wash with a moisturizing, good smelling soap after.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at softening up the skin, so it is effective.</li>
            <li>Good quality oil for making lotion for the winter.  </li>
            <li>Seems just as good.</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>I mix the Jojoba Oil with my Emu and Shea Butter, this is really good for my hair</li>
            <li>Good stuff and smells good.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it says it is good for Eczema, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Your skin absorbs it and it is good for your hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this oil... smells great and use it for hair and body.</li>
            <li>Lovely oil, great price point.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>love this jojoba oil - can&#x27;t stand winter-skin without it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>If something changes I&#x27;ll be sure to give an update!</li>
            <li>As a massage therapist who is concerned with the quality of products I use on my clients, and myself, I am thrilled to have found Dr. Adorable!</li>
            <li>and it work amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil because of the price and the many good reviews; however, I don&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve received is even jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it an hardky notice it now unless I search for the scent, and it does work nicely.</li>
            <li>nice to buy in bulk and save some money.  </li>
            <li>really nice quality of jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Dr Adorable&#x27;s products to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>Returned it, purchased Leven Rose (on Amazon) and give that 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own beauty products.</li>
            <li>It sprays nicely through my amber sprayer, though in a stream, not a mist.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS get consistent quality product and excellent customer service with Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands and feet beautiful and smooth :).  </li>
            <li>It feels great, has an earthy/natural mild smell.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good buy and fine product.</li>
            <li>Natural moisturizer and lubrication...works great!</li>
            <li>Amazing oil from Dr Adorable Inc.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, the box was full of baby ants!!</li>
            <li>I use a couple ounces per batch in my homemade soaps, and love how it affects the moisturizing properties of soap.  </li>
            <li>Do your homework, there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the bottle that the Jojoba Oil is supplied in.  </li>
            <li>The website (a yahoo storefront) that I found says it was certified organic by QAI but there was no company listing for Dr. Adorable on the QAI website.</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair &amp; scalp, makes my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li>Love my Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>The jojoba oil from Dr. Adorable states that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t say who&#x27;s it&#x27;s certified by.</li>
            <li>Love it for my scalp...fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying anything from Dr Adorable again.</li>
            <li>Dr Adorable is not a reliable company .</li>
            <li>I should have known better from the price.</li>
            <li>Dr adorable.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>love Jojoba anytime.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in my hair and I love it.</li>
            <li>I think this oil is okay.</li>
            <li>okay though...</li>
            <li>I ordered the Dr Adorable Inc. JoJoba oil, which I thought would be organic.  </li>
            <li>Love jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>Love jojoba.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying Jojoba oil from  Dr Adorable</li>
            <li>I love this jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I understand that Jojoba oil is likely one of the best moisturizers!  </li>
            <li>They must love seafood.</li>
            <li>So, I switched to Dr. Adorable and it works just as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more on the pricey side...</li>
            <li>Fantastic product...Thank you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for normal hair.</li>
            <li>A perfect \\&quot;dry oil.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this is a great product so far!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cheap but 100% quality :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that is completely natural.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good quality product.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and a good product.</li>

            <li>I like the oil just fine.  </li>
            <li>great oil... leaves hair full and skin silky soft</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Great for Essential Oil salves.</li>
            <li>Great oil for entire body.</li>
            <li>Light weight, not sticky.</li>
            <li>The value sure was worth it.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle was filled right to the brim</li>
            <li>I got a decent size bottle for a nice price.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth!  </li>
            <li>Use it to make my pure beard oils :)</li>
            <li>solid company good pruducts</li>
            <li>but it IS true Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li>Both products are superior and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t appear legit to me, so I returned the item for full refund.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve returned min for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The most reasonable priced jojoba oil I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Just like every other Dr. Adorable product I have bought to date, this is great, affordable and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>received quickly, product as described.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and this is really the most reasonably priced pure jojoba oil I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality of this oil so far!</li>
            <li>Not sure about a number of other reviewers, perhaps I was lucky, but the jojoba oil I bought had a nice neutral smell, looked nice, comes in a nice dark bottle (16oz), and worked just great in my soap making recipes.</li>
            <li>The stuff is pricey, but I believe it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>No I&#x27;m not crazy.</li>
            <li>It has a long shelf life, is not greasy feeling and is a very healthy product.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the oil smells</li>
            <li>and I make my hair soft and more manageable..</li>
            <li>makes my skin super smooth, and even toned which I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 100% pure golden organic jojoba oil and a tub of the avocado butter.</li>
            <li>while I havnt used many different brands I just didn&#x27;t resonate with this one when I opened it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a dark, sturdy bottle and the oil is nice and golden.  </li>
            <li>The first day I got it, I checked the smell.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have the smooth slip of other jojoba oils I&#x27;ve purchased, but works fine in a oil blend I make for hair and body.</li>
            <li>This oil is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful to use right after a shower when my skin is still damp (Years ago I was told by a dermatologist friend that moisturizers do no good on dry skin).</li>
            <li>is a constitution of pure unrefined organic jojoba).</li>
            <li>It was 100% pure Organic Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s pure.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone interested in high quality oils/butters.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily as apposed to waxy(which</li>
            <li>A MESS!&lt;br /&gt;The smell noted by others is there, though it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Feels like the real thing</li>
            <li>Thanks for protecting it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very affordable and needed.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>,I love eating  jojobas oil has a very different properties ,if you use on hair this will make your hair dark in colour and strong .prevents from falling.</li>
            <li>I was hoping I would have a better opinion of this product than other reviewers and I</li>
            <li>Lovely stuff, cheaper than other brand.</li>
            <li>It rolls off my fingers like silk and such a clean oil as well.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable and high quality oil.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an even better deal; less than $1 per oz...</li>
            <li>I will buy this particular brand again.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft!</li>
            <li>but the contents seem to be high quality</li>
            <li>High Grade High Quality.</li>
            <li>but here I got almost twice the amount for a little more than I paid there.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Rough skin is quite smooth when applied to the body.</li>
            <li>Yes, the glass bottle was clean and dry.</li>
            <li>It was a few dollars more</li>
            <li>It smells like normal jojoba oil</li>
            <li>Even if the other guy happens to be priced a little lower (not likely), it&#x27;s always worth it to spend the little bit more to ensure you get good product and service from this seller.</li>
            <li>Very early shipping.</li>
            <li>Ladies in India uses leaves paste on their hair once or twice a month for hair growth added with white lentil ,mixture of both makes hair strong and long</li>
            <li>It is clear that these need to have a different top other than the cap.</li>
            <li>But, it is worth every single penny</li>
            <li>To my chagrin after the 100% pure oil was poured in I could see white sediment in it.  </li>
            <li>The oil also sits on the skin for awhile while the other jojoba oil I have absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality jojoba oil - I would definitely recommend this (and have) to friends and family!</li>
            <li>It is clear sticky refined oil and doesn&#x27;t even feel like Jojoba.</li>
            <li>I bought this, took it out of the amber plastic bottle it comes in and put it in a clear glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses it for hair care says it make her hair feel soft and has restore the shine in her hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is really jojoba oil just a really low quality or</li>
            <li>I have used Jojoba in Skincare for nearly 30 years --</li>
            <li>The sebum matches the natural sebum</li>
            <li>Since using jojoba oil for nearly a year my skin has balanced the oil it makes.</li>
            <li>I also use this product on my natural African-american hair and in my homemade body butters.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d save and buy a larger bottle off of Amazon since I use so much of it for makeup remover and hair moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so far I think I like the product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and quite different from other, more expensive jojoba oils.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower with raw sugar as a sugar scrub; it is so moisturizing and light and did I mention it smells like honey?</li>
            <li>too much of it will leak down your neck and have you very oily.</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;d be able to tell a difference between good and bad quality of jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Works well for diy hair pomade and shaving cream as well as general moisturizing.</li>
            <li>we use it to dilute our young living essential oils and also alone as make up remover.</li>
            <li>The color is also a bit off (it&#x27;s a lighter of shade of yellow than the normal yellow).</li>
            <li>Would definitely order again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Super thick and made my skin break out everywhere.</li>
            <li>This product is the dark colored tall bottle to the left of the large white jug in the picture.</li>
            <li>in my experience, the more pure, the less it smells, but I could be wrong.</li>

            <li> Good price and great quality.</li>
            <li> great item, great quality and awesome value, quick delivery and great packaging</li>
            <li> Product seems good.</li>
            <li> But this seems good like the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I use it on my body to soften up my skin before shaving and then wash with a moisturizing, good smelling soap after.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at softening up the skin, so it is effective.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil for making lotion for the winter.  </li>
            <li> Seems just as good.</li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> I mix the Jojoba Oil with my Emu and Shea Butter, this is really good for my hair</li>
            <li> Good stuff and smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it says it is good for Eczema, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Your skin absorbs it and it is good for your hair as well.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this oil... smells great and use it for hair and body.</li>
            <li> Lovely oil, great price point.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> love this jojoba oil - can&#x27;t stand winter-skin without it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> If something changes I&#x27;ll be sure to give an update!</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist who is concerned with the quality of products I use on my clients, and myself, I am thrilled to have found Dr. Adorable!</li>
            <li> and it work amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because of the price and the many good reviews; however, I don&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve received is even jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it an hardky notice it now unless I search for the scent, and it does work nicely.</li>
            <li> nice to buy in bulk and save some money.  </li>
            <li> really nice quality of jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Dr Adorable&#x27;s products to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Returned it, purchased Leven Rose (on Amazon) and give that 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own beauty products.</li>
            <li> It sprays nicely through my amber sprayer, though in a stream, not a mist.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get consistent quality product and excellent customer service with Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands and feet beautiful and smooth :).  </li>
            <li> It feels great, has an earthy/natural mild smell.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good buy and fine product.</li>
            <li> Natural moisturizer and lubrication...works great!</li>
            <li> Amazing oil from Dr Adorable Inc.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, the box was full of baby ants!!</li>
            <li> I use a couple ounces per batch in my homemade soaps, and love how it affects the moisturizing properties of soap.  </li>
            <li> Do your homework, there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the bottle that the Jojoba Oil is supplied in.  </li>
            <li> The website (a yahoo storefront) that I found says it was certified organic by QAI but there was no company listing for Dr. Adorable on the QAI website.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair &amp; scalp, makes my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> Love my Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> The jojoba oil from Dr. Adorable states that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t say who&#x27;s it&#x27;s certified by.</li>
            <li> Love it for my scalp...fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying anything from Dr Adorable again.</li>
            <li> Dr Adorable is not a reliable company .</li>
            <li> I should have known better from the price.</li>
            <li> Dr adorable.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> So I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> love Jojoba anytime.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair and I love it.</li>
            <li> I think this oil is okay.</li>
            <li> okay though...</li>
            <li> I ordered the Dr Adorable Inc. JoJoba oil, which I thought would be organic.  </li>
            <li> Love jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> Love jojoba.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying Jojoba oil from  Dr Adorable</li>
            <li> I love this jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I understand that Jojoba oil is likely one of the best moisturizers!  </li>
            <li> They must love seafood.</li>
            <li> So, I switched to Dr. Adorable and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more on the pricey side...</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for normal hair.</li>
            <li> A perfect \\&quot;dry oil.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is a great product so far!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cheap but 100% quality :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that is completely natural.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good quality product.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and a good product.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, and smells nice!</li>
            <li> I like the oil just fine.  </li>
            <li> great oil... leaves hair full and skin silky soft</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Great for Essential Oil salves.</li>
            <li> Great oil for entire body.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not sticky.</li>
            <li> The value sure was worth it.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle was filled right to the brim</li>
            <li> I got a decent size bottle for a nice price.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth!  </li>
            <li> Use it to make my pure beard oils :)</li>
            <li> solid company good pruducts</li>
            <li> but it IS true Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> Both products are superior and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t appear legit to me, so I returned the item for full refund.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve returned min for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The most reasonable priced jojoba oil I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Just like every other Dr. Adorable product I have bought to date, this is great, affordable and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> received quickly, product as described.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and this is really the most reasonably priced pure jojoba oil I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> Love the quality of this oil so far!</li>
            <li> Not sure about a number of other reviewers, perhaps I was lucky, but the jojoba oil I bought had a nice neutral smell, looked nice, comes in a nice dark bottle (16oz), and worked just great in my soap making recipes.</li>
            <li> The stuff is pricey, but I believe it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> No I&#x27;m not crazy.</li>
            <li> It has a long shelf life, is not greasy feeling and is a very healthy product.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the oil smells</li>
            <li> and I make my hair soft and more manageable..</li>
            <li> makes my skin super smooth, and even toned which I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100% pure golden organic jojoba oil and a tub of the avocado butter.</li>
            <li> while I havnt used many different brands I just didn&#x27;t resonate with this one when I opened it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark, sturdy bottle and the oil is nice and golden.  </li>
            <li> The first day I got it, I checked the smell.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the smooth slip of other jojoba oils I&#x27;ve purchased, but works fine in a oil blend I make for hair and body.</li>
            <li> This oil is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful to use right after a shower when my skin is still damp (Years ago I was told by a dermatologist friend that moisturizers do no good on dry skin).</li>
            <li> is a constitution of pure unrefined organic jojoba).</li>
            <li> It was 100% pure Organic Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s pure.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone interested in high quality oils/butters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily as apposed to waxy(which</li>
            <li> A MESS!&lt;br /&gt;The smell noted by others is there, though it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Feels like the real thing</li>
            <li> Thanks for protecting it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very affordable and needed.</li>
            <li> Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> ,I love eating  jojobas oil has a very different properties ,if you use on hair this will make your hair dark in colour and strong .prevents from falling.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would have a better opinion of this product than other reviewers and I</li>
            <li> Lovely stuff, cheaper than other brand.</li>
            <li> It rolls off my fingers like silk and such a clean oil as well.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable and high quality oil.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an even better deal; less than $1 per oz...</li>
            <li> I will buy this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft!</li>
            <li> but the contents seem to be high quality</li>
            <li> High Grade High Quality.</li>
            <li> but here I got almost twice the amount for a little more than I paid there.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> Rough skin is quite smooth when applied to the body.</li>
            <li> Yes, the glass bottle was clean and dry.</li>
            <li> It was a few dollars more</li>
            <li> It smells like normal jojoba oil</li>
            <li> Even if the other guy happens to be priced a little lower (not likely), it&#x27;s always worth it to spend the little bit more to ensure you get good product and service from this seller.</li>
            <li> Very early shipping.</li>
            <li> Ladies in India uses leaves paste on their hair once or twice a month for hair growth added with white lentil ,mixture of both makes hair strong and long</li>
            <li> It is clear that these need to have a different top other than the cap.</li>
            <li> But, it is worth every single penny</li>
            <li> To my chagrin after the 100% pure oil was poured in I could see white sediment in it.  </li>
            <li> The oil also sits on the skin for awhile while the other jojoba oil I have absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality jojoba oil - I would definitely recommend this (and have) to friends and family!</li>
            <li> It is clear sticky refined oil and doesn&#x27;t even feel like Jojoba.</li>
            <li> I bought this, took it out of the amber plastic bottle it comes in and put it in a clear glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it for hair care says it make her hair feel soft and has restore the shine in her hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is really jojoba oil just a really low quality or</li>
            <li> I have used Jojoba in Skincare for nearly 30 years --</li>
            <li> The sebum matches the natural sebum</li>
            <li> Since using jojoba oil for nearly a year my skin has balanced the oil it makes.</li>
            <li> I also use this product on my natural African-american hair and in my homemade body butters.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d save and buy a larger bottle off of Amazon since I use so much of it for makeup remover and hair moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so far I think I like the product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and quite different from other, more expensive jojoba oils.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower with raw sugar as a sugar scrub; it is so moisturizing and light and did I mention it smells like honey?</li>
            <li> too much of it will leak down your neck and have you very oily.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d be able to tell a difference between good and bad quality of jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Works well for diy hair pomade and shaving cream as well as general moisturizing.</li>
            <li> we use it to dilute our young living essential oils and also alone as make up remover.</li>
            <li> The color is also a bit off (it&#x27;s a lighter of shade of yellow than the normal yellow).</li>
            <li> Would definitely order again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Super thick and made my skin break out everywhere.</li>
            <li> This product is the dark colored tall bottle to the left of the large white jug in the picture.</li>
            <li> in my experience, the more pure, the less it smells, but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a bad or rancid smell, but it&#x27;s definitely not a pleasant one either.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry skin moisturized (soothes eczema) and a few drops in my hair makes my hair feel so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I concur with several other reviewers, that having tried Jojoba oil from a variety of other sellers, i haven&#x27;t encountered the dense, noxious odor of this supplier, and while i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rancid, it&#x27;s a disappointment and a difference from other varieties, and the cost difference for clean and clear scent elsewhere is worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the NOW brand, but can only get it in a 4 ounce bottle, which is too small.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look professional enough to convince me it&#x27;s made by anyone but an amateur (maybe at-home) &amp;#34;company.&amp;#34;  The ad here on Amazon says it is certified organic, but it doesn&#x27;t have any official label on the bottle, nor does it say who certified it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. .</li>
            <li> perhaps it&#x27;s jojoba oil mixed with some other oil.</li>
            <li> A decent sized Jojoba oil is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I use it to take my make off and to moisturize dry zones on my body.  </li>
            <li> so I looked carefully at the 1st one, which was almost empty, and it, too, had white sediment on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It came in a plastic bag thank God because the cap was loose and it did leak a bit.</li>
            <li> We are regular users of jojoba oil in my household due to skin issues and I decided to give this one a chance since it was cheaper than $32!  </li>
            <li> I have used and it definitely had an odd smell.  </li>
            <li> Only problem was a little leaked out on its way to me.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I paid a minimal amount</li>
            <li> This is NOT Pure Jojoba Oil received.</li>
            <li> A little goes s long way that way too.</li>
            <li> Not recognizable at all.</li>
            <li> other uses have said, no organic certification on the bottle</li>
            <li> Not exactly a facility that can manufacture oils in bulk.</li>
            <li> It feels heavier or thicker than the other brans of Jojoba oil</li>
            <li> This is about 50% cheaper across the board than all the other legit organic jojoba oils for a reason...</li>
            <li> However, if this product was truly like the other jojoba oil I have used</li>
            <li> I have made other purchases from this company and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Extremely dis-satisfied and will be filing for a CHARGEBACK with my credit card company.</li>
            <li> Not like other jojoba oils that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased small containers from Amazon to separate the oil and add my essential oils, but nothing can hide that smell.  </li>
            <li> This could be castor oil or some other vegetable oil</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for my skin under my other skin creams.</li>
            <li> I am constantly buying small bottles and that becomes costly.  </li>
            <li> but it does not soak into my face and hair like the small bottles that I have purchased locally.  </li>
            <li> so maybe other users got a rancid product.  </li>
            <li> This oil smells very off (NOT PLEASANT!)</li>
            <li> The packaging and quality of this jojoba oil did not meet my expectations, it carries a peppery oder..which seemed odd.</li>
            <li> I used to have oily skin with a few dry spots.</li>
            <li> You see all these big bottles and they send you a small little 8 ounces.</li>
            <li> This in NOT golden unrefined jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> It also smells slightly rancid.</li>
            <li> The lid was not ine tight so there was some keaking in the box.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it in my hands with a little lotion before I use it on my body.  </li>
            <li> Just a little though.</li>
            <li> Smells a little...</li>
            <li> and I already had a little pump bottle that I could pour it into.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday, for everything.</li>
            <li> you just need a few drops.  </li>
            <li> I have been using different brands of jojoba oil for years and have not ever had an oil this poor in quality.</li>
            <li> I think it has a little bit of a nutty smell but it does not bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> The website also says that everything is processed in house to control quality, but according the address image on Google Maps, it&#x27;s just that - a small house in a neighborhood.</li>
            <li> I usually always get NOW brand but decided to get this because the price...just seems off, the color, consistency, etc.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I refill my small bottles.  </li>
            <li> It is not authentic jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> This product is really shady.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for jojoba and brought one tree from sunday market for 75 dollars but that ree shed leaves and no more leaves in it</li>
            <li> The price was hard to beat, but now I know why it&#x27;s cheaper than competitors.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using it and replaced it with a different organic cold pressed jojoba my skin cleared up within days.  </li>
            <li> Its thick</li>
            <li> Oh, I didn&#x27;t mention the smell of the original purchase--it was awful.  </li>
            <li> The name seems to be a little silly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use this seemingly unknown oil on my skin or in my soaps.  </li>
            <li> It is thin, but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> You know the smell in an alley behind a greasy spoon where they put the used fryer oil?  </li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant scent that I have not experienced with jojoba oil products purchased previously from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> after a few months, noticed a bad smell and through out the remainder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid to use it!</li>
            <li> i think the negative reviewers maybe got a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying to return it, but if unable, I have no idea what to do with it.  </li>
            <li> This is worse!</li>
            <li> for  my callused, uncomfortable  and unsightly elbows.</li>
            <li> ugh this had the worst fishy smell and it wasn&#x27;t sealed properly.</li>
            <li> I am angry at myself because you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I was all around disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made perfume, use it for my hair, on my skin instead of lotion, as a moisturizer for my face, for make up removal, and I made my boyfriend a beard oil blend using this as a base.</li>
            <li> smells like crap.</li>
            <li> The product did not have a USDA organic label on the bottle and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one is so nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. I use this to make homemade body butter and salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!  Perfect!  Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Great Product from a Grat Company!</li>
            <li> solid company good pruducts</li>
            <li> I wish amazon offered larger quantities available.(i.e. quarts.)</li>
            <li> I use a couple ounces per batch in my homemade soaps, and love how it affects the moisturizing properties of soap.  The stuff is pricey, but I believe it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> The protection label was not intact!! and the white seal under the cap seemed as if it was tampered with! I&#x27;m a little afraid to use it!</li>
            <li> Some say it smells. I think it has a little bit of a nutty smell but it does not bother me in the least. Not recognizable at all. The oil is great and I use it on my skin every day.</li>
            <li> Looks like jojoba oil, smells like jojoba oil, feels like jojoba oil. i think the negative reviewers maybe got a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> The packaging and quality of this jojoba oil did not meet my expectations, it carries a peppery oder..which seemed odd. while I havnt used many different brands I just didn&#x27;t resonate with this one when I opened it. It&#x27;s very oily as apposed to waxy(which is a constitution of pure unrefined organic jojoba). Do your homework, there&#x27;s better out there. This one feels like I&#x27;m using vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the bottle that the Jojoba Oil is supplied in.  It was a few dollars more than I would have like to pay but it IS true Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> Flustered with this product beyond all end! I waited to do this review to give myself time to get acclimated with the product. It is clear that these need to have a different top other than the cap. WHAT A MESS!&lt;br /&gt;The smell noted by others is there, though it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic ziplok-type bag and somehow leaked into the plastic and still got oil all over the place.</li>
            <li> Great amount although it was escaping from  the bottle.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist who is concerned with the quality of products I use on my clients, and myself, I am thrilled to have found Dr. Adorable! I ordered the 100% pure golden organic jojoba oil and a tub of the avocado butter. Both products are superior and I will definitely be ordering again. I recommend this product to anyone interested in high quality oils/butters.</li>
            <li> after a few months, noticed a bad smell and through out the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;As other uses have said, no organic certification on the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li> I use this for shampoo. It&#x27;s great for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I suspect the claims this company makes are fraudulent. The website (a yahoo storefront) that I found says it was certified organic by QAI but there was no company listing for Dr. Adorable on the QAI website. The website also says that everything is processed in house to control quality, but according the address image on Google Maps, it&#x27;s just that - a small house in a neighborhood. Not exactly a facility that can manufacture oils in bulk. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like jojoba oil. Didn&#x27;t appear legit to me, so I returned the item for full refund.</li>
            <li> Great deal, best I&#x27;ve found out there. Product seems good. Not sure I&#x27;d be able to tell a difference between good and bad quality of jojoba oil. But this seems good like the others I&#x27;ve used. I put it in my hair &amp; scalp, makes my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> Quality oil at a great price. I&#x27;ll be reordering soon! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure about a number of other reviewers, perhaps I was lucky, but the jojoba oil I bought had a nice neutral smell, looked nice, comes in a nice dark bottle (16oz), and worked just great in my soap making recipes. I think it&#x27;s a good buy and fine product.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and quite different from other, more expensive jojoba oils. It&#x27;s not exactly a bad or rancid smell, but it&#x27;s definitely not a pleasant one either. Because of this, I use it on my body to soften up my skin before shaving and then wash with a moisturizing, good smelling soap after. It does a great job at softening up the skin, so it is effective. However, I will NOT use this product on my face. I have purchased another, lighter smelling jojoba oil for this purpose. Once this runs out, I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing it. Depends on whether or not I get used to the smell. I doubt I will.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil for making lotion for the winter.  Package arrived without any problem.</li>
            <li> Great for Essential Oil salves.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it for hair care says it make her hair feel soft and has restore the shine in her hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would have a better opinion of this product than other reviewers and I gave it a chance but in the end I just don&#x27;t like it.  It feels heavier or thicker than the other brans of Jojoba oil I have used and it definitely had an odd smell.  To me it smells like peanut butter, which makes me wonder if it&#x27;s peanut oil?!  I wanted to return it but missed the deadline.</li>
            <li> Love my Jojoba oil. I use this everyday, for everything. I&#x27;ve made perfume, use it for my hair, on my skin instead of lotion, as a moisturizer for my face, for make up removal, and I made my boyfriend a beard oil blend using this as a base. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount the bottle brings. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Lovely stuff, cheaper than other brand. Seems just as good.</li>
            <li> It is thin, but moisturizing. I like to mix it in my hands with a little lotion before I use it on my body.  It makes your skin feel and look dewy. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is about 50% cheaper across the board than all the other legit organic jojoba oils for a reason...wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I usually always get NOW brand but decided to get this because the price...just seems off, the color, consistency, etc.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. Great product.</li>
            <li> The jojoba oil from Dr. Adorable states that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t say who&#x27;s it&#x27;s certified by. Is it USDA organic or certified by OTCO? However, if this product was truly like the other jojoba oil I have used I wouldn&#x27;t have returned it. The price was hard to beat, but now I know why it&#x27;s cheaper than competitors. This oil smells very off (NOT PLEASANT!), it&#x27;s not a nutty smell I&#x27;m used to. The oil also sits on the skin for awhile while the other jojoba oil I have absorbs fairly quickly. The color is also a bit off (it&#x27;s a lighter of shade of yellow than the normal yellow). Perhaps it is really jojoba oil just a really low quality or perhaps it&#x27;s jojoba oil mixed with some other oil. We&#x27;ll never know.  Do your research on the company before and think twice before buying it!</li>
            <li> Just like every other Dr. Adorable product I have bought to date, this is great, affordable and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product great size great price</li>
            <li> Love it for my scalp...fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product at a amazing price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because of the price and the many good reviews; however, I don&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve received is even jojoba oil.  It doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like jojoba and the packaging doesn&#x27;t look professional enough to convince me it&#x27;s made by anyone but an amateur (maybe at-home) &amp;#34;company.&amp;#34;  The ad here on Amazon says it is certified organic, but it doesn&#x27;t have any official label on the bottle, nor does it say who certified it.  I&#x27;m afraid to use this seemingly unknown oil on my skin or in my soaps.  I&#x27;ll be trying to return it, but if unable, I have no idea what to do with it.  I won&#x27;t be buying anything from Dr Adorable again.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful oil! I have made other purchases from this company and will continue to do so. Very good quality and fair prices. They offer a great spread of products!</li>
            <li> Oil was contaminated but would not let me return it. It smelled rotten . Dr Adorable is not a reliable company .</li>
            <li> The lid was not ine tight so there was some keaking in the box. But good quality  for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> I have used Jojoba in Skincare for nearly 30 years -- This is NOT Pure Jojoba Oil received. I should have known better from the price. It smells, looks and has the texture, smell and light-coloredness of blended Safflower and Sesame Oil with, perhaps, some jojoba oil. Came in leaking as well (pictures can be provided). Extremely dis-satisfied and will be filing for a CHARGEBACK with my credit card company.</li>
            <li> The title description is misleading. You see all these big bottles and they send you a small little 8 ounces. Very overpriced for just a few ounces.</li>
            <li> It was 100% pure Organic Jojoba Oil no filler and I would definitely purchase this item again. I received what I ordered.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product. Great pricing and great oil.</li>
            <li> Dr adorable. ......amazing products!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good quality product.  Will come back again when my current supply runs low.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for what we needed.  Moisterizes hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> great item, great quality and awesome value, quick delivery and great packaging</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! This in NOT golden unrefined jojoba oil. It is clear sticky refined oil and doesn&#x27;t even feel like Jojoba. I&#x27;m guessing this is a fraudulent company and I&#x27;ve returned min for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and just as described I will be buying again thank you</li>
            <li> after reading some of the comment about it not beeing organic I have panic and tested it, (since I am applying it on my face and body) I poured some to a glass and left it open for a week, nothing grow on it!!  :) So I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great and awesome price!</li>
            <li> Works great, but the smell is off-putting... Not like other jojoba oils that I have tried.  So I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like and the previous ones I have used were off, or if it&#x27;s this particular brand. Either way, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it an hardky notice it now unless I search for the scent, and it does work nicely.</li>
            <li> A decent sized Jojoba oil is hard to find. I use Jojoba oil alone and as a carrier oil for essential oils. This is a quality product and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> i use it in a spray mixed with water. too much of it will leak down your neck and have you very oily. my hair seems stronger and has grown a bit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very early shipping. Only problem was a little leaked out on its way to me. Just a little though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Use it to make my pure beard oils :)</li>
            <li> love Jojoba anytime. good price. 2nd purchase</li>
            <li> Keeps my roots moisturized</li>
            <li> I rate this product with 3 stars because it meets the basic requirements of moisturizing skin and scalp.  It has an unpleasant scent that I have not experienced with jojoba oil products purchased previously from Amazon.  I also purchased small containers from Amazon to separate the oil and add my essential oils, but nothing can hide that smell.  I just didn&#x27;t want to bother with the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. I&#x27;ve used Jojoba oil is for my skin as a moisturizer after the shower for a couple years and this brand combines quality and affordability.</li>
            <li> The name seems to be a little silly but the contents seem to be high quality so that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair and I love it. Its thick and it is a great sealant for moisture. It is a bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li> I think this oil is okay. Smells a little...in my experience, the more pure, the less it smells, but I could be wrong. I worry that it might be rancid or that the plastic packaging might have some effect on it. My skin seems to like it okay though...not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again. Maybe.</li>
            <li> This could be castor oil or some other vegetable oil but it is NOT Jojoba Oil. It doesn&#x27;t smell like Jojoba Oil, it doesn&#x27;t look like Jojoba Oil and it doesn&#x27;t feel like Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> Feels like the real thing</li>
            <li> I mix the Jojoba Oil with my Emu and Shea Butter, this is really good for my hair</li>
            <li> Love it!! Soft, smooth, and smells nice!</li>
            <li> I like the oil just fine.  It came in a plastic bag thank God because the cap was loose and it did leak a bit.</li>
            <li> You know the smell in an alley behind a greasy spoon where they put the used fryer oil?  This is worse!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for my skin under my other skin creams. I use it on the rest of my body and even my hair. I love this stuff and this is really the most reasonably priced pure jojoba oil I&#x27;ve seen.  Lasts a long time. . you just need a few drops.  It keeps my dry skin moisturized (soothes eczema) and a few drops in my hair makes my hair feel so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I got a decent size bottle for a nice price. It shipped within the time frame it estimated. Very nice feel to the jojoba oil on my hair. Will purchase again. I mix it with extra Virginia olive oil and it blends well. Saves on the usage of the jojoba which is more expensive. 👍</li>
            <li> Just used this to help make a pommade for our all-natural hair.  Good stuff and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful to use right after a shower when my skin is still damp (Years ago I was told by a dermatologist friend that moisturizers do no good on dry skin). A little goes s long way that way too.</li>
            <li> Combined with Fractionated Coconut oil and it work amazing. Would definitely order again in the near future. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Dr Adorable Inc. JoJoba oil, which I thought would be organic.  The product did not have a USDA organic label on the bottle and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product! It is the best that I have tried yet, and it isnt scented so you can add your own scent to it! This oil is majical and has given me the softest skin ever!</li>
            <li> nice to buy in bulk and save some money.  I refill my small bottles.  Love jojoba oil.  I use in on my face w/ my lotion and apply it to my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and high quality oil. Happy to have found it</li>
            <li> I love this oil... smells great and use it for hair and body.</li>
            <li> Best price I have found. Great product. Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Love jojoba. This is a good product, nicely packaged. I rub this all over my body and in my hair from time to time. It feels great, has an earthy/natural mild smell.This product is the dark colored tall bottle to the left of the large white jug in the picture.</li>
            <li> I use this to take makeup off and as a nightime moisturizer and I already had a little pump bottle that I could pour it into.  It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Cheap but 100% quality :)</li>
            <li> Very good. Rough skin is quite smooth when applied to the body.</li>
            <li> The most reasonable priced jojoba oil I&#x27;ve found. Works well in all my body products.</li>
            <li> Works well with the addition of essential oils in my recipe for hair care.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. doesn&#x27;t have the smooth slip of other jojoba oils I&#x27;ve purchased, but works fine in a oil blend I make for hair and body.</li>
            <li> Excellent Jojoba Oil. High Grade High Quality. Trusted Brand</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and a good product. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it says it is good for Eczema, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I concur with several other reviewers, that having tried Jojoba oil from a variety of other sellers, i haven&#x27;t encountered the dense, noxious odor of this supplier, and while i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rancid, it&#x27;s a disappointment and a difference from other varieties, and the cost difference for clean and clear scent elsewhere is worth it.</li>
            <li> Super thick and made my skin break out everywhere. As soon as I stopped using it and replaced it with a different organic cold pressed jojoba my skin cleared up within days.  Beware!!</li>
            <li> Put it on my face before I shave, and once a week in my hair. Great for a buffer between your razor and your face! Leaves your hair shiny after washing it!</li>
            <li> Thanks for protecting it.</li>
            <li> smells like Condom Lubricant ! I will not be buying Jojoba oil from  Dr Adorable</li>
            <li> love this jojoba oil - can&#x27;t stand winter-skin without it!</li>
            <li> This is the best deal I have found on Jojoba Oil.  Trader Joe&#x27;s sells a 4 oz bottle for $7.99. ($2 per oz) We use this for a massage oil, add drops of scent, and heat it.  It&#x27;s a great product that is completely natural.  Your skin absorbs it and it is good for your hair as well.  I just ordered a 32oz container of this...That&#x27;s an even better deal; less than $1 per oz...</li>
            <li> really nice quality of jojoba oil. Thanks</li>
            <li> received quickly, product as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Dr Adorable&#x27;s products to be of good quality. I love this jojoba oil. I use it daily as a facial moisturizer. No I&#x27;m not crazy. The sebum matches the natural sebum our face makes- thus it doesn&#x27;t make your face oily. It took 3-5 days for my skin to adjust. I used to have oily skin with a few dry spots. Since using jojoba oil for nearly a year my skin has balanced the oil it makes. My skin glows. I also use this product on my natural African-american hair and in my homemade body butters.</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil in a lot of my homemade cosmetics and I love it.  It has a long shelf life, is not greasy feeling and is a very healthy product.</li>
            <li> I bought this, took it out of the amber plastic bottle it comes in and put it in a clear glass bottle.  Yes, the glass bottle was clean and dry. To my chagrin after the 100% pure oil was poured in I could see white sediment in it.  This was my 2nd bottle so I looked carefully at the 1st one, which was almost empty, and it, too, had white sediment on the bottom.  I emailed the company and got no response.  Returned it, purchased Leven Rose (on Amazon) and give that 5 stars.  What a difference in smell and appearance.  Oh, I didn&#x27;t mention the smell of the original purchase--it was awful.  Not a fan.  Leven Rose is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have tried lanolin oil, Vitamin E oil, Argan oil, etc. for  my callused, uncomfortable  and unsightly elbows. This is the best product I have found for this problem area.</li>
            <li> Good price and great quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value. I was purchasing previously as a local health food store, paying twice the amount per ounce. This oil is just as good, if not better. Arrived quickly. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality jojoba oil - I would definitely recommend this (and have) to friends and family!</li>
            <li> ugh this had the worst fishy smell and it wasn&#x27;t sealed properly.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this oil so far!</li>
            <li> This big bottle of Jojoba Oil is a god send. I make a lot of my own beauty products. I am constantly buying small bottles and that becomes costly.  Having a big bottle on hand all the time saves time &amp; money.  It is a great product in and of itself.  I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Works on my work dish pan hands</li>
            <li> I love this oil. we use it to dilute our young living essential oils and also alone as make up remover. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I understand that Jojoba oil is likely one of the best moisturizers!  It sprays nicely through my amber sprayer, though in a stream, not a mist.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and needed. Great oil for entire body.</li>
            <li> Bottle was leaking in packaging.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not sticky. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product smells like FISH! Not like jojoba oil and the bottle had NO LABEL on it!!! When it arrived, the box was full of baby ants!! They must love seafood.</li>
            <li> The jojoba oil is very nice.  Its in a darker bottle to keep longer as well.  I will buy this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but I really like it.  It comes in a dark, sturdy bottle and the oil is nice and golden.  I normally buy the NOW brand, but can only get it in a 4 ounce bottle, which is too small.  So, I switched to Dr. Adorable and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Good quality, and excellent value. Works well for diy hair pomade and shaving cream as well as general moisturizing. A perfect \\&quot;dry oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product thank you.</li>
            <li> A quality product, great value</li>
            <li> Great product, price and delivery.</li>
            <li> Lovely oil, great price point.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this with some of my essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks you</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  It is not authentic jojoba oil.  Perhaps a blend but it does not soak into my face and hair like the small bottles that I have purchased locally.  I thought I&#x27;d save and buy a larger bottle off of Amazon since I use so much of it for makeup remover and hair moisturizer.  it will remove makeup but then so does vegetable oil.  I am angry at myself because you get what you pay for.  I paid a minimal amount and I got a subpar product. It also smells slightly rancid.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Not crazy about the oil smells but when you purchase oils, hey, they smell like oils.  The smell will eventually dissipate with time and I&#x27;ll eventually get used to it.  Does not smell like olive oil, I use olive oil all of the time and it is a very different smell.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s pure.  It works great as an additive or alone.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Great product. Great price. I will be a repeat customer. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff! I use it for everything!</li>
            <li> smells like crap. I prefer the Now or acne.org Jojoba. This one is so nasty.</li>
            <li> so far I think I like the product.  The value sure was worth it.</li>
            <li> I was all around disappointed in the product. I plastic lid was cracked upon arrival and oil had leaked into the bag it was in. The oil smells rancid and the smell stays on your skin and clothes. I have been using different brands of jojoba oil for years and have not ever had an oil this poor in quality. My infant son kicked the bottle over on the carpet (with the broken lid on) and the oil spilled and soaked into the light colored carpet and now the room has the same smell. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Using for hair care and I make my hair soft and more manageable..</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get consistent quality product and excellent customer service with Dr. Adorable. Even if the other guy happens to be priced a little lower (not likely), it&#x27;s always worth it to spend the little bit more to ensure you get good product and service from this seller. Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> This product is really shady. When I received my bottle is was perfectly sealed with no leaking; however, the bottle had no labels of certification that it was organic nor did it have a label that included the ingredients of the product. Any company who doesn&#x27;t include the ingredients has something to hide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing my oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s before but here I got almost twice the amount for a little more than I paid there.  Love it.</li>
            <li> great oil... leaves hair full and skin silky soft</li>
            <li> awesome packaging and oil, love it!</li>
            <li> Smells like HONEY! I use it in the shower with raw sugar as a sugar scrub; it is so moisturizing and light and did I mention it smells like honey? I love it.</li>
            <li> best moisturizer ever</li>
            <li> great value I use it for massage and for spray with aromatherapy oils in it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Natural moisturizer and lubrication...works great!</li>
            <li> Product had leaked into the bag</li>
            <li> one of the demanding oil.I have been searching for jojoba and brought one tree from sunday market for 75 dollars but that ree shed leaves and no more leaves in it ,I love eating  jojobas oil has a very different properties ,if you use on hair this will make your hair dark in colour and strong .prevents from falling.Ladies in India uses leaves paste on their hair once or twice a month for hair growth added with white lentil ,mixture of both makes hair strong and long</li>
            <li> Amazing oil from Dr Adorable Inc.  Wow!! makes my skin super smooth, and even toned which I was surprised.  It rolls off my fingers like silk and such a clean oil as well.  I have heard a lot about this oil and have doubted the hype. It&#x27;s also more on the pricey side... But, it is worth every single penny and I will buy from this company again.  I use it to take my make off and to moisturize dry zones on my body.  I do put it on my face and neck with an anti aging essential oil blend that I made.  It makes my hands and feet beautiful and smooth :).  I&#x27;m one happy lady !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Dr Adorable Inc!! Fantastic product...Thank you!</li>
            <li> No fish smell with my oil!  I love that the bottle was filled right to the brim so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth!  We are regular users of jojoba oil in my household due to skin issues and I decided to give this one a chance since it was cheaper than $32!  I had ran out so my skin had been suffering without!  The first day I got it, I checked the smell.  It smells like normal jojoba oil so maybe other users got a rancid product.  I put some on my damp hands after washing and immediately felt a difference!  Then I used on my face and body after my shower!!! All I can say is that this is a great product so far! If something changes I&#x27;ll be sure to give an update!</li>
