            <li>It&#x27;s more watery than I&#x27;m used to and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend standing the tube up on the cap side for storage.</li>
            <li>I am on my second tube of Sumigaki toothpaste, and I think it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>love it...have ordered more...</li>

            <li>Taste is nice &amp; very fresh.</li>
            <li>Even right after you eat , it goes good with what u ate</li>
            <li>I know from many years my grandmothers use charcol to clean teeth no tootpaste this time,she said very good clean teeth,keep breath fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly abrasive either, which my enamel is happy about too.</li>
            <li>Love its sweet fragrant flavor too.</li>
            <li>#34;hey, this actually tastes kind of nice&amp;#34;, I think it tastes like rose or lavender water.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It does make your breath very fresh.</li>
            <li>love this product, my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>

            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I like how refreshed and clean my mouth feels after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It tasted funny when i first started using it, but since I&#x27;m used to the flavor now, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a cool product</li>
            <li>Its not unpleasant...</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is black, and tastes great.</li>
            <li>and i like the fresh feel after</li>
            <li>THis stuff definitely makes my teeth smooth, I am not so sure about whitening</li>
            <li>Tastes surprisingly good; mouth feels fresh, teeth come out sparkling white; I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>natural tooth pastes which are listed many in Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are a bit whiter but the one thing my wife has noticed is how fresh my breath is since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>4.2 oz doesn&#x27;t go very far if you brush your teeth twice a day, even with free shipping</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite Japanese toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I noticed results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be certainly getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>My husband that has a sharp sense of smell could not detect my Kimchi breath and we had a nice night.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t rely on FDA too much since many approved drugs have caused harmful side effects include hospitalizations and deaths even when properly prescribed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great new item, have noticed a small improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly,this is an another commercial toothpaste with overwhelmingly strong after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth and tongue very well.</li>
            <li>Bubbles up, but not too much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need a lot for it to work well</li>
            <li>The flavor is different, sort of a berry/menthol thing going on, which I found I enjoy despite being a hardcore peppermint fan.</li>
            <li>Free shipping on international order.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I only use it a couple of times a week, as it is very powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very intense minty flavor and you can definitely taste the charcoal, which a lot of people who&#x27;ve tried it do not like, but I like that it is not as sweet as most American toothpastes, and the novelty of it being black is fun too.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste is black in color for sure and the taste is not what the US market is used to.  </li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on whether my teeth have become whiter, but I&#x27;m quietly confident.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend that used to live in Japan.</li>
            <li>I got this toothpaste for the first time in 2011 when I was living in Japan and have been looking for it in the US ever since the tube I brought back to the US with me ran out.</li>
            <li>The only reason I would not give it a full five stars is I feel for the price the tube should be bigger.</li>
            <li>(cap facing up, not down); the taste is not bad, just different to traditional toothpaste; it foams well.</li>
            <li>I just started using it so it is too early to say if will whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>My spouse, on the other hand, is more unnerved by the dark grey colour of the toothpaste, haha!  </li>
            <li>It leaves a fresher taste than the others and the black color comes from charcoal but it tases minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Only downfall is that it makes a bit of a mess in the sink but worth the clean-up and no worse than hardened white toothpaste!</li>
            <li>it was already opened and only half full.</li>
            <li>WOW , his usually yellow teeth were visibly whiter , I was stunned!</li>
            <li>little more watery than Im use to and thus can make a mess if your not careful.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t use as much as you would with conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>(firm consistency enough to stay well put on the toothbrush, no mess), and don&#x27;t stain absolutely anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews, a few important things to note are: the consistency is runnier than traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li>I really like what little is there.</li>

            <li> Like some of the other reviews, a few important things to note are: the consistency is runnier than traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li> I really like what little is there.</li>
            <li> The paste is black and your mouth becomes black but the squeaky cleanness gives a big smile.</li>
            <li> I had good results with Tom&#x27;s combined with activated charcoal, but the mess can be inconvenient at times.  </li>
            <li> am using diatomaceous earth very often lately.</li>
            <li> the charcoal takes care of breath for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;SLS has been proposed to increase the frequency of mouth ulcers in some people, as it can dry out the protective layer of oral tissues, causing the underlying tissues to become damaged&amp;#34; (Wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you are going back to conventional toothpaste like me, the sweetness can take time getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Cons: 1) I&#x27;ve only been using it for less than a week, so I&#x27;m not sure about the whitening part.</li>
            <li> toothpaste and foam are not as dark as you would expect.</li>
            <li> Also leaves a dark residue on the head of a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My Husband took one look at this black toothpaste and said &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not using that s_ _t&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> quite expensive, tastes like Lychee, doesn&#x27;t last long, and is nothing like black powdered toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I feel like my teeth are already a little whiter.</li>
            <li> Product is a bit small</li>
            <li> but it does seem to get the excess hard to get tarter off...</li>
            <li> me pick a common ingredient,&amp;#34;sodium laureth sulfate&amp;#34;(SLS)</li>
            <li> If Amazon mandates listing the ingredients, buyer would have less risk of buying wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I rank this 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 for the convenience of not dealing with a powdery charcoal mess.  </li>
            <li> and I have bought EVERY whitening toothpaste out there ,even that expensive one on the t.v. shopping channel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m legally blind in one eye</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth well and gets rid of bad onion breath without blinking an eye.</li>
            <li> but I hate my bad-breath after.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible per se; i just don&#x27;t know what it is supposed to taste like.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Big hit as a stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste for the first time in 2011 when I was living in Japan and have been looking for it in the US ever since the tube I brought back to the US with me ran out. It&#x27;s got a very intense minty flavor and you can definitely taste the charcoal, which a lot of people who&#x27;ve tried it do not like, but I like that it is not as sweet as most American toothpastes, and the novelty of it being black is fun too.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;2 uses. Deff whiter. Teeth feel smoother and have a polish to them. A little goes a long way. Smells great (grape bubblegum ish) taste is tollerable. Its not unpleasant...just different.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little more watery than Im use to and thus can make a mess if your not careful. And i suggest if you have a white sink...wipe any spilled immedietly</li>
            <li> It tasted funny when i first started using it, but since I&#x27;m used to the flavor now, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! It gives you a fresh taste and it does make my teeth whiter! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I like this product and the taste of toothpaste, i feel recently this toothpaste damage my Gums, so i switched again to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;  thank you.</li>
            <li> its a used product. it was already opened and only half full.</li>
            <li> everything was on time &amp;excellent product  5 stars</li>
            <li> works well, but taste is a bit...odd.  it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible per se; i just don&#x27;t know what it is supposed to taste like.  toothpaste and foam are not as dark as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I will agree - smells lemony and tastes like grape koolaid, which is really refreshing combo. Leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a cool product</li>
            <li> No idea if it is actually good for your teeth but it definitely makes them whiter.</li>
            <li> Excellente toothpaste</li>
            <li> our (me &amp; hubby) mouths have never felt cleaner &amp; teeth are whiter.  the charcoal takes care of breath for a long time.  love using nature&#x27;s supplies for needs.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste. It leaves a fresher taste than the others and the black color comes from charcoal but it tases minty and fresh.  It is excellent for teeth whitening and fresh breath! It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> got a good flavor and i like the fresh feel after</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is exactly what I was expecting. Like some of the other reviews, a few important things to note are: the consistency is runnier than traditional toothpaste so it&#x27;s a good idea to stand the tube upright (cap facing up, not down); the taste is not bad, just different to traditional toothpaste; it foams well. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on whether my teeth have become whiter, but I&#x27;m quietly confident.</li>
            <li> seems to be effective and strong mint taste.</li>
            <li> The paste is black and your mouth becomes black but the squeaky cleanness gives a big smile. I like Kimchi but I hate my bad-breath after. My husband that has a sharp sense of smell could not detect my Kimchi breath and we had a nice night.</li>
            <li> THis stuff definitely makes my teeth smooth, I am not so sure about whitening but it does seem to get the excess hard to get tarter off... I will be using this and ordering more</li>
            <li> quite expensive, tastes like Lychee, doesn&#x27;t last long, and is nothing like black powdered toothpaste</li>
            <li> It is very pleasant to use.  Perfect refreshing and clinging.</li>
            <li> Tastes surprisingly good; mouth feels fresh, teeth come out sparkling white; I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite Japanese toothpaste. Cleans teeth and tongue very well.</li>
            <li> Really good product, smells great, tastes fresh and minty, doesn&#x27;t drip or run (firm consistency enough to stay well put on the toothbrush, no mess), and don&#x27;t stain absolutely anything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be certainly getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> Leaves your teeth bright and feeling super clean!</li>
            <li> love the taste. Bubbles up, but not too much. nice texture. all around good</li>
            <li> If Amazon mandates listing the ingredients, buyer would have less risk of buying wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, sellers should list ingredients in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of charcoal&#x27;s absorption properties and that was the reason for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly,this is an another commercial toothpaste with overwhelmingly strong after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Ingredients] *Obtained through Yahoo Japan&lt;br /&gt;Water, Wetting agent (Sorbitol, Glycerine), Foaming agent (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Lauroyl sarcosinate na), Flavoring agent (Spice (Herb Mint type)), Stabilizer (3mg) Phosphoric acid, Preservative (Ethylparaben, Propylparaben), Polishing agent (Phosphoric acid 2 ca, Charcoal), Thickener (Silica), Binding material (Cellulose gum), Tonic (Menthol), Solvent (Ethanol), Foaming agent (Lauroyl sarcosinate na), Sweetening agent (Saccharin na)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update]&lt;br /&gt;I still call some of these ingredients &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Let me pick a common ingredient,&amp;#34;sodium laureth sulfate&amp;#34;(SLS) here.&lt;br /&gt;You Google rest of the ingredients and judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;SLS has been proposed to increase the frequency of mouth ulcers in some people, as it can dry out the protective layer of oral tissues, causing the underlying tissues to become damaged&amp;#34; (Wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t rely on FDA too much since many approved drugs have caused harmful side effects include hospitalizations and deaths even when properly prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go natural tooth pastes which are listed many in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update 2016]&lt;br /&gt;I am using diatomaceous earth very often lately.

            <li> Even right after you eat , it goes good with what u ate, I feel my mouth is cleaner than everyone around me!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, the taste is good and it helps with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Best Toothpaste i ever used. One needs to try to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Smells like grape, tastes like mint, and cleans great!</li>
            <li> I had low expectations for this product.  However I actually like it.  The toothpaste is black in color for sure and the taste is not what the US market is used to.  Not bad, just different.  My teeth are a bit whiter but the one thing my wife has noticed is how fresh my breath is since I started using this product.  I like this toothpaste.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is misleading. Smells like grape coolaid but tastes like eucalyptus. The product does work! I used it twice and my friend actually said Michelle you&#x27;re teeth look whiter today!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is black, and tastes great. Leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this tootpaste ,seller very nice,product very good.I know from many years my grandmothers use charcol to clean teeth no tootpaste this time,she said very good clean teeth,keep breath fresh.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. After using the product itself for a month, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick of extra whitening. Also leaves a dark residue on the head of a sonicare toothbrush. It does, however, taste like bubblegum (plus) and is functional.</li>
            <li> High quality product. It works better than any whitening toothpaste I tried and not doing any damage to enamel. Love its sweet fragrant flavor too.</li>
            <li> My son loves it.  Helps me see where he has brushed and where he has not. It takes a bit to get used to the taste.</li>
            <li> My Husband took one look at this black toothpaste and said &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not using that s_ _t&amp;#34;. He drinks a lot of coffee and I have bought EVERY whitening toothpaste out there ,even that expensive one on the t.v. shopping channel. I finally talked him into using it and he said &amp;#34;hey, this actually tastes kind of nice&amp;#34;, I think it tastes like rose or lavender water.&lt;br /&gt;But the big surprise was after I came back upstairs and my Husband smiled at me WOW , his usually yellow teeth were visibly whiter , I was stunned! I&#x27;m legally blind in one eye and I could see from across the room that his teeth were whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they continue to see it here, it works!</li>
            <li> It tastes like lemons to me which I just love. Cleans teeth well and gets rid of bad onion breath without blinking an eye. The only reason I would not give it a full five stars is I feel for the price the tube should be bigger. You don&#x27;t really need a lot for it to work well but I would still like to see more product for the money. Other than that I really like what little is there. Oh, and shipping takes forever so you may need to reorder as soon as you figure out you like it so you won&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> Shiny bright-white teeth again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent delivery</li>
            <li> love this product, my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste; makes my mouth feel so fresh!!!  Only downfall is that it makes a bit of a mess in the sink but worth the clean-up and no worse than hardened white toothpaste!</li>
            <li> great new item, have noticed a small improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Tastes a bit like grape flavored gum. It&#x27;s a small-ish tube but you don&#x27;t use as much as you would with conventional toothpaste. It&#x27;s more watery than I&#x27;m used to and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend standing the tube up on the cap side for storage. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and I feel like my teeth are already a little whiter.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube of Sumigaki toothpaste, and I think it is wonderful. I noticed results the first time I used it. The flavor is different, sort of a berry/menthol thing going on, which I found I enjoy despite being a hardcore peppermint fan. I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly abrasive either, which my enamel is happy about too.</li>
            <li> Pros: 1) Item arrived on time in perfect condition. 2) Taste is nice &amp; very fresh. 3) It does help with my teeth sensitivity.  4) Free shipping on international order. Yay! 😄 Cons: 1) I&#x27;ve only been using it for less than a week, so I&#x27;m not sure about the whitening part. 2) Product is a bit small</li>
            <li> love it...have ordered more...thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of Tom&#x27;s of Maine anti-plaque whitening paste, and decided that it wasn&#x27;t quite whitening enough for a daily tea &amp; coffee drinker.  I had good results with Tom&#x27;s combined with activated charcoal, but the mess can be inconvenient at times.  So I decided to give this charcoal toothpaste a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going back to conventional toothpaste like me, the sweetness can take time getting used to.  My spouse, on the other hand, is more unnerved by the dark grey colour of the toothpaste, haha!  I like how refreshed and clean my mouth feels after brushing.  I wish the toothpaste came in a larger size... 4.2 oz doesn&#x27;t go very far if you brush your teeth twice a day, even with free shipping (as of this writing all vendors are offering it) the cost adds up. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I rank this 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 for the convenience of not dealing with a powdery charcoal mess.  If they can use non-paraben based preservatives and another foaming agent I&#x27;d happily bump the review up to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend that used to live in Japan. It is a great whitener, but beware it is an acquired taste. I only use it a couple of times a week, as it is very powerful.</li>
            <li> I just started using it so it is too early to say if will whiten my teeth. It does make your breath very fresh.</li>
