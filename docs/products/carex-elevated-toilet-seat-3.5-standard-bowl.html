    <ol>
            <li>That works great!      </li>
            <li>And excellent pricing!</li>
            <li>This seat was perfect.</li>
            <li>Height is excellent...</li>
            <li>This works great with no leakage under the rim.</li>
            <li>and I got it for a great price.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 of these and they are great.</li>
            <li>Is a good temporary fix until you decide to get a taller bowl.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>It worked great, much better than the potty chair we had over the commode.</li>
            <li>Good foam construction and easy installation.</li>
            <li>Raised height is suitable for most people.</li>
            <li>One of the best features is that the seat goes under your own toilet seat</li>
            <li>The 3.5\\&quot; size is much better for me.  </li>
            <li>There are 2 more bathrooms in need.</li>
            <li>No bending more than 90 degrees for a couple of months, so this Carex seat was just what the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your existing seat has bolts that com out.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for someone of normal height recovering from knee replacment surgery.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my 94 year old mom!</li>
            <li>It appears to be the perfect answer to raise the toilet seat comfortably and safely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND IS VERY STRONG AND EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>and I think more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install with hardware provided.</li>
            <li>Installed easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install- keep clean-works</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and the additional height was perfect for ease of getting up and down.  </li>
            <li>well &amp; is easy to clean</li>
            <li>I liked this so much</li>
            <li>However,  I could not tell if it would fit until I opened it.  </li>
            <li>This came in very handy after  lumbar fusion and a year later after knee replacement.  </li>
            <li>One more thing, the price is $10.00 more than I could have bought at my local home improvement store.</li>
            <li>This solution allowed us to continue to use the padded side bars we have that bolt directly to the toilet and to put a padded seat on top, a combination that we think is superior to and far more comfortable than the molded all-in-one risers.  </li>
            <li>Excellent  product for a standard height toilet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good fit on a rounded toilet bowl and it provides a large opening.  </li>
            <li>One better set up with this is use your old plastic wingnuts in place of the metal supplied ones.</li>
            <li>well worth it).</li>
            <li>He was right</li>
            <li>It was very easy to install and could be installed with the toilet rails with no problem.  </li>
            <li>This riser has a much wider opening than those that sit on top of the toilet seat, so it is just like using your original commode, except easier.  </li>
            <li>Product installs and is exactly as sold.</li>
            <li>Is pretty stable.</li>
            <li>If you have need for such an item, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I had read another review of this seat which suggested that if you are short, you&#x27;ll love this 3 1/2 inch elevation.</li>
            <li>(I should have checked around first).</li>
            <li>If I had been able to see this product prior to purchase, I would never have purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this seat last year and am well pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Person that it was meant for is very comfortable getting on and off the toilet.</li>
            <li>A higher toilet would have looked better but as my DH</li>
            <li>I believe the rails are critial for safe use of the toilet after knee replacement surgery.    </li>
            <li>as the title states, it is a nightmare to keep clean, and wouldn&#x27;t need to be if it were designed a little better.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and uses the regular seat with lid.</li>
            <li>The install was easy and only needed the walker as an accessary.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it about 4 days, so all I can say is, so far I am happy with this product and hope that it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>The seat does increase the toilet to a much better height for a disabled user, but cleaning the piece is troublesome: the plastic surface is textured rather than smooth, requiring some effort to clean it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Amazon to the rescue with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>She really likes this product</li>
            <li>It comes with very substantial 6\\&quot; metal bolts to hold it, the bars and the toilet seat in place securely.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re home caring for my aging mother with advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s and mobility issues, and since we&#x27;re renting a home we needed an inexpensive alternative to replacing the toilet with a \\&quot;handicapped\\&quot; unit.  </li>
            <li>and it fit my toilet</li>
            <li>so you are sitting on your own toilet seat and that your original toilet seat and lid still function as they did before the addition of the elevated seat between the toilet and the seat.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who needs handicap toilets and can&#x27;t afford to replace the ones they have.</li>
            <li>The only problem is cleaning the elevated seat, which gets soiled on the bottom between the elevated seat and top of the toilet bowl.  </li>
            <li>Making a tighter fit and to reduce any possiable slipping.</li>
            <li>and I live in a rental for now</li>
            <li>I went to the orthopedic guy &amp; got a new hip in Sun City,Arizona.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you may have to invest in a new seat like I did.</li>
            <li>Once you do, you will find the bolts they ship with this thing to be too big around to fit through the holes of a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; toilet seat</li>
            <li>looks OK especially since our toilet is white.</li>
            <li>It is still sturdy, though, and so far has not given me a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Allows seat to move considerably.  </li>
            <li>THIS ITEM HAS REALLY HELPED WITH AN UPLIFT AND IS DEFINITELY TO PURCHASE IF NEEDED</li>
            <li>I got a large eye screw, installed it in wall opposite toilet with large sail boat rope.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a full opening to use and you can close your seat and seat cover down with it in place, or lift them out of the way with this product in place.  </li>
            <li>I think any higher and I would have felt less stable and my leg would have dangled too much, thereby causing additional pain.  </li>
            <li>Very short people may think it&#x27;s too high.</li>
            <li>We just ordered it on Amazon since I was willing to wait for the one I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 weeks of using it, it has held up just fine and isn&#x27;t too difficult to clean around it, though does need wiping every few days.</li>
            <li>The raised seat really helps those who find their existing toilet bowls being too low, which may cause a number of inconveniences, including the user&#x27;s hand which might touch the water in the bowl in some occasions.  </li>
            <li>modifications like a new toilet are out of the question.</li>
            <li>You will end up buying a new toilet seat.  </li>
            <li>However, seller of this item should have made it clear to customers  the model number of it, as there is another model which also raises 3.5 inches and is elongated for the elongated toilet bowl.</li>
            <li>I find it is much easier to sit down and rise with this additional elevation.  </li>
            <li>My teenage son installed the seat for me (after I had previously installed the rails) and it was very stable.    </li>

            <li> The bolts that come with it are large, 3/8\\&quot; diameter and 6\\&quot; long, which do not fit through the seat hinge - so the hinge would need to be drilled out larger.</li>
            <li> &quot; down to clear the side of the toilet.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it attaches underneath the toilet seat, which makes it look nicer</li>
            <li> It stays put in spite of some reviews to contrary and gets the toilet seat up where I need it.</li>
            <li> but eventually I will replace the toilet with a taller version.</li>
            <li> As it secured onto the toilet with screws, it does not lift up in order that it can be cleaned underneath.</li>
            <li> but I still expect to use this toilet seat for awhile while my ankle heals.</li>
            <li> The elevated seat is bolted in the rear to the toilet, so you have to remove the bolts (and the elevated seat) for a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> After you ream the holes out and attempt to install it, you will discover that the oversized wing nuts are also too big to tighten them down properly.  </li>
            <li> Trying to use  this item on an elongated toilet could be a safety issue with someone of limited mobility.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I find is that urine can collect between the seat and commode causing an odor if not cleaned frequently.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this item and found out when the product arrived that this item will not fit on an elongated toilet as product description states.  </li>
            <li> The screws that came with it would not hold the seat tight enough.  </li>
            <li> Just remove your toilet seat, put the riser down, and use the enclosed bolts and nuts to reattach (using a screwdriver).  </li>
            <li> This prevented slipping and scratching.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it only took a few minutes to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item does not fit on an elongated toilet!</li>
            <li> You can also close the lid, something I couldn&#x27;t do with the other risers.  </li>
            <li> Will not stay tight, the plastic is not strong enough to hold the bolts snug and will continue to squeez down</li>
            <li> After I realized using the toilet in a half leg cast was difficult, my husband searched online and sent our son to purchase a seat riser to use under our regular toilet seat at the Walgreens nearest us that supposedly had it in stock.</li>
            <li> The dimensions are not accurate for width and lenght so it does not fit as well as expected.</li>
            <li> When you need to tighten it down for heavy weight users so it doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with one of the wing nuts and had to use a wrench to hold it.</li>
            <li> Unless you plan to unscrew and clean it daily, expect to find it rimmed with trapped urine that will make your bathroom smell horrible.</li>
            <li> Small price compared to the surgery.</li>
            <li> but everything I buy lately online is junk.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in both knees which makes it very difficult to stand up from a low seat.  </li>
            <li> and it was to small and useless.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> All in all a disappointing experience.  </li>
            <li> I hate to drive and shop</li>

            <li> The raised seat really helps those who find their existing toilet bowls being too low, which may cause a number of inconveniences, including the user&#x27;s hand which might touch the water in the bowl in some occasions.  However, seller of this item should have made it clear to customers  the model number of it, as there is another model which also raises 3.5 inches and is elongated for the elongated toilet bowl.</li>
            <li> Product installs and is exactly as sold. Person that it was meant for is very comfortable getting on and off the toilet.</li>
            <li> Is pretty stable. Is a good temporary fix until you decide to get a taller bowl.&lt;br /&gt;Fits well &amp; is easy to clean</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly mother in law who is handicapped. It worked great, much better than the potty chair we had over the commode. Easy to install and uses the regular seat with lid.</li>
            <li> This is the third product I&#x27;ve tried.  I have arthritis in both knees which makes it very difficult to stand up from a low seat.  I like this product because it attaches underneath the toilet seat, which makes it look nicer and I think more comfortable.  You can also close the lid, something I couldn&#x27;t do with the other risers.  This riser has a much wider opening than those that sit on top of the toilet seat, so it is just like using your original commode, except easier.  The 3.5\\&quot; size is much better for me.  I had tried one that was 5\\&quot;, but it was too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this riser is that it doesn&#x27;t lock in the front. It has gripper pads on the bottom that are supposed to hold it, but I don&#x27;t think they work that well.  It is still sturdy, though, and so far has not given me a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is very simple.  Just remove your toilet seat, put the riser down, and use the enclosed bolts and nuts to reattach (using a screwdriver).  I had some trouble with one of the wing nuts and had to use a wrench to hold it. Other than that, it only took a few minutes to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it about 4 days, so all I can say is, so far I am happy with this product and hope that it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Easy to install with hardware provided. It stays put in spite of some reviews to contrary and gets the toilet seat up where I need it. A higher toilet would have looked better but as my DH and I live in a rental for now modifications like a new toilet are out of the question.</li>
            <li> If you have need for such an item, you&#x27;ll love this. I purchased in anticipation of a knee replacement. I had read another review of this seat which suggested that if you are short, you&#x27;ll love this 3 1/2 inch elevation. He was right This works great with no leakage under the rim. I combined this with support bars on the sides and make out quite well.</li>
            <li> The dimensions are not accurate for width and lenght so it does not fit as well as expected. The bolts that come with it are large, 3/8\\&quot; diameter and 6\\&quot; long, which do not fit through the seat hinge - so the hinge would need to be drilled out larger. Also if you have brass colored hinge, the bolts won&#x27;t match as they are galvanized. The seat will not match sizewise - there will be a lot of overhang all around the riser.  This product will do for now but eventually I will replace the toilet with a taller version. One more thing, the price is $10.00 more than I could have bought at my local home improvement store. (I should have checked around first).</li>
            <li> Recently bought this item and found out when the product arrived that this item will not fit on an elongated toilet as product description states.  Seller needs to rewrite product description to state as what is on product box, \\&quot; For standard toilets\\&quot;.  Trying to use  this item on an elongated toilet could be a safety issue with someone of limited mobility.  This item does not fit on an elongated toilet!</li>
            <li> Installed easily.  Used it one day before taking it off. Allows seat to move considerably.  No way to tighten sufficiently.  I got a large eye screw, installed it in wall opposite toilet with large sail boat rope.  That works great!      If I had been able to see this product prior to purchase, I would never have purchased it.  I think this will end my purchase of online products. I hate to drive and shop but everything I buy lately online is junk. Sorry.</li>
            <li> This is the one you want!  It leaves a full opening to use and you can close your seat and seat cover down with it in place, or lift them out of the way with this product in place.  I liked this so much i just ordered another today.  Yes I did buy one differnt one that had the seat included into it and it was to small and useless.  One better set up with this is use your old plastic wingnuts in place of the metal supplied ones. OR go to the store and get two plastic washers.  Reason is that metal against the cermanic bowl with the wing nut could damage it....When you need to tighten it down for heavy weight users so it doesn&#x27;t move around. I also added 4 1\\&quot;x1\\&quot; with 3/8\\&quot; holes rubber gasket which went under the seat bolt hole and under the product bolt holes on both sides.  Making a tighter fit and to reduce any possiable slipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this seat last year and am well pleased with it.  I read the reviews and took the advice of one of the reviewers and used a rubber washer on the bolts between the nuts and the commode.  This prevented slipping and scratching. I find it is much easier to sit down and rise with this additional elevation.  Knee pain is now minimized for me.  The only negative thing I find is that urine can collect between the seat and commode causing an odor if not cleaned frequently. Regardless, I would do this again, especially if it was offered in colors. There are 2 more bathrooms in need.</li>
            <li> I went to the orthopedic guy &amp; got a new hip in Sun City,Arizona.  They do a bunch of &#x27;em there.  No bending more than 90 degrees for a couple of months, so this Carex seat was just what the doctor ordered.  The install was easy and only needed the walker as an accessary.  Solidly mounted with no surprises.  And excellent pricing!</li>
            <li> The seat does increase the toilet to a much better height for a disabled user, but cleaning the piece is troublesome: the plastic surface is textured rather than smooth, requiring some effort to clean it thoroughly. As it secured onto the toilet with screws, it does not lift up in order that it can be cleaned underneath. Unless you plan to unscrew and clean it daily, expect to find it rimmed with trapped urine that will make your bathroom smell horrible.</li>
            <li> Amazon to the rescue with fast shipping. After I realized using the toilet in a half leg cast was difficult, my husband searched online and sent our son to purchase a seat riser to use under our regular toilet seat at the Walgreens nearest us that supposedly had it in stock. It wasn&#x27;t, so our son went to another Walgreens where they said it was in stock, but it wasn&#x27;t. We just ordered it on Amazon since I was willing to wait for the one I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 weeks of using it, it has held up just fine and isn&#x27;t too difficult to clean around it, though does need wiping every few days. One week to go until I get an air cast. but I still expect to use this toilet seat for awhile while my ankle heals.</li>
            <li> This seat was perfect. Gave the increased seating height necessary after hip surgery. Make sure your existing seat has bolts that com out. Otherwise you may have to invest in a new seat like I did. Small price compared to the surgery.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re home caring for my aging mother with advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s and mobility issues, and since we&#x27;re renting a home we needed an inexpensive alternative to replacing the toilet with a \\&quot;handicapped\\&quot; unit.  This solution allowed us to continue to use the padded side bars we have that bolt directly to the toilet and to put a padded seat on top, a combination that we think is superior to and far more comfortable than the molded all-in-one risers.  It&#x27;s a good fit on a rounded toilet bowl and it provides a large opening.  It comes with very substantial 6\\&quot; metal bolts to hold it, the bars and the toilet seat in place securely.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 94 year old mom!</li>
            <li> Wife had three back surgerys. This seat riser has been a life saver for her. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Height is excellent...as the title states, it is a nightmare to keep clean, and wouldn&#x27;t need to be if it were designed a little better.</li>
            <li> This came in very handy after  lumbar fusion and a year later after knee replacement.  The only problem is cleaning the elevated seat, which gets soiled on the bottom between the elevated seat and top of the toilet bowl.  The elevated seat is bolted in the rear to the toilet, so you have to remove the bolts (and the elevated seat) for a thorough cleaning.  Otherwise odor develops.</li>
            <li> It is a replacement for the one I had before and it fit my toilet well.  Wish you could make this model to be cleaned under..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for someone of normal height recovering from knee replacment surgery.  It was very easy to install and could be installed with the toilet rails with no problem.  I definitely recommend using the two products together for extra stability.  I believe the rails are critial for safe use of the toilet after knee replacement surgery.    My teenage son installed the seat for me (after I had previously installed the rails) and it was very stable.    One of the best features is that the seat goes under your own toilet seat so you are sitting on your own toilet seat and that your original toilet seat and lid still function as they did before the addition of the elevated seat between the toilet and the seat.    The size of the opening is the same as your seat.    I am 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and the additional height was perfect for ease of getting up and down.  I think any higher and I would have felt less stable and my leg would have dangled too much, thereby causing additional pain.  I give this product 5 stars but do recommend that it be used with the side rails (cost of around $23 and well worth it).</li>
            <li> It appears to be the perfect answer to raise the toilet seat comfortably and safely.&lt;br /&gt;It looks OK especially since our toilet is white.</li>
            <li> You will end up buying a new toilet seat.  Once you do, you will find the bolts they ship with this thing to be too big around to fit through the holes of a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; toilet seat (I won&#x27;t mention the brand name but it starts with a \\&quot;K\\&quot; and ends with an \\&quot;r\\&quot;).  After you ream the holes out and attempt to install it, you will discover that the oversized wing nuts are also too big to tighten them down properly.  I had to grind the \\&quot;wings\\&quot; down to clear the side of the toilet.  All in all a disappointing experience.  A 15 minute job took an hour.  Lesson learned: throw out the hardware and use your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the patient found the product satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my mother. She really likes this product and I got it for a great price.</li>
            <li> I did not know that you could not return this product if it had been opened.  However,  I could not tell if it would fit until I opened it.  The screws that came with it would not hold the seat tight enough.  I recommend &amp;#34;DO NOT BUY&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Will not stay tight, the plastic is not strong enough to hold the bolts snug and will continue to squeez down</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM HAS REALLY HELPED WITH AN UPLIFT AND IS DEFINITELY TO PURCHASE IF NEEDED AND IS VERY STRONG AND EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these and they are great. I highly recommend to anyone who needs handicap toilets and can&#x27;t afford to replace the ones they have.</li>
            <li> A back saver... Thank you!</li>
            <li> A must for handicapped people.</li>
            <li> Easy to install- keep clean-works well</li>
            <li> Excellent  product for a standard height toilet. Raised height is suitable for most people.Very short people may think it&#x27;s too high. Good foam construction and easy installation.</li>
