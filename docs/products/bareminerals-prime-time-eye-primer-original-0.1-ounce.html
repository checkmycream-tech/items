    <ol>
            <li>Awesome coverage and keeps eyeshawdow where it should be, on your eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>Excellent!!</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>But for eyeliner-- his is the BEST.</li>
            <li>and I am so impressed with it!  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this primer.  </li>
            <li>Eye shadow, liner &amp; concealer stay perfect ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>Best primer</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>THE best eyelid primer EVER!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best for keeping eye shadow from creasing ALL day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know WHY this primer works best for me</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and this is a good color for</li>
            <li>Good luck! :)</li>
            <li>When applied correctly--this is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>a cr√®me consistency which covers nicely.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of keeping eyeshadow looking fresh all day, no creases!  </li>
            <li>I normally would give this product 5 stars; it is an excellent product</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product, I try to never run out!</li>
            <li>It glides on your eyelids very smoothly and evenly and dries immediately.  </li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>Works better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is ok but seems to be some what drying to my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Just wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li>--there&#x27;s plenty more product in there.  </li>
            <li>I used this under some powder foundation or this plus powdered eye shadow and was able to dispense with any liquid concealer or liquid foundation altogether.  </li>
            <li>The ultimate test was a one-hour workout in 80 degree ambient temperatures and all of my eye makeup looked as perfect as when I had put it on despite all the sweat dripping into my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The reason this is a 5 star review is that in addition to performance, it is actually relatively safe per the www-dot-ewg-dot-org website (www.ewg.org/skindeep)</li>
            <li>Love how it keeps eyeshadow from creasing.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m just glad it does</li>
            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye primer I tried and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I really, really wish I could find something cheaper that works just as good, but</li>
            <li>My eye shadow doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as I&#x27;d like with this.  </li>
            <li>I love bright colors and lots of liner and this makes it LAST, all day and all night!  </li>
            <li>I have had better success using the BE</li>
            <li>applied helps to smooth the eyelid, hide imperfections also.</li>
            <li>My original order was in May 2014.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am making sure I always have a tube ready</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of different eyeshadows from ELF and Covergirl to Lorac and Urban Decay and no matter which shadow I put on it stays on and looks perfect with this primer.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they had re-thought the packaging--a jar would be more appropriate.  </li>
            <li>Favorite primer by far!</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t originally buy this product from Amazon...</li>
            <li>so it is worth getting.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price as it lasts for months and months.</li>
            <li>I can do my makeup, go to work and then go right out without any touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I had run out of it and didn&#x27;t order it right away.</li>
            <li>I have very very oily eye lids.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the whole \\&quot;muting\\&quot; colors review, I&#x27;ve never run into that!  </li>
            <li>and I felt like I needed to apply more to get the same result.</li>
            <li>By many hours later, it still looks as I just put it on.  </li>
            <li>Even though it works SO FREAKING WELL on its own, I&#x27;m still always extra paranoid, so I usually swipe my finger in Anti-Lady Monkey Butt powder (it&#x27;s a chaffing powder, shut up lol) and swipe it on top of the primer...between the primer, and the powder, my eye make-up LITERALLY stays on all day and night, and sometimes---on the RARE occasions I sleep in make-up, it lasts until the next morning.</li>
            <li>Even the Urban Decay primer (which everyone seems to love) does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>have tried other, cheaper brands, but always come back to bare escentuals because it&#x27;s the best!  </li>
            <li>And we live in a very hot area as well.  </li>
            <li>I am not usually a fan of Bare Escentuals because I like a lot more coverage with my foundation and powder.  </li>
            <li>if you wish)...don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands - believe me, this is the BEST!</li>
            <li>I love it for when I&#x27;m shooting photos at a wedding or spending a long day out and about.</li>
            <li>But I know if I want more pigmentation, I wet my brush.</li>
            <li>It really muted my eyeshadow color</li>
            <li>This product works very well, keeps eyeshadow and eyeliner from creasing and smudging.</li>
            <li>I really like the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I feel safer that long-term I am not accumulating or absorbing toxic poisons through my skin that would affect my health or my eyesight.</li>
            <li>Gentle on eyes, and it keeps eyeshadow in place</li>
            <li>all day.&lt;br /&gt;The trick is learning how much to apply, and anyone can&lt;br /&gt;learn</li>
            <li>Unless your eyelids are worse than mine (and trust me, they probably aren&#x27;t, lol)</li>
            <li>Actually works to remove fine lines for middle-aged to older skin.</li>
            <li>Holy cow this stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Could just be me and my particular skin texture.</li>
            <li>It makes a big difference by helping the eye shadow and eye liner to apply easier and better, and makeup stays on longer, and stays on even until the next day if you don&#x27;t remove it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li>Face Primer (not sure if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called exactly), but when I apply the Face Primer, I be sure to glide a little over my eyelids and that seems to do a better job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also did not think it blended as well as it does when I normally go without primer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money--makes any eyeshadow last all day without creasing!!</li>
            <li>I received a sample sized product 0.1 fl oz, the same size that I received from Bare Escentuals as a free sample, 0.1 fl oz)</li>
            <li>Then I put a very tiny dot of the white looking Prime Time Eyelid Primer on the flecks of powder and quickly mix it.</li>
            <li>but I certainly would not do the same for Beauty and Baskets who sold me a sample for a hefty price of $17.00.  </li>
            <li>an hour or two into my day and my shadow was creased and my liner up near my brows.</li>
            <li>This primer is the absolute ONLY PRIMER that works for me.</li>
            <li>It is not too thin or too thick and it has the perfect consistency.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s half full of air.</li>
            <li>I use it in an high humid area and it last all day.</li>
            <li>you need very little, which is good cuz the tube is small.</li>
            <li>I went into a Bare Mineral store and they showed me how to apply this.</li>
            <li>I put on the cream, put on my foundation (Bare Minerals Matte)</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered Bare Escentuals Prime Time Eyelid Primer from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Switched back to Bare Minerals and the stinging went away immediately!</li>
            <li>I like Bare Escentuals, and will order their stuff again- especially the sparkly stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product, bare escentuals eyelid primer because at various times&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem where my eyeshadow once applied moves around on my eyelid where&lt;br /&gt;eyeshadow builds up in the crease of the eye or by the end of the day, shadow is very&lt;br /&gt;unnoticeable or has disappeared off of the eye.</li>

            <li> I like Bare Escentuals, and will order their stuff again- especially the sparkly stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product, bare escentuals eyelid primer because at various times&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem where my eyeshadow once applied moves around on my eyelid where&lt;br /&gt;eyeshadow builds up in the crease of the eye or by the end of the day, shadow is very&lt;br /&gt;unnoticeable or has disappeared off of the eye.</li>
            <li> Let dry a second or two, then apply shadow, liner, mascara and go!  </li>
            <li> It will dry in a second.</li>
            <li> And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried every single one of them because I use it not only on my eyelids, but I use it on my eyebrows, too, when I need to fill them in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelid primer for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish the container was bigger - it seems like a moderately high price for a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li> Due to the cost of this item, I&#x27;ve tried several alternatives, but they don&#x27;t keep the shadow on my eyes as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> I use loose eyeshadow, like Mac&#x27;s purple/black color as my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a toothpick to shave a few specks of the powder into a tiny container.</li>
            <li> I have my thin eyeliner brush ready and line my eyes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this at the Macy&#x27;s counter and not at Amazon, but I wanted to give it a review hoping it may prove helpful to other ladies.</li>
            <li> The tube is small, only wish</li>
            <li> So, I suppose that even though the container is small, it does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It still felt slightly tacky to me and my eye shadow didn&#x27;t seem to blend as well.</li>
            <li> It helps eyeshadow stay in place for my 14+ hour work days, and keeps my eyelids from feeling like greasy pools when I&#x27;m not wearing eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to make my eyelids feel less greasy.  </li>
            <li> You just need a little dab on each eyelid as the primer&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> I have green eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear anything else of BareMInerals, just because it&#x27;s too expensive, but my eye primer is a necessity, so, I am forced.</li>
            <li> It stays until I remove it with plain face wash.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that I&#x27;d ordered the wrong thing, but I think it will work fine underneath my other eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Apply your foundation (any), take a small amount of this, and dab it on your lid.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Ulta.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of girls SAY they have oily eyelids, and then what they REALLY mean is that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s kinda-sorta oily, icky.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not one of those girls.</li>
            <li> it works well, but the amount they give you for $20 is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.</li>

            <li> Does a great job of keeping eyeshadow looking fresh all day, no creases!  And we live in a very hot area as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product says this in the title, but I happen to be an owner of the sparkly version of the primer... I was a bit disappointed that I&#x27;d ordered the wrong thing, but I think it will work fine underneath my other eyeshadows. I like Bare Escentuals, and will order their stuff again- especially the sparkly stuff.</li>
            <li> When applied correctly--this is AMAZING.  I love bright colors and lots of liner and this makes it LAST, all day and all night!  I can do my makeup, go to work and then go right out without any touch ups.  I have very very oily eye lids. an hour or two into my day and my shadow was creased and my liner up near my brows. Apply your foundation (any), take a small amount of this, and dab it on your lid.  Let dry a second or two, then apply shadow, liner, mascara and go!  I don&#x27;t understand the whole \\&quot;muting\\&quot; colors review, I&#x27;ve never run into that!  But I know if I want more pigmentation, I wet my brush.</li>
            <li> The size/amount of this product is laughable. Sure it works well, but the amount they give you for $20 is just ridiculous. The container is about the size of a AAA battery and it&#x27;s half full of air. I would not recommend this product to anyone at this price.</li>
            <li> Awesome coverage and keeps eyeshawdow where it should be, on your eyes. I use it in an high humid area and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the Macy&#x27;s counter and not at Amazon, but I wanted to give it a review hoping it may prove helpful to other ladies. I did not care for this product. It still felt slightly tacky to me and my eye shadow didn&#x27;t seem to blend as well. At the Macy&#x27;s counter, there were three types of this Prime Time: Matte, and two kinds of pearl, one in a pinkish shade and one in a yellowish shade, so I&#x27;m assuming this one is the Matte, which I also purchased. It really muted my eyeshadow color and I felt like I needed to apply more to get the same result. I also did not think it blended as well as it does when I normally go without primer. I have had better success using the BE Face Primer (not sure if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called exactly), but when I apply the Face Primer, I be sure to glide a little over my eyelids and that seems to do a better job. My eyeshadow just glides on when I do that, so personally, I don&#x27;t see the need to purchase a separate eye primer.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that will keep my eyeshadow or liner on without smuding or disappearing throughout the day.  I am 58 and will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and my shad always creases or wears off.  This is the first eye primer I tried and I loved it.  But, I wanted to try some cheaper primers.  Guess what... they don&#x27;t work as well.  With this product, you can go all day and all night and your shadow will not crease.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Due to the cost of this item, I&#x27;ve tried several alternatives, but they don&#x27;t keep the shadow on my eyes as well as this product.  Go head, plurge!</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Very happy. I&#x27;d been using Merle Norman but my eyes were always stinging.  Switched back to Bare Minerals and the stinging went away immediately!</li>
            <li> I have oily eyelids and no matter how I apply my eyeliner, it fades within hours and I used to use waterproof eyeliner. I went into a Bare Mineral store and they showed me how to apply this. I do not put this all over my lids. I use loose eyeshadow, like Mac&#x27;s purple/black color as my eyeliner. I have green eyes and this is a good color for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a toothpick to shave a few specks of the powder into a tiny container. Then I put a very tiny dot of the white looking Prime Time Eyelid Primer on the flecks of powder and quickly mix it. It will dry in a second. I have my thin eyeliner brush ready and line my eyes. It stays until I remove it with plain face wash. Nothing special. This prep takes a second, but I wrote it out for those that don&#x27;t understand how to use it. I do not use it as shadow base as I don&#x27;t want it too dry looking. But for eyeliner-- his is the BEST.</li>
            <li> This is ok but seems to be some what drying to my eyelids. My eye shadow doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as I&#x27;d like with this.  Could just be me and my particular skin texture. It does work.</li>
            <li> Holy cow this stuff is fantastic!  I have oily eyelids.  When using Prime Time my eye shadow lasts without creasing, or smudging from morning until bedtime when I take my makeup off (16 hours!).  Just wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, keeps eyeshadow and eyeliner from creasing and smudging.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a fan of Bare Escentuals because I like a lot more coverage with my foundation and powder.  I bought this on a whim and I am so impressed with it!  It glides on your eyelids very smoothly and evenly and dries immediately.  The primer helps any eyeshadow stay on for the entire day.  I have tried a bunch of different eyeshadows from ELF and Covergirl to Lorac and Urban Decay and no matter which shadow I put on it stays on and looks perfect with this primer.  I am very impressed with this primer.  It is not too thin or too thick and it has the perfect consistency.  A little goes a long way so it is worth getting.</li>
            <li> this eye lid primer is the only way to go. you need very little, which is good cuz the tube is small. but it&#x27;s worth the money--makes any eyeshadow last all day without creasing!!</li>
            <li> Favorite primer by far!</li>
            <li> This is the best under eye shadow cream / base Ive ever used! I put on the cream, put on my foundation (Bare Minerals Matte) and then my eye shadow. By many hours later, it still looks as I just put it on.  Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> Only need a tiny amount on your lids and under eyes.  Eye shadow, liner &amp; concealer stay perfect ALL DAY.  Eliminates creases in your shadow.  Eliminates shadow melting away --even in summer.  Well worth the price as it lasts for months and months. I only wish they had re-thought the packaging--a jar would be more appropriate.  When the product gets low in the tube--cut the tube open --there&#x27;s plenty more product in there.  Store in plastic bag.  Best primer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while.  Before using this, I had the problem of my eye shadow melting into the crease of my eyelid.  This product prevents that.  I really like the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Actually works to remove fine lines for middle-aged to older skin. My skin did not use to crease, but now my eyelids and under-eye area could not hold makeup without it creasing and running. I used this under some powder foundation or this plus powdered eye shadow and was able to dispense with any liquid concealer or liquid foundation altogether.  The ultimate test was a one-hour workout in 80 degree ambient temperatures and all of my eye makeup looked as perfect as when I had put it on despite all the sweat dripping into my eyes.  The reason this is a 5 star review is that in addition to performance, it is actually relatively safe per the www-dot-ewg-dot-org website (www.ewg.org/skindeep) so I feel safer that long-term I am not accumulating or absorbing toxic poisons through my skin that would affect my health or my eyesight.</li>
            <li> Update.  I am just now reordering in July of 2015 to replenish my supply.  My original order was in May 2014.  So, I suppose that even though the container is small, it does go a long way.  I use it 3-4 times a week, and can definitely tell when I don&#x27;t.  It helps eyeshadow stay in place for my 14+ hour work days, and keeps my eyelids from feeling like greasy pools when I&#x27;m not wearing eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to make my eyelids feel less greasy.  Works well with or without makeup.  I wish the container was bigger - it seems like a moderately high price for a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> THE best eyelid primer EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product, bare escentuals eyelid primer because at various times&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem where my eyeshadow once applied moves around on my eyelid where&lt;br /&gt;eyeshadow builds up in the crease of the eye or by the end of the day, shadow is very&lt;br /&gt;unnoticeable or has disappeared off of the eye. This primer is a netural color base&lt;br /&gt;when applied helps to smooth the eyelid, hide imperfections also., plus help maintain&lt;br /&gt;the eyeshadow when applied to the lid. The tube is small, only wish Bare Escentuals&lt;br /&gt;would eventually make the primer in a larger size. This primer does work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 5 Stars. PS- You just need a little dab on each eyelid as the primer&lt;br /&gt;has a cr√®me consistency which covers nicely.</li>
            <li> I ordered Bare Escentuals Prime Time Eyelid Primer from Amazon.  Product information indicated that the size was 1.6 fl oz.  I received a sample sized product 0.1 fl oz, the same size that I received from Bare Escentuals as a free sample, 0.1 fl oz) (The seller was Beauty and Baskets LLC but there is no place for seller review among my orders.  I was charged $17.00 for this sample sized product.  Beauty and Baskets is not listed as a seller of this item at this time.  I have not found a phone number to contact Amazon so this review seems to be my only resort.  I normally would give this product 5 stars; it is an excellent product but I certainly would not do the same for Beauty and Baskets who sold me a sample for a hefty price of $17.00.  Please check your product if you order from them.  The product is in the same tube, just a bit longer and a bit thinner.  Check your product amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelid primer for a long time. I had run out of it and didn&#x27;t order it right away. What a big mistake. My eyeshadow would crease and my eyeliner would look almost gone within a couple of hours. I am making sure I always have a tube ready so I never run out again.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference by helping the eye shadow and eye liner to apply easier and better, and makeup stays on longer, and stays on even until the next day if you don&#x27;t remove it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> Love how it keeps eyeshadow from creasing.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  It prevents the eye shadow from smearing</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product, I try to never run out!</li>
            <li> Gentle on eyes, and it keeps eyeshadow in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;The trick is learning how much to apply, and anyone can&lt;br /&gt;learn that with practice.</li>
            <li> A must have.  It is the only thing I can use that will keep my eye make up on all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for years...have tried other, cheaper brands, but always come back to bare escentuals because it&#x27;s the best!  It will keep your eyeshadow on ALL day and ALL night (if you wish)...don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands - believe me, this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This is the best for keeping eye shadow from creasing ALL day. I love it for when I&#x27;m shooting photos at a wedding or spending a long day out and about.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t originally buy this product from Amazon...I usually buy it at Ulta. But, regardless, I&#x27;ve been using this for probably about 6 years. I know a lot of girls SAY they have oily eyelids, and then what they REALLY mean is that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s kinda-sorta oily, icky.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not one of those girls. When I say my eyelids get oily, I mean they get disgustingly gross, nasty, oozing oily. This primer is the absolute ONLY PRIMER that works for me. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried every single one of them because I use it not only on my eyelids, but I use it on my eyebrows, too, when I need to fill them in. I really, really wish I could find something cheaper that works just as good, but no. Even the Urban Decay primer (which everyone seems to love) does absolutely nothing for me. I don&#x27;t know WHY this primer works best for me, I wish I did know...but, I&#x27;m just glad it does and if they ever stop making it I&#x27;ll probably cry. I don&#x27;t really wear anything else of BareMInerals, just because it&#x27;s too expensive, but my eye primer is a necessity, so, I am forced. Even though it works SO FREAKING WELL on its own, I&#x27;m still always extra paranoid, so I usually swipe my finger in Anti-Lady Monkey Butt powder (it&#x27;s a chaffing powder, shut up lol) and swipe it on top of the primer...between the primer, and the powder, my eye make-up LITERALLY stays on all day and night, and sometimes---on the RARE occasions I sleep in make-up, it lasts until the next morning. So, I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. Definitely recommended. Unless your eyelids are worse than mine (and trust me, they probably aren&#x27;t, lol) then this stuff should work wonders. Good luck! :)</li>
