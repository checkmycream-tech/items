            <li>Did the product give the purchaser a pleasant experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell when you apply it, but I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I&#x27;m done styling.  </li>

            <li>I loved it, so between that</li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my mom after she asked me to find her a good priced and quality leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The reviews were so good on this product, I thought, though pricy, I&#x27;ll give this a try...</li>
            <li>and i loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>I loved the effect it has on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Good for all textures of hair.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells so good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good heat protectant for the hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and the fact that this product is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to give products good ratings if they don&#x27;t deserve it.  </li>
            <li>(she has naturally gorgeous curly hair)</li>
            <li>I tried hers one day and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to pay over $100 for a good one...</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years.  </li>
            <li>Good for before or after blow drying.</li>
            <li>After one day using this oil, my hair felt good.</li>
            <li>Works good on my hair</li>
            <li>Its a good quality product.</li>
            <li>but she said an Ion works just as good as a Chi.</li>
            <li>I tried it when I bought the HSI iron, and loved it.</li>
            <li>Gret product, good price.</li>
            <li>, I absolutely LOVED it, so I decided to purchase the full-size product.</li>
            <li>It is fairly dense oil and will cause your hair to look greasy.</li>
            <li>Once after washing your hair is good.</li>
            <li>And since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get good results, I won&#x27;t go broke maintaining my hair.</li>
            <li>I originally received this as a sample when I bought an HSI hair straightener (also an excellent product).</li>
            <li>After giving both these products a fair amount of testing time, I can honestly say that they are amazing!</li>
            <li>This has a very pleasant and light fragrance, and the oil adds smoothness to your hair and scalp but is not &amp;#34;greasy&#x27; at all.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Leave beautiful and healthy look hair every time used.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling healthy, shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Then I bought another straightener (these are the best that I have found and a great price) and a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly and is a great product, I appreciate the good business!</li>
            <li>Super good!!!!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others and this is exceptional.</li>
            <li>It is an exceptional product.  </li>
            <li>I received my product quickly and it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>There is a pleasant hair product scent to it, because it has added fragrance, and it spreads out nicely in your hair, not creating clumps.</li>
            <li>had a question about the product and was also very happy with the quick response.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, hair looks healthy even after all that heat!</li>
            <li>I use a good dime-size amount on my towel-dried hair, and the HSI Argan Oil does its magic!</li>
            <li>It is very nice and the bottle arrived safe and good.</li>
            <li>It smells super gd!!!</li>
            <li>this is a great argan oil treatment for the hair and leaves your hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the great reviews and I must say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Just ok, got great.</li>
            <li>I love this product and smells great</li>
            <li>I keep touching my hair because it&#x27;s become softer (and I think that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll end up with greasy locks - constant-touching lol).</li>
            <li>outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this seems to be great protection for my hair and takes the &#x27;static&#x27; away.</li>
            <li>We were both very pleased.  </li>
            <li>HAPPY FLAT-IRONING :&gt;</li>

            <li>So I was thrilled to find this product at this price and was wondering whether it would be as good as the product I had had before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>i guess after trying out the good kind of argan oil..</li>

            <li>love the way my hair becomes silky after applying it</li>
            <li>just works as a magic .perfect product which has replaced my  hair serum, heat protector from my hair care kit.</li>

            <li>I have to say my favorite part is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>With this oil I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair without it looking severely burned.</li>
            <li>It like seals the ends of my hair making it look healthy.</li>

            <li>add more and move on to the untouched hair.</li>
            <li>Tried so many conditioners over the years.  </li>
            <li>Some were ok.  </li>
            <li>The problem is they didn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my hair smooth and friz free.  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This doesnt make my hair greasy or oily, just gives it a healthy shine.</li>

            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s better for your hair.</li>
            <li>Many products do not allow this because they make my hair greasy, and to top it off, I wouldn&#x27;t notice a deference in straightening time.</li>

            <li>I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I also like the smell of HSI&#x27;s oil better.  </li>
            <li>Some were given to me, some were in my Ipsy bag, and some I bought thinking that I might find something better.  </li>
            <li>If you wash your hair more often you would use more.  </li>

            <li>It smells wonderful and gives my not very shiny hair a nice sheen.  </li>

            <li>Compared to the Redken oil, the sample smelled &#x27;darker&#x27; or &#x27;heavier&#x27;, for lack of a better descriptor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Argan oil does make my hair shiny (which I love) and</li>
            <li>It smells like heaven and I love to touch my hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure that with continued use of this product, and maintaining better hair care, I will achieve the healthy looking hair I once had.</li>

            <li>and it works better.</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil is wonderful, not only does it make my hair silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with this stuff..</li>
            <li>I tried sooo many things and nothing</li>
            <li>Try it is a 10, leave in conditioner and it worked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started growing it out, and since those ends aren&#x27;t getting clipped every 5 weeks, the need a bit more love.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product, &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>I love this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I also cannot believe how much it helps the \\&quot;fly aways\\</li>
            <li>I 1st got this oil from Groupon with the HSI curling/flat irons and together they work like magic.</li>
            <li>It came with a 2oz bottle of the oil and when I ran out I ordered more oil from amazon.</li>
            <li>and you love that salon look,  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a product!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, then I turn the HSI bottle over in my hand 3 times while keeping my palm on top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Hsi Argan Oil helped with my frizz and static and this is a problem i have with my hair.</li>
            <li>Love using this on wet/dry hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing makes my hair shiny smooth and moisturized, would recommend this to friends</li>
            <li>:) a must.</li>
            <li>Works 10 times better than any de-tangler i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HSI profess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I went to the salon and got extensions put in for more volume.</li>
            <li>I also own HSI hair straightener, and this product combined with the straightener works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li>It is the one I use most often.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this iron and am so happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li>I still love the product, but the bottle it came in is a hassle to use.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell, I would describe it as a mix between amber and musk</li>
            <li>One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my hair, quite possibly ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, just re-ordered and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy Moroccan Oil for about 4 times the price; this works better.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into each strand, and leaves your hair silky, shiny, and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Would be more convenient if it was a pump style rather than just twist off</li>
            <li>than that such a great product!</li>
            <li>Is better than the CHI oil I was using.</li>
            <li>I wish this product had a squirt top, rather than having to pour some liquid into my hands in order to apply the product.  </li>
            <li>Product is ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for selling it as such a wonderful price!</li>
            <li>I love all of HSI products.</li>
            <li>This product met more than my expectations</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I can&#x27;t believe that the Arganesque is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Then I flat-iron, and it takes away even more.</li>
            <li>I’m sure, but</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were 5 star ratings.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that he seemed to suggest that this product did not have silicone so after seeing all the 5 star ratings along with his</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This makes it behave better than any product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I feel more than qualified to post this review.</li>
            <li>Amazing scent, light weight, leaves your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair is frizz free all day!</li>
            <li>Much better than store bought argan oils.</li>
            <li>like the swivel cord... use it with the Argan Oil---makes hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Im using now and it works better then</li>
            <li>Has a lovely fragrance also.</li>

            <li>I was really pleased with this purchase, it works just like moroccanoil but at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Well I was pleased that this gave off no nasty odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>

            <li>It feels silky smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and manageable.</li>

            <li>this one is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It smells nice kind of similar to vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a plastic bottle with a squeeze top so you can better control how much product comes out.</li>
            <li>I loved it and have since purchased two bottles of the HSI professional Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>This is the best argan oil I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many and spent way too much money.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product--after a month my hair is much healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes my hair soft.</li>

            <li>I use it , it makes my hair very smooth , but not too much oiled and make my hair very clean.</li>
            <li>it gives a shine and smell good, I can&#x27;t abuse of the amount because my hair tends to oily, but I found the right amount to use without been too much</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever, and trust me, I have spent a lot of money trying to find the right products.</li>
            <li>The best way I have found to use it is on wet hair, right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I run my fingers through my hair to make sure that the Argan oil gets to all the right places.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels right after I have straightened my hair with it.</li>

            <li>It smells great and never leaves a residue or weighs down your hair like some products do.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong chemical smell, I had to use way too much of it, and it did not make my hair much softer.</li>

            <li>This product really makes styling easy.</li>
            <li>People complimented me left and right, this flat iron was a great investment and this leave in is the bomb!</li>
            <li>I think this products is very nice, i highly recomends this to all ladies out there with African hair.</li>
            <li>Have to agree with the other reviews, this oil is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and still gonna get more when this one is gone!</li>
            <li>The easier comb-out is a real plus!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product several months ago and love it!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a product I will always make sure to have on hand!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely unbelievable how good this Argan oil hair treatment is!</li>
            <li>At first I had my doubts, but I have been using it for a month, and I really love it!,My hair is starting to look better and softer, and healthier</li>
            <li>Works very well with the HSI Flatiron that I ordered!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not oily , it leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable- very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its very light and leaves my hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all shopped Amazon, looking for a big seller with lots of positive reviews - bought it, and although good, it wasn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so I am very cautious with hair products.</li>
            <li>This product greatly helps with this, leaving my hair looking more natural - shinier and less frizzy and softer without the appearance of using a styling gel.</li>
            <li>While its not 100% Argon oil it works really well and is alot cheaper than the 100% Argon oil and works just fine on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair and when I wash it...</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li>And its just pure amazing for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite large, and it takes a tiny bit  to do the job, and so I consider it a good bargain.</li>
            <li>I was impressed because I have coarse hair, and it worked and did not leave my hair feeling very dry</li>
            <li>She says that it really improves the texture of her fine hair, and it curls and straightens much better than the old iron.</li>
            <li>thing really works, I&#x27;ve tried many many hair products including the famous Moroccan oil, none of them did what this little guy does to my hair with 2 times.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a great deal of time to really work with styling my hair (mother of a 2-year-old), but the few quick flat iron stylings I have managed to undertake seem to have produced good results.</li>
            <li>the HSI flat iron if you are interested in real sleek styles - also does a very nice flip or curl-under.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on all of the other positive reviews, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate everyone&#x27;s detailed help and I hope this helps someone as well.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing because it only helps your hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and calm after.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will bring back the glass bottles with the amazing pumps on them.</li>
            <li>so I like a product that is not too heavy but leaves a great shine on my hair.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil really keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>

            <li>This product works very well, make my hair smooth</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth  Warms up fast and doesn&#x27;t rip hair out.</li>
            <li>This product reduces frizz and keeps hair feeling smooth without adding too much oil.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, especially the smell</li>
            <li>It really helps mend my split ends and hair feels silky and smooth after using the straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>

            <li>I was happy with the vendor and product was delivered as expected, but I just didn&#x27;t care for the product so much after use.  </li>
            <li>Most of us jumped on the wagon of Morrocon Oil, but at nearly $43 a bottle, who can afford it.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Product is worth your money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>, that tends to split from frequent styling, but with this product I am able to save my hair and allow it to grow out healthier.</li>
            <li>I love this natural product.  </li>
            <li>The next day you will find your hair just as nice and still not greasy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>It has tamed my hair frizziness completely and makes my hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>This  completely transformed my hair into silky shiny healthy looking hair in a matter of a week.  </li>
            <li>After using HSI Argon oil, my hair is soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I still ordered it thinking it must be worth all the hype.</li>
            <li>I put some mayo in my hair, that worked far better.</li>
            <li>(I only use a nickel size amount in my hair as it spreads rather nicely).</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, a spray is really useful for evenly spread oil on hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing it out for about 18 months and rarely trim it.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft, shiny, and healthy.</li>
            <li>It smells great and definitely helps keep my hair soft</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients are chemical based, so I would not recommend the HSI Professional Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking a dot worth.</li>
            <li>I really like the good smell,  but I haven&#x27;t seen different in my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definently worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for nearly a month now and love the smell and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many conditioning products for my naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and then some.it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and then some.</li>
            <li>so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>the amount of money I would paid to send it back would not be cost effective.</li>
            <li>Thus far I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Hair feels incredibly soft, frizz-free and it gives my hair a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>Still, I would recommend a more natural version of this oil.</li>
            <li>I love that it makes my hair soft and helps with the frizz all while protecting it from blow drying/curling/straightening.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks fresh and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Not purfume laced, it just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope it stays at this affordable price, although it&#x27;s certainly worth $50, or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, I am able to achieve the soft shiny look that my stylist gets from my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, soft, and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>This HSI feels just like my old reliable Solia, but it&#x27;s better because it performs just as well</li>
            <li>super fine (my stylist says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;like a baby&#x27;s hair&amp;#34;) and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>I love HSO Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The HSI Professional Argan Oil leaves the hair soft and not greasy, and smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>company.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the result for my frizzy hair, I like Biosilk much better.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product and I am a woman of color with natural hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li>Love this product leaves your hair so soft and it doesnt make it look oily.  </li>
            <li>the next day I took a picture of my hair and went to work and got a few compliments that my hairdo was looking good and that I looked good.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy, shiny, and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the indulgence.</li>
            <li>I just love this oil, makes my hair so soft and it has protected it from the heat.</li>
            <li>but it works the best for restoring damaged broken or bleached hair.</li>
            <li>A relative of mine had an HSI straightener, when I tried hers, I was amazed, and when she told me the price, I HAD to order one of my own.</li>
            <li>Love this, makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>But so far no problems and love the shine my hair has.</li>
            <li>I just use a little bit right before blow drying and it gives great results.</li>
            <li>i have very fine hair, so many products weigh it down, or leave it greasy.  </li>
            <li>HSI leave in conditioner is really one of the best products if you color your hair and use flat iron daily.</li>
            <li>make the hair not dry any more, very useful production, very recommend it to you all!</li>
            <li>Before, I had been using Tresemme thermal protections, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great and leaves hair stiff like hairspray.</li>
            <li>Both of the HSI products I have are great for helping to tame my wavy curls.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many hair products, including other argan oil products, and this is my favorite oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it to help tame frizziness and manage fly aways.</li>
            <li>Only issue is it doesn&#x27;t have dropper but other than that excellent quality product.</li>
            <li>Received a free sample of this with my HSI flat iron purchase and was so pleased I ordered a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Also use to tame fly away hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I wanted to give everyone a quick breakdown of what&#x27;s in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I loved the product so much that when I discovered there was a flat iron to work along with the oil</li>
            <li>When it was the perfect pour, it was great, but too much will leave you greasy and too little left my hair dry.</li>
            <li>This oil leaves my hair very manageable and more importantly it doesn&#x27;t weight it down but gives it a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve decided to purchase because this product is very light and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for flat iron users.</li>
            <li>I got a sample bottle with my flat iron and liked it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know it will also protect my hair when I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li>Nice with flat iron also</li>
            <li>Not as good as other people described.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the Argan oil before I put the flat iron to it.</li>
            <li>good size bottle will last a long time :)</li>
            <li>Now here I am, a grandma with silver hair using the HSI flat hair iron I purchsed online through Amazon and really loving it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shine it gave my hair when I used the flat iron.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers were right - they smell really good.  </li>
            <li>Well, an hour later I finally got to see myself in the mirror, and voila, non-frizzy, awesome, super soft curls.</li>
            <li>Well, an hour later I finally got to see myself in the mirror, and voila, non-frizzy, awesome, super soft curls.</li>
            <li>and I use this mostly right now as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>Once you find the right amount of pumps your hair needs, you will never look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>apply it before straightening and it softens the hair up right away.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time and with everything</li>
            <li>I put this on after my hair is washed and it absorbs right in.  </li>
            <li>one thing, I can&#x27;t seem to get the amount right every time...</li>
            <li>It leaves just the right about of</li>
            <li>I use it before I apply heat to my hair and sometimes right out of the shower for conditioning.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t have the money to get one right away</li>
            <li>WORKED ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S THICK FRIZZIE HAIR, WORKED ON MY SON&#x27;S CURLS (WITHOUT FLATIRON :), WORKED ON MY DRY DAMAGED HAIR EXCELLENT THERMAL PROTECTOR.</li>
            <li>This makes your hair shiny and soft, your hair will feel so healthy after you put this in your hair, I use it so much and it lasts ages!</li>
            <li>Oh, and the smell is wonderful and very subtle.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the sample a try and the results actually turned out pretty nicely even before I&#x27;d started using the iron.</li>
            <li>Instantly Makes your hair silky, shiny and gives it a healthy look- check mark - true</li>
            <li>I put it on my hair after shower and it dries up sooo soft without even using the hot iron and when I do use it, the results are even better.</li>
            <li>This is a great little bottle of oil!</li>
            <li>The HSI Professional Argan Oil is a phenomenal product that left my hair feeling silky smooth and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it, and it just absorbs this product leaving my hair feeling smooth and looking shiny and healthy not greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use less and then add in more oil if you need</li>
            <li>The only positive about this product is the nice smell.</li>
            <li>In our quest we have had some success but none that have given us consistent results like this product.  </li>
            <li>It has considerably lessened the redness due to rosacea and serves as a perfect, light, daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Considering how much use I&#x27;ve gotten and still have a practical full bottle, the price is pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering how much use I&#x27;ve gotten and still have a practical full bottle, the price is pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Felt every drop is absorbed and my hair got softer in the first time use.</li>
            <li>Ok so...I&#x27;ve been using argan  oil in general for about 2 years</li>
            <li>What I got was beautiful shiny glossy hair especially after I used my HSI ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s aroma, while being pleasant, is a little over powering.</li>
            <li>Obviously if you pour an oil, you&#x27;re not going to get a perfect 2-3 drops; you&#x27;re going to get a little handful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like pure silk for my hair!</li>
            <li>Works exactly how it should and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because I live in Florida and it helps so much with humidity and frizz but also with dry</li>
            <li>Make&#x27;s your hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I had dried and deeply damaged hair, but it becomes silky and beautiful after using this product!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product since it makes her hair soft and nice, and I have ordered it twice so far.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly, and is a very generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have greasy hair naturally, so I can easily go a week between washes when straightening.</li>

            <li>Great for African American hair.</li>
            <li>I had a question regarding packaging and they were very prompt in replying adequately.  </li>
            <li>A must have for me, a new forever product!!!  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for a couple of months now, and can honestly say that I can not live without it.</li>
            <li>Makes her hair very straight and soft and easy to manage for her.</li>
            <li>I compared it to my Moraccan Oil Light MoroccanoilTreatment which does not protect my hair from heat at all and ends up drying my fine hair after using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>But I tried the HSI Argan oil on my damp hair before blow dry, the result was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very smooth, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>got here very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much, so the bottle lasts longer than you would think.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>I reserve one star in that the product is new to me and I must try it out under stringent circumstances to be sure to respond accurately to those who, like me, depend almost entirely on customer reviews in choosing products online.  </li>
            <li>The comb glides right through and my hair is more amenable to my attempts to control it in general.</li>
            <li>After using this product several times, I am very happy with the silky, soft results that it has given my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy versatility in my styles and this product makes my hair smooth, shiny &amp; protected for blow out and flat iron styles.</li>
            <li>I kept my 5 yr old niece over the holidays and this is what she used instead of conditioner on her baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>... Protects my hair and leaves it looking and feeling silky smooth after each pass with my HSI flat iron - which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up nicely and glides through my hair removing any &#x27;frizzies&#x27; and leaving it shiny and bouncy straight.  </li>
            <li>I run this through my hair before I blow dry it every morning, and it leaves my hair easy to straighten and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Left her hair super soft and shiny and more importantly to her - straight.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent where the Moroccan Oil has a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a straightener, I strongly recommend theirs, it is half the price of a Chi, with much better results and durability.</li>
            <li>Loved this Argan Oil more than any other because it makes your smooth &amp; shiny -without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my hair was dull and frizzy from over processing and was really happy with the result.</li>
            <li>no other product has given me such good and instantaneous results.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go with the HSI Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and works well to keep my fine hair from turning into a frizzy mess using the iron to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way ... and it will leave your hair looking great!</li>
            <li>Bought a long time, just use it, rub the hair soft and bright, and I like it.</li>
            <li>Great for flat ironing with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>i had some doubts at first .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This fluid is &#x27;lighter&#x27; and works much better for her.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several brands of argan oil and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I got my first trial with the hsi iron.</li>
            <li>I may not have had to do that if I had used it first.</li>
            <li>and I color it and use hot irons and curlers.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this product better is for it to have a dropper.</li>
            <li>I first got a sample with a straightening iron I purchased.</li>
            <li>This last week I went for a haircut and my stylist complimented me on how healthy my hair has become.  </li>
            <li>It not only protects, it also nuirish my hair and gives it a healthy look.</li>
            <li>This oil leaves my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops which I use mostly on the edges and then comb through from the edges to the crown.</li>
            <li>It makes her hair smell fantastic and it feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Also this is my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much longer than before that I even get commented on its length!</li>
            <li>Works great on my course, thick and frizzy hair that needs heat treating.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing the Argan Oil</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t left with a oily residue and my hair looked so shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because of the stellar reviews and rating.</li>
            <li>I would like this product more if it was packaged differently.  </li>
            <li>This product instantly make my hair silky, shines and healthy look.</li>
            <li>Really prompt delivery too!</li>
            <li>I first tried it when I received a sample along with the HSI straightener.</li>
            <li>First time buyer.  </li>
            <li>use it only as a product that gives a healthy shine to your hair, and NOT as a heat protectant.    </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair shiny and not frizzy!</li>
            <li>I haver very wavy and unruly hair, but this makes it so manageable!</li>
            <li>Please be aware that the first ingredient listed in there is SILICONE</li>
            <li>and I tried many products in an attempt to bring life back to my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great for my thick, sometimes frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and more manageable now - and if I decide to add curls, the curls last all day without adding hair spray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first two listed ingredients are Dimethicone Crosspolyme (DC) and Cyclopentasiloxane (CYC).  </li>
            <li>This product actually really worked!  </li>
            <li>Notably it disappeared into my skin almost instantly, leaving a sense of a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34; if that is the correct term.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and smooth, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But today was the first day I used this product, and I was floored by the results.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty pressed for words.  </li>
            <li>If you put aside that fact that its mostly chemicals and not 100% Argan Oil, it actually worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I read a ton of the reviews for this stuff and obviously it sounded like liquid gold or something.</li>
            <li>This is the sole product I use on my hair to make it sleek, shiny, and incredibly healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>If you use to much it can make your hair look greasy!</li>
            <li>This is my second order I love it</li>
            <li>The packaging was pretty beat up when I received it.</li>
            <li>I was paying 75 dollars a bottle exactly this size.</li>
            <li>I definitely got better,</li>
            <li>It definitely made my hair more shiny and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, I don&#x27;t write reviews recently but had to on this one.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the HSI straightener about a year ago and they had sent a sample of this Argan Oil leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I like it at first.</li>
            <li>first time I rubbed this in my hair</li>
            <li>Hair is smooth and soft for days.  </li>
            <li>would like to buy more and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>prompt shipment, first time I&#x27;ve used argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>The only thing I have noticed is my hair has a lot of static since I started using this.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, and it has done wonders in my hair care.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a salon look without paying salon prices!</li>
            <li>My initial reason for purchasing was for the shine, which it does do, although, I wish more so.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a dime sized drop and I had better hair.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>So straightening has been a constant challenge and most irons and hair product</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a leave in to me, more like an oil</li>
            <li>My hair is so much shinier since I started using this oil!</li>
            <li>(I use tresemme heat tamer on hair first, then blow dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Ten Miracle Texture Fiber to separate out pieces and spray with favorite finishing spray.</li>
            <li>I was so upset as I just could not match the extensions texture to the texture of my real hair!</li>
            <li>but it does not last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the same consistency and works a lot better.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays the way I styled it for much longer than it would without this product and it smells heavenly!</li>
            <li>However, it should last a while. :)</li>
            <li>I tried for the first time and</li>
            <li>I tried many different oils</li>
            <li>Really recommend!</li>
            <li>Over all, I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone with similar problems to myself or anyone just looking for a quality product.</li>
            <li>Pretty effortless.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly what you are looking for in a thermal protector.</li>
            <li>With each section I flat-ironed, I dipped my pointer finger in the oil, rubbed it between my first two fingers and my thumb, and applied it to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of argan oil through my hairdresser to the tune of $40.</li>
            <li>I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased at least 80 products trying to find something and so happy with this.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this, use it daily.</li>
            <li>I like it better than biosilk and a similar paul Mitchel product.</li>
            <li>I have drawn enough comparisons to say this is nowhere close to magic in a (very impractical, glass, open-pour) bottle!</li>
            <li>Only issue i have with it is the bottle, i tend to pour more than needed on my hand.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I used it for the first time and it leaves</li>
            <li>I absolutely love beauty products, so any opportunities that present themselves to me are amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recieved another sample that was more then enough, this product with or with out  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and frizz free with every application.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle ordered 5 months ago.</li>
            <li>Was apprehensive at first thinking it would leave my hair oily but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, is a great flat iron for the price.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>The results are higher than my expectations.</li>
            <li>Ok, bought this in bulk last time.</li>
            <li>I have had shoulder length and more recently short:  </li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft and damage free.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty frizzy with fly-aways everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I just got my first haircut since using this product.  </li>
            <li>As my hair stylist worked with my hair, she was commenting on how healthy and moisturized it was, and asked what I was doing differently.  </li>
            <li>Buyers be aware.</li>
            <li>After the first apply of this HSI leave in oil I started to feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product a handful of times since purchasing and it works really well!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li>This is the first bottle of argon oil that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my hair smooth soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t use hair products but this thing, I love it, leaves it looking natural.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Works like more expensive treatments at a better price, leaving my hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>Will I buy leave-in treatment conditioner again – ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li>Just let the oil soak in your hair at first then style.</li>
            <li>I have had better experiences using Argan Oil by One and Only.</li>
            <li>I ended up using my Argan Oil by One and Only and had better results.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>I still have fly-aways even after ironing my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t completely frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil will always keep a extra</li>
            <li>I have thick,curly,frizzy hair and this oil is exactly what my hair needed.</li>
            <li>Between the heat styling tools and my thyroid, maintaining healthy, moisturized hair is a losing battle, especially through Ohio winters.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After a few days of using it I absolutely loved it ❤</li>
            <li>it smells nice and very light, but i don&#x27;t c anything different from my other cheaper products that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The most important point to note here, is that I went home afer getting caught in the rain, rubbed a pea size amount of the product throughout my hair, combed down &amp; tucked in the ends</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it would be worth it for me to spend that kind of money to dump half a bottle in my hair once or twice a month, but it&#x27;s tempting.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair so soft and silky!!!!</li>
            <li>The good: It really does make my hair very slick and smooth...</li>
            <li>I bought this at the last minute (impluse buy) but based on all the positive reviews I figured it would be a safe bet.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly long, layered hair and even when I would flat iron it, there was always fly aways.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple different argon oils and this  by far is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Thanks Blue Novelties for having such a great product and pricing it reasonably.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely, delicate scent which relaxes me and makes me feel happy, so I use it as aromatherapy especially when I gently massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li>It also smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel oily like lots of other AA hair products do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, and will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>This item delivered as promised and I love the look of my hair after using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love how this product make&#x27;s my hair feel before and after flat ironing.</li>
            <li>and I use my flat iron on most days.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron oil.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe I put up with any other conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice scent to it though and is not oily like some of the other serums.</li>
            <li>Also, products claiming to last a week with straight awesome hair with washes are pointless for me since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t thought of using any sort of protective conditioner for my hair with my flat iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I have been introduced to this as I feel like I&#x27;m being proactive in keeping my hair from getting damaged.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other products she&#x27;s tried, it smells really nice, too.</li>
            <li>I love this oil to help keep my hair from frizzing and to help protect it from the flat iron heat.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I flat iron my hair and love the results.</li>
            <li>sure to buy it with the HSI flat iron</li>
            <li>While most people (probably) use it during heat styling, I also use it as just a leave-in even when I don&#x27;t style with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Really does make your hair silky and shiny, and just look healthy, but if you use a lot on one section of your hair it will weigh it down, so even with it being a light oil, it still can buildup and create a greasy problem</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>Hair is really silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Service was great, I received it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous other top of the line products and this one if the best I&#x27;ve had at half the cost!  </li>
            <li>I only use 2-3 drops for my shoulder length hair and my hair would be nice and smooth once I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>So it seems to work as an ok humidity protector, but I&#x27;ll have to wait to the next summer to experience the DC heatwave to see how it holds up in very humid conditions.</li>
            <li>It leaves my naturally curly, color treated hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Particularly effective for keeping curly hair soft with daily swimming.</li>
            <li>but in a good way, okay that sounds weird..</li>
            <li>I tried another more expensive brand, and it made our hair look greasy and didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, there&#x27;s no way this would add that much volume, but for what I have it does an incredible job.</li>
            <li>It just makes my hair so much more manageable and really helps to protect my hard-won straightness from humidity (which is a constant issue in my part of the world).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, so it will last for a year or even more.</li>
            <li>Love this product because it makes my natural hair soft and manageable....</li>
            <li>Now be aware you aren’t buying pure argan oil, and it has some synthetic stuff in there</li>
            <li>I have pretty &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; hair that likes to do everything except settle down and look nice.  </li>
            <li>Her hair after using both this and my flat iron is straight, soft, and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better and I have received compliments on how shinny and healthy my hair looks which is amazing since I damaged it pretty bad from coloring/hi-lighting.  </li>
            <li>the shower and my hair dries super soft!</li>
            <li>Despite that, it&#x27;s pretty healthy, mainly because I keep it fairly short.  </li>
            <li>With the HSI it looked halfway decent the first day, then better the second day, after I&#x27;d flat-ironed again.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>this stuff is awesome to use as directed when flat ironing, but I have fine hair and usually when I put this stuff all over, I have to wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li>it has a great smell (not strong though) and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It helps tame the frizz, leaves my hair feeling  smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Since then, using the Argan oil before I begin styling, I have noticed a positive difference in the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>I love the product, especially for my natural hair; my hair feels silky soft and easy to manage in any style.</li>
            <li>Either way it cuts down tremendously on the frizz, and leaves it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It really makes hair soft, shiny and frizz free when you useable straight iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I have used other top brand serums in the past but this one works best especially when blending my hair with weaves.</li>
            <li>I am still in love with this stuff, and I think I always will be as long as they keep making it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the HSI iron and argan oil, I have had more success than all other products I tried.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product I woke up with much \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels oily when first applied, but seems to to really distribute well once it is heated when hair is styled.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient in this product is silicone, it makes you makes you wonder how much argon oil is in it,</li>
            <li>First thing I always check, how much does something smell.  </li>
            <li>I decided to switch back to Morrocan oil until I came across this product and due to the great reviews decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re not an accident-prone person or living with kids, you should be okay.</li>
            <li>My hair is really long so maintaining split ends is no joke, but this has kept my hair healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>When I use my curling iron or flat iron, my hairstyle stays in place all day and is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Good luck trying to get a small amount out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Since i use my flat iron often, it feels good having extra protection.  </li>
            <li>I bought other products that claimed to be argan oils, and they were nowhere near as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Some hair oils make your hair fabulous but after 1 week feel super dry without it</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair dry or wet, whether I&#x27;m using styling tools or not, although their (hsi) flat iron is great when I get around to doing  my hair. :)</li>
            <li>If your hair feels too dry, use more.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Ok guys, if you have dry damaged hair with splits like me, get it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Mine was getting old and I wanted something nicer, so I checked out Amazon&#x27;s selection and was quickly sold on this one.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel super soft.</li>
            <li>It works just as promised and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is always super soft and I get compliments from others on the smell.</li>
            <li>No more frizz and fly aways when I straighten my naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have healthy but dry hair with some gray</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Makes hair drying time quick and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had an old bottle with a pump that I cleaned out and put this product into so that was helpful.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil, it makes my hair feel ft and shiney even after blowing my hair dry every day</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it keeps my hair shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>It is really soft now, full but not flyaway, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Had to back my good review because this product didn&#x27;t work for me in long run.</li>
            <li>Not at all, even in large amounts.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Buy the large bottle, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>Beware and be smart before buying.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an all-natural pure argan oil, this product is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But with this product, I NEVER have to use the flat iron spray, my hair is now easy to get straight (and takes less time) plus feels silky smooth!!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when using this leave-in conditioner for the very first time.</li>
            <li>I apply it before I flat iron, and it leaves my hair very silky, not greasy, the way it is packaged for shipping needs improvement, but other than that, its a great product.</li>
            <li>I recently dropped a brand new bottle on my tile bathroom floor causing the bottle to shatter and the precious oil to spill all over the place.</li>
            <li>The lid was loose and I&#x27;m glad I got it when I did, as it would have gone everywhere</li>
            <li>try it, you have nothing to loose :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair and it does great for both.</li>
            <li>Works great on both wet and dry hair without messing my hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a black female and this works great for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li>It leaves it super soft, straight, and silky.....</li>
            <li>The only drawback is you can easily use too much.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair manageable and super soft.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner lends a wonderful sheen and the entire effect lasts for at least 4 days! &#x27;</li>
            <li>included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to actually straighten it.</li>
            <li>She had fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>I will gladly purchase more of this, as it seemed to help way more than other, more expensive options!</li>
            <li>The argon oil is thick in texture, but it is super light once you smooth it into your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product i have very dry freeze hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry from dying over many years.  </li>
            <li>I put just a little in my hands, warm it up and run all through my wet/damp hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less expensive, smells better, and most importantly works better.</li>
            <li>so I wanted a nice light weight oil that didn&#x27;t weight my hair down while flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>Made the flat iron glide through easy too.</li>
            <li>If I use my flat iron and no oil (or another brand of oil I used to use) my hair will straighten easily but curl as soon as I get warm/</li>
            <li>soft, shiny and smells good (just use a little or you will have greasy hair).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is great for the fact it can be used on dry hair whereas other products cannot be.  </li>
            <li>it has a very high amount of silicone in it which makes it seem extra smooth but is very drying to my hair.</li>
            <li>the 4 oz size is HUGE and will last for months.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again,, It made my hair so straight, shinny and feels so light and manageable.</li>
            <li>, I ended up getting too much of it out</li>
            <li>thanks for all the reviews in here that helped me alot to emagine what im going to feel.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t not that this bottle is used , very disappoints ;(</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I went somewhere very humid &amp; didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in hair.  </li>
            <li>I notice that it is easier to straight iron my hair</li>
            <li>Hair used to look damaged after so much color treatment.</li>
            <li>After using this product I can really notice the difference in how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>This product is very comparable to the CHI SILK INFUSION.</li>
            <li>I really like this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really ever have split ends</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel oily even though I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>oily, dries fast and my hair shines beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>It really helps my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really damaged my hair by going ombre.  </li>
            <li>gently squeeze my flattened palms together.</li>
            <li>Works well and my color lasted much longer, in spite of being in the sun.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really works on all sorts of hair.</li>
            <li>And at a reasonable price?  </li>
            <li>Been using it for months now and don&#x27;t really notice any benefits from using this product</li>
            <li>My hair has also stopped breaking off as much</li>
            <li>I wanted to see for myself why Argan oil is making so much buzz.</li>
            <li>Like all things that generate hype, I was very skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did experience frizz but not so much that my hair drew up into a cloud/mushroom.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very time-consuming to style.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair is much healthier and silky</li>
            <li>It really does help protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>With really course hair</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after buying the HSI ceramic straight iron for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am very  impress with this product .</li>
            <li>Smooth, not sticky and can last longer.</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and tends to frizz, but when I put this product on my hair it makes it look smooth and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I find if I use too much in my hair, it becomes frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have to say it has a very silky feel without an oily residue.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I think this product really helps to style your hair easier and after blow drying, it literally looks and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your fast delivery.</li>
            <li>You will really like it.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute miracle in a bottle .My</li>

            <li>Absorbs well and very durable.</li>
            <li>Wife really loves this product for her hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was really damaged from bleaching it.</li>
            <li>I really believe it is what repaired my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it builds up in your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get it, this leave in conditioner did absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair responds and feels...</li>
            <li>and it straightens much easier than before.</li>
            <li>This is really a five-star product, but I deducted a star&lt;br /&gt;for packaging.</li>
            <li>Absolutely yes</li>
            <li>Adds softness, sheen, and really feels like it conditions the hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a leave-in light oil to use daily and my mom recommended that I buy Argan oil.</li>
            <li>It is fuller, softer and so much healthier looking that it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law absolutely loves the stuff though.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair that I wear mostly straight.</li>
            <li>I have really stubborn hair for straightening.</li>
            <li>It does what it wants when it wants to.</li>
            <li>Bought it because a tiny sampler came in my HSI straightener - which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>it does make it much smoother and easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>she seems to really like it</li>
            <li>much ie:</li>
            <li>I then went on to straight my hair and thats when I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this purchase; you will not regret it!</li>
            <li>I have not been having as much breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used too much - hair</li>
            <li>But I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much work it takes out of blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been really helping.</li>
            <li>and now we are both really</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been colored and highlighted, and frankly, after this summer, was really unmanagable.  </li>
            <li>The ends felt like straw, no matter how much I conditioned them, and my hair floated around my face.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>and I have very thick/long hair.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this out</li>
            <li>I have curly, and frizzy hair that I wear straight.</li>
            <li>It kept my hair straight and no frizz.</li>
            <li>When I used this, it really made my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very silky and shiny (and I have very wavy hair).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a long-term difference in the moisture or shine of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and it absolutely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very versatile.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and shipped within Amazon Prime&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and straight and shiny for days - and this is a big deal since I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Very protective.  </li>
            <li>This one fits the bill at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Then again, I didn&#x27;t notice much of the perfume after I&#x27;d styled my hair with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still straight, even after I took a shower this morning.</li>
            <li>This did not do a thing for my hair except to make it look very greasy.</li>
            <li>I Bleach my hair and this really tames the frizz and dryness</li>
            <li>It has really helped keep the integrity of my overly processed hair.</li>
            <li>This is just enough to then smooth through my hair.</li>
            <li>The oil leaves hair very shiny but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It stops my hair from frizzing out and it really stops the damage from heat.</li>
            <li>she has very curly &amp;#34;Shirley Temple&amp;#34; type of hair and maybe the tropical heat plus her hair</li>
            <li>I use it after blowdrying my hair and before using a straight iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>It made a real difference to my chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Since she has been using it, her hair is much healthier and there are no signs of damage.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>After I swim and wash my hair, I use a lot more on my wet hair, but it never makes it oily and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged after exposure to chlorine in the pool.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets really frizzy though</li>
            <li>and it really isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It took about 4 &amp;#34;pours&amp;#34; into the saucer to do my whole head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always get way more oil on my hand than I expected.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe there was that much difference in brands.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it’s really helping my hair on styling days.</li>
            <li>In fact they are very close in their ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>but I really like what I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My hair was very shiny too.  </li>
            <li>It really protects my hair and leaves it so shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pin straight with no kinks or frizz and its even easier to control how you want the flip at the end of your hair.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair has been much healthier and</li>
            <li>We really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have found it works better for me if I put it on while my hair is wet or damp.</li>
            <li>HSI has really made a difference in the appearance and condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended this product to friends and am looking forward to hearing if they like the oil as much as I do.</li>
            <li>My hair now looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>My wife really loves this product.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: I would recommend trying this product to anyone who wants straighter, shinier hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have very unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of different products to get my hair to lay smooth.  </li>
            <li>but it does not take much and it leaves my hair silky and as full/light as I want it to be.  </li>
            <li>It helps hide some of my really damaged parts.  </li>
            <li>When the sample was empty she insisted on 2 more bottles of this argan oil.</li>
            <li>So far worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Its texture is thicker than cooking oil, so using too much could make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing as much shine with this either.</li>
            <li>I had to think about if or a week before spending this amount on this product because I can find Argan oil for much cheaper, and I have used Argon oil but not from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it being so much healthier.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute go to</li>
            <li>The oil really helps prevent my hair from getting those sizzled ends (those who have damaged, fried hair know what I&#x27;m talking about)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an argan oil that is non greasy and flake free after multiple uses, and this product has surpass my expectations.</li>
            <li>Either way I would like to find out, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter because this product really works.  </li>
            <li>and it straightened so fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and very touchable.</li>
            <li>it really helps manage my hair and control friz.</li>
            <li>I have hair that can tend to get oily fast, and I struggle with applying conditioner because I never know if it is really needed and then regret how frizzy/over oily my hair looks after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li>The leave in-treatment really does help make my bleached hair feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really have seen a difference in my hair since I have used this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this product and leaving it in my hair, it&#x27;s left my hair so silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I have VERY think hair and iron it probably every 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>(Argan oil is very greasy.)</li>
            <li>it feeling very silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier</li>
            <li>hair is smooth as silk when I use it, and I only have to use it once after washing my hair</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil really sets it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i believe it was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>For the first time in a long time I was able to go natural after a week of using the Aegean oil.</li>
            <li>It was nice to only have to order 1 larger bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, and any leftover oil quickly absorbs in my alreay dry hands.</li>
            <li>I liked how it worked immediately after I put it on; however, after a few hours it seemed as if I never even put it on.</li>
            <li>Love this product and definitely would recommend to anyone looking for soft hair.</li>
            <li>Overall she has been thrilled with the product, with her only wish being that she found it sooner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and smooth not heavy</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not kidding it definitely tricks people into thinking I have luxurious, soft, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely thick and hard to straighten, however with thisoil and the HSI straightener, what used to take me at least an hour on a good day now takes about 25 minutes and my hair is nice and smooth!!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair which is normally very dry, extremely soft &amp; it is a great protector when using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>the HSI flat iron if you are interested in real sleek styles - also does a very nice flip or curl-under.yer at a time to flat iron if you have extra curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>so so soft!!!</li>
            <li>I am very stingy with the amount of oil I use, and even just a little goes a long way and keeps my hair smooth (and smelling great) for 3-5 days in my personal experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and was worried the oil would weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This absorbs right into the stands and immediately makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower and go to bed, waking with soft, manageable and shiny (not greasy) hair.</li>
            <li>This update is just a couple days after my original review, which means that after just a few weeks of using this product, my hair stylist noticed a huge difference in the healthiness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>this product is good but not different than any other Argan oil out there.</li>
            <li>it might not have functions to make hair softer, reduce losing hairs, and the kind of botter is not easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used one other spray product and while that worked for a couple of weeks, I noticed the leave-in spray stopped making my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the silky soft salon results when using this argan oil and then flat ironing my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried one other moroccan oil hair treatment from another company, but I really prefer this HSI Argan oil over it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>My hair is soft shiny and smells lovely after using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This argan oil leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and I love that it also has a thermal protector for when I use my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other similar products, but this one is superior.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to allow my hair to grow; therefore a combination of significantly reducing the amount of heat I use, deep conditioning once per week, and moisturizing/wrapping my hair with a satin scarf each night has really helped.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, however, I have super fine hair and it is still a little frizzy at the ends with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>After playing around with it a little bit I realized the best way to use this was to put very little conditioner in my hair and then apply the argon oil after I blowdried it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic effect on hair - makes it shiny, straight, adds moisture, most effective styling natural product before blowdry, especially well suited for thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil based on the other reviews I read - and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I also love that doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy like other oils.</li>
            <li>Product leaves hair shiny and smooth and protects it from my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I no longer use other styling product that contains more chemicals.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>I like HSI argan oil because it is better than other argan oils for the price.  </li>
            <li>I would love to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried many other smoothing serums, anti-frizz products, conditioners, etc.  </li>
            <li>have used it every other day since I got it a couple of weeks ago, and have even started getting compliments about how shiny and healthy my hair looks, already!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so its a great buy.</li>
            <li>Better than any other product she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried other argan oil products  which work better.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this product more compare to the other argan oil leave-in treatment I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products containing Argan oil, but this one works better than the others I have tried (maybe because it has fewer other ingredients and more Argan oil?  </li>
            <li>I used it the first day I received it--just a little bit rubbed between my palms &amp; smoothed over the top of my hair, focusing on the ends that are damaged.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write a review, but this product wowed me!</li>
            <li>If you want smooth and shiny, use it with the flat iron, but you can skip the iron just to control frizz.</li>
            <li>After several months of moderate use, it did smooth out frizzy hair especially on the ends, leaves hair soft,  and smells nice for the whole family.</li>
            <li>My ends are dry and break off so easy...</li>
            <li>Purchased from Amazon saved a trip to the store and cost less, most important, Satisfaction or money back, Win,win situation.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great is a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li>Flat ironing much less damaging because I don&#x27;t have to do as many passes to get smooth, shiny straight hair.</li>
            <li>, I recently got caught in a misty, dewy, humid mess one night and my straight hair held up fairly well to the moisture.</li>
            <li>Using just a bit of this oil keeps my hair straight almost all day long - I&#x27;ll see some very light wave return around my face by the end of the day, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>She highly recommends the oil for anyone that uses a straight iron.</li>
            <li>I was actually pretty pissed when I received this product at first, mostly because I just spent 17 bucks on a tiny bottle, however, after using it</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I really thought I was just going to have to live with it my whole life until i came upon this product.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments left and right!  </li>
            <li>I have thought of putting some in its own dropper type bottle so that I don&#x27;t use to much as a tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I use the HSI Argan Oil when my hair is at that almost dry stage by gently pouring a dollop into my hand and lightly massage it through the tresses.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair look and feel nice only after I blow dry it with a boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I use it before I blow dry, on my near blond highlights that have been bleached one time too many.</li>
            <li>They look very soft, smooth and silky by only using this serum.</li>
            <li>This oil left my wife&#x27;s hair very soft to the touch and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and fine and there is a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>It works well on my dry fine hair in dime size doses.</li>
            <li>After i used this the first time i realized this product made my hair just as soft just as manageable</li>
            <li>I can even BRUSH MY HAIR DRY without it getting super frizzy!</li>
            <li>First product ever to leave my hair so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, one of my friends noticed immediately and told me my hair looked so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>and you will not get no where near as much!</li>
            <li>I first tried HSI Professional Argan Oil when my stylist gave me a sample bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The HSI Argan Oil  is actually a leave-in treatment conditioner, that literally felt like true &amp;</li>
            <li>I used the product prior to styling with the HSI Professional Flat Iron (also a phenomenal product!).</li>
            <li>I have pretty damaged hair, but also prone to getting greasy which it will if you get this anywhere near your roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of old ladies with lovely soft gray hair, but mine&#x27;s coming in frizzy and coarse.</li>
            <li>I use moroccan oil too... but that usually is a little more greasy looking on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do put this on your ends like I do... be generous but not sloppy.</li>
            <li>the flat iron hands down best spent money on amazon to date!</li>
            <li>With just a small amount, rubbed together in your hands and slid down the ends of your hair, will leave it shiny, soft, non frizzy and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>I would apply more right after I blow dry for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It is very light on my hair and takes a lot for it to get greasy but it never really gets that lush shinny look that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I got a few bottles for my friends as &#x27;late&#x27; new years gifts :)</li>
            <li>This product absolutely does (be careful if you have fine hair however</li>
            <li>I use quite a lot of it, and often for consecutive days without washing, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down the way many products do.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and most oils typically are too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, curly hair which I regularly blow dry straight and require a heat protectant for.</li>
            <li>The HSI&#x27;s plates close together completely, too, so it actually catches every hair (without snagging it!), which has made a huge difference in my level of frizzies and flyaways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>although I find if I do this I need to smooth an additional drop or two on my dry finished hair.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product almost four months ago and its more than half.</li>
            <li>After I wash and dry my hair, I pour a dime-sized amount onto my hand, rub to disperse and smooth it into my hair.</li>
            <li>I can use it when my hair is damp and when it is dry either way it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I notice a slight difference but nothing magical.</li>
            <li>I just use it once after shower while my mom&#x27;s hair which is more coarse require daily application at the moment.   </li>
            <li>First thing first, i felt the smoothness instantly as im spreading the drops through my hair.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product with mainly &amp;</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and I am planning on getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of this type of conditioner and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Blue Novelties shipped the product quickly in a well-packed box, and then did a quality-control follow-up.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The HSI doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hot to the touch, and the outside of the iron doesn&#x27;t feel hot at all.</li>
            <li>Be careful though--my first full glass bottle fell an inch onto the floor and shattered.</li>
            <li>The secret to awesome curls is use this oil while wet, then don&#x27;t touch it while drying.  </li>
            <li>The secret to awesome curls is use this oil while wet, then don&#x27;t touch it while drying.  </li>
            <li>, now I wash it once a week as it stays soft and straight for much longer.</li>
            <li>I keep buying this particular brand because the soft/shiny results without the greasy/build up</li>
            <li>I will continue use the product and see if I would like it further more since I have only used it twice after I received it.  </li>
            <li>I also add a smaller amount to the top of my head (what&#x27;s left on my hands after distribution to the rest of my hair), and I&#x27;m amazed that it doesn&#x27;t cause any flattening at</li>
            <li>and she preferred a Chi which this particular store did not sale</li>
            <li>, you DO NOT need to put the product on your roots, only midlength to the ends).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great value, you only need a little to be effective, even on long hair (mine is past my shoulder blades, and while it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone with naturally curly/frizzy hair that wants it to be straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored every 5 weeks, hot dryer, and flat Iron, &amp; it stays super soft and silky with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and a little goes along way!</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of it and also makes my hair shiny and smooth, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (other hair products tend to do that).</li>
            <li>You use a TINY bit and it makes your hair SUPER soft!!</li>
            <li>I put it on before I flat-iron, and my hair stays straight and silky soft for days!</li>
            <li>My hair was easier to straighten and after sleeping on it, the next day my hair was still very straight!</li>
            <li>i have thick hair &amp; love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use too much but a money saver once you get the hang of how little you really need.</li>
            <li>But overall it improves my hair immensely, it feels great and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li>, I hope it need more tight sealing cap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>

            <li>I will try it again in the spring / summer to see if it helps when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li>so can not tell if it is helping shield my hair from high heated styling tools.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I came back from the break, my school friend love to brush my hair since I used this product for several months, my hair really gotten silky soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Argan oils and this is the perfect consistency for hair--not too oily and not to watery, plus a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair every other day and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried other products, but says that just a tiny bit of this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American woman who has experienced significantly less breakage.</li>
            <li>but I think I like the end result with the HSI Professional ARGAN oil more than with the other Argan oils.</li>
            <li>I never tried any sort of leave in hair old before a free sample came with a flat iron I purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it protects my hair even though I flat iron it daily after sweating from workouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Read countless reviews of other brands and honestly 3 or 4-ish stars</li>
            <li>All I can add to that is, I even use this when I am going with my natural wavy hair, and that I certainly will be repurchasing this soon (backup).</li>
            <li>I add a little more to the ends.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for months, both in my hair, as was recommended by my stylist, but I also put a little bit on my face each morning after shaving.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this little bottle of miracles.</li>
            <li>Of course, I purchased many other thermal protectors, but each were thrown out or donated to someone else after the first of second use.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and silky!!</li>
            <li>If you use it sparingly it will leave your hair soft and shiny!!  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to get straighter with this product but some of the ends are a little more frayed.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny and it&#x27;s super soft with no static!</li>
            <li>Wife liked it so much this is the 2nd big bottle we have bought (had 2 sample bottles before from flat iron purchase).</li>
            <li>I use this before straightening my hair and it makes it very smooth and soft without the weighted down oily feeling.</li>
            <li>It is easily comparable to other leave-in conditioners at twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will straighten fairly easily, but with other products or without any products, i end up with somewhat \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>I wrote the review below when my hair was unprocessed (dye free).</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is much lighter and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It will be soft and straight.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the HSI professional argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every conditioner and nothing seemed to give my hair a soft and gentle texture and prevent it from poofing.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>Really makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>hair looks like I came from a salon... very shiny, soft and manageable...</li>
            <li>It really does leave your hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>oil leaves my hair feeling soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Argan oil u know that is expensive so for this price is great.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing much easier and leave it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to the expensive Moroccan oil I had been buying and came across all the great reviews here.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny after use, you really must try the product for yourself.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have split ends anymore thanks to HSO Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can then flatten or fluff the hair as I see fit.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear my natural, 4b hair straight.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so soft and silky and feels soo much healthier too.</li>
            <li>But it would be better if there is a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; for the bottle so that I could get a few drop of oil in an easier way.</li>
            <li>I have thick, frizzy hair and this (and a hot iron) makes it silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I honestly was pretty skeptical about this product when I first got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally frizzy and wavy.  </li>
            <li>I had received a sample of this product with a HSI straightener and me and my three teenage daughters loved it, so I bought a small bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it a few more times</li>
            <li>i will say its nice as a pre flat iron protector but not any nicer than other brands.  </li>
            <li>Just a few drops before styling makes my hair look shiny and healthy without a greasy look or feel.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to leave my hair straight.</li>
            <li>product replaced the far more expensive Argan oil they sell at salons (I won&#x27;t name names, but the teal label with orange writing product is what I&#x27;m referring to) for me because it is cheaper and a better product, how often does that happen?</li>
            <li>I always disliked oils in my hair because they sat on top of the hair, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t had a lot of breakage like I normally do during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Love how it only takes about a dime size for my long hair and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking.</li>
            <li>I noticed my arm getting tired after doing my hair, but it still looks good, so I do recommend this.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because in my opinion it is a good product but not exactly great.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too thick, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking.</li>
            <li>The secret to good curls in curly hair is don&#x27;t touch it while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li>The secret to good curls in curly hair is don&#x27;t touch it while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li>and I wish it had pump because its easy to pour a little too much out.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair sooo soft and healthy looking and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>: Getting the right amount each time I use it is a real guessing game; would be better if it came with a dropper cap.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and lovely!</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s dry the next day, I put 2 more drops on the end, tip my hair over/shake it out</li>
            <li>I am Asian and have kind of frizzy black hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks less frizzy, and feels more soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and it make my dry frizzy hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The change in my hair with these products is nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry, damaged looking, AND feeling hair.  </li>
            <li>I have permed African American hair, and a little bit goes a long way to help my hair feel soft, bouncy, and manageable while maintaining a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li>I put a tiny amount on my hair before I use the flat iron and it leaves my hair feeling soft and bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It works better than all the other argan oil products I&#x27;ve purchased before as those products have left my hair very oily.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for the flat iron, but you can just use it everyday without the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enough said, right?</li>
            <li>Being mixed, finding the right hair products has been all about trial and error</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve finally found the right combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m usually not keen on putting oil in my hair because of the scorching heat coupled with the high humidity levels in my country.</li>
            <li>I can use this product before blow drying and it comes out straight and smooth enough to not even need the flat iron!  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair is frizzy due to the heat in FL but with this product my hair looks silky and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>I was actually contemplating cutting my hair soon but now that i have these great products that give me long straight healthy looking hair</li>
            <li>and I straighten my hair just to keep it looking tame and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have long blonde fine straight hair with an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>so I blow dry and flatiron every other day, so I really need a good protectant if I don&#x27;t want my hair to look like a total fuzz ball.</li>
            <li>You only use a few drops per amount of hair &amp; do not need to use more!</li>
            <li>i only need small amount , i like to use it after a shower before my hair become dry ( while my hair a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they&#x27;ll  make the bottle more easily to use (it&#x27;s still good)</li>
            <li>I had been reading such good things about using Argan Oil to add shine and manageability to your hair, (especially if you use heat tools regularly), that I finally tried</li>
            <li>I know this has cut down on the time it takes her to straighten her hair by a ton, easily going from an hour to 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>but when it dries it will be fine... and especially the second day!!!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any long-term effects, but I&#x27;m looking forward to enjoying soft silky hair as a result in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>This product is oil but so light, as other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like brand new hair again.</li>
            <li>and I have lots of new growth.</li>
            <li>I had been using Moroccan oil for a while, and was reluctant to try something new.</li>
            <li>Happened to see this in my recommendations and saw the new pump bottle and immediately ordered.</li>
            <li>It helps with the fritz too, being that I do live in the south.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new style and decided to buy this.  </li>
            <li>How did I ever live without this product.</li>

            <li>My new must-have product.  </li>
            <li>I live in Vegas and this product makes my hair shiny and tamed.</li>
            <li>We got her a new straightener and there was a sample of the Argan Oil in the package.</li>
            <li>However, Amazon solved my issue and I received  new bottle.  </li>
            <li>This product helps straightening out my new growth while protecting from heat damage.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Because of where I live, I can&#x27;t speak about humidity, but it helps the moisture stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>I put it on after shower, before blow dry or flat iron, rub more on the ends.</li>
            <li>I use it on my damp hair and also on dry hair before using a flat iron and my hair looks silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t chemically process my hair (dyes or relaxers) and I was able to apply this, blow dry it out and flat iron</li>
            <li>product definitely worked for me: my hair was not weighed down; it had a healthy sheen; my hair became more manageable (and took less time to style); and, my hair feels a bit fuller and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>very rich and tame my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I had a CHI previously and the HSI rivals it EASILY at a fraction on the price.</li>
            <li>After years of using a straight iron on my hair daily, it was really beginning to show.</li>
            <li>Its thick and has good volume, but its not greasy at the same time.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leave my hair feeling soft and thick.</li>
            <li>have long, thin, fine hair that tangles VERY easily.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, it&#x27;s OK, not exceptional; and in fact, smells very very close to the scent of the Moroccan Oil treatment</li>
            <li>I have fine hair (although a lot of it), and unlike a lot of products, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this does not weigh it down or make it look oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down</li>
            <li>I have always had problems finding the conditioner that did not leave my hair weighted down or frizzy since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>I use this right before flat ironing my hair to protect from the heat.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and protected from heat damage.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this oil to anyone who appreciates soft, aromatic hair.</li>

            <li>Also leaves the hair feeling very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair very soft, and also keeps it protected.</li>
            <li>I like the product it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and shines when I use this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and silky, I use</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much and it last a looooong time.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>But after about 2 weeks my scalp started itching, burning, became very sensitive</li>
            <li>I needed a heat protectant oil after buying a high heat professional curling wand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hair very soft and shine.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse, long, curly hair which is finally tamed, glossy, healthy, and looks glamorous thanks to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also put it on my skin after showering and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and my hair is very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to buy the smaller bottle, just spend a little more to get twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this over-wrote a review I previously wrote about how much I love this.</li>
            <li>First I thought my hair was protein sensitive, then low porosity, then high porosity,bottom line</li>
            <li>I have very thin, wavy, frizzy hair that has finally been tamed by this incredible product.</li>
            <li>It even smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have tried many argan oils in the past, but none have worked as well as this one did.</li>
            <li>However that is only on the first day.  </li>
            <li>This is still my first step after i have deep conditioned.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice, and my hair definitely came out better the second time.  </li>
            <li>I only shampoo my hair every other day, and my second-day hair is even better than on the days I shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive this product only to find that it was open and spilled inside the box damaging everything inside the box with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft before!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft, shiny and wavy, not frizzy!</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle now - the first one lasted about 4 months.  </li>
            <li>I got my first bottle earlier this year.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and is shiny after using!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I went ahead and ordered this, and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>I received one 2 ounce bottle of HSI Professional Leave-in Hair Treatment, with Argan Oil to review!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been willing to pay the price since there&#x27;s a big difference in quality and results.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling sooooo soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li>Uber soft, moisturized curls that (and this never happens), lasted all day!</li>
            <li>Thank you Science and HSI professional for helping a sister out!</li>
            <li>: It needs to have a different delivery system, either a dropper or a top that delivers a smaller amount of fluid.  </li>
            <li>My daughter in law has this exact same straightener.  </li>
            <li>I usually jump from product to product since most of them make claims they&#x27;ll do this or</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>So far my hair end doesn&#x27;t crack!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I am not very much satisfied with Hair Straightener, but I love this oil.</li>
            <li>my hair comes out soft and undamaged after applying heat!</li>
            <li>I put this product on before I straighten my hair and it makes it so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I totally forgot where I purchased the last bottle from and decided to just get it from my favorite place to shop (amazon obviously).</li>
            <li>It protects my hair while flat ironing and leaves a nice shine without leaving a heavy build up.</li>
            <li>I normally apply it after a shower as her hair gets dry (I suppose because of the length) and this product fixes the problem right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and has a nice subtle scent, and makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li>I put it on and blow dry and then add more and blow dry again.  </li>
            <li>Made my damaged/dry hair shiny and smooth without weighing it down or making it greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth all day and not oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny without being weighed down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>HSI smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and although I have to use more than the recommended &amp;#34; few drops&amp;#34; because of my ridiculously thick hair I&#x27;ve really come to enjoy and rely on this</li>
            <li>A gift to my wife for use as a backup straightener, but she prefers this new one to her old one now.</li>
            <li>super soft, less frizz, hair stayed straight.  </li>
            <li>I also look only at descriptive reviews, but I am now even a bit suspicious of overly long reviews from people who sound like ad men for the company selling the product.  </li>
            <li>This oil has been the long awaited secret to great hair.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops applied to towel-dried hair and it&#x27;s easy to brush with no tangles.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron seemed to help set in the smoothness, but I can&#x27;t say my hair looked any better than with other argan oil products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stored away all my other flat irons including my CHI because this iron works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I hot iron daily causing lots of damage.  </li>
            <li>I can even get away with using this alone without the flat iron and still look casual good!  </li>
            <li>Especially if your hair is very dry, and breaks so easily.</li>
            <li>like it better than other products because it is a more natural hair product without unnecessary chemicals</li>
            <li>This adds a little weight &amp; luster to unmanageable fine hair.</li>
            <li>This has earned a place among my favorite hair products, and that is no easy feat!</li>
            <li>This is a great oil for my hair which is very thick and dry (from winter conditions and haircoloring).  </li>
            <li>A few weeks after using the product my hair began to look and feel less dry and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I tried several different serums for my hair, with daily straitening my hair was becoming damaged.  </li>
            <li>I started using it on my hair after drying, before the flat iron, and I now have a much higher opinion of it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li>I first tried this conditioner when it came along with the flat iron as a sample.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be very curly, especially in the back; and while the oil doesn&#x27;t give me perfectly straight hair (nothing will do that!)</li>
            <li>I first tried this oil with the flat iron</li>
            <li>My first experience with  a flat iron hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>Try flat ironing thinner sections or layers of hair - use a clip to hold up top layers and release a layer at a time to flat iron if you have extra curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Wet hair has more results than dry hair.</li>
            <li>most recent order arrived with less than 1/3 of the product inside the plastic bottle, the contents were not even inside the box</li>
            <li>It not only calmed down hair fried to the roots, it looks shinier than it did when it was young and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine hair that is damaged easily.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair, this product is just right for me.</li>
            <li>But the real proof comes in the \\&quot;second day hair\\&quot;, when to my surprise, my hair was just as pretty as the first day, not at all weighed down or oily.</li>
            <li>At first, I used this extremely sparingly--not getting too much of a result.  </li>
            <li>Not like pure argan oil, that smells quite gross.</li>
            <li>I received a small sample with my flat iron and I loved it instantly.</li>
            <li>I have super long, thick hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>When you get to the top layer and want to create a little more body - especially at crown - flat iron close to scalp with a slight twist under and out to ends of hair section.  </li>
            <li>When you get to the top layer and want to create a little more body - especially at crown - flat iron close to scalp with a slight twist under and out to ends of hair section.  </li>
            <li>Now, however, I use a little of this HSI Professional product after I wash my hair (not daily) and my hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Since using the leave in conditioner her hair has been much more manageable with less time invested using her flat iron.</li>
            <li>I still had to put my other leave-in conditioner in along with it to be able to comb through my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just recommend being a little more generous with how much you use if you have african american hair like me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used like a dime size (I have fine hair down my to the middle of my back) and my hair looked greasy.</li>
            <li>It really feels soft, shiny and helps keeping the hair style for several days.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised but is a bit expensive for what you get,  So happy with purchase but will probably look elsewhere in the future</li>
            <li>- the ad clearly states that it&#x27;s a 4 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this, but I&#x27;m giving it all the stars because my daughter keeps having people feel her hair because this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>This item has far exceded my wife&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li>and I really wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff earlier.  </li>
            <li>The argan oil leaves it soft, manageable and is never oily.  </li>
            <li>Your hair feels softer, it feels natural, doesn&#x27;t get grimmy like with hair spray re-application.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes hair so soft without feeling greasy at all.</li>

            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>I have medium, straight hair and would say that about a dollar coin size amount is enough.</li>

            <li>wow ...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to go all the way to your scalp, it will end up looking greasy, since the natural oils from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but she wanted a conditioner to keep her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Her hair is soft and silky and the frizziness is just gone.</li>
            <li>Her hair is normally naturally oily and with this product we cannot even see a hint of oiliness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and I could not figure out how people had soft hair they could run their fingers through it.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and manageable without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I ove this oil, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My damaged hair looked silky and soft with use of this product before and after drying.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and shiny, prevents damage, and is not oily.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li>I use about a dime-sized amount on my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable, even after I heat-style.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves your hair feeling very silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It does make it soft and that is why I gave it a 4 star review.  </li>
            <li>It protects my hair from heat, while leaving it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, silky and controllable.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and also use it very often in my daughters&#x27; hair as well.  </li>
            <li>You can immediately feel the difference in how soft and silky it leaves your hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I say was,because since using it to seal, my hair has done a complete 360.</li>
            <li>It just made my hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>If you use only a dime size quantity it works very well.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair silky and soft</li>
            <li>Although it may be too early to assess W Ultra Beauty ArganGold</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>You are going to want to invest in a screw-on dropper bottle or pump cap if you want to use this product correctly and not waste</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I found the two products now and not sooner, could have saved so much money and time.</li>
            <li>This product absorbs into her hair, leaves it feeling soft without any residue.</li>
            <li>So far my HSI professional flatiron has only been used once so a few more uses</li>
            <li>She was also surprised at the cost...</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li>Also, it was naïve of me to take it at face value as far as &amp;</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t loud</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and not oily</li>
            <li>I do like this product and it leaves your hair soft and detangles</li>
            <li>But what a surprise got from HSI Professional leave-in treatment conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have only been using this for about a week, but I can really see and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li>this did nearly nothing to minimize the frizz.  </li>
            <li>and I must say it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Then I run my hands in my hair (nowhere near the scalp as my scalp gets naturally greasy).</li>
            <li>After applying this argan oil, I can go for 4 days without any frizz or greasiness but just silky soft</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I can never get that salon look or the texture like after a Japanese Straight Perm</li>
            <li>I try to go all natural.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my mom, she loves it, said it makes her hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Protects my hair from heat like it says and also keeps it soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and shiny, even if you don&#x27;t iron over it.</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair everyday, and have tried many different oils.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair with lots of body that require lots of product, work, and time to get it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>The ONLY COMPLAINT I have is in regards to the bottle not having some kind of pump.</li>
            <li>But with this serum, I can add just the smallest amount before blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair and my hair turns out silky smooth and so soft to the touch, without that heavy greasy feeling or look.</li>
            <li>I have thick, healthy hair and this treatment allows it to stay that way....</li>
            <li>I like that the oil is thick and not runny like most oils.  </li>
            <li>although I have thick hair that requires more heat to straighten, I never let the temperature go beyond 375F</li>
            <li>Too expensive but good buy.</li>
            <li>I have thick course hair, love this product.</li>
            <li>my shoulder length thick hair I use about a &#x27;skittle&#x27; sized amount of oil, sometimes a tad bit more.</li>
            <li>The product itself is awesome, but I hate the packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get too little, too much, or just the right amount and never knew how my hair would turn out.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way, so this bottle will last forever- love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various commercial products (not ever been happy with, even the extremely expensive ones had some major flaw, such as being too oily or smelling weirdly artificial), and even olive oil (too thick and oily) and grapeseed oil (better than olive oil) -- but this product is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>but I have found another one of my products is a little better (silky elements heat protection spray for flat irons, curling irons, etc).</li>
            <li>However, the more I use it, the more I am getting sick of the smell.</li>
            <li>Notably, it has the nutty/ rice-water like smell characteristic of argan oil and comes in a dark colored bottle that is needed to preserve argan oil&#x27;s character.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually flat iron my hair because I have so much hair and not enough time, but I do using a curling iron and this is really helping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have the HSI flat iron as a back up, I don&#x27;t like it as much as my Wal-Mart Remington which has a much wider blade</li>
            <li>It helps tame the frizz, and makes my hair feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>It requires just a drop or two in the palm of your hand to smooth onto almost dry or dry hair for a professional looking shine.</li>
            <li>I tried first on damp hair and then on dry hair.</li>
            <li>After blow drying it leaves my hair really silky soft, then after I flat iron, it is even softer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and silky and tame.</li>
            <li>HSI Argan Oil is head &amp; shoulders above other available Moroccan Oil leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>I apply this to towel dry hair -- about a quarter size amount , then I use my hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found one other anti-frizz product that makes it this smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just half full when I received it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s arrived half way full and oil all over the box.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, will recommend for smooth finish for both straight or curly hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and most serums weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>After every wash right before I would blow dry I would put a little in my hands and spread throughout my entire head as well as making sure to get enough on my ends.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil after I wash my hair and ready use flat iron.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but this stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Works very well for styling or flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using this, and i spilled a little to much on my hands and was worried my hair would come out greasy.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way I love the way my hair feels</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I started using the tiny bottle that came with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair, so even though it is light, I can only use a tiny amount</li>
            <li>One of the first few times I used too much oil</li>
            <li>only con: I don&#x27;t particularly like that you just pour a bit into your hand.</li>
            <li>I pour a tiny bit of the product into my palm, mix it a bit with both hands and then run my hands through my hair particularly where I want to ensure no fly-aways.</li>
            <li>(I use the same brand flat iron).work on my hair the same like rest products I have tried.nothing special.</li>
            <li>Not only makes my hair soft and shiny, but I love the fact that you only need a little to apply and one bottle lasts looooong time.</li>
            <li>Good size bottle that will last me a long time because with argan oil a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The ends were still a little dry, so I applied a touch more with my fingertips where things felt crispy.  </li>
            <li>so I went ahead and ordered a 5oz bottle of Redken oil (their &#x27;Smooth down Heat glide&#x27;), to later find out that the iron included a sample of Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Ive been a regular user of Redken smooth down for years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend - especially for this price!</li>
            <li>I would say I will be buying this product again, but since a little goes a long way, this bottle had so much that I might not be buying more for a very very long time.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my son decided to dump it down the drain but the company was so nice and after explaining to them what happened, they sent me another bottle, which he ended up like the first bottle thanks to my son...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and I just need to use a few drops on my thick, medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts in my hair for a long time with no need to reapply which is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>A small drop could make my frizzy hair shine and smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li>No more fly-aways at the bottom - just smooth, shiny, silky hair that flows.  </li>
            <li>After a long search for a product that really conditions and protects hair, I came upon this one.  </li>
            <li>I got a small free sample when I purchased my straighter, from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use it with the flat iron since my hair usually comes out better.</li>
            <li>I first starting using this product when I got it as a sample with the flat iron</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely purchase a full bottle when my sample bottle is empty!</li>
            <li>she left her oil that she normally use at home.</li>
            <li>It smells phenomenal and leaves my thick, coarse hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The smell is way too sweet, I feel like I wear a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all!</li>
            <li>I also have used pure argan oil, and it is leaves my hair with that greasy/oily look if I put it in when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>I only use this oil after I blow dry my hair and right before I curl/</li>
            <li>I put about a quarter sized amount to my hair right after I wash it, then blow dry it and finally straighten it.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit of this, and a quick brush</li>
            <li>I would high recommend over pure Moroccan Oil (which would weight down my hair and was oily).</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>I received the little sample when I ordered the HSI flat iron (which I love also) and had to order the big bottle.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is a good size and since you only have to use a small amount this should last for a really long time, you have to be careful not to use to much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so silky smooth and shiny... but a little bit greasy some hours later.</li>
            <li>When I use even a little too much, my hair looks very greasy and no amount of blow-drying changes it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I doubt that really matters because the product itself is FANTASTIC and it takes only a very small amount to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that really tames the frizz and it leaves my hair soft and not greasy after I&#x27;ve flat ironed it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s former boxed/shrink wrapped container next to the new plastic version - new plastic bottle</li>
            <li>so i just kept it instead of sending it back and getting a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/3b curls which tend to be extremely dry and absorb moisture insanely fast.</li>
            <li>I dont really see the difference until I blow dry or iron my hair..</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry ends immediately.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be dry, and this product really improves its appearance.</li>
            <li>I had done some damage to my hair when coloring the last time, and this really helped to get my hair back in shape.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the designed of the cap; I would prefer a smaller opening to control how much product I can use instead</li>
            <li>It also leaves it very shiny, it just takes a tiny amount so the bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li>Before I left the salon, she told me to definitely keep using it because she was \\&quot;very impressed.\\</li>
            <li>You can use it on both towel dried hair or completely dried hair, both with nice results.</li>
            <li>This is a super heavy oil.  </li>
            <li>Left hair very soft, not oily</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is how soft my dry hair was, even before using the flat iron.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a major factor for me when I&#x27;m choosing a hair product.</li>
            <li>But after only using this oil 2 or 3 times, there&#x27;s been a complete change in my hair!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make it appear oily.  </li>
            <li>I can also choose to go without flat ironing at all sometimes because after just blow drying my hair is still smooth and shiny- just a little wavy.</li>
            <li>hair is a few inches past my shoulders, i keep it straight because is more managable that way.</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t need much either; usually a dime-sized amount is all it takes and my daughter&#x27;s hair is past the middle of her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I turn the bottle over frequently as I&#x27;m getting ready in the mornings and reaching for other hair products or cosmetics.</li>
            <li>it is very smoothy after use this hair oil and dry the hair!</li>
            <li>Then I blow dry with a round brush and it comes out so incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil especially since I use the flat iron quite often.</li>
            <li>You only need a very small amount to work the magic, about the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li>While I like other anti-frizz products maybe a tad better, they&#x27;re heavy (or greasy) and flatten the curl out.  </li>
            <li>I used a TINY amount of this product (like two very small drops -about 1/4 a teaspoon at the most), and rubbed it into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick but fine hair</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too heavy and on a pretty humid day, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz up!</li>
            <li>It was a little oily at first but then was fine, her hair seemed no different after it had dried.</li>
            <li>I received a trial bottle with the purchase of a new flat iron.  </li>
            <li>BUT, after the provider of this product saw my review they immediately shipped me a new flat iron because somehow the one I bought was defective.</li>
            <li>I started using this oil when I received a trial size bottle with my new HSI Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>if you have fine hair as I do, you&#x27;ll notice that it needs to be washed a day earlier than I usually do.  </li>
            <li>I am of mixed decent ( African and Indian)</li>
            <li>When she ran out of the little sample bottle that came with the hair straightener, she was pretty loud about it.</li>
            <li>I naturally have long, fine, straight hair that&#x27;s on the thin side.</li>
            <li>I use more than a drop though because I have very thick hair with a natural wave and since I wear it back all the time my hair has been breaking.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Liss Ultime Shine Serum which would make my hair greasy and heavy but the Argan Oil is wonderful, just a few drops in my wet hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li>On one of those negative reviews,  I did confirm that \\&quot;Benzyl Salicylate\\&quot; is listed twice in the ingredients and although it may look intimidating, it&#x27;s used as a fragrance additive or UV light absorber.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it so much that I use it every night for my body and just a few drops for my hair after it is washed and dried.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical about using an oil as heat protection but this oil worked out fabulous.</li>
            <li>If it takes me the same amount of time to straighten my hair with a product as it does without the product, and I have to wash my hair more with it, then it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li>If it takes me the same amount of time to straighten my hair with a product as it does without the product, and I have to wash my hair more with it, then it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li>Constantly, I find my hands in my hair without being conscious of it.</li>
            <li>and it actually makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommended HSI Professional Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Scent is barely there...</li>
            <li>This oil conditions my hair leaving it soft and silky, while protecting it from heat at the same time.</li>
            <li>HSI left my hair extremely soft and shiny without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair shiny and I can flatiron it straight with minimal flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I left this product in the bathroom and my 25 year old daughter seen it and also tried this product.  </li>
            <li>and I have done highlights, lo-lights, color, etc all at the same time and my hair feels so soft - softer than when I used to just color and use mouse, gel, etc.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling soft and silky without any added weight or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Ive used it a couple times now and barely even made a dent in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Bottle will then be very slippery, so be careful when handling it.</li>
            <li>It leaves it silky and shiny and I usually do not need to use my flat iron at all after using this product.  </li>
            <li>So far my traditional  hair treatment worked out bette.</li>
            <li>you only use a small amount and it really protects your hair from hot iron damage.</li>
            <li>Only negative thing I can say is I wish I would have purchased more than two when the price was only $14.99.</li>
            <li>you combine this product with the HSI flat iron, WOW!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and has a wide range of temperatures.</li>
            <li>HSI Professional Argan Oil is a must have for daily hair treatment.</li>
            <li>After I finished flat ironing it, my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li>I have 3C curls and if not careful</li>
            <li>so I ended up purchasing one for her as an early birthday present</li>
            <li>They can only exclaim about how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li>It not only protected my hair from the heat, it made my hair extremely soft and added some flow to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It lasted for three days, which is how long I go between shampoos normally, so it wasn&#x27;t adding oil to my scalp.</li>
            <li>Alas my search for a better product continues...</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight and thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse hair and many products simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks, so I don&#x27;t have a full opinion yet.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair and a little dab of this when she is right out of the shower allows me to comb through her hair without it getting snagged or pulling out.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and facilitates easy styling, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It makes my coarse hair much more soft and manageable and using it everyday doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend trying it if your hair have dry split ends.</li>
            <li>I have natural coarse curly asian hair, and if I just blow dry without anything conditioner, I would be very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>will have to see how the Redken oil compares in combination with my new hair iron, but I will consider getting a larger bottle of Argan in the future</li>
            <li>I have 4 oz bottle, so its will last me for a very long time considering how much product need for one use.</li>
            <li>I have long hair &amp; it is basically pretty dry-</li>
            <li>The small bottle (4oz) goes a long way so the price is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I sometimes add a tiny bit when it is dry but not too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other Argan Oil brands before and after this and definitely like this better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works better when the hair is half wet than it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I normally just let my hair air dry, but I think you need the heat to help it absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a small bottle came with the flat iron for free.  </li>
            <li>#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; on my hair.. Just a small about in your hand, and  a quick finger-comb through, is like moisturizing bliss.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s light enough to leave my hair shiny and moisturized with BODY.</li>
            <li>HSI Argan Oil is quite thick in formula, much thicker than pure argan oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>I always put it in my hair before I blow dry it straight and as a result, at the end of blowdrying it is soft, silky and not at all dry!</li>
            <li>I am nowhere near almost out of this product because a little really does go a longggggg way.</li>
            <li>It works so well that I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron to get my hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>

            <li>I also noticed that breakage was nearly gone when flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Argan Oil treatment after I received the HSI Professional Flat Iron as a Christmas Gift.</li>
            <li>I did purchase ther ceramic flat iron and discarded my old one.  </li>

            <li>how it makes my hair feel soft and not fried after using the flat iron.</li>
            <li>After using flat iron, my hair was shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I bought leaked, making a mess and practically emptying the contents.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this item has little more financial punch than others but the quality surpasses any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>My hair was super dry and frizzy due to constant dyeing and even bleaching my hair.</li>
            <li>Need be very careful how much you put on your hair otherwise</li>
            <li>And I am pleased to say that it has had a dramatic effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and she says she can use it as much as she wants and since it is a dry oil, it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look oily and heavy.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny amount through the hair not only eliminates frizziness, but makes hair incredibly soft</li>
            <li>At this point, I can definitely say that my hair feels silky soft, which was not the case prior to using this.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I am an African American woman with natural brown hair.</li>
            <li>You must open the top and poor it into your hand to use.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is magical on my thick coarse dry highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>truly, professional products are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have never had such control over my thick, coarse, wavy hair and styling has never been so easy.</li>
            <li>i tried a few drops, I tried more than a few drops, and saw no affect whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the oil and definitely the flat iron along with it!!!!</li>
            <li>I have long, very thick unruly hour (wavy and several cowlicks) and after applying the oil and using the iron, my hair is smooth, straight, shiny and flowing.</li>
            <li>makes my hair very soft, adds life to my hair again when it gets dry.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have very curly hair that I flat iron almost everyday and because of that I&#x27;ve struggled with dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It does have a scent, which I love, very similar to other musky hair emollients I&#x27;ve used in the past, but might not be for everyone.  </li>
            <li>It mends dry split ends and makes hair extremely soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price and the same exact size.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it right before I use the HSI flat iron to straighten my hair so that my hair will be shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old woman with very long white hair that is naturally curly and frizzy if left to itself.</li>
            <li>for use with Flat Iron:  follow recommendation for applying product after shampoo/conditioner/towel dry; focus on ends; flat iron when hair is almost dry - still slightly damp - for super straight and sleek styles.  </li>
            <li>As someone whose hair was very damaged due to multiple dyes, she is always looking for a boost to help it out.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to the present: I was searching for a leave-in product to protect from heat styling, and I was drawn to this one due to the rave reviews and the fact that it contains argan oil.</li>
            <li>Using a minimal amount protects your hair from the flat iron and makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li>Very small portion of the oil is enough for one application and the hair are smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It makes my long hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my long, think hair feeling amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>As a definite extra plus, HSI doesn&#x27;t leave any obvious lingering signs of its use-- no heavy scent, no oily-looking residue.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re only supposed to use a few drops and smooth it through your wet hair, but there is no dropper or pump; it&#x27;s just a screw-top bottle, which means you need to POUR the oil into your palm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pricey (way beyond my usual hair product price point) but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or oily at all, and a few drops really does do the trick!</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the hefty price.</li>
            <li>The straightener works well, but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has never been able to flat iron her hair without there being a sort of fried smell behind it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really thick and frizzy, it relieves some if the volume and let&#x27;s me straighten it much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Only con is that you have to be very careful not to use too mucch or your hair will be look very greasy</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but makes it so much easier to brush girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This helped it so much and did not appear greasy or weigh it down</li>
            <li>I wait until it&#x27;s still a little damp, but not wet, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small amount of oil, so the bottle lasts for a good amount of time, even though I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and using this product has made blow drying as well as hot ironing my hair much easier.</li>
            <li>and it looked less frizzy than when i blow dry with no product, and a little more shiny.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because it is hard to dispenSE small amount with the kind of bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>After i blow dry my hair it is so soft and doesn&#x27;t frizz..</li>
            <li>This is my all-in-one go-to product whether I style my hair or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>The one downside, and the reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating, is it can leave your hair feeling oily if you use even slightly too much.  </li>
            <li>Where my hair was dry and brittle, not it is soft.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and realized this product was to use before drying or the use of an iron, whereas all I do in the morning is shampoo/condition my hair and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Today, my hair has completely recovered and I no longer have problems with dry, heat damaged hair.</li>
            <li>And for anyone who has dry or damaged hair and want it feeling soft again.  </li>
            <li>I can put it in my hair and either leave my hair natural, or blow dry it out.</li>
            <li>And then let my hair air dry completely.</li>
            <li>Once it is dry, my hair feels so soft and no frizzes even if my straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I leave this conditioner in my hair and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Works well for straightening, blow drying and for just letting colored hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Now that I started using HSI Professional Argan Oil, i noticed that i don&#x27;t have hair split ends and dry ends anymore.</li>
            <li>This product is the first to actually tame my frizz.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way and it detangled my 3c/4a (otherwise uncooperative strands) natural hair making it soooooo much easier to comb...</li>
            <li>when numerous reviews are written on the same day or successive days consistently giving 5 star reviews containing little or no descriptive words  (for instance: &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; be suspicious folks.  </li>
            <li>My last bleaching left my hair broken and changed the texture from straight and fine to extremely course and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I used it years ago but moved on to other brands (way more expensive ones like alterna, macadamia professional, etc, ) because I was never a fan of the old packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight, frizzy, thick hair that I wear straight during the winter and curly during the summer.  </li>
            <li>(my evidence for this is that my hair is now much longer than I have ever been able to have it before; usually it just gets so frayed and broken at the ends that I would have had to cut it months ago).</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is a little bit too strong smell, but it goes away in a little bit, not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and haven&#x27;t run this this as quickly as I thought I would -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I definitely have noticed a much smoother and less frizzir hair texture with the recommended combination.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse hair with lots of body that usually needs lots of product, work, and time to get it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy hair that tends to frizz due to living in a VERY humid climate.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on Bradley Stafford&#x27;s review of November 10, 2012 as well as other reviews that gave  long, very explanatory reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have fine and thin hair and when I used this product it helps keep my hair bouncy..</li>
            <li>I have pretty damaged hair due to years of neglect and tying it up wet...</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>good grief it makes my hair feel so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>This made my daughter&#x27;s curly hair more puffy and very dry looking, she was not pleased at all!!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, that can sometimes be very dry.</li>
            <li>has had little effect leaving my hair either too greasy or hardly straight.</li>
            <li>*Updated Review Due to New Packaging</li>
            <li>however it tends to get frizzy and sometimes quite damaged and coarse due to humidity where we live.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a flat iron, and do let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>When I used my flat iron there was no smoking or odd odor - and my hair straightened very well.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> The best way to describe the difference is that it makes my hair look and feel healthy and takes away the \\&quot;frizzyness.\\</li>
            <li> Have tried many argan oil brand and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Really nice product!</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with how my hair turned out, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a mixture of the hair products I&#x27;d used.</li>
            <li> It is a great leave in conditioner and it smells so good and feels good even on your hands and leaves your hair smelling</li>
            <li> This exceptional oil is also great for all hair types as well.</li>
            <li> One thing to mention though is the scent, not too pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not offensive, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it pleasant either.</li>
            <li> Did the product give the purchaser a pleasant experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell when you apply it, but I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I&#x27;m done styling.  </li>
            <li> It does smoothed her fuzzy hair and  with a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and does not leave your hair looking  oily.</li>

            <li> (she has naturally gorgeous curly hair)</li>
            <li> I tried hers one day and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to pay over $100 for a good one...</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years.  </li>
            <li> Good for before or after blow drying.</li>
            <li> After one day using this oil, my hair felt good.</li>
            <li> Works good on my hair</li>
            <li> Its a good quality product.</li>
            <li> but she said an Ion works just as good as a Chi.</li>
            <li> I tried it when I bought the HSI iron, and loved it.</li>
            <li> Gret product, good price.</li>
            <li> , I absolutely LOVED it, so I decided to purchase the full-size product.</li>
            <li> It is fairly dense oil and will cause your hair to look greasy.</li>
            <li> Once after washing your hair is good.</li>
            <li> And since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get good results, I won&#x27;t go broke maintaining my hair.</li>
            <li> I originally received this as a sample when I bought an HSI hair straightener (also an excellent product).</li>
            <li> After giving both these products a fair amount of testing time, I can honestly say that they are amazing!</li>
            <li> This has a very pleasant and light fragrance, and the oil adds smoothness to your hair and scalp but is not &amp;#34;greasy&#x27; at all.  </li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Leave beautiful and healthy look hair every time used.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling healthy, shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Then I bought another straightener (these are the best that I have found and a great price) and a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly and is a great product, I appreciate the good business!</li>
            <li> Super good!!!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others and this is exceptional.</li>
            <li> It is an exceptional product.  </li>
            <li> I received my product quickly and it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> There is a pleasant hair product scent to it, because it has added fragrance, and it spreads out nicely in your hair, not creating clumps.</li>
            <li> had a question about the product and was also very happy with the quick response.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, hair looks healthy even after all that heat!</li>
            <li> I use a good dime-size amount on my towel-dried hair, and the HSI Argan Oil does its magic!</li>
            <li> It is very nice and the bottle arrived safe and good.</li>
            <li> It smells super gd!!!</li>
            <li> this is a great argan oil treatment for the hair and leaves your hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the great reviews and I must say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just ok, got great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and smells great</li>
            <li> I keep touching my hair because it&#x27;s become softer (and I think that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll end up with greasy locks - constant-touching lol).</li>
            <li> outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this seems to be great protection for my hair and takes the &#x27;static&#x27; away.</li>
            <li> We were both very pleased.  </li>
            <li> HAPPY FLAT-IRONING :&gt;</li>

            <li> /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> i guess after trying out the good kind of argan oil..</li>

            <li> The oil has a pleasant smell and most importantly makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This HSI flat iron was the best straightener I’ve ever used and with this HSI ARGAN oil, it made my life so easy!</li>
            <li> My mom and I have lovely locks</li>
            <li> I did some research, because I do love the feel of argan oil in my dry/damaged hair, the price threw me off.</li>
            <li> Your hair feels more moisturized and no build up</li>
            <li> I love feeling my hair after use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> i must buy more from this product again.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the packaging could be more functional.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the top / lid to the bottle was cracked, it does not close.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Argan Oil-</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite product.</li>
            <li> It sat on top of my hair and gave it a waxy feel and did not improve my hair in any way.</li>
            <li> It even does okay with just a hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will never go back to Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> Such an excellent product!  </li>
            <li> Glad I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> works lovely.</li>
            <li> nice and light and freshens my hair as well as keeps</li>
            <li> Better than the Josie Maran argan oil in my opinion.</li>
            <li> As per reviews, I had much more expectations from this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s better with the HSI Iron.</li>
            <li> I love this product, cant do without it.</li>
            <li> Now it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I love love love this oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> I really love this...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Then again its always best to have your hair as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li> I develop asthma attacks to many hair creams</li>
            <li> I do love the feel of this oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame too, because I love the product.</li>
            <li> I think this would work fantastically with longer hair, but I still think my hair comes out cute.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than what I thought.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT.........</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I haven&#x27;t been losing as many hair as I had before, and I attribute that to both the use of Hannah and Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It feels better and healthier than it has ever felt.</li>
            <li> love the way my hair becomes silky after applying it</li>
            <li> just works as a magic .perfect product which has replaced my  hair serum, heat protector from my hair care kit.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased that it doesn&#x27;t have that effect at all.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair a healthy glow and won&#x27;t be needing a Brazilian Blow-Out anymore, which saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> so you need to add even more.</li>
            <li> The product arrives as promised, and really helps my hair look great.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> She love&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> I have used many products that reduce frizz, without results.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> And that is because I love HSI Conditioner.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> It seems to work more like a serum than a leave in conditioner, I use it before flat-ironing my hair</li>
            <li> I have to say my favorite part is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> With this oil I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair without it looking severely burned.</li>
            <li> It like seals the ends of my hair making it look healthy.</li>
            <li> I do believe this is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Get it while it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many before.  </li>
            <li> We really love the shiny bouncy effect this product leaves.  </li>
            <li> Its my favorite leave in conditioner at the moment , and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll be buying this product again</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so shinny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with the weight of my hair resting on my neck and find myself throwing my hair up into a pony tail more days than not.  </li>

            <li> I have ethnic, curly hair and this was able to do its job.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I do love the scent of the oil</li>
            <li> I needed something my hair could absorb and feel healthy.</li>

            <li> much better result.</li>
            <li> but more of an observation.</li>
            <li> The scent could be better, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff, but when I got it the top wasn&#x27;t on correctly and the bottle leaked out</li>
            <li> add more and move on to the untouched hair.</li>
            <li> Tried so many conditioners over the years.  </li>
            <li> Some were ok.  </li>
            <li> The problem is they didn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my hair smooth and friz free.  </li>
            <li> One of the better hair oils I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This doesnt make my hair greasy or oily, just gives it a healthy shine.</li>

            <li> I used to be in love with biosilk</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s better for your hair.</li>
            <li> Many products do not allow this because they make my hair greasy, and to top it off, I wouldn&#x27;t notice a deference in straightening time.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> :-)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I also like the smell of HSI&#x27;s oil better.  </li>
            <li> Some were given to me, some were in my Ipsy bag, and some I bought thinking that I might find something better.  </li>
            <li> If you wash your hair more often you would use more.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Many products do not allow this because they make my hair greasy, and to top it off, I wouldn&#x27;t notice a deference in straightening time.  </li>

            <li> Compared to the Redken oil, the sample smelled &#x27;darker&#x27; or &#x27;heavier&#x27;, for lack of a better descriptor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Argan oil does make my hair shiny (which I love) and</li>
            <li> It smells like heaven and I love to touch my hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure that with continued use of this product, and maintaining better hair care, I will achieve the healthy looking hair I once had.</li>

            <li> and it works better.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil is wonderful, not only does it make my hair silky and shiny.  </li>

            <li> I tried sooo many things and nothing</li>
            <li> Try it is a 10, leave in conditioner and it worked better.</li>

            <li> and you love that salon look,  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a product!&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> I LOVE HSI profess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon and got extensions put in for more volume.</li>
            <li> I also own HSI hair straightener, and this product combined with the straightener works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> It is the one I use most often.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this iron and am so happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> I still love the product, but the bottle it came in is a hassle to use.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell, I would describe it as a mix between amber and musk</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my hair, quite possibly ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, just re-ordered and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy Moroccan Oil for about 4 times the price; this works better.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into each strand, and leaves your hair silky, shiny, and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Would be more convenient if it was a pump style rather than just twist off</li>
            <li> than that such a great product!</li>
            <li> Is better than the CHI oil I was using.</li>
            <li> I wish this product had a squirt top, rather than having to pour some liquid into my hands in order to apply the product.  </li>
            <li> Product is ok</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for selling it as such a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> I love all of HSI products.</li>
            <li> This product met more than my expectations</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I can&#x27;t believe that the Arganesque is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Then I flat-iron, and it takes away even more.</li>
            <li> I’m sure, but</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were 5 star ratings.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that he seemed to suggest that this product did not have silicone so after seeing all the 5 star ratings along with his</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This makes it behave better than any product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I feel more than qualified to post this review.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, light weight, leaves your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair is frizz free all day!</li>
            <li> Much better than store bought argan oils.</li>
            <li> like the swivel cord... use it with the Argan Oil---makes hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Im using now and it works better then</li>

            <li> told me I didn&#x27;t even need to cut it because it was so healthy :)</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave your oily or greasing looking either, just healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this purchase, it works just like moroccanoil but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Well I was pleased that this gave off no nasty odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>

            <li> Makes my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a better container or would have like a better method of getting some of the oil out rather than pouring it on my hand.  </li>
            <li> Bought it out of curiosity mostly and I&#x27;ve been using it after shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> My hairdresser tried both the Ion flatiron by using it to style my hair on one side of my head and the HSI on the other to see which one works the best.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s better than the Healthy Sexy Hair oil, but not near as good as Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not as good as Sedu hair serum, it&#x27;s also not the high price.  </li>

            <li> The Argan Oil was shipped quickly and wrapped correctly so there was no issue with leakage.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 46 (as of this writing) and my hair has become more course as I get older.</li>
            <li> Super seller.</li>
            <li> With HSI  I have to use more than just a few drops and the result is as not as good as Biosilk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this HSI iron, it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also it makes hair oily quickly.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best and you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every day use of that treatment help to my hair looks healthy and finally I got compliment about my healthy hair from coworkers.</li>
            <li> It smells great, isn&#x27;t too oily, definitely makes my hair very shiny, and is affordable.  </li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t enough for my spoiled taste but after using this oil I must say I&#x27;m more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I even love the way it leaves my hands feeling soft and smooth after I&#x27;ve applied it to my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this when I blow dry and straighten my hair and it definitely give the nice healthy shine:) give a try!</li>
            <li> I have tried one of the highly rated 100% Argan oil products on Amazon and have had much better luck with this one.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT (light, soft, and ridiculously smooth) for days afterward, much longer than when I straighten it with just the other stuff I use.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again, I thought the price was right for such a good sized bottle.</li>
            <li> So, I did not know how this oil would look on hair drying naturally and was so happy to see that it gets rid of all the frizzes and keeps my hair moist, soft and perfectly curled all day long and even into the next days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchased this because I got a free sample with a flat iron and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i first time try ，it makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li> If your scalp doesn&#x27;t mind all the chemicals, then try it, it will make your hair look very pretty.</li>
            <li> The best part is that this product actually does work, my hair is now naturally silky and much healthier than it was two months ago.</li>
            <li> I use this on my Beard, it keeps it from becoming frizzy, and when I use a straight iron on my beard it protects it from heat.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product at one time!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> And I only take about 5-10 minutes at the very most to straighten.  </li>
            <li> I normally dont write reviews, but this is one of my most satisfy purchase thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and it was becoming a burden, so much so that I was considering getting a haircut.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again because it provides protection from flat irons with no buildup and smells great!</li>
            <li> We ordered full size bottles through Amazon and continue to be delighted with the product, now on the third month of consistent use.</li>
            <li> It tames my fly aways and split ends  without weighing down my curls.</li>
            <li> Great product - doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It smells great and never leaves a residue or weighs down your hair like some products do.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong chemical smell, I had to use way too much of it, and it did not make my hair much softer.</li>
            <li> Realistically, you can purchase argan at many stores but HSI seemed to leave my hair much more smooth than the other products.  </li>
            <li> its amazing leaves my  hair soft and pretty</li>
            <li> This one however, was a lot less money and a great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great for black Americans hair.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product but created slight flakes on use.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I use about a half teaspoonful on my shoulder length hair and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to comb thru (a real issue).</li>
            <li> Easy transaction &amp; received item fast.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel dry or greasy before I stepped in the shower either, so the sample did a good job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I happened across this product on Amazon, but I was very impressed with the reviews and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This product really makes styling easy.</li>
            <li> People complimented me left and right, this flat iron was a great investment and this leave in is the bomb!</li>
            <li> I think this products is very nice, i highly recomends this to all ladies out there with African hair.</li>
            <li> Have to agree with the other reviews, this oil is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and still gonna get more when this one is gone!</li>
            <li> The easier comb-out is a real plus!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago and love it!  </li>

            <li> It is absolutely unbelievable how good this Argan oil hair treatment is!</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not oily , it leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable- very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Its very light and leaves my hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all shopped Amazon, looking for a big seller with lots of positive reviews - bought it, and although good, it wasn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so I am very cautious with hair products.</li>
            <li> This product greatly helps with this, leaving my hair looking more natural - shinier and less frizzy and softer without the appearance of using a styling gel.</li>
            <li> While its not 100% Argon oil it works really well and is alot cheaper than the 100% Argon oil and works just fine on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair and when I wash it...</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li> And its just pure amazing for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite large, and it takes a tiny bit  to do the job, and so I consider it a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I was impressed because I have coarse hair, and it worked and did not leave my hair feeling very dry</li>
            <li> She says that it really improves the texture of her fine hair, and it curls and straightens much better than the old iron.</li>
            <li> thing really works, I&#x27;ve tried many many hair products including the famous Moroccan oil, none of them did what this little guy does to my hair with 2 times.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a great deal of time to really work with styling my hair (mother of a 2-year-old), but the few quick flat iron stylings I have managed to undertake seem to have produced good results.</li>
            <li> the HSI flat iron if you are interested in real sleek styles - also does a very nice flip or curl-under.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on all of the other positive reviews, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate everyone&#x27;s detailed help and I hope this helps someone as well.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing because it only helps your hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and calm after.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will bring back the glass bottles with the amazing pumps on them.</li>
            <li> so I like a product that is not too heavy but leaves a great shine on my hair.</li>

            <li> I was happy with the vendor and product was delivered as expected, but I just didn&#x27;t care for the product so much after use.  </li>
            <li> Most of us jumped on the wagon of Morrocon Oil, but at nearly $43 a bottle, who can afford it.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product is worth your money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> , that tends to split from frequent styling, but with this product I am able to save my hair and allow it to grow out healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this natural product.  </li>
            <li> The next day you will find your hair just as nice and still not greasy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> It has tamed my hair frizziness completely and makes my hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> This  completely transformed my hair into silky shiny healthy looking hair in a matter of a week.  </li>
            <li> After using HSI Argon oil, my hair is soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I still ordered it thinking it must be worth all the hype.</li>
            <li> I put some mayo in my hair, that worked far better.</li>
            <li> (I only use a nickel size amount in my hair as it spreads rather nicely).</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, a spray is really useful for evenly spread oil on hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing it out for about 18 months and rarely trim it.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft, shiny, and healthy.</li>
            <li> It smells great and definitely helps keep my hair soft</li>
            <li> Most of the ingredients are chemical based, so I would not recommend the HSI Professional Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking a dot worth.</li>
            <li> I really like the good smell,  but I haven&#x27;t seen different in my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definently worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for nearly a month now and love the smell and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioning products for my naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and then some.it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and then some.</li>
            <li> so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> the amount of money I would paid to send it back would not be cost effective.</li>
            <li> Thus far I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Hair feels incredibly soft, frizz-free and it gives my hair a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> Still, I would recommend a more natural version of this oil.</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my hair soft and helps with the frizz all while protecting it from blow drying/curling/straightening.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks fresh and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Not purfume laced, it just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope it stays at this affordable price, although it&#x27;s certainly worth $50, or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, I am able to achieve the soft shiny look that my stylist gets from my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, soft, and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> This HSI feels just like my old reliable Solia, but it&#x27;s better because it performs just as well</li>
            <li> super fine (my stylist says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;like a baby&#x27;s hair&amp;#34;) and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I love HSO Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil leaves the hair soft and not greasy, and smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> company.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the result for my frizzy hair, I like Biosilk much better.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product and I am a woman of color with natural hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li> Love this product leaves your hair so soft and it doesnt make it look oily.  </li>
            <li> the next day I took a picture of my hair and went to work and got a few compliments that my hairdo was looking good and that I looked good.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy, shiny, and feels soft.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the indulgence.</li>
            <li> I just love this oil, makes my hair so soft and it has protected it from the heat.</li>
            <li> but it works the best for restoring damaged broken or bleached hair.</li>
            <li> A relative of mine had an HSI straightener, when I tried hers, I was amazed, and when she told me the price, I HAD to order one of my own.</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> But so far no problems and love the shine my hair has.</li>
            <li> I just use a little bit right before blow drying and it gives great results.</li>
            <li> i have very fine hair, so many products weigh it down, or leave it greasy.  </li>
            <li> HSI leave in conditioner is really one of the best products if you color your hair and use flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> make the hair not dry any more, very useful production, very recommend it to you all!</li>
            <li> Before, I had been using Tresemme thermal protections, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great and leaves hair stiff like hairspray.</li>
            <li> Both of the HSI products I have are great for helping to tame my wavy curls.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many hair products, including other argan oil products, and this is my favorite oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it to help tame frizziness and manage fly aways.</li>
            <li> Only issue is it doesn&#x27;t have dropper but other than that excellent quality product.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample of this with my HSI flat iron purchase and was so pleased I ordered a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Also use to tame fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I wanted to give everyone a quick breakdown of what&#x27;s in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I loved the product so much that when I discovered there was a flat iron to work along with the oil</li>
            <li> When it was the perfect pour, it was great, but too much will leave you greasy and too little left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my hair very manageable and more importantly it doesn&#x27;t weight it down but gives it a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve decided to purchase because this product is very light and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for flat iron users.</li>
            <li> I got a sample bottle with my flat iron and liked it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know it will also protect my hair when I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Nice with flat iron also</li>
            <li> Not as good as other people described.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the Argan oil before I put the flat iron to it.</li>
            <li> good size bottle will last a long time :)</li>
            <li> Now here I am, a grandma with silver hair using the HSI flat hair iron I purchsed online through Amazon and really loving it.  </li>
            <li> I liked the shine it gave my hair when I used the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers were right - they smell really good.  </li>
            <li> Well, an hour later I finally got to see myself in the mirror, and voila, non-frizzy, awesome, super soft curls.</li>
            <li> Well, an hour later I finally got to see myself in the mirror, and voila, non-frizzy, awesome, super soft curls.</li>
            <li> and I use this mostly right now as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and they were right.</li>
            <li> Once you find the right amount of pumps your hair needs, you will never look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> apply it before straightening and it softens the hair up right away.</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time and with everything</li>
            <li> I put this on after my hair is washed and it absorbs right in.  </li>
            <li> one thing, I can&#x27;t seem to get the amount right every time...</li>
            <li> It leaves just the right about of</li>
            <li> I use it before I apply heat to my hair and sometimes right out of the shower for conditioning.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t have the money to get one right away</li>
            <li> WORKED ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S THICK FRIZZIE HAIR, WORKED ON MY SON&#x27;S CURLS (WITHOUT FLATIRON :), WORKED ON MY DRY DAMAGED HAIR EXCELLENT THERMAL PROTECTOR.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair shiny and soft, your hair will feel so healthy after you put this in your hair, I use it so much and it lasts ages!</li>
            <li> Oh, and the smell is wonderful and very subtle.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the sample a try and the results actually turned out pretty nicely even before I&#x27;d started using the iron.</li>
            <li> Instantly Makes your hair silky, shiny and gives it a healthy look- check mark - true</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair after shower and it dries up sooo soft without even using the hot iron and when I do use it, the results are even better.</li>
            <li> This is a great little bottle of oil!</li>
            <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil is a phenomenal product that left my hair feeling silky smooth and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it, and it just absorbs this product leaving my hair feeling smooth and looking shiny and healthy not greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use less and then add in more oil if you need</li>
            <li> The only positive about this product is the nice smell.</li>
            <li> In our quest we have had some success but none that have given us consistent results like this product.  </li>
            <li> It has considerably lessened the redness due to rosacea and serves as a perfect, light, daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Considering how much use I&#x27;ve gotten and still have a practical full bottle, the price is pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering how much use I&#x27;ve gotten and still have a practical full bottle, the price is pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Felt every drop is absorbed and my hair got softer in the first time use.</li>
            <li> Ok so...I&#x27;ve been using argan  oil in general for about 2 years</li>
            <li> What I got was beautiful shiny glossy hair especially after I used my HSI ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s aroma, while being pleasant, is a little over powering.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you pour an oil, you&#x27;re not going to get a perfect 2-3 drops; you&#x27;re going to get a little handful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like pure silk for my hair!</li>
            <li> Works exactly how it should and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because I live in Florida and it helps so much with humidity and frizz but also with dry</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s your hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I had dried and deeply damaged hair, but it becomes silky and beautiful after using this product!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product since it makes her hair soft and nice, and I have ordered it twice so far.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, and is a very generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have greasy hair naturally, so I can easily go a week between washes when straightening.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have greasy hair naturally, so I can easily go a week between washes when straightening.  </li>

            <li> My hair gets soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I know it is a great product, will definitely purchase ths oil in the future.</li>
            <li> Great for African American hair.</li>
            <li> I had a question regarding packaging and they were very prompt in replying adequately.  </li>
            <li> A must have for me, a new forever product!!!  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for a couple of months now, and can honestly say that I can not live without it.</li>
            <li> Makes her hair very straight and soft and easy to manage for her.</li>
            <li> I compared it to my Moraccan Oil Light MoroccanoilTreatment which does not protect my hair from heat at all and ends up drying my fine hair after using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> But I tried the HSI Argan oil on my damp hair before blow dry, the result was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> It left my hair very smooth, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> got here very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much, so the bottle lasts longer than you would think.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li> I reserve one star in that the product is new to me and I must try it out under stringent circumstances to be sure to respond accurately to those who, like me, depend almost entirely on customer reviews in choosing products online.  </li>
            <li> The comb glides right through and my hair is more amenable to my attempts to control it in general.</li>
            <li> After using this product several times, I am very happy with the silky, soft results that it has given my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy versatility in my styles and this product makes my hair smooth, shiny &amp; protected for blow out and flat iron styles.</li>
            <li> I kept my 5 yr old niece over the holidays and this is what she used instead of conditioner on her baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> ... Protects my hair and leaves it looking and feeling silky smooth after each pass with my HSI flat iron - which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up nicely and glides through my hair removing any &#x27;frizzies&#x27; and leaving it shiny and bouncy straight.  </li>
            <li> I run this through my hair before I blow dry it every morning, and it leaves my hair easy to straighten and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Left her hair super soft and shiny and more importantly to her - straight.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent where the Moroccan Oil has a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a straightener, I strongly recommend theirs, it is half the price of a Chi, with much better results and durability.</li>
            <li> Loved this Argan Oil more than any other because it makes your smooth &amp; shiny -without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair was dull and frizzy from over processing and was really happy with the result.</li>
            <li> no other product has given me such good and instantaneous results.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the HSI Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and works well to keep my fine hair from turning into a frizzy mess using the iron to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way ... and it will leave your hair looking great!</li>
            <li> Bought a long time, just use it, rub the hair soft and bright, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Great for flat ironing with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> i had some doubts at first .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This fluid is &#x27;lighter&#x27; and works much better for her.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of argan oil and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I got my first trial with the hsi iron.</li>
            <li> I may not have had to do that if I had used it first.</li>
            <li> and I color it and use hot irons and curlers.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this product better is for it to have a dropper.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample with a straightening iron I purchased.</li>
            <li> This last week I went for a haircut and my stylist complimented me on how healthy my hair has become.  </li>
            <li> It not only protects, it also nuirish my hair and gives it a healthy look.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops which I use mostly on the edges and then comb through from the edges to the crown.</li>
            <li> It makes her hair smell fantastic and it feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Also this is my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much longer than before that I even get commented on its length!</li>
            <li> Works great on my course, thick and frizzy hair that needs heat treating.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing the Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t left with a oily residue and my hair looked so shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because of the stellar reviews and rating.</li>
            <li> I would like this product more if it was packaged differently.  </li>
            <li> This product instantly make my hair silky, shines and healthy look.</li>
            <li> Really prompt delivery too!</li>
            <li> I first tried it when I received a sample along with the HSI straightener.</li>
            <li> First time buyer.  </li>
            <li> use it only as a product that gives a healthy shine to your hair, and NOT as a heat protectant.    </li>
            <li> It really makes my hair shiny and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> I haver very wavy and unruly hair, but this makes it so manageable!</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the first ingredient listed in there is SILICONE</li>
            <li> and I tried many products in an attempt to bring life back to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my thick, sometimes frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and more manageable now - and if I decide to add curls, the curls last all day without adding hair spray.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first two listed ingredients are Dimethicone Crosspolyme (DC) and Cyclopentasiloxane (CYC).  </li>
            <li> This product actually really worked!  </li>
            <li> Notably it disappeared into my skin almost instantly, leaving a sense of a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34; if that is the correct term.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and smooth, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But today was the first day I used this product, and I was floored by the results.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty pressed for words.  </li>
            <li> If you put aside that fact that its mostly chemicals and not 100% Argan Oil, it actually worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I read a ton of the reviews for this stuff and obviously it sounded like liquid gold or something.</li>
            <li> This is the sole product I use on my hair to make it sleek, shiny, and incredibly healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> If you use to much it can make your hair look greasy!</li>
            <li> This is my second order I love it</li>
            <li> The packaging was pretty beat up when I received it.</li>
            <li> I was paying 75 dollars a bottle exactly this size.</li>
            <li> I definitely got better,</li>
            <li> It definitely made my hair more shiny and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t write reviews recently but had to on this one.  </li>
            <li> I first bought the HSI straightener about a year ago and they had sent a sample of this Argan Oil leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I like it at first.</li>
            <li> first time I rubbed this in my hair</li>
            <li> Hair is smooth and soft for days.  </li>
            <li> would like to buy more and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> prompt shipment, first time I&#x27;ve used argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed is my hair has a lot of static since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, and it has done wonders in my hair care.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a salon look without paying salon prices!</li>
            <li> My initial reason for purchasing was for the shine, which it does do, although, I wish more so.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a dime sized drop and I had better hair.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> So straightening has been a constant challenge and most irons and hair product</li>
            <li> Not necessarily a leave in to me, more like an oil</li>
            <li> My hair is so much shinier since I started using this oil!</li>
            <li> (I use tresemme heat tamer on hair first, then blow dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Ten Miracle Texture Fiber to separate out pieces and spray with favorite finishing spray.</li>
            <li> I was so upset as I just could not match the extensions texture to the texture of my real hair!</li>
            <li> but it does not last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same consistency and works a lot better.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays the way I styled it for much longer than it would without this product and it smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> However, it should last a while. :)</li>
            <li> I tried for the first time and</li>
            <li> I tried many different oils</li>
            <li> Really recommend!</li>
            <li> Over all, I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone with similar problems to myself or anyone just looking for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Pretty effortless.  </li>
            <li> That is exactly what you are looking for in a thermal protector.</li>
            <li> With each section I flat-ironed, I dipped my pointer finger in the oil, rubbed it between my first two fingers and my thumb, and applied it to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of argan oil through my hairdresser to the tune of $40.</li>
            <li> I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 80 products trying to find something and so happy with this.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this, use it daily.</li>
            <li> I like it better than biosilk and a similar paul Mitchel product.</li>
            <li> I have drawn enough comparisons to say this is nowhere close to magic in a (very impractical, glass, open-pour) bottle!</li>
            <li> Only issue i have with it is the bottle, i tend to pour more than needed on my hand.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used it for the first time and it leaves</li>
            <li> I absolutely love beauty products, so any opportunities that present themselves to me are amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recieved another sample that was more then enough, this product with or with out  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and frizz free with every application.</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle ordered 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> Was apprehensive at first thinking it would leave my hair oily but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, is a great flat iron for the price.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> The results are higher than my expectations.</li>
            <li> Ok, bought this in bulk last time.</li>
            <li> I have had shoulder length and more recently short:  </li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft and damage free.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty frizzy with fly-aways everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I just got my first haircut since using this product.  </li>
            <li> As my hair stylist worked with my hair, she was commenting on how healthy and moisturized it was, and asked what I was doing differently.  </li>
            <li> Buyers be aware.</li>
            <li> After the first apply of this HSI leave in oil I started to feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a handful of times since purchasing and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li> This is the first bottle of argon oil that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair smooth soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t use hair products but this thing, I love it, leaves it looking natural.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Works like more expensive treatments at a better price, leaving my hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Will I buy leave-in treatment conditioner again – ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li> Just let the oil soak in your hair at first then style.</li>
            <li> I have had better experiences using Argan Oil by One and Only.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my Argan Oil by One and Only and had better results.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> I still have fly-aways even after ironing my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t completely frizz free.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil will always keep a extra</li>
            <li> I have thick,curly,frizzy hair and this oil is exactly what my hair needed.</li>
            <li> Between the heat styling tools and my thyroid, maintaining healthy, moisturized hair is a losing battle, especially through Ohio winters.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it I absolutely loved it ❤</li>
            <li> it smells nice and very light, but i don&#x27;t c anything different from my other cheaper products that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The most important point to note here, is that I went home afer getting caught in the rain, rubbed a pea size amount of the product throughout my hair, combed down &amp; tucked in the ends</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it would be worth it for me to spend that kind of money to dump half a bottle in my hair once or twice a month, but it&#x27;s tempting.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair so soft and silky!!!!</li>
            <li> The good: It really does make my hair very slick and smooth...</li>
            <li> I bought this at the last minute (impluse buy) but based on all the positive reviews I figured it would be a safe bet.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly long, layered hair and even when I would flat iron it, there was always fly aways.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different argon oils and this  by far is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Thanks Blue Novelties for having such a great product and pricing it reasonably.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely, delicate scent which relaxes me and makes me feel happy, so I use it as aromatherapy especially when I gently massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li> It also smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel oily like lots of other AA hair products do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price, and will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> This item delivered as promised and I love the look of my hair after using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love how this product make&#x27;s my hair feel before and after flat ironing.</li>
            <li> and I use my flat iron on most days.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron oil.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe I put up with any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice scent to it though and is not oily like some of the other serums.</li>
            <li> Also, products claiming to last a week with straight awesome hair with washes are pointless for me since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t thought of using any sort of protective conditioner for my hair with my flat iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I have been introduced to this as I feel like I&#x27;m being proactive in keeping my hair from getting damaged.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other products she&#x27;s tried, it smells really nice, too.</li>
            <li> I love this oil to help keep my hair from frizzing and to help protect it from the flat iron heat.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I flat iron my hair and love the results.</li>
            <li> sure to buy it with the HSI flat iron</li>
            <li> While most people (probably) use it during heat styling, I also use it as just a leave-in even when I don&#x27;t style with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Really does make your hair silky and shiny, and just look healthy, but if you use a lot on one section of your hair it will weigh it down, so even with it being a light oil, it still can buildup and create a greasy problem</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> Hair is really silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Service was great, I received it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other top of the line products and this one if the best I&#x27;ve had at half the cost!  </li>
            <li> I only use 2-3 drops for my shoulder length hair and my hair would be nice and smooth once I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> So it seems to work as an ok humidity protector, but I&#x27;ll have to wait to the next summer to experience the DC heatwave to see how it holds up in very humid conditions.</li>
            <li> It leaves my naturally curly, color treated hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Particularly effective for keeping curly hair soft with daily swimming.</li>
            <li> but in a good way, okay that sounds weird..</li>
            <li> I tried another more expensive brand, and it made our hair look greasy and didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, there&#x27;s no way this would add that much volume, but for what I have it does an incredible job.</li>
            <li> It just makes my hair so much more manageable and really helps to protect my hard-won straightness from humidity (which is a constant issue in my part of the world).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, so it will last for a year or even more.</li>
            <li> Love this product because it makes my natural hair soft and manageable....</li>
            <li> Now be aware you aren’t buying pure argan oil, and it has some synthetic stuff in there</li>
            <li> I have pretty &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; hair that likes to do everything except settle down and look nice.  </li>
            <li> Her hair after using both this and my flat iron is straight, soft, and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better and I have received compliments on how shinny and healthy my hair looks which is amazing since I damaged it pretty bad from coloring/hi-lighting.  </li>
            <li> the shower and my hair dries super soft!</li>
            <li> Despite that, it&#x27;s pretty healthy, mainly because I keep it fairly short.  </li>
            <li> With the HSI it looked halfway decent the first day, then better the second day, after I&#x27;d flat-ironed again.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome to use as directed when flat ironing, but I have fine hair and usually when I put this stuff all over, I have to wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li> it has a great smell (not strong though) and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It helps tame the frizz, leaves my hair feeling  smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> Since then, using the Argan oil before I begin styling, I have noticed a positive difference in the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> I love the product, especially for my natural hair; my hair feels silky soft and easy to manage in any style.</li>
            <li> Either way it cuts down tremendously on the frizz, and leaves it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It really makes hair soft, shiny and frizz free when you useable straight iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have used other top brand serums in the past but this one works best especially when blending my hair with weaves.</li>
            <li> I am still in love with this stuff, and I think I always will be as long as they keep making it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the HSI iron and argan oil, I have had more success than all other products I tried.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product I woke up with much \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels oily when first applied, but seems to to really distribute well once it is heated when hair is styled.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in this product is silicone, it makes you makes you wonder how much argon oil is in it,</li>
            <li> First thing I always check, how much does something smell.  </li>
            <li> I decided to switch back to Morrocan oil until I came across this product and due to the great reviews decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not an accident-prone person or living with kids, you should be okay.</li>
            <li> My hair is really long so maintaining split ends is no joke, but this has kept my hair healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> When I use my curling iron or flat iron, my hairstyle stays in place all day and is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Good luck trying to get a small amount out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Since i use my flat iron often, it feels good having extra protection.  </li>
            <li> I bought other products that claimed to be argan oils, and they were nowhere near as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> Some hair oils make your hair fabulous but after 1 week feel super dry without it</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair dry or wet, whether I&#x27;m using styling tools or not, although their (hsi) flat iron is great when I get around to doing  my hair. :)</li>
            <li> If your hair feels too dry, use more.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Ok guys, if you have dry damaged hair with splits like me, get it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Mine was getting old and I wanted something nicer, so I checked out Amazon&#x27;s selection and was quickly sold on this one.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel super soft.</li>
            <li> It works just as promised and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is always super soft and I get compliments from others on the smell.</li>
            <li> No more frizz and fly aways when I straighten my naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have healthy but dry hair with some gray</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes hair drying time quick and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had an old bottle with a pump that I cleaned out and put this product into so that was helpful.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, it makes my hair feel ft and shiney even after blowing my hair dry every day</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it keeps my hair shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> It is really soft now, full but not flyaway, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Had to back my good review because this product didn&#x27;t work for me in long run.</li>
            <li> Not at all, even in large amounts.</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Buy the large bottle, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Beware and be smart before buying.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all-natural pure argan oil, this product is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with this product, I NEVER have to use the flat iron spray, my hair is now easy to get straight (and takes less time) plus feels silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when using this leave-in conditioner for the very first time.</li>
            <li> I apply it before I flat iron, and it leaves my hair very silky, not greasy, the way it is packaged for shipping needs improvement, but other than that, its a great product.</li>
            <li> I recently dropped a brand new bottle on my tile bathroom floor causing the bottle to shatter and the precious oil to spill all over the place.</li>
            <li> The lid was loose and I&#x27;m glad I got it when I did, as it would have gone everywhere</li>
            <li> try it, you have nothing to loose :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair and it does great for both.</li>
            <li> Works great on both wet and dry hair without messing my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female and this works great for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> It leaves it super soft, straight, and silky.....</li>
            <li> The only drawback is you can easily use too much.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair manageable and super soft.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner lends a wonderful sheen and the entire effect lasts for at least 4 days! &#x27;</li>
            <li> included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to actually straighten it.</li>
            <li> She had fine blonde hair</li>
            <li> I will gladly purchase more of this, as it seemed to help way more than other, more expensive options!</li>
            <li> The argon oil is thick in texture, but it is super light once you smooth it into your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have very dry freeze hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry from dying over many years.  </li>
            <li> I put just a little in my hands, warm it up and run all through my wet/damp hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive, smells better, and most importantly works better.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a nice light weight oil that didn&#x27;t weight my hair down while flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> Made the flat iron glide through easy too.</li>
            <li> If I use my flat iron and no oil (or another brand of oil I used to use) my hair will straighten easily but curl as soon as I get warm/</li>
            <li> soft, shiny and smells good (just use a little or you will have greasy hair).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is great for the fact it can be used on dry hair whereas other products cannot be.  </li>
            <li> it has a very high amount of silicone in it which makes it seem extra smooth but is very drying to my hair.</li>
            <li> the 4 oz size is HUGE and will last for months.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again,, It made my hair so straight, shinny and feels so light and manageable.</li>
            <li> , I ended up getting too much of it out</li>
            <li> thanks for all the reviews in here that helped me alot to emagine what im going to feel.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t not that this bottle is used , very disappoints ;(</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I went somewhere very humid &amp; didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in hair.  </li>
            <li> I notice that it is easier to straight iron my hair</li>
            <li> Hair used to look damaged after so much color treatment.</li>
            <li> After using this product I can really notice the difference in how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> This product is very comparable to the CHI SILK INFUSION.</li>
            <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really ever have split ends</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel oily even though I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> oily, dries fast and my hair shines beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> It really helps my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really damaged my hair by going ombre.  </li>
            <li> gently squeeze my flattened palms together.</li>
            <li> Works well and my color lasted much longer, in spite of being in the sun.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really works on all sorts of hair.</li>
            <li> And at a reasonable price?  </li>
            <li> Been using it for months now and don&#x27;t really notice any benefits from using this product</li>
            <li> My hair has also stopped breaking off as much</li>
            <li> I wanted to see for myself why Argan oil is making so much buzz.</li>
            <li> Like all things that generate hype, I was very skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did experience frizz but not so much that my hair drew up into a cloud/mushroom.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very time-consuming to style.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair is much healthier and silky</li>
            <li> It really does help protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> With really course hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after buying the HSI ceramic straight iron for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very  impress with this product .</li>
            <li> Smooth, not sticky and can last longer.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and tends to frizz, but when I put this product on my hair it makes it look smooth and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I find if I use too much in my hair, it becomes frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have to say it has a very silky feel without an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I think this product really helps to style your hair easier and after blow drying, it literally looks and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your fast delivery.</li>
            <li> You will really like it.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute miracle in a bottle .My</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this oil.  </li>
            <li> I was very please with this product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and very durable.</li>
            <li> Wife really loves this product for her hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was really damaged from bleaching it.</li>
            <li> I really believe it is what repaired my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it builds up in your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it, this leave in conditioner did absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my hair responds and feels...</li>
            <li> and it straightens much easier than before.</li>
            <li> This is really a five-star product, but I deducted a star&lt;br /&gt;for packaging.</li>
            <li> Absolutely yes</li>
            <li> Adds softness, sheen, and really feels like it conditions the hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a leave-in light oil to use daily and my mom recommended that I buy Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It is fuller, softer and so much healthier looking that it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law absolutely loves the stuff though.</li>

            <li> I have relaxed hair that I wear mostly straight.</li>
            <li> I have really stubborn hair for straightening.</li>
            <li> It does what it wants when it wants to.</li>
            <li> Bought it because a tiny sampler came in my HSI straightener - which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> it does make it much smoother and easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> she seems to really like it</li>
            <li> much ie:</li>
            <li> I then went on to straight my hair and thats when I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this purchase; you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I have not been having as much breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used too much - hair</li>
            <li> But I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much work it takes out of blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been really helping.</li>
            <li> and now we are both really</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been colored and highlighted, and frankly, after this summer, was really unmanagable.  </li>
            <li> The ends felt like straw, no matter how much I conditioned them, and my hair floated around my face.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thick/long hair.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this out</li>
            <li> I have curly, and frizzy hair that I wear straight.</li>
            <li> It kept my hair straight and no frizz.</li>
            <li> When I used this, it really made my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very silky and shiny (and I have very wavy hair).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a long-term difference in the moisture or shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it absolutely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very versatile.</li>

            <li> This one fits the bill at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Then again, I didn&#x27;t notice much of the perfume after I&#x27;d styled my hair with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still straight, even after I took a shower this morning.</li>
            <li> This did not do a thing for my hair except to make it look very greasy.</li>
            <li> I Bleach my hair and this really tames the frizz and dryness</li>
            <li> It has really helped keep the integrity of my overly processed hair.</li>
            <li> This is just enough to then smooth through my hair.</li>
            <li> The oil leaves hair very shiny but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It stops my hair from frizzing out and it really stops the damage from heat.</li>
            <li> she has very curly &amp;#34;Shirley Temple&amp;#34; type of hair and maybe the tropical heat plus her hair</li>
            <li> I use it after blowdrying my hair and before using a straight iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> It made a real difference to my chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Since she has been using it, her hair is much healthier and there are no signs of damage.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> After I swim and wash my hair, I use a lot more on my wet hair, but it never makes it oily and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged after exposure to chlorine in the pool.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy though</li>
            <li> and it really isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> It took about 4 &amp;#34;pours&amp;#34; into the saucer to do my whole head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always get way more oil on my hand than I expected.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe there was that much difference in brands.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it’s really helping my hair on styling days.</li>
            <li> In fact they are very close in their ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> but I really like what I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hair was very shiny too.  </li>
            <li> It really protects my hair and leaves it so shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pin straight with no kinks or frizz and its even easier to control how you want the flip at the end of your hair.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair has been much healthier and</li>
            <li> We really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have found it works better for me if I put it on while my hair is wet or damp.</li>
            <li> HSI has really made a difference in the appearance and condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this product to friends and am looking forward to hearing if they like the oil as much as I do.</li>
            <li> My hair now looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this product.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: I would recommend trying this product to anyone who wants straighter, shinier hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of different products to get my hair to lay smooth.  </li>
            <li> but it does not take much and it leaves my hair silky and as full/light as I want it to be.  </li>
            <li> It helps hide some of my really damaged parts.  </li>
            <li> When the sample was empty she insisted on 2 more bottles of this argan oil.</li>
            <li> So far worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Its texture is thicker than cooking oil, so using too much could make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing as much shine with this either.</li>
            <li> I had to think about if or a week before spending this amount on this product because I can find Argan oil for much cheaper, and I have used Argon oil but not from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it being so much healthier.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute go to</li>
            <li> The oil really helps prevent my hair from getting those sizzled ends (those who have damaged, fried hair know what I&#x27;m talking about)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very silky but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an argan oil that is non greasy and flake free after multiple uses, and this product has surpass my expectations.</li>
            <li> Either way I would like to find out, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter because this product really works.  </li>
            <li> and it straightened so fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and very touchable.</li>
            <li> it really helps manage my hair and control friz.</li>
            <li> I have hair that can tend to get oily fast, and I struggle with applying conditioner because I never know if it is really needed and then regret how frizzy/over oily my hair looks after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li> The leave in-treatment really does help make my bleached hair feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really have seen a difference in my hair since I have used this oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product and leaving it in my hair, it&#x27;s left my hair so silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I have VERY think hair and iron it probably every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> (Argan oil is very greasy.)</li>
            <li> it feeling very silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier</li>
            <li> hair is smooth as silk when I use it, and I only have to use it once after washing my hair</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil really sets it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i believe it was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> For the first time in a long time I was able to go natural after a week of using the Aegean oil.</li>
            <li> It was nice to only have to order 1 larger bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, and any leftover oil quickly absorbs in my alreay dry hands.</li>
            <li> I liked how it worked immediately after I put it on; however, after a few hours it seemed as if I never even put it on.</li>
            <li> Love this product and definitely would recommend to anyone looking for soft hair.</li>
            <li> Overall she has been thrilled with the product, with her only wish being that she found it sooner.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and smooth not heavy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not kidding it definitely tricks people into thinking I have luxurious, soft, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and hard to straighten, however with thisoil and the HSI straightener, what used to take me at least an hour on a good day now takes about 25 minutes and my hair is nice and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair which is normally very dry, extremely soft &amp; it is a great protector when using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> the HSI flat iron if you are interested in real sleek styles - also does a very nice flip or curl-under.yer at a time to flat iron if you have extra curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> so so soft!!!</li>
            <li> I am very stingy with the amount of oil I use, and even just a little goes a long way and keeps my hair smooth (and smelling great) for 3-5 days in my personal experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was worried the oil would weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This absorbs right into the stands and immediately makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower and go to bed, waking with soft, manageable and shiny (not greasy) hair.</li>
            <li> This update is just a couple days after my original review, which means that after just a few weeks of using this product, my hair stylist noticed a huge difference in the healthiness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> this product is good but not different than any other Argan oil out there.</li>
            <li> it might not have functions to make hair softer, reduce losing hairs, and the kind of botter is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used one other spray product and while that worked for a couple of weeks, I noticed the leave-in spray stopped making my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the silky soft salon results when using this argan oil and then flat ironing my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried one other moroccan oil hair treatment from another company, but I really prefer this HSI Argan oil over it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> My hair is soft shiny and smells lovely after using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This argan oil leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and I love that it also has a thermal protector for when I use my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products, but this one is superior.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to allow my hair to grow; therefore a combination of significantly reducing the amount of heat I use, deep conditioning once per week, and moisturizing/wrapping my hair with a satin scarf each night has really helped.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, however, I have super fine hair and it is still a little frizzy at the ends with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> After playing around with it a little bit I realized the best way to use this was to put very little conditioner in my hair and then apply the argon oil after I blowdried it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic effect on hair - makes it shiny, straight, adds moisture, most effective styling natural product before blowdry, especially well suited for thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil based on the other reviews I read - and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I also love that doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy like other oils.</li>
            <li> Product leaves hair shiny and smooth and protects it from my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I no longer use other styling product that contains more chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> I like HSI argan oil because it is better than other argan oils for the price.  </li>
            <li> I would love to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried many other smoothing serums, anti-frizz products, conditioners, etc.  </li>
            <li> have used it every other day since I got it a couple of weeks ago, and have even started getting compliments about how shiny and healthy my hair looks, already!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so its a great buy.</li>
            <li> Better than any other product she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried other argan oil products  which work better.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product more compare to the other argan oil leave-in treatment I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products containing Argan oil, but this one works better than the others I have tried (maybe because it has fewer other ingredients and more Argan oil?  </li>
            <li> I used it the first day I received it--just a little bit rubbed between my palms &amp; smoothed over the top of my hair, focusing on the ends that are damaged.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write a review, but this product wowed me!</li>
            <li> If you want smooth and shiny, use it with the flat iron, but you can skip the iron just to control frizz.</li>
            <li> After several months of moderate use, it did smooth out frizzy hair especially on the ends, leaves hair soft,  and smells nice for the whole family.</li>
            <li> My ends are dry and break off so easy...</li>
            <li> Purchased from Amazon saved a trip to the store and cost less, most important, Satisfaction or money back, Win,win situation.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great is a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> Flat ironing much less damaging because I don&#x27;t have to do as many passes to get smooth, shiny straight hair.</li>
            <li> , I recently got caught in a misty, dewy, humid mess one night and my straight hair held up fairly well to the moisture.</li>
            <li> Using just a bit of this oil keeps my hair straight almost all day long - I&#x27;ll see some very light wave return around my face by the end of the day, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> She highly recommends the oil for anyone that uses a straight iron.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty pissed when I received this product at first, mostly because I just spent 17 bucks on a tiny bottle, however, after using it</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really thought I was just going to have to live with it my whole life until i came upon this product.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments left and right!  </li>
            <li> I have thought of putting some in its own dropper type bottle so that I don&#x27;t use to much as a tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I use the HSI Argan Oil when my hair is at that almost dry stage by gently pouring a dollop into my hand and lightly massage it through the tresses.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair look and feel nice only after I blow dry it with a boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry, on my near blond highlights that have been bleached one time too many.</li>
            <li> They look very soft, smooth and silky by only using this serum.</li>
            <li> This oil left my wife&#x27;s hair very soft to the touch and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and fine and there is a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> It works well on my dry fine hair in dime size doses.</li>
            <li> After i used this the first time i realized this product made my hair just as soft just as manageable</li>
            <li> I can even BRUSH MY HAIR DRY without it getting super frizzy!</li>
            <li> First product ever to leave my hair so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, one of my friends noticed immediately and told me my hair looked so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> and you will not get no where near as much!</li>
            <li> I first tried HSI Professional Argan Oil when my stylist gave me a sample bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The HSI Argan Oil  is actually a leave-in treatment conditioner, that literally felt like true &amp;</li>
            <li> I used the product prior to styling with the HSI Professional Flat Iron (also a phenomenal product!).</li>
            <li> I have pretty damaged hair, but also prone to getting greasy which it will if you get this anywhere near your roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen plenty of old ladies with lovely soft gray hair, but mine&#x27;s coming in frizzy and coarse.</li>
            <li> I use moroccan oil too... but that usually is a little more greasy looking on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do put this on your ends like I do... be generous but not sloppy.</li>
            <li> the flat iron hands down best spent money on amazon to date!</li>
            <li> With just a small amount, rubbed together in your hands and slid down the ends of your hair, will leave it shiny, soft, non frizzy and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I would apply more right after I blow dry for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It is very light on my hair and takes a lot for it to get greasy but it never really gets that lush shinny look that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I got a few bottles for my friends as &#x27;late&#x27; new years gifts :)</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does (be careful if you have fine hair however</li>
            <li> I use quite a lot of it, and often for consecutive days without washing, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down the way many products do.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and most oils typically are too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly hair which I regularly blow dry straight and require a heat protectant for.</li>
            <li> The HSI&#x27;s plates close together completely, too, so it actually catches every hair (without snagging it!), which has made a huge difference in my level of frizzies and flyaways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> although I find if I do this I need to smooth an additional drop or two on my dry finished hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product almost four months ago and its more than half.</li>
            <li> After I wash and dry my hair, I pour a dime-sized amount onto my hand, rub to disperse and smooth it into my hair.</li>
            <li> I can use it when my hair is damp and when it is dry either way it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I notice a slight difference but nothing magical.</li>
            <li> I just use it once after shower while my mom&#x27;s hair which is more coarse require daily application at the moment.   </li>
            <li> First thing first, i felt the smoothness instantly as im spreading the drops through my hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product with mainly &amp;</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I am planning on getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of this type of conditioner and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Blue Novelties shipped the product quickly in a well-packed box, and then did a quality-control follow-up.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The HSI doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hot to the touch, and the outside of the iron doesn&#x27;t feel hot at all.</li>
            <li> Be careful though--my first full glass bottle fell an inch onto the floor and shattered.</li>
            <li> The secret to awesome curls is use this oil while wet, then don&#x27;t touch it while drying.  </li>
            <li> The secret to awesome curls is use this oil while wet, then don&#x27;t touch it while drying.  </li>
            <li> , now I wash it once a week as it stays soft and straight for much longer.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this particular brand because the soft/shiny results without the greasy/build up</li>
            <li> I will continue use the product and see if I would like it further more since I have only used it twice after I received it.  </li>
            <li> I also add a smaller amount to the top of my head (what&#x27;s left on my hands after distribution to the rest of my hair), and I&#x27;m amazed that it doesn&#x27;t cause any flattening at</li>
            <li> and she preferred a Chi which this particular store did not sale</li>
            <li> , you DO NOT need to put the product on your roots, only midlength to the ends).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great value, you only need a little to be effective, even on long hair (mine is past my shoulder blades, and while it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone with naturally curly/frizzy hair that wants it to be straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored every 5 weeks, hot dryer, and flat Iron, &amp; it stays super soft and silky with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of it and also makes my hair shiny and smooth, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (other hair products tend to do that).</li>
            <li> You use a TINY bit and it makes your hair SUPER soft!!</li>
            <li> I put it on before I flat-iron, and my hair stays straight and silky soft for days!</li>
            <li> My hair was easier to straighten and after sleeping on it, the next day my hair was still very straight!</li>
            <li> i have thick hair &amp; love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use too much but a money saver once you get the hang of how little you really need.</li>
            <li> But overall it improves my hair immensely, it feels great and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> , I hope it need more tight sealing cap.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m officially sold and I highly recommend their products to whoever is reading this.</li>
            <li> I will try it again in the spring / summer to see if it helps when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li> so can not tell if it is helping shield my hair from high heated styling tools.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I came back from the break, my school friend love to brush my hair since I used this product for several months, my hair really gotten silky soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Argan oils and this is the perfect consistency for hair--not too oily and not to watery, plus a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried other products, but says that just a tiny bit of this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who has experienced significantly less breakage.</li>
            <li> but I think I like the end result with the HSI Professional ARGAN oil more than with the other Argan oils.</li>
            <li> I never tried any sort of leave in hair old before a free sample came with a flat iron I purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it protects my hair even though I flat iron it daily after sweating from workouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Read countless reviews of other brands and honestly 3 or 4-ish stars</li>
            <li> All I can add to that is, I even use this when I am going with my natural wavy hair, and that I certainly will be repurchasing this soon (backup).</li>
            <li> I add a little more to the ends.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for months, both in my hair, as was recommended by my stylist, but I also put a little bit on my face each morning after shaving.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this little bottle of miracles.</li>
            <li> Of course, I purchased many other thermal protectors, but each were thrown out or donated to someone else after the first of second use.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and silky!!</li>
            <li> If you use it sparingly it will leave your hair soft and shiny!!  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to get straighter with this product but some of the ends are a little more frayed.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and shiny and it&#x27;s super soft with no static!</li>
            <li> Wife liked it so much this is the 2nd big bottle we have bought (had 2 sample bottles before from flat iron purchase).</li>
            <li> I use this before straightening my hair and it makes it very smooth and soft without the weighted down oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It is easily comparable to other leave-in conditioners at twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will straighten fairly easily, but with other products or without any products, i end up with somewhat \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> I wrote the review below when my hair was unprocessed (dye free).</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is much lighter and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It will be soft and straight.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the HSI professional argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every conditioner and nothing seemed to give my hair a soft and gentle texture and prevent it from poofing.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> hair looks like I came from a salon... very shiny, soft and manageable...</li>
            <li> It really does leave your hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> oil leaves my hair feeling soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Argan oil u know that is expensive so for this price is great.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing much easier and leave it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to the expensive Moroccan oil I had been buying and came across all the great reviews here.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny after use, you really must try the product for yourself.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have split ends anymore thanks to HSO Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can then flatten or fluff the hair as I see fit.  </li>
            <li> I like to wear my natural, 4b hair straight.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so soft and silky and feels soo much healthier too.</li>
            <li> But it would be better if there is a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; for the bottle so that I could get a few drop of oil in an easier way.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and this (and a hot iron) makes it silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I honestly was pretty skeptical about this product when I first got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally frizzy and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this product with a HSI straightener and me and my three teenage daughters loved it, so I bought a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it a few more times</li>
            <li> i will say its nice as a pre flat iron protector but not any nicer than other brands.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops before styling makes my hair look shiny and healthy without a greasy look or feel.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to leave my hair straight.</li>
            <li> product replaced the far more expensive Argan oil they sell at salons (I won&#x27;t name names, but the teal label with orange writing product is what I&#x27;m referring to) for me because it is cheaper and a better product, how often does that happen?</li>
            <li> I always disliked oils in my hair because they sat on top of the hair, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had a lot of breakage like I normally do during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Love how it only takes about a dime size for my long hair and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I noticed my arm getting tired after doing my hair, but it still looks good, so I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because in my opinion it is a good product but not exactly great.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too thick, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking.</li>
            <li> The secret to good curls in curly hair is don&#x27;t touch it while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li> The secret to good curls in curly hair is don&#x27;t touch it while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li> and I wish it had pump because its easy to pour a little too much out.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair sooo soft and healthy looking and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> : Getting the right amount each time I use it is a real guessing game; would be better if it came with a dropper cap.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and lovely!</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry the next day, I put 2 more drops on the end, tip my hair over/shake it out</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have kind of frizzy black hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks less frizzy, and feels more soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and it make my dry frizzy hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The change in my hair with these products is nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry, damaged looking, AND feeling hair.  </li>
            <li> I have permed African American hair, and a little bit goes a long way to help my hair feel soft, bouncy, and manageable while maintaining a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li> I put a tiny amount on my hair before I use the flat iron and it leaves my hair feeling soft and bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It works better than all the other argan oil products I&#x27;ve purchased before as those products have left my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> Not only is it great for the flat iron, but you can just use it everyday without the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enough said, right?</li>
            <li> Being mixed, finding the right hair products has been all about trial and error</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve finally found the right combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m usually not keen on putting oil in my hair because of the scorching heat coupled with the high humidity levels in my country.</li>
            <li> I can use this product before blow drying and it comes out straight and smooth enough to not even need the flat iron!  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair is frizzy due to the heat in FL but with this product my hair looks silky and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> I was actually contemplating cutting my hair soon but now that i have these great products that give me long straight healthy looking hair</li>
            <li> and I straighten my hair just to keep it looking tame and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde fine straight hair with an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> so I blow dry and flatiron every other day, so I really need a good protectant if I don&#x27;t want my hair to look like a total fuzz ball.</li>
            <li> You only use a few drops per amount of hair &amp; do not need to use more!</li>
            <li> i only need small amount , i like to use it after a shower before my hair become dry ( while my hair a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they&#x27;ll  make the bottle more easily to use (it&#x27;s still good)</li>
            <li> I had been reading such good things about using Argan Oil to add shine and manageability to your hair, (especially if you use heat tools regularly), that I finally tried</li>
            <li> I know this has cut down on the time it takes her to straighten her hair by a ton, easily going from an hour to 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> but when it dries it will be fine... and especially the second day!!!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any long-term effects, but I&#x27;m looking forward to enjoying soft silky hair as a result in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so silky, replaced all my other hair oils, keeps it smooth</li>
            <li> This product is oil but so light, as other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like brand new hair again.</li>
            <li> and I have lots of new growth.</li>
            <li> I had been using Moroccan oil for a while, and was reluctant to try something new.</li>
            <li> Happened to see this in my recommendations and saw the new pump bottle and immediately ordered.</li>
            <li> It helps with the fritz too, being that I do live in the south.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new style and decided to buy this.  </li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this product.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail hair product, the one I cannot, CANNOT live without.  </li>
            <li> live in Las Vegas</li>
            <li> My new must-have product.  </li>
            <li> I live in Vegas and this product makes my hair shiny and tamed.</li>
            <li> We got her a new straightener and there was a sample of the Argan Oil in the package.</li>
            <li> However, Amazon solved my issue and I received  new bottle.  </li>
            <li> This product helps straightening out my new growth while protecting from heat damage.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Because of where I live, I can&#x27;t speak about humidity, but it helps the moisture stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on after shower, before blow dry or flat iron, rub more on the ends.</li>
            <li> I use it on my damp hair and also on dry hair before using a flat iron and my hair looks silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t chemically process my hair (dyes or relaxers) and I was able to apply this, blow dry it out and flat iron</li>
            <li> product definitely worked for me: my hair was not weighed down; it had a healthy sheen; my hair became more manageable (and took less time to style); and, my hair feels a bit fuller and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> very rich and tame my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI previously and the HSI rivals it EASILY at a fraction on the price.</li>
            <li> After years of using a straight iron on my hair daily, it was really beginning to show.</li>
            <li> Its thick and has good volume, but its not greasy at the same time.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leave my hair feeling soft and thick.</li>
            <li> have long, thin, fine hair that tangles VERY easily.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, it&#x27;s OK, not exceptional; and in fact, smells very very close to the scent of the Moroccan Oil treatment</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (although a lot of it), and unlike a lot of products, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this does not weigh it down or make it look oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down</li>
            <li> I have always had problems finding the conditioner that did not leave my hair weighted down or frizzy since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> I use this right before flat ironing my hair to protect from the heat.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and protected from heat damage.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  this oil to anyone who appreciates soft, aromatic hair.</li>

            <li> Also leaves the hair feeling very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft and shiny</li>

            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and silky, I use</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very much and it last a looooong time.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> But after about 2 weeks my scalp started itching, burning, became very sensitive</li>
            <li> I needed a heat protectant oil after buying a high heat professional curling wand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hair very soft and shine.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, long, curly hair which is finally tamed, glossy, healthy, and looks glamorous thanks to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also put it on my skin after showering and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> and my hair is very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy the smaller bottle, just spend a little more to get twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this over-wrote a review I previously wrote about how much I love this.</li>
            <li> First I thought my hair was protein sensitive, then low porosity, then high porosity,bottom line</li>
            <li> I have very thin, wavy, frizzy hair that has finally been tamed by this incredible product.</li>
            <li> It even smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I have tried many argan oils in the past, but none have worked as well as this one did.</li>
            <li> However that is only on the first day.  </li>
            <li> This is still my first step after i have deep conditioned.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice, and my hair definitely came out better the second time.  </li>
            <li> I only shampoo my hair every other day, and my second-day hair is even better than on the days I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive this product only to find that it was open and spilled inside the box damaging everything inside the box with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft before!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft, shiny and wavy, not frizzy!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle now - the first one lasted about 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I got my first bottle earlier this year.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and is shiny after using!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I went ahead and ordered this, and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> I received one 2 ounce bottle of HSI Professional Leave-in Hair Treatment, with Argan Oil to review!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been willing to pay the price since there&#x27;s a big difference in quality and results.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling sooooo soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Uber soft, moisturized curls that (and this never happens), lasted all day!</li>
            <li> Thank you Science and HSI professional for helping a sister out!</li>
            <li> : It needs to have a different delivery system, either a dropper or a top that delivers a smaller amount of fluid.  </li>
            <li> My daughter in law has this exact same straightener.  </li>
            <li> I usually jump from product to product since most of them make claims they&#x27;ll do this or</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> So far my hair end doesn&#x27;t crack!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I am not very much satisfied with Hair Straightener, but I love this oil.</li>
            <li> my hair comes out soft and undamaged after applying heat!</li>
            <li> I put this product on before I straighten my hair and it makes it so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I totally forgot where I purchased the last bottle from and decided to just get it from my favorite place to shop (amazon obviously).</li>
            <li> It protects my hair while flat ironing and leaves a nice shine without leaving a heavy build up.</li>
            <li> I normally apply it after a shower as her hair gets dry (I suppose because of the length) and this product fixes the problem right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and has a nice subtle scent, and makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li> I put it on and blow dry and then add more and blow dry again.  </li>
            <li> Made my damaged/dry hair shiny and smooth without weighing it down or making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth all day and not oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny without being weighed down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> HSI smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and although I have to use more than the recommended &amp;#34; few drops&amp;#34; because of my ridiculously thick hair I&#x27;ve really come to enjoy and rely on this</li>
            <li> A gift to my wife for use as a backup straightener, but she prefers this new one to her old one now.</li>
            <li> super soft, less frizz, hair stayed straight.  </li>
            <li> I also look only at descriptive reviews, but I am now even a bit suspicious of overly long reviews from people who sound like ad men for the company selling the product.  </li>
            <li> This oil has been the long awaited secret to great hair.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops applied to towel-dried hair and it&#x27;s easy to brush with no tangles.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron seemed to help set in the smoothness, but I can&#x27;t say my hair looked any better than with other argan oil products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stored away all my other flat irons including my CHI because this iron works so much better.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I hot iron daily causing lots of damage.  </li>
            <li> I can even get away with using this alone without the flat iron and still look casual good!  </li>
            <li> Especially if your hair is very dry, and breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> like it better than other products because it is a more natural hair product without unnecessary chemicals</li>
            <li> This adds a little weight &amp; luster to unmanageable fine hair.</li>
            <li> This has earned a place among my favorite hair products, and that is no easy feat!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for my hair which is very thick and dry (from winter conditions and haircoloring).  </li>
            <li> A few weeks after using the product my hair began to look and feel less dry and more healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried several different serums for my hair, with daily straitening my hair was becoming damaged.  </li>
            <li> I started using it on my hair after drying, before the flat iron, and I now have a much higher opinion of it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> I first tried this conditioner when it came along with the flat iron as a sample.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be very curly, especially in the back; and while the oil doesn&#x27;t give me perfectly straight hair (nothing will do that!)</li>
            <li> I first tried this oil with the flat iron</li>
            <li> My first experience with  a flat iron hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> Try flat ironing thinner sections or layers of hair - use a clip to hold up top layers and release a layer at a time to flat iron if you have extra curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Wet hair has more results than dry hair.</li>
            <li> most recent order arrived with less than 1/3 of the product inside the plastic bottle, the contents were not even inside the box</li>
            <li> It not only calmed down hair fried to the roots, it looks shinier than it did when it was young and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair that is damaged easily.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, this product is just right for me.</li>
            <li> But the real proof comes in the \\&quot;second day hair\\&quot;, when to my surprise, my hair was just as pretty as the first day, not at all weighed down or oily.</li>
            <li> At first, I used this extremely sparingly--not getting too much of a result.  </li>
            <li> Not like pure argan oil, that smells quite gross.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample with my flat iron and I loved it instantly.</li>
            <li> I have super long, thick hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> When you get to the top layer and want to create a little more body - especially at crown - flat iron close to scalp with a slight twist under and out to ends of hair section.  </li>
            <li> When you get to the top layer and want to create a little more body - especially at crown - flat iron close to scalp with a slight twist under and out to ends of hair section.  </li>
            <li> Now, however, I use a little of this HSI Professional product after I wash my hair (not daily) and my hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Since using the leave in conditioner her hair has been much more manageable with less time invested using her flat iron.</li>
            <li> I still had to put my other leave-in conditioner in along with it to be able to comb through my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just recommend being a little more generous with how much you use if you have african american hair like me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used like a dime size (I have fine hair down my to the middle of my back) and my hair looked greasy.</li>
            <li> It really feels soft, shiny and helps keeping the hair style for several days.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but is a bit expensive for what you get,  So happy with purchase but will probably look elsewhere in the future</li>
            <li> - the ad clearly states that it&#x27;s a 4 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this, but I&#x27;m giving it all the stars because my daughter keeps having people feel her hair because this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> This item has far exceded my wife&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li> and I really wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff earlier.  </li>
            <li> The argan oil leaves it soft, manageable and is never oily.  </li>
            <li> Your hair feels softer, it feels natural, doesn&#x27;t get grimmy like with hair spray re-application.</li>

            <li> surprised</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thinning, frizz-prone hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair ends up soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> wow ...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to go all the way to your scalp, it will end up looking greasy, since the natural oils from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but she wanted a conditioner to keep her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Her hair is soft and silky and the frizziness is just gone.</li>
            <li> Her hair is normally naturally oily and with this product we cannot even see a hint of oiliness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>

            <li> you&#x27;re hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li> I use about a dime-sized amount on my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable, even after I heat-style.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves your hair feeling very silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It does make it soft and that is why I gave it a 4 star review.  </li>

            <li> I say was,because since using it to seal, my hair has done a complete 360.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> If you use only a dime size quantity it works very well.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair silky and soft</li>
            <li> Although it may be too early to assess W Ultra Beauty ArganGold</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> You are going to want to invest in a screw-on dropper bottle or pump cap if you want to use this product correctly and not waste</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I found the two products now and not sooner, could have saved so much money and time.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs into her hair, leaves it feeling soft without any residue.</li>
            <li> So far my HSI professional flatiron has only been used once so a few more uses</li>
            <li> She was also surprised at the cost...</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Also, it was naïve of me to take it at face value as far as &amp;</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t loud</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and not oily</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it leaves your hair soft and detangles</li>
            <li> But what a surprise got from HSI Professional leave-in treatment conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for about a week, but I can really see and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li> this did nearly nothing to minimize the frizz.  </li>
            <li> and I must say it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Then I run my hands in my hair (nowhere near the scalp as my scalp gets naturally greasy).</li>
            <li> After applying this argan oil, I can go for 4 days without any frizz or greasiness but just silky soft</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I can never get that salon look or the texture like after a Japanese Straight Perm</li>
            <li> I try to go all natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom, she loves it, said it makes her hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Protects my hair from heat like it says and also keeps it soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and shiny, even if you don&#x27;t iron over it.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair everyday, and have tried many different oils.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with lots of body that require lots of product, work, and time to get it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> The ONLY COMPLAINT I have is in regards to the bottle not having some kind of pump.</li>
            <li> But with this serum, I can add just the smallest amount before blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair and my hair turns out silky smooth and so soft to the touch, without that heavy greasy feeling or look.</li>
            <li> I have thick, healthy hair and this treatment allows it to stay that way....</li>
            <li> I like that the oil is thick and not runny like most oils.  </li>
            <li> although I have thick hair that requires more heat to straighten, I never let the temperature go beyond 375F</li>
            <li> Too expensive but good buy.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair, love this product.</li>
            <li> my shoulder length thick hair I use about a &#x27;skittle&#x27; sized amount of oil, sometimes a tad bit more.</li>
            <li> The product itself is awesome, but I hate the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get too little, too much, or just the right amount and never knew how my hair would turn out.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so this bottle will last forever- love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various commercial products (not ever been happy with, even the extremely expensive ones had some major flaw, such as being too oily or smelling weirdly artificial), and even olive oil (too thick and oily) and grapeseed oil (better than olive oil) -- but this product is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> but I have found another one of my products is a little better (silky elements heat protection spray for flat irons, curling irons, etc).</li>
            <li> However, the more I use it, the more I am getting sick of the smell.</li>
            <li> Notably, it has the nutty/ rice-water like smell characteristic of argan oil and comes in a dark colored bottle that is needed to preserve argan oil&#x27;s character.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually flat iron my hair because I have so much hair and not enough time, but I do using a curling iron and this is really helping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have the HSI flat iron as a back up, I don&#x27;t like it as much as my Wal-Mart Remington which has a much wider blade</li>
            <li> It helps tame the frizz, and makes my hair feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> It requires just a drop or two in the palm of your hand to smooth onto almost dry or dry hair for a professional looking shine.</li>
            <li> I tried first on damp hair and then on dry hair.</li>
            <li> After blow drying it leaves my hair really silky soft, then after I flat iron, it is even softer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky and tame.</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil is head &amp; shoulders above other available Moroccan Oil leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> I apply this to towel dry hair -- about a quarter size amount , then I use my hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found one other anti-frizz product that makes it this smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just half full when I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s arrived half way full and oil all over the box.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, will recommend for smooth finish for both straight or curly hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and most serums weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> After every wash right before I would blow dry I would put a little in my hands and spread throughout my entire head as well as making sure to get enough on my ends.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil after I wash my hair and ready use flat iron.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but this stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Works very well for styling or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using this, and i spilled a little to much on my hands and was worried my hair would come out greasy.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way I love the way my hair feels</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I started using the tiny bottle that came with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair, so even though it is light, I can only use a tiny amount</li>
            <li> One of the first few times I used too much oil</li>
            <li> only con: I don&#x27;t particularly like that you just pour a bit into your hand.</li>
            <li> I pour a tiny bit of the product into my palm, mix it a bit with both hands and then run my hands through my hair particularly where I want to ensure no fly-aways.</li>
            <li> (I use the same brand flat iron).work on my hair the same like rest products I have tried.nothing special.</li>
            <li> Not only makes my hair soft and shiny, but I love the fact that you only need a little to apply and one bottle lasts looooong time.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle that will last me a long time because with argan oil a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The ends were still a little dry, so I applied a touch more with my fingertips where things felt crispy.  </li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered a 5oz bottle of Redken oil (their &#x27;Smooth down Heat glide&#x27;), to later find out that the iron included a sample of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Ive been a regular user of Redken smooth down for years.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend - especially for this price!</li>
            <li> I would say I will be buying this product again, but since a little goes a long way, this bottle had so much that I might not be buying more for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my son decided to dump it down the drain but the company was so nice and after explaining to them what happened, they sent me another bottle, which he ended up like the first bottle thanks to my son...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and I just need to use a few drops on my thick, medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts in my hair for a long time with no need to reapply which is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> A small drop could make my frizzy hair shine and smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li> No more fly-aways at the bottom - just smooth, shiny, silky hair that flows.  </li>
            <li> After a long search for a product that really conditions and protects hair, I came upon this one.  </li>
            <li> I got a small free sample when I purchased my straighter, from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it with the flat iron since my hair usually comes out better.</li>
            <li> I first starting using this product when I got it as a sample with the flat iron</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely purchase a full bottle when my sample bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> she left her oil that she normally use at home.</li>
            <li> It smells phenomenal and leaves my thick, coarse hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is way too sweet, I feel like I wear a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all!</li>
            <li> I also have used pure argan oil, and it is leaves my hair with that greasy/oily look if I put it in when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I only use this oil after I blow dry my hair and right before I curl/</li>
            <li> I put about a quarter sized amount to my hair right after I wash it, then blow dry it and finally straighten it.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this, and a quick brush</li>
            <li> I would high recommend over pure Moroccan Oil (which would weight down my hair and was oily).</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine and thin hair</li>
            <li> I received the little sample when I ordered the HSI flat iron (which I love also) and had to order the big bottle.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is a good size and since you only have to use a small amount this should last for a really long time, you have to be careful not to use to much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so silky smooth and shiny... but a little bit greasy some hours later.</li>
            <li> When I use even a little too much, my hair looks very greasy and no amount of blow-drying changes it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I doubt that really matters because the product itself is FANTASTIC and it takes only a very small amount to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that really tames the frizz and it leaves my hair soft and not greasy after I&#x27;ve flat ironed it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s former boxed/shrink wrapped container next to the new plastic version - new plastic bottle</li>
            <li> so i just kept it instead of sending it back and getting a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/3b curls which tend to be extremely dry and absorb moisture insanely fast.</li>
            <li> I dont really see the difference until I blow dry or iron my hair..</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry ends immediately.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry, and this product really improves its appearance.</li>
            <li> I had done some damage to my hair when coloring the last time, and this really helped to get my hair back in shape.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the designed of the cap; I would prefer a smaller opening to control how much product I can use instead</li>
            <li> It also leaves it very shiny, it just takes a tiny amount so the bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> Before I left the salon, she told me to definitely keep using it because she was \\&quot;very impressed.\\</li>
            <li> You can use it on both towel dried hair or completely dried hair, both with nice results.</li>
            <li> This is a super heavy oil.  </li>
            <li> Left hair very soft, not oily</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is how soft my dry hair was, even before using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a major factor for me when I&#x27;m choosing a hair product.</li>
            <li> But after only using this oil 2 or 3 times, there&#x27;s been a complete change in my hair!  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make it appear oily.  </li>
            <li> I can also choose to go without flat ironing at all sometimes because after just blow drying my hair is still smooth and shiny- just a little wavy.</li>
            <li> hair is a few inches past my shoulders, i keep it straight because is more managable that way.</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t need much either; usually a dime-sized amount is all it takes and my daughter&#x27;s hair is past the middle of her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I turn the bottle over frequently as I&#x27;m getting ready in the mornings and reaching for other hair products or cosmetics.</li>
            <li> it is very smoothy after use this hair oil and dry the hair!</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry with a round brush and it comes out so incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil especially since I use the flat iron quite often.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount to work the magic, about the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> While I like other anti-frizz products maybe a tad better, they&#x27;re heavy (or greasy) and flatten the curl out.  </li>
            <li> I used a TINY amount of this product (like two very small drops -about 1/4 a teaspoon at the most), and rubbed it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick but fine hair</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too heavy and on a pretty humid day, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz up!</li>
            <li> It was a little oily at first but then was fine, her hair seemed no different after it had dried.</li>
            <li> I received a trial bottle with the purchase of a new flat iron.  </li>
            <li> BUT, after the provider of this product saw my review they immediately shipped me a new flat iron because somehow the one I bought was defective.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil when I received a trial size bottle with my new HSI Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> if you have fine hair as I do, you&#x27;ll notice that it needs to be washed a day earlier than I usually do.  </li>
            <li> I am of mixed decent ( African and Indian)</li>
            <li> When she ran out of the little sample bottle that came with the hair straightener, she was pretty loud about it.</li>
            <li> I naturally have long, fine, straight hair that&#x27;s on the thin side.</li>
            <li> I use more than a drop though because I have very thick hair with a natural wave and since I wear it back all the time my hair has been breaking.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Liss Ultime Shine Serum which would make my hair greasy and heavy but the Argan Oil is wonderful, just a few drops in my wet hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li> On one of those negative reviews,  I did confirm that \\&quot;Benzyl Salicylate\\&quot; is listed twice in the ingredients and although it may look intimidating, it&#x27;s used as a fragrance additive or UV light absorber.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it so much that I use it every night for my body and just a few drops for my hair after it is washed and dried.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about using an oil as heat protection but this oil worked out fabulous.</li>
            <li> If it takes me the same amount of time to straighten my hair with a product as it does without the product, and I have to wash my hair more with it, then it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> If it takes me the same amount of time to straighten my hair with a product as it does without the product, and I have to wash my hair more with it, then it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> Constantly, I find my hands in my hair without being conscious of it.</li>
            <li> and it actually makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommended HSI Professional Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Scent is barely there...</li>
            <li> This oil conditions my hair leaving it soft and silky, while protecting it from heat at the same time.</li>
            <li> HSI left my hair extremely soft and shiny without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair shiny and I can flatiron it straight with minimal flyaways.  </li>
            <li> I left this product in the bathroom and my 25 year old daughter seen it and also tried this product.  </li>
            <li> and I have done highlights, lo-lights, color, etc all at the same time and my hair feels so soft - softer than when I used to just color and use mouse, gel, etc.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft and silky without any added weight or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Ive used it a couple times now and barely even made a dent in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Bottle will then be very slippery, so be careful when handling it.</li>
            <li> It leaves it silky and shiny and I usually do not need to use my flat iron at all after using this product.  </li>
            <li> So far my traditional  hair treatment worked out bette.</li>
            <li> you only use a small amount and it really protects your hair from hot iron damage.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I can say is I wish I would have purchased more than two when the price was only $14.99.</li>
            <li> you combine this product with the HSI flat iron, WOW!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and has a wide range of temperatures.</li>
            <li> HSI Professional Argan Oil is a must have for daily hair treatment.</li>
            <li> After I finished flat ironing it, my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li> I have 3C curls and if not careful</li>
            <li> so I ended up purchasing one for her as an early birthday present</li>
            <li> They can only exclaim about how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li> It not only protected my hair from the heat, it made my hair extremely soft and added some flow to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It lasted for three days, which is how long I go between shampoos normally, so it wasn&#x27;t adding oil to my scalp.</li>
            <li> Alas my search for a better product continues...</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and many products simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks, so I don&#x27;t have a full opinion yet.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and a little dab of this when she is right out of the shower allows me to comb through her hair without it getting snagged or pulling out.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and facilitates easy styling, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes my coarse hair much more soft and manageable and using it everyday doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend trying it if your hair have dry split ends.</li>
            <li> I have natural coarse curly asian hair, and if I just blow dry without anything conditioner, I would be very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> will have to see how the Redken oil compares in combination with my new hair iron, but I will consider getting a larger bottle of Argan in the future</li>
            <li> I have 4 oz bottle, so its will last me for a very long time considering how much product need for one use.</li>
            <li> I have long hair &amp; it is basically pretty dry-</li>
            <li> The small bottle (4oz) goes a long way so the price is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I sometimes add a tiny bit when it is dry but not too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other Argan Oil brands before and after this and definitely like this better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works better when the hair is half wet than it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I normally just let my hair air dry, but I think you need the heat to help it absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a small bottle came with the flat iron for free.  </li>
            <li> #34;liquid gold&amp;#34; on my hair.. Just a small about in your hand, and  a quick finger-comb through, is like moisturizing bliss.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s light enough to leave my hair shiny and moisturized with BODY.</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil is quite thick in formula, much thicker than pure argan oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> I always put it in my hair before I blow dry it straight and as a result, at the end of blowdrying it is soft, silky and not at all dry!</li>
            <li> I am nowhere near almost out of this product because a little really does go a longggggg way.</li>
            <li> It works so well that I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron to get my hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]]</li>
            <li> if you add HSI PROFESSIONAL #1 THERMAL PROTECTOR 450 WITH ARGAN OIL FOR FLAT IRON, INFUSED WITH</li>

            <li> I also noticed that breakage was nearly gone when flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Argan Oil treatment after I received the HSI Professional Flat Iron as a Christmas Gift.</li>
            <li> I did purchase ther ceramic flat iron and discarded my old one.  </li>
            <li> HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]]</li>
            <li> how it makes my hair feel soft and not fried after using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> After using flat iron, my hair was shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle I bought leaked, making a mess and practically emptying the contents.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this item has little more financial punch than others but the quality surpasses any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> My hair was super dry and frizzy due to constant dyeing and even bleaching my hair.</li>
            <li> Need be very careful how much you put on your hair otherwise</li>
            <li> And I am pleased to say that it has had a dramatic effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and she says she can use it as much as she wants and since it is a dry oil, it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny amount through the hair not only eliminates frizziness, but makes hair incredibly soft</li>
            <li> At this point, I can definitely say that my hair feels silky soft, which was not the case prior to using this.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am an African American woman with natural brown hair.</li>
            <li> You must open the top and poor it into your hand to use.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is magical on my thick coarse dry highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> truly, professional products are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have never had such control over my thick, coarse, wavy hair and styling has never been so easy.</li>
            <li> i tried a few drops, I tried more than a few drops, and saw no affect whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the oil and definitely the flat iron along with it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick unruly hour (wavy and several cowlicks) and after applying the oil and using the iron, my hair is smooth, straight, shiny and flowing.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft, adds life to my hair again when it gets dry.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have very curly hair that I flat iron almost everyday and because of that I&#x27;ve struggled with dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It does have a scent, which I love, very similar to other musky hair emollients I&#x27;ve used in the past, but might not be for everyone.  </li>
            <li> It mends dry split ends and makes hair extremely soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price and the same exact size.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it right before I use the HSI flat iron to straighten my hair so that my hair will be shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old woman with very long white hair that is naturally curly and frizzy if left to itself.</li>
            <li> for use with Flat Iron:  follow recommendation for applying product after shampoo/conditioner/towel dry; focus on ends; flat iron when hair is almost dry - still slightly damp - for super straight and sleek styles.  </li>
            <li> As someone whose hair was very damaged due to multiple dyes, she is always looking for a boost to help it out.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to the present: I was searching for a leave-in product to protect from heat styling, and I was drawn to this one due to the rave reviews and the fact that it contains argan oil.</li>
            <li> Using a minimal amount protects your hair from the flat iron and makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li> Very small portion of the oil is enough for one application and the hair are smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It makes my long hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my long, think hair feeling amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> As a definite extra plus, HSI doesn&#x27;t leave any obvious lingering signs of its use-- no heavy scent, no oily-looking residue.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re only supposed to use a few drops and smooth it through your wet hair, but there is no dropper or pump; it&#x27;s just a screw-top bottle, which means you need to POUR the oil into your palm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pricey (way beyond my usual hair product price point) but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or oily at all, and a few drops really does do the trick!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the hefty price.</li>
            <li> The straightener works well, but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has never been able to flat iron her hair without there being a sort of fried smell behind it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and frizzy, it relieves some if the volume and let&#x27;s me straighten it much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Only con is that you have to be very careful not to use too mucch or your hair will be look very greasy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but makes it so much easier to brush girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This helped it so much and did not appear greasy or weigh it down</li>
            <li> I wait until it&#x27;s still a little damp, but not wet, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of oil, so the bottle lasts for a good amount of time, even though I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and using this product has made blow drying as well as hot ironing my hair much easier.</li>
            <li> and it looked less frizzy than when i blow dry with no product, and a little more shiny.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because it is hard to dispenSE small amount with the kind of bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> After i blow dry my hair it is so soft and doesn&#x27;t frizz..</li>
            <li> This is my all-in-one go-to product whether I style my hair or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> The one downside, and the reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating, is it can leave your hair feeling oily if you use even slightly too much.  </li>
            <li> Where my hair was dry and brittle, not it is soft.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and realized this product was to use before drying or the use of an iron, whereas all I do in the morning is shampoo/condition my hair and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Today, my hair has completely recovered and I no longer have problems with dry, heat damaged hair.</li>
            <li> And for anyone who has dry or damaged hair and want it feeling soft again.  </li>
            <li> I can put it in my hair and either leave my hair natural, or blow dry it out.</li>
            <li> And then let my hair air dry completely.</li>
            <li> Once it is dry, my hair feels so soft and no frizzes even if my straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I leave this conditioner in my hair and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Works well for straightening, blow drying and for just letting colored hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Now that I started using HSI Professional Argan Oil, i noticed that i don&#x27;t have hair split ends and dry ends anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is the first to actually tame my frizz.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way and it detangled my 3c/4a (otherwise uncooperative strands) natural hair making it soooooo much easier to comb...</li>
            <li> when numerous reviews are written on the same day or successive days consistently giving 5 star reviews containing little or no descriptive words  (for instance: &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; be suspicious folks.  </li>
            <li> My last bleaching left my hair broken and changed the texture from straight and fine to extremely course and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I used it years ago but moved on to other brands (way more expensive ones like alterna, macadamia professional, etc, ) because I was never a fan of the old packaging.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight, frizzy, thick hair that I wear straight during the winter and curly during the summer.  </li>
            <li> (my evidence for this is that my hair is now much longer than I have ever been able to have it before; usually it just gets so frayed and broken at the ends that I would have had to cut it months ago).</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is a little bit too strong smell, but it goes away in a little bit, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and haven&#x27;t run this this as quickly as I thought I would -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed a much smoother and less frizzir hair texture with the recommended combination.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair with lots of body that usually needs lots of product, work, and time to get it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that tends to frizz due to living in a VERY humid climate.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on Bradley Stafford&#x27;s review of November 10, 2012 as well as other reviews that gave  long, very explanatory reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair and when I used this product it helps keep my hair bouncy..</li>
            <li> I have pretty damaged hair due to years of neglect and tying it up wet...</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> good grief it makes my hair feel so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> This made my daughter&#x27;s curly hair more puffy and very dry looking, she was not pleased at all!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, that can sometimes be very dry.</li>
            <li> has had little effect leaving my hair either too greasy or hardly straight.</li>
            <li> *Updated Review Due to New Packaging</li>
            <li> however it tends to get frizzy and sometimes quite damaged and coarse due to humidity where we live.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a flat iron, and do let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> When I used my flat iron there was no smoking or odd odor - and my hair straightened very well.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten every day and HSI Argan Oil has protected my hair from the major damage and breaks that I used to experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite ringlet curly, but is definitely more than just wavy; basically it&#x27;s just a poofy blond mess and looks ridiculous if I don&#x27;t straighten it.</li>
            <li> and it usually takes too long at home and never comes out right.</li>
            <li> I was very annoyed by this situation, but completely forgot about it when I shared this with BeautyChange and got set another bottle, free of charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have soft, manageable hair, but due to depression and a recent breakup which in turn affected my nutrition, I have lackluster locks.</li>
            <li> It really works to tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li> i really wanted to believe after all the glowing reviews but this did tame some frizzies of my daughter&#x27;s hair but by the end of school</li>
            <li> I have CRAZY thick dark brown wavy hair and it makes my hair smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy or overly greasy like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy oil like other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny with no sticky residue like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Due to the color of my hair i and natural state</li>
            <li> Split ends has always been my problem due to frequent blowdrying, and styling.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron almost daily and the argan oil helps prevent damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> It also seems to help protect from daily flat iron use.</li>
            <li> I received a simple of this with the purchase of the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this Argan oil with the HSI flat iron I&#x27;ve recently bought.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the HSI flat iron, and in the box I got a sample of this product.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to prevent split ends from hairdrying and flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly hair and this product smooths and defrizzes my hair, while protecting from the flat iron as well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and is definitely recommended with flat iron use.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I always forget to apply it on my hair before using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Got the tiny sample when I ordered the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife with her Ceramic Flat Iron from the same seller.  </li>
            <li> I use flat irons and chemicals on my hair that have left it damaged.</li>
            <li> Left residuos on my flat iron.</li>
            <li> well this is the same look and feel you will get from this product (along with the HSI flat irons).  </li>
            <li> I constantly use a flat iron and it damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> Can be used before styling (flat iron hair straightner, dryer) for extra thermal protection</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a flat iron often because of the potential damage it can do to my hair.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this HSI ARGAN oil with my HSI Flat Iron last February 2013.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount (2-3 drops for long hair) to wet hair after daily wash, blow dry, then use my HSI flat iron to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> If i put it in my damp hair and let it dry without the flat iron, it makes my frizzy hair dry with soft curls and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, something that works on my frizzy yet flat and oily hair!  </li>
            <li> Also, products claiming to last a week with straight  hair with washes are pointless for me since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way, don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> We purchased a couple of other brands of thermal protection sprays from other manufacturers and we were sadly very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, dry, colored, with split ends, yet you wouldn&#x27;t know it after using HSI Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bottle will last you a long time, so I just now bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Had I bought this sooner, I would not have wasted so much time on my hair; it&#x27;s about 30 inches long</li>
            <li> SO highly recommended for those like me with dead crunshy hair and no hope at all..</li>
            <li> I have significantly less split ends, and my hair feels so soft!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft while wet and dry.</li>
            <li> It maintains the proper balance of conditioning for hair exposed to heat &amp; daily environmental factors that cause dry lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> What caught my eye with Bradley&#x27;s review was his comment that he&#x27;d used silicone based leave-in conditioners prior to this product which left his hair dry (which silicone can do).  </li>
            <li> I had been using Moroccan Oil, which I liked, but decided to give this a try since it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I split my hair half up half down and do 6 pumps per section and the results are silky smooth hair</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very low porosity hair (low porosity &#x3D; hair that has a hard time absorbing and holding onto moisture, eg.</li>
            <li> I assumed that I was going to get a very small bottle, in a very large box.  </li>
            <li> an amazing job!I have purchased very expensive oils and none have worked until this one.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the way the Argan Oil make my hair feel silky and stay smoother than usual.  </li>
            <li> I usually try to get it from root to tip but really rub into the ends ,comb through and wait 5 min.</li>
            <li> i am not sure how much i paid</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it with a flat iron, just for blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> it prepped for my HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Received a trial size bottle of this product along with my purchase of the HSI Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> but this with the ceramic flat iron makes my hair straighter than any perm</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to people who flat iron their hair.</li>
            <li> I used it with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my curly bangs before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I sometimes don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a must when you use HSI&#x27;s flat iron.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair with the HSI flat iron, but before I do that, I use the HSI Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> and once I flat iron it with my HSI flatiron</li>
            <li> A leave-in conditioner that is flat iron thermal protected, too.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s intended for flat iron use, but I&#x27;m using it as a protecting conditioner.  </li>
            <li> so this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Since I was buying the HSI flat iron, this product came up as a complementary item, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Even after blow drying and using a flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps protect my hair from heat of flat iron.i would recommend this thermal protector oil to anyone looking for hair protector</li>
            <li> Keeps hair shiny and protects against the heat of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil to combat the dryness and as a protectant because I flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you have a flat iron hair straightener, get this oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever burn myself on my flat iron again.</li>
            <li> I received this oil when I bought my flat iron ad</li>
            <li> as I flat iron</li>
            <li> I could hear it break before and had to shake my flat iron over the garbage can to release the hair.  </li>
            <li> Always use it before flat iron to protect the hair.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this argan oil with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Long, almost to my back end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with my HSI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I tried styling flat and leaving wavy.</li>
            <li> Got this as a sample with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Will definitely make this part of my long term hair care regime.</li>
            <li> the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!I was use it all the time when i straighten my hair with my flat iron</li>
            <li> If I just use the ends, and don&#x27;t even flat iron...</li>
            <li> I use a Flat Iron to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> 4oz bottle lasts a long time because you only need a quarter size amount and my hair is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> A thermal protector and a ceramic flat iron was recommended by my hair dresser to minimize the damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I used it with a flat iron that it seems to be hydrating my hair.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair protected from the heat of my flat iron and also keeps my hair from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend HSI Argan oil to anyone that uses a flat iron or just needs to keep their hair from frizzing if it&#x27;s curly.</li>
            <li> A very tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel that this has long lasting results.</li>
            <li> I was ordering HSI&#x27;s flat iron at the time and people were raving about the iron as well as the oil.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter to use with her flat iron.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair with my flat iron and my hair</li>
            <li> I received a complementary bottle of this Argan Oil with the purchase of my flat iron.  </li>

            <li> This bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all, but it may not have the same effect on someone who doesn&#x27;t have dry hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I also will put a smaller amount on my dry hair if I am styling it with heat.  </li>

            <li> After recently bleaching my hair I needed something that was going to keep it from getting dry and frizzy all the time.</li>
            <li> I use only this after I shampoo and condition and towel dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After every time I wash my hair... once my hair is 90% dry I go through all of my hair and put this oil on my ends only.</li>
            <li> I notice this only when I blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> I notice this only when I blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> It is not the argan oil natural , probably a cheap artificial ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair, but like one of the other reviewers mentioned, if you mess with it too much while it&#x27;s drying it won&#x27;t be curly anymore.  </li>

            <li> This oil has brought my dry, aging hair (I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s, therefore my hair is too!)</li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way, as too much causes greasy, slick looking hair.</li>
            <li> I apply only 2-3 drops on wet hair, especially at the ends and the frizzy part of my hair.</li>
            <li> It also lasts long because only a couple of drops go a long way.  </li>
            <li> 2 of the bottles I ordered were broken but the company quickly replaced the products without any hassle.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that&#x27;s just starting to get a little coarse with grays coming in and kiddo is 4 with long, crazy curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops rubbed around in my palms, then rubbed through my hair before straightening leaves by hair very soft and feeling moisturized and protected.</li>
            <li> Does the trick for the first few mins but once dried (30 mins later)</li>
            <li> I usually have very frizzy hair after i blow dry</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about it was its heavenly,albeit subtle, scent.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few other argan oils before but they were much pricier.</li>
            <li> It performs just as well as the other more expensive oils I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a very small amount though because it can definitely leave hair greasy if you use too much.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil on a regular basis and two months later, I still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal Total Repair Extreme, the shampoo, &amp; the Total Repair Extreme Damage Erasing Balm, alternating the balm with the conditioner of the same name.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair feel silky and soft, with a little shine.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit in my hair when I&#x27;m about halfway through drying, and my hair always ends up feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> A little drop helps to transform my hair into soft, straighter styles and also allows me to get bouncey curls with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> This little guy fixed all those problems.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and then distribute a bit of the the oil on my hair before using the flat iron.</li>

            <li> and I tip the bottle and put this on 4 fingertips then run my fingers through dry hair, and I&#x27;m all set to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair before using a flat iron to prevent hair damage.</li>
            <li> i blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> Blow dry, then you can use your flat iron.</li>
            <li> and then again after it&#x27;s dry when flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> sometimes notice I get way too much product out, hard to control the amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> You can use it in wet or dry hair and helps keep the softness especially when hair is processed and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that really I should call that a complaint...</li>
            <li> My flat iron only goes up to 410 degrees and with other thermal protector&#x27;s or frizz reducers</li>
            <li> You have to be extra careful when applying it to your hands or else</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle means it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It can get frizzy and because I like to keep it long</li>
            <li> I have a long bob, and it&#x27;s angled</li>
            <li> Lets start off with my ever growing grey hair is just frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and and fluffy (not greasy and oily).</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t apply it to my roots it never looks greasy.</li>
            <li> bottle is smaller than I thought or expected, since I have no idea about 4 Oz.</li>
            <li> From long experience, I&#x27;m telling you; order this and use it.</li>
            <li> I used this almost everyday and it makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this product a long time.</li>
            <li> use this on my 10 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and it stays shimmering all day long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and having this oil</li>
            <li> I expected them to be the same.</li>
            <li> I have color treated (cover the grey),</li>
            <li> hair was shiny and soft after I used it, but didn&#x27;t feel heavy or look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a tiny bit in my palms and run it over my wet hair after my shower and before combing.</li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to frizz out and be fairly rough to the touch, even with different leave-ins.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Something no natural oils/ butters did for me.</li>
            <li> This will be  my long term leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is a big fluff ball.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using takes so long to ship.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that I couldn&#x27;t use it when my hair was completely wet or it would almost leave it oily looking.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever made my thick Asian hair soft and silky all day.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, frizzy, thick hair that I wear straight during the winter and curly during the summer.  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time, but when it is empty, I will not hesitate to buy another.</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample when i bought the HSI straightner because i have thick hair that hangs past my butt</li>
            <li> The liquid is thick (imagine honey) and it does not take much to serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight.</li>
            <li> I have thick and very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> They cut down on my styling time by at least 50% - that is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> that seems to work, and then I actually use a Remington flat iron, just on about 310 degrees and use it as little as possible.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say anything about added shine, but as a leave-in treatment, it definitely did make my hair softer and easier to brush (I usually have slightly wavy, very tangly hair).</li>
            <li> Anyway, my ends, which are usually split and broken (you can see it..) are super soft and look like new!so</li>
            <li> I used it on my dry hair, just a little bit and didnt seem to notice much of a difference, if anything it made my hair slightly frizzy</li>
            <li> HSI Argan oil in my opinion is better than Moroccan oil, and also much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I do this because I have to air dry my curly hair for the curls to turn out okay, and it&#x27;s to cold to do that during the winter.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny, and protects it from heat damage (I blow dry a few times a week).</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the price - plenty of Competing argan oil similar products for much less than the price of HSI argan oil.</li>
            <li> This HSI oil can be used on wet or dry hair and not leave it oily or greasy looking (if you only use a drop or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron; sometimes blow dry and other times just apply and air dry with same results regardless.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, fine hair and a little less than a dime-size amount of this product</li>
            <li> prefer unscented products generally and there is a slight scent added to this, but I do not find it to be offensive.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy long dry hair</li>
            <li> She has had a long history of dealing with extremely curly/dry hair and could never find products that either didn&#x27;t help or left a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color treated, long (past the bra strap) and thick and a very small dime-sized amount distributes easily and evenly through my hair and the end result is not oily-looking or feeling, just soft and protected!</li>
            <li> but so very few of them actually live up to their claims.</li>
            <li> This has cyclomethicone which works similar to the other products</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, it should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> have started to go grey (prematurely, i might add!)</li>
            <li> Like any other oil that u find in regular drugstores.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> After trying several other brands of hair oil</li>
            <li> However, the item comes in a very small bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> The minute I left the salon my hair (extensions) literally inflated, got curly and extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thought about trying other products, but I keep going back to this one because of the results!</li>
            <li> My stylists, all tell me you don&#x27;t need to condition anything other than your ends, same with the argan oil.</li>
            <li> , I rub my hands each time and run  my fingers through my hair, the inside with one hand palm and the other hand palm the outside.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 bottles of this stuff and it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> It is long lasting as you only need a few drops for your head.</li>
            <li> A surprisingly small amount of this stuff, and my hair is silky soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Initially I hesitated, thinking a &amp;#34;coney&amp;#34; serum will damage my hair,thanks to all the cone bashing by other hair gurus.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of damage due to over processing and wanted something to help repair and protect my hair from future damage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s finally starting to grow again due to</li>
            <li> I have tried other oils before, and they always left a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other brand of argan oil, but this one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> First off, I have short (3-4\\&quot;), thick, curly brown hair that is wavy in spots, and decided a few days ago to try to style it with a hair straightening iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is all of the above, so it can be really difficult to find something that can leave my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Put it on while hair is still wet, then blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> - other products left her hair dry and sticky-awful.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and use a dime-sized amount on my damp hair.  </li>
            <li> We apply on damp hair, twist our curls and dry it with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> but my hair does tend to get dry when styling and it does help with that.</li>
            <li> it dry my hair</li>
            <li> After that I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my damp hair, and on my kid&#x27;s dry hair instead of detangler.</li>
            <li> but you can put a lot in your hair and blow dry it.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite dry</li>
            <li> When I rubbed it onto my freshly-washed, dry hair, I was half-scared I might end up with greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it when blow dry my hair, and I didn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> As soon as my hair is fully dry, it has a shine and softness to it.  </li>
            <li> in the winters when it is so dry inside &amp;</li>
            <li> and it was sooo dry and brittle until I started using this.</li>
            <li> My hair was over processed and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer dry</li>
            <li> Then when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I use it after I dry my hair - section</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using about a nickel sized portion of this product in the palm of my hand and add it to the bottom 4 inches of my hair (I prefer to apply it to my hair dry</li>
            <li> I always apply it before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair, so after I am done blow drying my hair looks, feels, and smells ammazing.  </li>
            <li> I put it in my damp hair, and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I would buy again and recommend it if your hair gets puffy after dry.  </li>
            <li> when your hands feel dry..</li>
            <li> but I also just use it on my dry hair almost every day.</li>
            <li> I then blew it dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a bit frizzy and dry by the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> I use it on semi-damp hair before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I take a shower, blow dry and straighten</li>
            <li> After using the products together for a couple of months I suggest using the oil on damp hair to dry it</li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a heat protectant before I straighten, blow dry or curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I *did* try to keep my hair dry in the shower.)</li>
            <li> I have frizzy dry hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry (like &amp;#34;could</li>
            <li> ; dry), and frizzy hair -</li>
            <li> and I let it dry.</li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t always have to use it when you blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> if u have ever been to a salon where they place you under a steamer with the conditioner, blow dry, then curl your hair</li>
            <li> my hair with the HSI curling/flat iron or on days my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was bleached, so it was really dry, and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I had totally dry hair</li>
            <li> I always use this after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower and before I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems so dry when I use it.</li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair, and there&#x27;s almost no frizziness when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> (I use a thermal spray after it&#x27;s dry, before I flat-iron or use a Perfector.)</li>
            <li> I use it every day after I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> HAIR IS NORMALLY DRY AND HAS NO LIFE</li>
            <li> If I have to wash my hair, but I do not have time,  I put about a dime size amount in my palms and rub it threw my dry hair</li>
            <li> - I apply it after every shampoo and sometimes on dry hair before using curling iron</li>
            <li> I apply the oil to dry hair, wrap my hair in a towel, then go to bed for the night.  </li>
            <li> Hair is not as dry as before.</li>
            <li> I use it to seal my hair after washing and conditioning, and I use it whenever my hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> After a wash I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I put in about a quarter of product into my hair while damp and work it through the ends then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because I already use quality products (Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner, Kenra blow dry spray, Sebastion Shaper plus hairspray) on my hair</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t dry and brittle</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me an oily feel that i was worried about (i hate when my hair is too oily), instead it just looks extremely healthy and has a natural shine, not a greasy shine.</li>
            <li> wavy, more- thin- than- thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It was immediately something I knew I could not live without.</li>
            <li> and when it is damp (not wet), I pour a little of it on my palm and rub my palms together to spread the oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those with thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this is the price, but I do not need any other product for my hair when I have this one, so in that sense I&#x27;m definitely saving money.</li>
            <li> I only had to do a little flat ironing from then on.  </li>
            <li> It helped that every single review was 5 stars.</li>
            <li> every single day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Purchased another bottle of pure Argan oil before this, which didn&#x27;t work for her Asian hair (it was too thick and made her hair feel &#x27;heavy&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> I do have to be careful to only use a tiny amount at a time as a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> I put a little of this stuff in after I straighten it, and it immediately smooths it down and makes my hair look and feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Just a small quantity plus some straightening makes my hair incredibly soft and styled.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to rate it, because it does leaves the hair soft and takes care of the frizz.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how just a small amount made my hair silky and shiny</li>
            <li> Other women with frizzy hair said that the oil and flat iron combined kept their hair from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me to only buy Argan Oil in a dark colored glass bottle...</li>
            <li> This is not normal.  </li>
            <li> With this product, professional results were achieved without spending a small fortune at the salon.</li>
            <li> Have been blow drying only instead of flat ironing everyday.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I used up the sample and ordered a full bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of “miracle “and I have to say I was very skeptical about that product with the assumption that will one more bottle in my drawer.  </li>
            <li> This screw on cap is NOT airtight, and could come loose during transport.  </li>
            <li> , I actually need to use the flat iron less!</li>
            <li> give extra shine to hair without weighing it down-</li>
            <li> Spray mid length down</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it is quite pricy.</li>
            <li> I think that may be toned down SOME at this point, but I&#x27;m still hoping that continued use of the product will make a bigger difference over time.    </li>
            <li> You can actually put a lot in without it weighing down your hair or making it greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> Also cuts down on drying and styling time in a big way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, colored, naturally curly hair which I torture daily with straightening spray, blow-dry and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing as soon as it gets low, but that won&#x27;t be happening anytime soon since a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> I have long hair - upto my lower back, yet i need to use just a little of the oil to coat it all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this product should last for a while.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, the 4oz bottle will easily last for 6 months on her below the shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, it keeps my hair dry and moist without the oily film like other products by the end of the long work day.  </li>
            <li> - you only need very little to do the job, so it will last you.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I look at the most negative reviews first to see if even in the worst case scenario, I can still live with my purchase decision.</li>
            <li> A miracle for people with dry hair!</li>
            <li> I use the argan oil on wet hair, damp hair, or even dry hair.  </li>
            <li> in wet hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I put it in my wet hair and then dry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> I could apply to wet of dry hair.</li>
            <li> U don&#x27;t have to use alot works on both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> The 4Oz bottle will last me one to two months and it is an investment well made, after all the previous products I bought and had to throw away because they did not react well with my hair.</li>
            <li> The overall softness lasted about a week before it was back to the usually craziness.</li>
            <li> Also, I use such a small amount each day, that this bottle will last a year.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly with just a drop on your hands, rub and together and put on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It works with wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This product can be used on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> -I use it on my wet hair before blow drying and on my dry hair too-</li>
            <li> I use an amount about the size of a half dollar in my hair once per week when I roller set my hair, and I have definitely seen and felt a difference.</li>
            <li> I tried it when my hair was wet, when my hair was damp, and when my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> I put a small amount in before I blow dry my hair and an even smaller amount before I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> so it tends to be very dry, but this product is God send.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s somewhat curly and very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> my hair can be very dry.</li>
            <li> hair was very dry , damaged and was breaking off .</li>
            <li> It is very dry now.</li>
            <li> It was very dry from coloring it and the winter weather before receiving the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> My hair was also feeling very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter that has very dry curley hair.</li>
            <li> And after straightening, it feels naturally straight instead of the burnt frizzy fake straight feeling I usually got.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and leaves my hair silky after using my Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> usually blow dry my hair after I get out of the shower, which as we all know does some definite damage to your hair and mines already extremely crappy and brittle from multiple bleachings.</li>
            <li> I use it as we&#x27;ll, my hair is much less thick and much finer.</li>
            <li> I used a pea sized amount, and then my hair took FOREVER to air dry... &amp; felt gross and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I received the product and it was half empty, the cap was open there was oil all over the box.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair only twice a week and having the oil remain until then prevented it from getting dry and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and have seen less breakage in my hair and my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li> I chose the later, as my shoes are too tight.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bottle cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight and it spilled all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> Bought a 4oz , u don&#x27;t have to use a lot just a lil and turn down your flat iron when using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also bought cheaper ones that seem to have too much silicone or some other additives that are not good for hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil for a few years and love it but decided to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the glove, the small container of oil and the red silk cover for the flat iron...</li>
            <li> My hair had poor quality since I curled and dyed it, but this product certainly saved it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also applied a little at bedtime to the ends which helped to  condition and  prevent further damage.</li>
            <li> On the days I do not wash my hair and wear it curly, I scrunch with only a little water and bed head is gone and even prettier curls than the day before appear.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would add a lot of shine, but it only adds a little shine.  </li>
            <li> only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to give your hair that silky shine.</li>
            <li> likes that it only takes a little to work</li>
            <li> My wife has to often use a flat iron on her hair to get the slight wave out of her hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> However due to the rough weather in Boston, my hair strands always dry up and break.  </li>
            <li> As the title notes, when used with a combination of other similar products, the results appeared in days (less than a week).</li>
            <li> As a guy with short color-treated hair, my hair is often dull and frizzy as it grows longer and is treated multiple times.</li>
            <li> Finally a leave in that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> I will definitely look to HSI if I need other haircare appliances!!</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst hair ever... and this stuff has literally made me so happy.</li>
            <li> When I straighten my crazy curly hair, this oil helps smooth the ends and also keeps the flyaways to a minimum.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount so this bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m guessing this won&#x27;t last as long as you risk overusing because of having to pour and it running past your fingers.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t make a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself is made of glass, so have to be really careful not to break.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair noticeably shinier and easier to comb out when wet.  </li>
            <li> I apply it while my hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> I sleep on a satin pillow case and shake and go or comb with a wide tooth</li>
            <li> And you only need to use a few drops to see results.  </li>
            <li> I then apply a second round and that&#x27;s when it feels like I have something in my hair.  </li>
            <li> one only needs to use a few drops</li>
            <li> and it only takes a few drops for all of that.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like at all; not much argan oil in this product.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how rough my hair felt until I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I put it away and forgot about it until i came back across it a few weeks ago and started to use it.  </li>
            <li> careful not to cover all of your hair or you might end up needing to wash it sooner than you&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> I shampoo, condition, while hair is wet</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, deep conditioned, and air dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I put it in when the hair is wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on hair products.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is not cheap BUT it will last you forever!</li>
            <li> Only con is that the bottle is made of heavy glass</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops of the oil to work and it helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only requires a few drops.</li>
            <li> another drop Rt side, with my wet hair</li>
            <li> I work about 4-5 drops in my wet hair.</li>
            <li> If you use a flatiron everyday, I would definitely recommend using this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to make my hair syaight without getting messy and this is the only thing that has worked!</li>
            <li> For one, it&#x27;s glass, so you have to be careful with where you set it on the counter.</li>
            <li> It came on time and carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different oils for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops.</li>
            <li> after washing the Wen off I put some of this on while still wet.</li>
            <li> and I use this when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is missing is this jar does not have a dropper or pump to dispense it.</li>
            <li> and I put in wet hair to condition ends.</li>
            <li> I just put some on my palm and rub in my wet</li>
            <li> I have only used for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to apply a lot; I applied just under a teaspoon amount and rubbed it between my hands before brushing it through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian woman with color-treated hair that is fairly thick and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> I was careful to only used a few drops as the instructions say so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an ingredient list, which could only mean 2 things, its only ingredient is argan oil</li>
            <li> I also add a little while I&#x27;m flat ironing to add shine and heat protection.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the HSI flat iron, and it came with a little sample of this leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pure argan oil but a combination of things inluding silicones.</li>
            <li> This is not pure argan oil.  </li>
            <li> Since I have used this product the last few weeks I have thrown out all my other hair serums.  </li>
            <li> After Years of searching for something to tame my hair, I finally found it!  </li>
            <li> Literally blow drying and straightening my hair takes me about 30 minutes or less depending on how long after my shower I start doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Literally blow drying and straightening my hair takes me about 30 minutes or less depending on how long after my shower I start doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given the tiny amount of product I need to get the job done, this is no easy feat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely notice less split ends and breakages than in the past, even though I use a flat iron every day.  </li>
            <li> It looked sleek (like as though I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time perfecting my blow-out, when in truth, I&#x27;ve only spent very little time.)</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the amount, because a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> You can use a thermal spray with this conditioner if you like without trouble, just use it sparingly as you flat iron and focus on ends.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, I received a sample bottle with my HSI flat iron and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small so don&#x27;t be surprised when you receive it.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this a few weeks ago; about a year after buying my HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> even dirty, right after I&#x27;d just washed and flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for few months now, my damaged hair, thick asian black hair is now silky and really soft.</li>
            <li> hate(d) flat ironing my hair because I thought my hair was too dry, limp, and weak to get soft, bouncy, moisturized results.</li>
            <li> My hair has to be washed daily due to the product I use to tame it (oil, leave in conditioner, conditioner, hairspray).</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair, rub a small (dime size) amount through it and then use the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I even put a little extra in on the ends after drying and it smooths the ends down.</li>
            <li> We tried several products, they are either not very effective or with a chemical odor.</li>
            <li> It was less expensive than similar products, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read ridiculous words like this in a review before too, and took it with a grain of salt, so I&#x27;m surprised to be writing this stuff...</li>
            <li> Typically without this product my long hair looks very dry and odd.</li>
            <li> I am using prior to wash and after towel dried,  and sometimes if I&#x27;m going to use irons when my hair is dried I put little bit for extra protection against the heat.....</li>
            <li> but if you have greasy hair like me you might want to put just a tiny bit as I found it to be a little less lightweight thant</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way like the reviews state.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is an oil, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> maybe 2-3 times a week..a little will do you and bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> There is no greasy residue, but do not saturate your hair with the product, just a little, goes a long way..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> There is a lot of product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so it goes to show that little does go a long way for this product</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>

            <li> just a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Even when I skip the flat iron, I still use this to tame frizz without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and curly.  </li>
            <li> For me the product is too heavy to use on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, but I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> And finally, although the price may look a little steep, a very little bit of the product goes a long way; that little bottle will be working for you for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and somewhat curly hair and every time my hair dries after a shower, it feels coarse and dry even though I use coconut and jojoba and skip shampooing every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have used other products like John F</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for too long, but I find my hair healthier and smoother even though I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky on your hair or on your hands, unlike some other oil products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other bottles of argan oil, but none have done as well as this one.</li>
            <li> My hair was returned to its usual condition after using this oil daily for two weeks!  </li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t sticky like some other leave-in conditioners that I have tried before.</li>
            <li> my face without worry of sensitivity due to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell oily like other argon oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Last time I had to order 2 small bottles.  </li>
            <li> I guess some other reviewers must have a hound-like sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy like other oils do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products to reduce the frizz in my hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work like any other oil I have used on my hair.</li>
            <li> You only use a small amount on hair ends, so a 4 oz bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> i got a small bottle inside with the HSI iron i bought and had to get a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged after I took out my senegalese twists, so I started looking for products that would revitalize it and help stem the damage.</li>
            <li> comb it through my hair every other day after using the HSI straightener</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other argan oil products and they tend to make my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of other argan oils, protectants, sprays, serums, you name it.</li>
            <li> Then I went shopping for the usual brand since my last bottle was almost gone.</li>
            <li> So, by the time I&#x27;m due for a trim every 6-8 weeks, I end up losing whatever miniscule amount of length I accumulate due to damage from flat-irons, blow drying, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Argan oils for the hair and the leave the hair too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have repurchased it only 2 times in the past two years.  </li>
            <li> My mom loves it and use it every other day</li>
            <li> It gives my hair extreme shine and makes it so silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> The oil is not greasy at all and you only need a small drop to get the desired outcome.</li>
            <li> i was hoping based on reviews this would do something other products havent done.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use any other product in my hair after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten from other.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it with a curling iron or other heated product, so</li>
            <li> GIRLFRIEND USED IT THE OTHER DAY</li>
            <li> Only small amount is required.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> how one product, and such a small amount, can do all these things in one treatment.</li>
            <li> And, an added bonus, a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Two, it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump or some other dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li> , it will all come dumping out -- and rather quickly due to the weight of the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that gets extremely frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I use only a small amount</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it somehow doesn&#x27;t leave your hair extremely shinny and greasy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oil products from other sources and they did not perform as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> The Argan Oil helps, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products that didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it does</li>
            <li> I have 4b textured natural hair.. Very thick and sometimes very dry.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> as it grew, it started to feel a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I use a little bit before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I let it set for a little bit before I blow dry</li>
            <li> but for me, I will hereafter be very careful about basing my purchases on reviews like that.  </li>
            <li> I am African American with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> dry!!!)</li>
            <li> It may seem like a limited amount given the small container, but it really only takes a few drops.  </li>
            <li> My friend at work noticed and i told her my new secret...</li>
            <li> Some are so heavy with such heavy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I was going to keep a product that was half empty and not because I used it.</li>
            <li> But you should only apply a bit on it because its really heavy, and it makes your hair sort of heavy</li>
            <li> Like a lot of oils, you have to be careful not to apply too much or your hair will be sticky and difficult to fix.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I could just put in my hair and notice the difference but from what I gather, heat seems to active this.</li>
            <li> Hair will also resist excessive heating due to flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Please believe the previous reviewers when they say &amp;#34;A little goes a long way!&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I have hair that reaches down to the small of my back</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle with a flat iron purchase.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on while it&#x27;s damp, and then blow-dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> Then I usually let air-dry if I have time and then curl it with my HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample of HSI argan oil  when I purchased the HSI Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and finally found a straightener to tame the wild mess!!</li>
            <li> This bottle arrived with the bottle cap loose and a couple ounces wasted.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount every day on my face and my hair, whether my hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and carry this around with me to help tame my locks through a busy day.</li>
            <li> I think the product spilled because it wasn&#x27;t closed tightly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel sticky like other heat protectants.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and frizzy and this helps moisturize and tame it.</li>
            <li> - I have a bottle of pure oil that I use for skin, and I could probably use it on my hair, but it was REALLY expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful because this oil is amber colored and can make my hair appear a little yellowish, so I compensate by using bluing or lavender in my shampoo.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a little on my wet hair, then sleep, then use a tad in the morning while straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> She has very thick hair with natural waves, so that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and live in a cold dry climate.  </li>
            <li> but I have tried other products that work as well and cost much less</li>
            <li> I use it every other day or less, it does not make hair greasy - in fact, I used to wash my hair twice a week</li>
            <li> Half the price of other web sites.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be heavy handed.</li>
            <li> Might look a little weird at first</li>
            <li> Bear in mind, the sample I received with the flat iron was very small, so this goes to show that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky smooth, somehow fixes your bad ends, and it rejuvenates your hair.</li>
            <li> (yes, you can feel sorry for me) and I use this oil after blow-drying my hair before using a straight iron.</li>
            <li> I used to have at least 25 different products on my hair care shelf, and not one of them worked as well as this.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent.</li>
            <li> From Bleaching it to deciding to go dark</li>
            <li> This is really a five-star product, but I deducted a star for the questionable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> blow drying, straightening ect, because my hair is so delicate i avoid any potential damage.</li>
            <li> You very a lot of product for the price, unfortunately, the bottle is glass</li>
            <li> I have used at least 20 different kinds of leave-ins, premium oils, and thermal protectants.</li>
            <li> I used the standard delivery which can take at least 7 business days</li>
            <li> I have brown straight hair and this unfortunately did not go well with my hair.  </li>
            <li> After back and forth a few messages with company’s customer service I got small bottle 4 oz.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> so once it arrived to me, i took a shower immediatly and on my wet hair (slightly dried)</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have:  shoulder length, coarse, thick, wavy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but I also don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I put it in towel dried (still wet) hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my wet hair, blow dried it</li>
            <li> This product works well for my thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, hate the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;First - the product.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, curly, shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and have colored, straightened, curled and done a lot of damage to my poor hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair and coloring and straightening had made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry, coarse shoulder length hair which soaks up any sort of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> it is also not a cheap imitation argan oil that some other company&#x27;s sell.  </li>
            <li> I use very little on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I am a male whose hair has always been thin and dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not greasy/oily and does not weigh the hair down</li>
            <li> The product just runs down the sides.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t protect my hair and weighed it down.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh the hair down nor leaves an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling to your hair</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down and feel sticky</li>
            <li> It does not weigh the hair down and prevents hair from drying out from heat appliances.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not bulletproof, it slows down the damage a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pair</li>
            <li> This product calms it all down.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Although it is an oil, this leave in conditioner does not way hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to about 1/4 of a bottle (4 oz) after using it approx 3 times weekly for about 5 months now.</li>
            <li> With this product, the straightening iron runs smoothly down the hair</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil leave in does not weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down nor make it feel greasy or look &amp;#34;product-laden.&amp;#34;  Try it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and glossy and it doesn&#x27;t way it down.</li>
            <li> I also use the oil by itself immediately after showering and it helps keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> This product weighs down my hair some.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, esp here in humid Florida.  </li>
            <li> It does not way my hair down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh it down one bit</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> Calmed down my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy which allows me to go longer between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Josie Maran before but this product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as weighed down</li>
            <li> but if you have the same issue, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying different products of all kinds for years - and I mean years.  </li>
            <li> i mean the bottle i used to use was like $50 for similar size bottle</li>
            <li> I have thrown out all my other hair products!</li>
            <li> I usually apply it before I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tame my frizzy curly hair like I had expected.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed that my bottle was open and leaking oil; the top wasn&#x27;t sealed at all.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the Arganesque oil made my hair softer, silkier feeling and shinier, with a lot less frizz.  </li>
            <li> You will only need to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but I little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I anticipate that with using just a little bit every day the 4 oz bottle will last me at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> and I only use a very small amount to get the desired results.  </li>
            <li> yet I have thick hair (a lot of hair strands on my head) which makes flat ironing time consuming...</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long, long way - I&#x27;m talking less than dime size for my thick almost-shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really damaged hair from a bad perm I got several months ago.</li>
            <li> *Note to Amazon, please put in a airtight cap within the black screw-on cap.  </li>
            <li> I divide my hair in half while it&#x27;s still damp and apply a generous nickle size amount to each side.</li>
            <li> and it has shrunk in size by half.</li>
            <li> i have ordered this product twice in one and half year .i</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about argan oil previously, but never thought to use it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The 100% Argan oil made my hair heavier, slightly greasy and did not eliminate frizz half as well as this product does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the iron doesn&#x27;t break out my hair like previous straighteners have.</li>
            <li> Photo shows previous glass bottle</li>
            <li> If I use less</li>
            <li> time half of it has leaked out&lt;br</li>
            <li> just use less.</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair has cut in half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second: the styling time has been cut in half.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second: the styling time has been cut in half.  </li>
            <li> I brought this product after reading previous reviews and this stuff didn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silkier and shinier with a substantially less noticeable damaged appearance.</li>
            <li> (maybe everyone knows this, but I didn&#x27;t until recently - applying heat protectants to your hair is close to useless if your hair is dry - when your hair is wet</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It gives the hair a softer and less tangle when uses finger to run through the hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I apply the Argan oil conditioner when my hair is still just slightly damp, and then finish drying and styling it.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever, have been using it almost a year and still have over a half a bottle.</li>
            <li> I now look for Vine reviews and reviews with 3 or less stars to see what people don&#x27;t like about the product.  </li>
            <li> Less haircuts &#x3D; longer</li>
            <li> my hair began to wave and frizz oddly when I went through menopause.</li>
            <li> When this bottle arrived home, half of its contents had spilled out into the box.</li>
            <li> Some of the other products we had tried just made your hair feel stiff and like you had used hair spray.</li>
            <li> and I was a little worried about this weighing it down</li>
            <li> It was suggested that I only purchase a CHI, but because of price and not knowing whether I would like using a flat iron, I wanted a less expensive one.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is full of silicone, which is bad for the environment, and also for your hair.</li>
            <li> it drips everywhere and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> 1/3 of the content of bottle leaked out, and my travel luggage was a mess.  </li>
            <li> It gives me some cough but sofar no full blown asthma attack.</li>
            <li> but you can do it wet) and then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I, also, color my hair dark with few highlights monthly at a salon.</li>
            <li> But, the smell makes up for any mess I might make.</li>
            <li> I have generally frizzy hair, and it gets worse in the humid air.  </li>
            <li> I mean little since it only takes a few drops to get the results I get.  </li>
            <li> Instead of making my hair smooth and shiny, it just makes my hair lumpy :(  </li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair, and I use about a nickle sized amount each time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that I dye often</li>
            <li> Not only was this item poorly packaged, but it made my hair extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything too heavy or my hair gets weighed down.</li>
            <li> The cap wasn&#x27;t sealed tight, causing some of the oil to leak out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so I need something that will help with this dry weather (hair gets dull and frizzy).</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick curly hair</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, this time around the lid was not closed properly, so about 1/4 of the product had spilled in the box when I received it.</li>
            <li> If there was some type of a dropper or squeeze cap (with a plastic bottle) I think there would be less waste of product.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and seems dry, this made it feel thick and silky....</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair</li>
            <li> have normal hair (not too thick, not too thin)</li>
            <li> I have frizzy dry thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly and dry hair, I put the oil in my hair</li>
            <li> Plus I only need to use a little, and the bottle is hardly gone at all!</li>
            <li> made it little softer though</li>
            <li> Brought it for my little sister who loves it for taming her frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I put a little on my face after a shower</li>
            <li> ( little trick</li>
            <li> : just apply a little  amount on ur comb and ur hair to remove tangles in ur hair ) .it</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair that dries a little curly.  </li>
            <li> It lasts forever since all you need is a little.</li>
            <li> It felt a little yuckie.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how little you need.  </li>
            <li> so it gets a little curly.</li>
            <li> I just add a little to my ends after my shower  </li>
            <li> That being said, after buying the straightener that had this little sample with it, I read up on all the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other oil products in the past that no matter how little I used</li>
            <li> perspire even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> and I poured a little of the HSI Argan oil into a saucer (about the diameter of a votive candle).</li>
            <li> A little is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> What a difference a little Argan oil can do and</li>
            <li> but as long as I use a very small amount</li>
            <li> The ony reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think they could improve on the smell a little.  </li>
            <li> If it feels to heavy and limp, use less.</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily thick and frizzy hair and this product is the only thing that seems to work to tame the frizz!</li>
            <li> and it does the job to tame my hair,some reviews are negative,but i would recommend everybody to try it,i was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to smell like MoroccanOil and the other Argan Oil products I&#x27;ve used the past few years.</li>
            <li> The new plastic, unprotected container is VERY POOR.</li>
            <li> I guess it helped a little bit, but I thought the product was heavy and &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found that this is hard to wash out of my hair and a headband won&#x27;t stay on if I want to go to the gym later in the day, and it&#x27;s really hard to keep a ponytail in.</li>
            <li> and I have not put it down!</li>
            <li> My daughter has VERY thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair and this oil leaves</li>
            <li> I like it so far, but the only bad thing is that it makes my scalp itchy at times.</li>
            <li> Others have complained that it contains silicon oils such as \\&quot;Dimethicone\\&quot;, which is commonly used as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> , i applied few drops here and there .</li>
            <li> Just a few drops works for me.</li>
            <li> I waited to post this review after using this a few times.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy with product.  </li>
            <li> There are few products that will work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I cut off a few inches of my hair and used a keratin moisture mask on my hair before I used it.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of trouble drying my hair, the brush would get stuck and it came out frizzy.</li>
            <li> If the product is too heavy, my hair can look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This argan oil + a round brush&#x3D; the silkiest, smoothest hair you can imagine.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all you need.  </li>
            <li> This oil does for her almost what the keratin treatment does without the trouble and expense.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil everyday before ironing my hair, and it protects my hair from damaging.</li>
            <li> The bottle was designed by someone who appreciates waste.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and I use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> , that isn&#x27;t greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is heavy and cumbersome to me.</li>
            <li> I also feel like I waste product because I have to pour it into my hand.</li>
            <li> It isnt heavy and the hair soaks it up.</li>
            <li> I put this product in my hair everyday after showering and my hair feels so silky.</li>
            <li> I had this product in my cart for a few days and then the price went up by like 6 dollars or so.</li>
            <li> Missing 1/4 of oil.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was damaged by coloring frequently.</li>
            <li> Wasted $$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair for a few years now and</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not an issue with buildup nor does it make my sensitive skin break out or feel uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Let it sit in your cart a few days and check on it a few times..</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, conditioned, and then towel dried.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my hair and blow dried my hair and my daughter</li>
            <li> You know, get out a few kinks that showed up at night.</li>
            <li> You know, get out a few kinks that showed up at night.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> it works well as a detangler, and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> To me that was a surprise because I have trouble finding a hair gel that will keep my hair in place!&lt;br</li>
            <li> A dime size is enough for me, and I have moderately thin hair.  </li>
            <li> She used to have to get all of the split and damaged ends trimmed every few weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair was shinier and smoother and left without the greasiness some products leave behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret buying it, my hair is wavy and heavy and this helped quite a lot to keep it shinny and</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and get my hair highlighted, I also blowdry and straighten my hair every day so it definitely gets stressed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that I&#x27;ll keep in my hair-care routine.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as indicated in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Came opened and spilled everywhere, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I gave it a chance a few times but it did  not make ANY difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem so dried out.</li>
            <li> If you use a small amount as recommended, it is plenty to go around and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or make your hair feel sticky or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I am sick and tired of products being advertised as &amp;#34;ARGAN OIL&amp;#34;&#x27; when argan oil is just one of the many ingredients of the product.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that is hard to straighten, and Ivw always had to use flat iron spray.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is I like to use less of an amount and the opening makes it impossible to get only a bit in your palm, perhaps a narrower opening?    </li>
            <li> I take small sections, rub a very small amount of the product on each small section from root to end and pass through once with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried and unhealthy until I bought a HSI flat iron and tried the samplea Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It smoothed, didn&#x27;t leave an after oily feeling, or stiff at all.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with the product is that it was a little difficult to apply because it came from a bottle without a pump and it was just a mess trying to apply.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> This product did some what tame some of my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Argan Oil a try to see if it can tame my frizzies and take some of the weight on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I even use just to tame the frizz after curling.</li>
            <li> Really tame my frizzy hair away....</li>
            <li> This product helps tame frizz and flyaways and makes my hair softer.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to grow my hair long and it is keeping me from having to trim too often as it prevents split ends (which I normally get like CRAZY!)  </li>
            <li> My hair ...and its curls...are shiny and quite tame.</li>
            <li> wow, i am someone who has bought tons of serums only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and was afraid I was gonna have to cut it short.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 4 times a week since purchasing (at least 6 months now) and notice that my hair is a lot shinier than if I blow dry and straighten without it.</li>
            <li> I then washed and dried as usual.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thin hair</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick, oily hair.  </li>
            <li> It is comparable to every other straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, but not exceptional, which is what I was hoping from the description.</li>
            <li> A little expensive to use as your only form of conditioner, but it works SO well!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret and it makes straighten your hair alot easier and save at least half the time you spend on straighten your hair and</li>
            <li> So, use a little at a time!</li>
            <li> After a month my aging hair seems to have gained a thickness not seen in several years at least in the places where I still have hair!!</li>
            <li> and this little product does the trick!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive stuff, I&#x27;ve used it and this is the same if not better.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this with the flat iron and had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> It comes in an open pour bottle, which I find odd and awkward to dispense \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; of oil.</li>
            <li> do a pea size, rub it in your hands a very little bit and twist your ends or just rub it in.</li>
            <li> No more dryness or split ends.</li>
            <li> In past experience using foams or creams as thermal protection, I found that in order to get the job done, I had to use a lot of product...not with the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> got a small bottle as a sample...</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I could only find that product in India.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to my palm and put the ends of my hair between my palms and I</li>
            <li> Never greasy and all you need is a small amount.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years I have been growing out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that makes sense</li>
            <li> that are too expensive to use regularly.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to, maybe just a protect the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the product is in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable the results .</li>
            <li> My wife bought another brand for herself and the scent of that brand is not nearly so enjoyable nor is the quality even comparable.</li>
            <li> if not better then the Moroccan Oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair oily/greasy like the Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> After I was done straightening my hair i put a small bit on my hands and rubbed both my hand together and put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> For me, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with having argan oil listed as the third ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the argan oil or the iron</li>
            <li> Usually the day I wash my hair, all bets are off on how frizzy it will be and</li>
            <li> not sure why, but the Benzyl Salicylate is listed twice on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I place a small amount on my hair after I shower every night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks with no results :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it.  </li>
            <li> I usually ended up with FRIZZY/curly/wavy/ hair.</li>
            <li> Use small amount or hair may feel oily.  </li>
            <li> No more tears while brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> I usually shower at nighttime and was using another brand of argan oil on damp hair, but I still woke up with crazy-looking hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone raving about this product.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of over-pouring, I started using an eye dropper to get a small amount without wasting, which works, but</li>
            <li> i dont like that it doesnt have a pump, and the hole is too small for me to get my finger into to get product out.  </li>
            <li> No static cling.</li>
            <li> : Apply a small amount to the ENDS of your hair.</li>
            <li> -I wish it was easier to get a small amount of the oil out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure).  </li>
            <li> I ordered the HSI Flatiron for a trip that I was taking, and this small bottle of oil was included in the shipment.</li>
            <li> I could already tell the difference once it air dried!</li>
            <li> know Wen is already expensive but adding this to my regular hair routine will be a must from now on.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t use oils on it because I end up looking like I dipped my hair in grease.  </li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were fried after lightening it in the past and I haven&#x27;t cut it in 2 years in an attempt to get it longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending big money on expensive products and nothing has worked as well.  </li>
            <li> I must say this is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> where 90 % humidity all year long, my long blond hair is brutal and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near impossible to just pour out a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually apply about a dime size drop (I have thick shoulder-length hair) before blow-drying then again before using a curling/flat iron.</li>
            <li> There is no reducer included, so you have to try to slowly pour a small amount into your palm</li>
            <li> I have long suspected that some products sold on amazon have fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with how much I paid for this &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a thing.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and the HSI argan oil does not weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes it really difficult to dry my hair.    </li>
            <li> The product is fine, but the bottle is horrible, there&#x27;s no pump</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like hair oil because despite my dry hair, oils usually just sit there and make my hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> They either made hair brittle with no shine or hard as cardboard.</li>
            <li> and I would be hard pressed to pronounce the majority of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I have hardly made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> I also hardly have to use any oil</li>
            <li> When I think of all the semi-effective products I&#x27;ve tried and settled for over the years, it&#x27;s hard to believe this product even exists.</li>
            <li> but all works for a day and after that need wash my hair because it looks like dull and unwashed.</li>
            <li> so it has been hard to find a product that worked and didn&#x27;t make my hair</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;awful dry, frizzy and very thin hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t allowed such a disappointment don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed was the after I put some in, my hair sucks it all up (absorbs it) and it feels as if I have not put anything in.  </li>
            <li> That part sucks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a bit on the clumsy side, so</li>
            <li> complaint I have is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment to find the very second ingredient was dimethicone (a silicone)</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment, so I took it back.  </li>
            <li> I am assuming it is satisfactory, since I have not heard anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> this one sucks</li>
            <li> i combbed it and it start to shine while drying slowly.</li>
            <li> I apply this conditioner in sections to my hair and slowly detangle.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzing.  </li>
            <li> I have thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> unstraightened, my hair is shoulder-length, thick, and poofy.</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder+ length hair</li>
            <li> i have thick course hair...</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, so the volume was there.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> , I divide my thick hair in 2 parts, then I put a dime size Lt Side and</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I live in an area with terrible water that makes my hair dull and dry.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading all of these crazy, lovestruck reviews, but I gave in and bought their products since I was using the same straightener and CVS brand frizz-no-more something or other product for years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anybody thinking about trying the Argan oil for hair care, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!!</li>
            <li> My problem with serums is that my hair would feel flat and dirty by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> At first I hated it, now I use it</li>
            <li> I apply a very small dime size amount of the oil,</li>
            <li> If you use a very small amount it is weightless.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to express how much I hate the new bottle design.</li>
            <li> I hate the NEW product bottle design.</li>
            <li> Put it on dry and even crazy wind fussing you up is an easier brush out if this was applied.</li>
            <li> If your hair needs TLC, want to restore your hair&#x27;s vibrancy and manageability, and/or cut half the time you spend doing your hair, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much less expensive products that worked just as well.</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive than what I was buying from my hair salon</li>
            <li> seriously....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always gotten seriously tangled in the washing process.</li>
            <li> but it is subtle.</li>
            <li> My ends felt so dry that I was contemplating cutting my hair off.</li>
            <li> I was desperate cause my hair was in very bad healt consequence of the many color and misuse of the iron.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying a brand that was not familiar to me, but the ratings and the price made me take a chance.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is the glass bottle--</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Which she says is a hard to find combo!</li>
            <li> Definitely expensive and small in size, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a different brand of argan oil, but was very much disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this product would weigh my hair down or make it greesy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to get the product out</li>
            <li> I also have hypothyroidism which is very hard on hair.</li>
            <li> hsi flat iron.- doesn&#x27;t work :(    </li>
            <li> hair can be tough to manage and style.  </li>
            <li> My hair is below shoulder length and very thick</li>
            <li> As a background, I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works with one or two passes and makes my hair so shiny and slick!!  </li>
            <li> My cats would be happy for the play-cave, I would be miserable with the hair loss from terrible product.  </li>
            <li> This product has given me a severe rash behind my ears.</li>
            <li> Still hate the open pour bottle, but I won&#x27;t hold that against the product.</li>
            <li> I cannot however speak to how well the product performs over time because my bottle came broken...</li>
            <li> In fact I think it made my frizz worse.</li>
            <li> Not cool HSI &amp; BTW... a lot of the reviews looks fake!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and prone to split ends, but this seems to keep my hair protected.</li>
            <li> Can you tell my hair WAS confused?</li>
            <li> My poor hair is on the mend</li>
            <li> but I will probably keep looking for that secret formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the very small amount needed for the hair, this quite a bargain!</li>
            <li> I also live in Florida and the humidity is awful.  </li>
            <li> How wrong was I!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> to the few idiots who says this doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair, this is just oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff merely protects your hair and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for.</li>
            <li> No matter what size you purchase, you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this anymore, because they&#x27;ve hiked up the prices from $15 to almost $25.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was 100% argan oil, but I guess I bought the wrong item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive salon products and everything you can thing of.  </li>
            <li> but I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> Those are expensive though</li>
            <li> I could be wrong but thats how it appeared with my hair.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> weird...</li>
            <li> This oil was mediocre.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as expensive.  </li>
            <li> Wrong,</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> Wrong link came through.</li>
            <li> render this product useless.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong--</li>
            <li> so needless to say after I found this bottle of argan oil for $20</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to get the smallest amt that I need for my hair.</li>
            <li> This also makes traveling with it really scary.</li>
            <li> I have really difficult hair:</li>
            <li> The FDA is totally useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry I dont have the ingredients anymore</li>
            <li> Boy,was I wrong.</li>
            <li> So addicted to this hair oil!</li>
            <li> plus they are too expensive</li>
            <li> However, I was not impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> then I ran out -sad</li>
            <li> I have some nasty kinky curly hair and use a flat iron on my hair to keep it</li>
            <li> I used to be very addicted to that stuff when I heat styled.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever (twice a year) use heat in my hair because I hate going to the salon</li>
            <li> Its crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to grow out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that the bottle is going to break one of these days.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just crazy.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I was unhappy to find that there are artificial ingredients including artificial colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally&#x27;s oil products but got sick of the weird texture it gave my hair.</li>
            <li> THE JUMP - YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY!</li>
            <li> After all, it is a very difficult to harvest the oil and DC and CYC</li>
            <li> Very sad about that.</li>
            <li> oh so very wrong.  </li>
            <li> So when got this product I was very skeptical that it would be like all the rest.</li>
            <li> the directions say to use 2 drops, which is impossible to dispense in that way.  </li>
            <li> This product is really bad</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t feel that bad about it.  </li>
            <li> I have had a really bad experience with leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad my any means, just not quite the fragrance I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Ladies may want to take note, I could imagine that a bagful of oily clothes can ruin your trip.  :(</li>
            <li> But I had to pay for the shipping :(</li>
            <li> u want be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Though disappointed, I tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to try it :(</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was looking awful.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product!!</li>
            <li> , I just hate that all the companies insist on pumping chemicals into us.</li>
            <li> (that I hate)</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a a high-end product, the oil comes in a boring, 90&#x27;s-esque glass bottle.</li>
            <li> This was horrible.</li>
            <li> The package is horrible!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was a horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to be greasy and oily and nasty, but it wasn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> and I needed a relaxer and my hair needed to be done real bad.</li>
            <li> works terribly -- tried it on silky yet curly hair that tends to frizz.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think the product spilled because it wasn&#x27;t closed tightly. It&#x27;s just half full when I received it.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but the bottle is horrible, there&#x27;s no pump and it&#x27;s very hard to get the product out, I ended up getting too much of it out and my hands were full of greasy oils.</li>
            <li> My mom and I have lovely locks however it tends to get frizzy and sometimes quite damaged and coarse due to humidity where we live. This products works amazingly well!!  We apply on damp hair, twist our curls and dry it with a diffuser. We don&#x27;t even need any styling product! This works well as leave in conditioner AND styling product! I just use it once after shower while my mom&#x27;s hair which is more coarse require daily application at the moment.   We love the product and nothing has worked as well as this oil!!</li>
            <li> Great for flat ironing with the HSI flat iron. A little goes a long way. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this, but I&#x27;m giving it all the stars because my daughter keeps having people feel her hair because this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> Most of us jumped on the wagon of Morrocon Oil, but at nearly $43 a bottle, who can afford it. I did some research, because I do love the feel of argan oil in my dry/damaged hair, the price threw me off. I have found in this item the best so far, even better than Morrocan oil. It&#x27;s half the price and the same exact size. It even smells exactly the same. It helped that every single review was 5 stars. I really appreciate everyone&#x27;s detailed help and I hope this helps someone as well. I put 2 drops in my hair while it&#x27;s damp. I don&#x27;t use a falt iron, but I do beat my hair up quite a bit. When it&#x27;s dry the next day, I put 2 more drops on the end, tip my hair over/shake it out and it&#x27;s like brand new hair again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.I use it everyday.I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best leave-in oil treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried, surpasses Moroccan oil by far and I think the Moroccan oil is good. Your hair feels more moisturized and no build up which is great. I love feeling my hair after use. Constantly, I find my hands in my hair without being conscious of it. Hair is really silky, soft, and smooth. Btw, my hair is relaxed and bleached so it tends to be very dry, but this product is God send.  No more dryness or split ends.</li>
            <li> thanks for all the reviews in here that helped me alot to emagine what im going to feel. i had some doubts at first . so once it arrived to me, i took a shower immediatly and on my wet hair (slightly dried), i applied few drops here and there . First thing first, i felt the smoothness instantly as im spreading the drops through my hair. i combbed it and it start to shine while drying slowly. It is a wowing feeling for my hair. I didnt even style it or curl it and it is super good to go with. i can imagine how gorgous it will be once it is styled. SO highly recommended for those like me with dead crunshy hair and no hope at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fell in luv with it! &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Great product, great results!</li>
            <li> I am using prior to wash and after towel dried,  and sometimes if I&#x27;m going to use irons when my hair is dried I put little bit for extra protection against the heat..... it gives a shine and smell good, I can&#x27;t abuse of the amount because my hair tends to oily, but I found the right amount to use without been too much, it is a big bottle and it will last some time....</li>
            <li> Not heavy or overly greasy like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It is very good and quick shipping. And i am soooo happy with the Argan Oil. It is very nice and the bottle arrived safe and good. i must buy more from this product again.Thanks</li>
            <li> This item has far exceded my wife&#x27;s expectations. Honestly leaves her hair with great sheen and body even after she uses a flat iron on her hair. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s real argan oil and smells so good.  Definitely worth the price!!!  Makes hair feel silky and soft, with a little shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various commercial products (not ever been happy with, even the extremely expensive ones had some major flaw, such as being too oily or smelling weirdly artificial), and even olive oil (too thick and oily) and grapeseed oil (better than olive oil) -- but this product is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The serum is silky to the touch and doesn&#x27;t feel too sticky after I apply it on my hair. I&#x27;m able to use my hot iron just fine. It also smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any long-term effects, but I&#x27;m looking forward to enjoying soft silky hair as a result in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the packaging could be more functional. You have to be extra careful when applying it to your hands or else it drips everywhere and makes a mess. If this bottle had a dispenser instead of a cap, it would be fab.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the top / lid to the bottle was cracked, it does not close. The bottle itself is made of glass, so have to be really careful not to break.  Other than that,I like the way my hair looks and feels after applying it.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and makes my hair so silky smooth and so so soft!!!</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair and this conditions it nicely.</li>
            <li> I have long hair &amp; it is basically pretty dry- I absolutely love the Argan Oil- it&#x27;s not oily , it leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable- very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the way the Argan Oil make my hair feel silky and stay smoother than usual.  I will continue to order this product as it is the best I have found for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair feel silky smooth.  The argan oil smells wonderful.  I use a flat iron almost daily and the argan oil helps prevent damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried and unhealthy until I bought a HSI flat iron and tried the samplea Argan oil. I love it! Its worth the money. My hair is soft, silky and healthy!</li>
            <li> this is a great argan oil treatment for the hair and leaves your hair smooth and shiny! it&#x27;s not greasy/oily and does not weigh the hair down which is something i always look for in leave in oils. it is also not a cheap imitation argan oil that some other company&#x27;s sell.  i would purchase this again and pay the price for its quality.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product. It works decently, but I&#x27;ve used more effective products.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when using this leave-in conditioner for the very first time. I have fine, thin hair and most serums weigh my hair down.  I&#x27;ve read the feedback for this product and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve decided to purchase because this product is very light and does not weigh my hair down at all. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil after I wash my hair and ready use flat iron. Need be very careful how much you put on your hair otherwise its can make hair greasy. I have 4 oz bottle, so its will last me for a very long time considering how much product need for one use. In general it is very good product, make hair shiny and soft, also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I wrote the review below when my hair was unprocessed (dye free). Since then I have lightened my hair and had to throw this bottle out. It sat on top of my hair and gave it a waxy feel and did not improve my hair in any way. Now I only use \\&quot;Bumble and Bumble Invisible hair oil\\&quot;. It&#x27;s magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It really makes hair soft, shiny and frizz free when you useable straight iron or curling iron. It even does okay with just a hair dryer although I find if I do this I need to smooth an additional drop or two on my dry finished hair.</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil is the best I have tried.  Some are so heavy with such heavy fragrance.  HSI is balanced in every respect.  It does wonders for my thinner hair.  Thank you HSI!</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil for a few years and love it but decided to try something less expensive. Argan Oil is much lighter and it leaves my hair soft. I don&#x27;t use it with a flat iron, just for blow drying my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will never go back to Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of HSI Argan oil leave in conditioner and I really wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff earlier.  My hair tends to do it&#x27;s own thing - it&#x27;s somewhat curly and very dry so it frizzes easily.  The argan oil leaves it soft, manageable and is never oily.  Unlike silicone products there seems to be no problem using this oil every day.  I really love it!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever, and trust me, I have spent a lot of money trying to find the right products.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Such an excellent product!  Both of the HSI products I have are great for helping to tame my wavy curls.  They cut down on my styling time by at least 50% - that is worth every penny.  Plus, they leave my hair so soft and silky - just love it!</li>
            <li> I am sick and tired of products being advertised as &amp;#34;ARGAN OIL&amp;#34;&#x27; when argan oil is just one of the many ingredients of the product.The description of the item should read, ....conditioner &amp;#34;WITH&amp;#34;argan oil. If you are looking for a product with mainly &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34;,keep looking because this is not it. And let me know when you find it. The only positive about this product is the nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great seller with a great product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Leaves your hair shinny and smooth, without an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel. We have been using it for about three years now and always get the same quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil based on the other reviews I read - and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have straight, fine and thin hair (yes, you can feel sorry for me) and I use this oil after blow-drying my hair before using a straight iron. It keeps my hair from being full of static and plus it makes it shiny and healthy looking too. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried many argan oils in the past, but none have worked as well as this one did. some were also much more expensive. the 4 oz size is HUGE and will last for months. Fixes my frizz and makes my hair shine without making it greasy</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  If helps keep my hair silky and smooth even when using the straightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the hair.  But it would be better if there is a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; for the bottle so that I could get a few drop of oil in an easier way.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my product and highly recommend it. I have very thick hair and using this product has made blow drying as well as hot ironing my hair much easier.</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves my hair silky and hydrated. It keeps my hair straight and frizz free. Glad I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use. Works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles! I have thick, frizzy hair and this (and a hot iron) makes it silky smooth!</li>
            <li> When receive the packed with the Argan oil the bottle this open...So I don&#x27;t not that this bottle is used , very disappoints ;(</li>
            <li> Great for dry ends after washing your hair. I use it every day, helps with frizz too after styling.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling and looking amazing, extremely soft and shiny. I have tried numerous other top of the line products and this one if the best I&#x27;ve had at half the cost!  I have ordered it for both of my sister&#x27;s as well and they are hooked too! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> works lovely. nice and light and freshens my hair as well as keeps it prepped for my HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift to my mom. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and frizzy and this helps moisturize and tame it. It has a good scent to it as well. Better than the Josie Maran argan oil in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This oil works well on my hair which is fairly coarse and curly.  It also smells really good. I use it in conjunction with another styling product and get a nice result.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all, but it may not have the same effect on someone who doesn&#x27;t have dry hair like I do.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, EXCELLENT SELLER, WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> As per reviews, I had much more expectations from this product. It is good. But it makes your hair oily after 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and still gonna get more when this one is gone! Reviews on this product looked so great I decided to give a try. I am so glad I did. Not only makes my hair soft and shiny, but I love the fact that you only need a little to apply and one bottle lasts looooong time. I am Asian and have kind of frizzy black hair. I use this when I blow dry and straighten my hair and it definitely give the nice healthy shine:) give a try! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love it! smell&#x27;s good and my hair condition is getting better.&lt;br /&gt;It works better when the hair is half wet than it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Received a trial size bottle of this product along with my purchase of the HSI Flat Iron. Loved it so much, just bought more!  I have thick, coarse hair. In past experience using foams or creams as thermal protection, I found that in order to get the job done, I had to use a lot of product...not with the Argan oil. Just a few drops works for me. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or feel \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;, and it gets me superb results. I find this to be an exceptional product at a very reasonable price.  As a side note, once you apply it to your hair, DON&#x27;T wash your hands....just rub them together as you would when applying hand cream, and let the residual Argan oil sink in to the skin....only takes a minute or so, and you get the added benefit to your hands at no extra cost!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Does not leave your hair looking oily at all. This is my 2nd bottle and i know i will keep on ordering it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, and she loves it.  Purchased another bottle of pure Argan oil before this, which didn&#x27;t work for her Asian hair (it was too thick and made her hair feel &#x27;heavy&#x27;).  This fluid is &#x27;lighter&#x27; and works much better for her.  Just purchased another bottle for her.    *Note to Amazon, please put in a airtight cap within the black screw-on cap.  This screw on cap is NOT airtight, and could come loose during transport.  1/3 of the content of bottle leaked out, and my travel luggage was a mess.  Good thing it was a return flight.  Ladies may want to take note, I could imagine that a bagful of oily clothes can ruin your trip.  :(</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in I will use on my hair! I first tried it with the sample I received with my HSI straightener and fell in love. I have thick wavy hair and carry this around with me to help tame my locks through a busy day. Your hair feels softer, it feels natural, doesn&#x27;t get grimmy like with hair spray re-application. Put it on dry and even crazy wind fussing you up is an easier brush out if this was applied.</li>
            <li> This is liquid GOLD for your hair. I&#x27;ve tried several argan oils and they are just that - OILY. This absorbs right into the stands and immediately makes my hair soft and shiny. It feels like cashmere on the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a small bottle as a sample... then bought the biggest bottle I could find. A little goes a long way, but this stuff is phenomenal. No build up. No oily, lank locks. Just softness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, almost exotic soft musk smell. So sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for my hair which is very thick and dry (from winter conditions and haircoloring).  It has a nice scent and you do not need a lot.  I received it quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The quality of my purchase is great!! I tried many brands before but this one works great on the ends of my hair; during winter was the best option to avoid having splits on my hair. Also the thickness and scent is really good. I highly reccomend this product</li>
            <li> I went somewhere very humid &amp; didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in hair.  Guess it&#x27;s better with the HSI Iron.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair noticeably shinier and easier to comb out when wet.  Hair also seems healthier.  The easier comb-out is a real plus!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, cant do without it.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!! Super good!!!!</li>
            <li> I waited to post this review after using this a few times.  My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and curly.  It looks great the first day after I first wash it and that is without product.  However that is only on the first day.  I don&#x27;t color or perm or use anything to chemically alter the structure of my hair.  It has always been this way.  I am always on the lookout for something that will smooth my hair and soften the texture.  I am also looking for shine.  I have used other products like John F***** or Citre S****.  I still like both products.  Oh by the way, I use frizz serums, shine serums, smoothing serums and the like.  This has cyclomethicone which works similar to the other products but there is the additional ingredient of argan oil. I didn&#x27;t know if it would truly make a difference in my hair.  The argan oil added to a basic frizz serum does make my hair softer.  This stuff is amazing.  I will definitely buy it again.  It smells great and it actually makes my hair soft.  I notice that it is easier to straight iron my hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy with product.  It smells nice kind of similar to vanilla.  I am using this sparingly because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I will buy soon just to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the argon oil products on the market, but this is an absolutely the best product ever. Not only does it make my hair easy to brush after washing, but I also makes it look silky and very healthy. It also smells great. This is my second bottle and I am planning on getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it! Hair used to look damaged after so much color treatment. Now it looks healthy. I also love that doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy like other oils. Just what I needed after trying so many expensive products with no luck</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. This item delivered as promised and I love the look of my hair after using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of argan oil and this is definitely my favorite. I have thin hair and the HSI argan oil does not weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. It only takes a small amount so this bottle lasts a long time. My hair is straight with a nice shine after using HSI argan oil. It also seems to help protect from daily flat iron use.</li>
            <li> I own the HSI straightener and used the sample oil.  I decided to purchase the oil after I noticed such a difference.  I do use another heat protector because it is a de-tangler however I use this as well.  This is great for the fact it can be used on dry hair whereas other products cannot be.  It makes my hair feel super smooth as well as look shiny.  My favorite part is that it helps tame fly aways.  The size of the bottle means it lasts a long time so I feel the price is a value.  I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> Works. Leaves hair soft and manageable. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I spent so much time and money looking for a perfect product for my hair and had no luck till now. I love love love this oil. My hair looks and feels fantastic. And it smells sooo nice, not like stinky old lady like Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> works well but not as good a shea butter.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help the friZZ! made it little softer though</li>
            <li> I have 4b textured natural hair.. Very thick and sometimes very dry. After using this product I can really notice the difference in how my hair feels. After i blow dry my hair it is so soft and doesn&#x27;t frizz.. I am nowhere near almost out of this product because a little really does go a longggggg way. I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got my first trial with the hsi iron. Now i cannot stop using it. its an addiction. buy it you will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes hair so soft without feeling greasy at all. Great seller and amazing oil!</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, it works perfect in my head, non grassy, no heavy. The result is natural.</li>
            <li> There are few products that will work as advertised. This is one of them. I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and I&#x27;ve never regretted it. I always reorder when I run out, and that&#x27;s saying something. It leaves my hair very soft and protected from heat damage. I am a 55 year old woman with very long white hair that is naturally curly and frizzy if left to itself. I use about a bottom of a capful of this oil on my hair every time I wash it, which is almost every day. I have to be careful because this oil is amber colored and can make my hair appear a little yellowish, so I compensate by using bluing or lavender in my shampoo. I definitely recommended HSI Professional Argan Oil. It just disappears into your hair without any greasy feeling at all. Try it! If your hair feels too dry, use more. If it feels to heavy and limp, use less. It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this leave in conditioner. I am African American with very thick hair. After every wash right before I would blow dry I would put a little in my hands and spread throughout my entire head as well as making sure to get enough on my ends. I would apply more right after I blow dry for flat ironing. This product makes my hair so soft while wet and dry. It&#x27;s as if it makes the naps and tangles melt away. Granted I still have to take my time when detangling but I COULD NOT detangle my hair AT ALL without this leave in. Now I am currently  about 8 months post relaxer (currently transitioning) and even though I am no longer using heat at present. This is still my first step after i have deep conditioned. I apply this conditioner in sections to my hair and slowly detangle. LOVE THIS STUFF. I WILL DEFINITELY REPURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret buying this leave in. Relaxed ladies can use it when heat styling as well as natural/ transitioning ladies to aid in detangling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: This product is very comparable to the CHI SILK INFUSION. I used to be very addicted to that stuff when I heat styled. After i used this the first time i realized this product made my hair just as soft just as manageable and it&#x27;s safer for my hair!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Saw visible improvement to my hair immediately</li>
            <li> This is the best argan oil! Very pleasant smell, very smooth hair, and excellent price!</li>
            <li> I really love this... it makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always leave reviews but I just had to for this. I absolutely love this stuff. I do not have a relaxer and I have lots of new growth. I was concerned how it would work on my kinky extra course hair but this with the ceramic flat iron makes my hair straighter than any perm could ever get it. I cut off a few inches of my hair and used a keratin moisture mask on my hair before I used it. I may not have had to do that if I had used it first. Then again its always best to have your hair as healthy as possible. I use it daily and it keeps my hair shiny and strong. It feels like silk with out any oily residue. I have basically NO strands falling out or breakage .I never thought my hair could feel and look like this. WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Really does make your hair silky and shiny, and just look healthy, but if you use a lot on one section of your hair it will weigh it down, so even with it being a light oil, it still can buildup and create a greasy problem</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. My hair is naturally curly so I straighten it allot cause my hair was damaged from allergy shots. For the first time in a long time I was able to go natural after a week of using the Aegean oil. I&#x27;m so happy! Best thing is I didn&#x27;t have to put any hairspray or anything on my hair except this.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and fine and there is a lot of it. It can get frizzy and because I like to keep it long I worry about accumulated heat damage. This stuff is wonderful! I divide my hair in half while it&#x27;s still damp and apply a generous nickle size amount to each side. This makes it easy to comb thru (a real issue). Then I blow dry with a round brush and it comes out so incredibly soft and smooth. I used to have a lot of trouble drying my hair, the brush would get stuck and it came out frizzy. Now it&#x27;s quick and easy and always comes out great.  Dealing with the seller was super easy and the bottle came packaged securely and on time. Good experience and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best Argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Really helps with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner. I use it at least 4 times a week since purchasing (at least 6 months now) and notice that my hair is a lot shinier than if I blow dry and straighten without it. I don&#x27;t really ever have split ends so I can&#x27;t attest to it preventing them but my hair does tend to get dry when styling and it does help with that. A little goes a long way. I usually try to get it from root to tip but really rub into the ends ,comb through and wait 5 min. before blow-drying. I have medium, straight hair and would say that about a dollar coin size amount is enough. It is easy to use too much but a money saver once you get the hang of how little you really need.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 star because of its aroma. I was looking for a hypoallergic leave-in conditioner and came upon this product. I develop asthma attacks to many hair creams so it&#x27;s a major factor for me when I&#x27;m choosing a hair product. I do love the feel of this oil on my hair. It really feels soft, shiny and helps keeping the hair style for several days. However, it&#x27;s aroma, while being pleasant, is a little over powering. It gives me some cough but sofar no full blown asthma attack. So I&#x27;m going to use it until I develop reaction or get used to it.</li>
            <li> Hair feels amazing. Doesn&#x27;t look oily. Would recommend this product to people who flat iron their hair.</li>
            <li> I found that this is hard to wash out of my hair and a headband won&#x27;t stay on if I want to go to the gym later in the day, and it&#x27;s really hard to keep a ponytail in. It made my hair feel oily even though I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different product but unfortunately I could only find that product in India. I found this online and thought I would give it a shot. Thankfully, I did! Product is worth your money. Salon style quality in my opinion. I haven&#x27;t used it for too long, but I find my hair healthier and smoother even though I don&#x27;t use it everyday. I know some people like to soak their hair in it, but I just use it as a heat/anti-frizz serum and it works great. Only drawback is I like to use less of an amount and the opening makes it impossible to get only a bit in your palm, perhaps a narrower opening?    Bonus: It smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this oil, my hair feels very soft and healthy :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair is so soft and silky I cannot stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily, dries fast and my hair shines beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great too, product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can find that leaves my hair silky &amp; stops the fizziness. I recommend this highly! Easy transaction &amp; received item fast.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I color it and use hot irons and curlers. This oil has been a savior. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and it always shines. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to express how much I hate the new bottle design. The pump does not work. The product just runs down the sides. I have tried for months to just give it a try, but I am about to throw it all out. It&#x27;s a shame too, because I love the product. Apparently this over-wrote a review I previously wrote about how much I love this. It has the old purchase date. I hate the NEW product bottle design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice, and my hair definitely came out better the second time.  I have a long bob, and it&#x27;s angled so it&#x27;s fairly short in the back.  I think this would work fantastically with longer hair, but I still think my hair comes out cute.  I noticed my arm getting tired after doing my hair, but it still looks good, so I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had been using Moroccan oil for a while, and was reluctant to try something new. However, after reading the reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try. I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and silky. It is not oily and does not weigh the hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Brought it for my little sister who loves it for taming her frizzy hair</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would tame my incredibly frizzy hair. I found just the perfect product in Argan Oil Leave-in Conditioner. Just a small quantity plus some straightening makes my hair incredibly soft and styled. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone wanting an easy fix for frizz.</li>
            <li> Great product. I got a sample bottle with my flat iron and liked it so well I bought a bigger bottle. My hair is color treated blonde and it works great, leaves my hair silky, and looking great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t protect my hair and weighed it down. I used it with the HSI flat iron. My hair became fried.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome - feels great on my hair.  I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner when I use this instead.  Did you know it&#x27;s also good for your skin?  I put a little on my face after a shower and I get that wonderful smell and soft skin without it being greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than what I thought. It really helps my frizzy hair. It&#x27;s making my hair soft and shiny. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZing !!! Makes my hair so silky, replaced all my other hair oils, keeps it smooth even w out the use of the straightener!!! This company is great too, super fast shipping and friendly customer service highly recommend, in conjunction w the flat iron hands down best spent money on amazon to date!</li>
            <li> Lets start off with my ever growing grey hair is just frizz. This product did some what tame some of my hair. how ever I have eczema and I am always trying everything I can to help this problem. well within three days of applying this oil on my eczema it started to help. it is about three weeks and it has shrunk in size by half. will be ordering more for my eczema, if I have to. but it looks like it just might heal it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I put a little bit in my hair when I&#x27;m about halfway through drying, and my hair always ends up feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Product leaves hair shiny and smooth and protects it from my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so I am very cautious with hair products. If the product is too heavy, my hair can look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HSI Professional Argan Oil is lightweight and does an amazing job. My hair is easier to style and is silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be heavy handed. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way like the reviews state. I have 3c/3b curls which tend to be extremely dry and absorb moisture insanely fast. I hardly ever (twice a year) use heat in my hair because I hate going to the salon and it usually takes too long at home and never comes out right. This oil kept the moisture locked in and I have salon-type results. I would easily spend $50 on this!</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT.........Leaves my hair soft, shiny and no greasy residue at all.  I even put in daily and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product and use it each time after I shampoo my hair. It&#x27;s not greasy, and has a nice subtle scent, and makes my hair soft and shine. You can use it on both towel dried hair or completely dried hair, both with nice results. I also noticed that I haven&#x27;t been losing as many hair as I had before, and I attribute that to both the use of Hannah and Argan oil. I highly recommend it to anybody thinking about trying the Argan oil for hair care, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an improvement!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair products, including other argan oil products, and this is my favorite oil.  It helps tame the frizz, and makes my hair feel smooth.  It does not feel sticky on your hair or on your hands, unlike some other oil products.  I have very long hair and use a dime-sized amount on my damp hair.  I also will put a smaller amount on my dry hair if I am styling it with heat.  It does not make your hair look greasy.  I am on my second bottle and this is now a &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; product for me.</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily thick and frizzy hair and this product is the only thing that seems to work to tame the frizz! I can even BRUSH MY HAIR DRY without it getting super frizzy! This is a miracle product and a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I just had to for this!  I really damaged my hair by going ombre.  It felt dry and crispy, totally gross.  I tried several types of leave-in  conditioner with no improvement.  But after only using this oil 2 or 3 times, there&#x27;s been a complete change in my hair!  Its crazy but I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair.  It feels better and healthier than it has ever felt. I will be repurchasing as soon as it gets low, but that won&#x27;t be happening anytime soon since a little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I received a simple of this with the purchase of the HSI flat iron. It works so well that I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron to get my hair soft, silky and manageable. It is not a heavy oil like other brands I have tried. It does not weigh the hair down nor leaves an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling to your hair and it smells great too.  The only thing that would make this product better is for it to have a dropper. Absolutely LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair fall out!</li>
            <li> wow  i just loved it for the first time i had use it. i have ordered this product twice in one and half year .i love the way my hair becomes silky after applying it ( little trick : just apply a little  amount on ur comb and ur hair to remove tangles in ur hair ) .it just works as a magic .perfect product which has replaced my  hair serum, heat protector from my hair care kit.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product!! I first got a sample with a straightening iron I purchased. It smells phenomenal and leaves my thick, coarse hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Leaves my hair soft and shiny after styling with any of my heated hair styling tools. I DEFINITELY plan on buying more of this product. :-)</li>
            <li> I loved this leave in conditioner! It works for my natural hair texture as well as straightened. I use it with the flat iron since my hair usually comes out better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Makes my hair so soft and shiny, and protects it from heat damage (I blow dry a few times a week). Smells great, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Best product for frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I use this after I striaghten my hair and it leaves it soft and silky. I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down and feel sticky but I am pleased that it doesn&#x27;t have that effect at all. I apply a small amount to my palm and put the ends of my hair between my palms and I gently squeeze my flattened palms together. I find this helps my hair absorb the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Made my damaged/dry hair shiny and smooth without weighing it down or making it greasy.  Would buy again for sure! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used to have at least 25 different products on my hair care shelf, and not one of them worked as well as this.  Some of those cost more than twice as much as this, too.  I have really thick hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzing.  I have to blow dry it daily to get anything resembling a hairstyle.  In this product I got heat protection for blow drying and a de-frizzing product that not only leaves my hair in better condition but smells amazing, too.  A little goes a long way so this is really a great deal, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best item for your hair. Awesome</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use this every day. I apply it to my curly bangs before flat ironing. I recommend this brand of Argan Oil over others because it leaves my bangs shiny with out giving it that greasy look.</li>
            <li> Fantastic effect on hair - makes it shiny, straight, adds moisture, most effective styling natural product before blowdry, especially well suited for thick and coarse hair. Only drawback is the price - plenty of Competing argan oil similar products for much less than the price of HSI argan oil.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair a healthy glow and won&#x27;t be needing a Brazilian Blow-Out anymore, which saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Works well and my color lasted much longer, in spite of being in the sun.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! My hair has never been softer. I use it right out of the shower and go to bed, waking with soft, manageable and shiny (not greasy) hair. The smell is clean and pleasant. I have super fine hair, that tends to split from frequent styling, but with this product I am able to save my hair and allow it to grow out healthier. Go try it, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this for the third time. I have the course at hair you will find on a white girl. This is the best product I have ever used for getting my hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I tried several different serums for my hair, with daily straitening my hair was becoming damaged.  This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to protect the hair from heat damage.  This oil is light weight and it smoothes out any frizz and makes my hair look healthy.  This last week I went for a haircut and my stylist complimented me on how healthy my hair has become.  Thank you HSI for this awesome product.</li>
            <li> Very good leave in conditioner.  Like the smell.</li>
            <li> Just buy it. Some hair oils make your hair fabulous but after 1 week feel super dry without it so you need to add even more. This product is amazing because it only helps your hair</li>
            <li> This product is really bad it dry my hair I followed all the instructions I try returning it but they don&#x27;t allowed such a disappointment don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the great reviews and I must say I&#x27;m glad I did. The argan oil leaves your hair soft, shiny and smells good (just use a little or you will have greasy hair). My niece has the ombre look and her ends are kind of damaged, so I put some on her ends and it really helped.</li>
            <li> I love this natural product.  I put it on after shower, before blow dry or flat iron, rub more on the ends. It works great. I no longer use other styling product that contains more chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a great little bottle of oil! I have permed African American hair, and a little bit goes a long way to help my hair feel soft, bouncy, and manageable while maintaining a beautiful shine! I usually apply it right before I use the HSI flat iron to straighten my hair so that my hair will be shiny and soft. It also lasts in my hair for a long time with no need to reapply which is something I really appreciate. I have tried other bottles of argan oil, but none have done as well as this one. It&#x27;s like pure silk for my hair!</li>
            <li> I use this before straightening my hair and it makes it very smooth and soft without the weighted down oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product with a very nice scent. Its a great heat protector and an amazing serum/leave in conditioner. I sometimes don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron to straighten my hair. They look very soft, smooth and silky by only using this serum.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why this product is so highly rated...it&#x27;s fabulous. This argan oil + a round brush&#x3D; the silkiest, smoothest hair you can imagine. I get compliments left and right!  Just wish it was in a more user-friendly bottle, as I have already knocked it over and spilled it everywhere, but that in no way would prevent me from buying it again!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Leaves my hair soft and silky. It even feels great on my hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to help reduce damage to my hair with straightening it with flat iron, and it works wonderfully! The product arrives as promised, and really helps my hair look great. It not only protects, it also nuirish my hair and gives it a healthy look. It leaves no residual and applying is easy. I am happy with the product and will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this oil but mine didn&#x27;t have a dropper in it and you need the dropper so that you can run the oil on your scape so that you can work it in to your hair.  I will look for a brand that I can get a dropper with so that I can use it.  If you don&#x27;t like a dropper then this is a good product for you.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my blonde hair, leaving it soft and taming fly-aways!</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my hair so soft and smooth. A little goes a long way. It is a must when you use HSI&#x27;s flat iron.</li>
            <li> I ordered the argon oil to deal with a perm from the nether regions. It not only calmed down hair fried to the roots, it looks shinier than it did when it was young and healthy. It only takes a couple of drops which I use mostly on the edges and then comb through from the edges to the crown. It really works on all sorts of hair. I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample with my flat iron and I loved it instantly. The company that sold the iron was even nice enough to ship me an additional sample free of charge once I told them how much I loved the product. I have relaxed colored hair and I use the treatment after I have washed my hair before blow drying. I also add a little while I&#x27;m flat ironing to add shine and heat protection. I have thick, healthy hair and this treatment allows it to stay that way....wonderful product. If you have relaxed hair, I recommend that you add this to your regimen.</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry hair!!! I like a lot!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this oil every time that she straightens her hair. She love&#x27;s it and so do I! It makes her hair smell fantastic and it feels incredibly soft. I find myself running my fingers through her hair even more now than when we were first married 24 years ago. I highly recommend  this oil to anyone who appreciates soft, aromatic hair.</li>
            <li> My  tends to be frizzy.  I straighten my hair with the HSI flat iron, but before I do that, I use the HSI Argan Oil.  The result is amazing.  My hair is silky and smooth.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for frizzy hair.  Just a few drops is all you need.  I would give this the ++++ 10 rating !!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great leave in conditioner and it smells so good and feels good even on your hands and leaves your hair smelling good.[[ASIN:B007Q0WW0S HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]]</li>
            <li> better than the expensive argan oil 10X</li>
            <li> I have thick and frizzy hair. I have used many products that reduce frizz, without results.&lt;br /&gt;After a search on amazon.com I found HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave in Conditioner, which had great reviews. I always check reviews before buying something. Also this is my first review on Amazon. And that is because I love HSI Conditioner. I apply only 2-3 drops on wet hair, especially at the ends and the frizzy part of my hair. After that I blow dry my hair. My hair is so soft, shiny and frizz free. I highly recommend this product to those with thick and frizzy hair. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, this product is just right for me. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product . It leaves my hair soft and shiny . I usually apply it before I blow dry my hair and once I flat iron it with my HSI flatiron the results are wonderful. Never greasy and all you need is a small amount. I would recommend this product especially if your hair is dry and frizzy I definitely see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Hey, what can I say?  When a man needs leave in conditioner, he can do one of two things: Prance into a salon, or log into Amazon.  I chose the later, as my shoes are too tight.  BUT, be that as it may...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shop and this product exceeded my expectations.  I assumed that I was going to get a very small bottle, in a very large box.  My cats would be happy for the play-cave, I would be miserable with the hair loss from terrible product.  How wrong was I!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave-in conditioner is one of the best on the market.  And at a reasonable price?  Daddy is going to super-size his french-fries tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high-five goes out to all my peoples, who loves them the quality leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> I use it on my damp hair, and on my kid&#x27;s dry hair instead of detangler. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but makes it so much easier to brush girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my wife&#x27;s hair silky smooth and manageable. I love it....she loves it.</li>
            <li> Good , I like it .&lt;br /&gt;When I use it , it makes my hair very smooth , but not too much oiled and make my hair very clean.</li>
            <li> It seems to work more like a serum than a leave in conditioner, I use it before flat-ironing my hair and it adds some protection and restores some of the oil stripped out from shampooing. It is an oil, so a little bit goes a long way. I have to say my favorite part is the fragrance. Best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave in Conditioner Thermal Protector does a job and dose it well. With just a small amount, rubbed together in your hands and slid down the ends of your hair, will leave it shiny, soft, non frizzy and smelling wonderful. The next day you will find your hair just as nice and still not greasy and frizzy. I buy through Amazon also to insure I&#x27;m getting the best price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian woman with color-treated hair that is fairly thick and naturally wavy.  I run this through my hair before I blow dry it every morning, and it leaves my hair easy to straighten and smooth.  For me the product is too heavy to use on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, but I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> This product has given me a severe rash behind my ears.</li>
            <li> this product is good but not different than any other Argan oil out there.</li>
            <li> The product was leaking when I got it. There&#x27;s no seal on the bottle nor on the box. The bottle cap was opened inside its box and some of the oil leaked out.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for a couple of months now, and can honestly say that I can not live without it. My hair is so much longer than before that I even get commented on its length! it makes my hair so much softer after washer, and makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t pressed my hair in 5 years, so this conditioner did wonder for my hair. Soft and less breakage when I finished my hair.  Will buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Good product and good value. Works great on my course, thick and frizzy hair that needs heat treating. Great on skin too.</li>
            <li> I use just the smallest amount of this stuff every time i straighten my hair.  It leaves it super soft, straight, and silky.....It also smells really good too!  I think i finally found what i&#x27;ve been looking for, for 15 years!</li>
            <li> I have really damaged hair from a bad perm I got several months ago. Ive tried other products and didnt see any great results. With this oil I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair without it looking severely burned. It like seals the ends of my hair making it look healthy. I do believe this is magic in a bottle. A little goes a long way and it will last me awhile. One thing to mention though is the scent, not too pleasant. But it works!</li>
            <li> As a guy with short color-treated hair, my hair is often dull and frizzy as it grows longer and is treated multiple times. This product greatly helps with this, leaving my hair looking more natural - shinier and less frizzy and softer without the appearance of using a styling gel. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Super lightweight! Perfect for using in your ends or on bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Just ok, got great. Been using it for months now and don&#x27;t really notice any benefits from using this product</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Makes her hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> My daughter has VERY thick coarse hair. I have been trying everything to help her manage it including Keratin treatments and professional straightening. This oil does for her almost what the keratin treatment does without the trouble and expense. It really calms her fizziness and makes the ends of her hair much more manageable. I use it as we&#x27;ll, my hair is much less thick and much finer. It tames the flyaways and leaves my hair glossy without looking oily. The small bottle (4oz) goes a long way so the price is easy to handle. This will be a regular in our routine now!</li>
            <li> Great product gals!  A leave-in conditioner that is flat iron thermal protected, too.  Can&#x27;t beat this!  Get it while it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for a year. My last bleaching left my hair broken and changed the texture from straight and fine to extremely course and frizzy. I thought my hair was ruined until I started using this oil.  My hair was returned to its usual condition after using this oil daily for two weeks!  It&#x27;s oil but you can put a lot in your hair and blow dry it. It will not be greasy. It will be soft and straight. Don&#x27;t worry about getting oil on your face and clogging pores. This type of oil can be used for skin conditions too.  Glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> i like it. It leaves your hair nice and smooth. I would recommend to others. I gave it four stars because in my opinion it is a good product but not exactly great.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and shiny. I have tried several different brands of this type of conditioner and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  We have tried so many before.  In our quest we have had some success but none that have given us consistent results like this product.  We really love the shiny bouncy effect this product leaves.  I will definitely purchase this product again and I recommend it to anyone with teens.  They will find it easy to use and helpful for their hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly was pretty skeptical about this product when I first got it. However, now that I&#x27;ve been using it I can se that it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. The product isn&#x27;t sticky like some other leave-in conditioners that I have tried before. In addition to this, there is also a good quantity in the bottle and the price is reasonable for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants really soft hair. Its my favorite leave in conditioner at the moment , and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll be buying this product again once I finish of what I have at home.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and less frizzy without being greasy.  i&#x27;m very happy with it and i&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and lovely! My hair is quite dry and I use this mostly right now as a leave in conditioner.  I apply it while my hair is wet.  My hair never feels oily or greasy, it just soaks it up.  I know it&#x27;s intended for flat iron use, but I&#x27;m using it as a protecting conditioner.  It&#x27;s nice to know it will also protect my hair when I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Totally recomended !!! and it´s perfect combination if you add HSI PROFESSIONAL #1 THERMAL PROTECTOR 450 WITH ARGAN OIL FOR FLAT IRON, INFUSED WITH VITAMINS A,B,C &amp; D. CREATES SILKY</li>
            <li> Perfect size foe a salon use. I bought it for a nice price.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is amazing. It leaves my hair so shinny and healthy. I love this product and smells great</li>
            <li> Over the past two years I have been growing out my hair.  It&#x27;s normally frizzy and wavy.  I&#x27;ve struggled with the weight of my hair resting on my neck and find myself throwing my hair up into a pony tail more days than not.  I decided to give Argan Oil a try to see if it can tame my frizzies and take some of the weight on my neck.  It did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  It&#x27;s smoothed my hair out, keep the frizzies at bay and has helped me straighten it and keep it from resting on my neck.  I&#x27;m not sure if that makes sense but if you have the same issue, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.  :)</li>
            <li> This product has a light pleasant smell. I switched from Biosilk to this product because I can use it all n my face without worry of sensitivity due to the fragrance. It tames my fly aways and split ends  without weighing down my curls.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing the Argan Oil and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I had heard from others that it is a great product and they were right. This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have brittle, dry, over processed, bleach blonde hair that was breaking off at the ends. This HSI argon oil literally saved my hair from having to cut it all off. I use it on my damp hair and also on dry hair before using a flat iron and my hair looks silky and healthy. My hair has also stopped breaking off as much and I have noticed that it is finally getting longer. HSI Argan oil in my opinion is better than Moroccan oil, and also much less expensive. In loveeeeeeee</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and loves it!</li>
            <li> I got the sample with the iron.  It is a great product.  Ordering more today.</li>
            <li> I wanted Agave Healing Oil but ordered this when I could not get it. It has been a great product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because of the free sample I received with the iron.  Works better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and shiny. It also smells so good I&#x27;d like to wear it as perfume!</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have found for smoothing my hair that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling or leave my hair feeling weighed down after. I have fine hair but a lot of it, and it just absorbs this product leaving my hair feeling smooth and looking shiny and healthy not greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Updated 2017: I recently started using this oil again and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I used it years ago but moved on to other brands (way more expensive ones like alterna, macadamia professional, etc, ) because I was never a fan of the old packaging.  I&#x27;d get too little, too much, or just the right amount and never knew how my hair would turn out. When it was the perfect pour, it was great, but too much will leave you greasy and too little left my hair dry. Happened to see this in my recommendations and saw the new pump bottle and immediately ordered. I remember why I love it. I&#x27;ve had nothing but great hair days since I started using it again and I know this oil takes all the credit. I split my hair half up half down and do 6 pumps per section and the results are silky smooth hair 😍. If you had issues before with the packaging, give this another chance. Once you find the right amount of pumps your hair needs, you will never look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff just... Wow. I got a sample with my hsi flat iron ( which is also great btw) My hair has not felt this good in years. I ordered the biggest bottle of it immediately. I usually don&#x27;t like hair oil because despite my dry hair, oils usually just sit there and make my hair look dirty. My hair soaked this stuff up. Made the flat iron glide through easy too. I wasn&#x27;t left with a oily residue and my hair looked so shiny and healthy. It has a very light almost nonexistent scent to it but it doesn&#x27;t smell oily like other argon oils I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair and it does great for both. What&#x27;s great is a little goes a very long way so this bottle should last a long time. My only complaint is the bottle itself. It is a glass bottle and I wish it had pump because its easy to pour a little too much out. Other than that this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that tends to frizz due to living in a VERY humid climate. I used to have soft, manageable hair, but due to depression and a recent breakup which in turn affected my nutrition, I have lackluster locks. So my hair has lost its shine and bounce. I also regularly blow-dry/flat iron my hair, which just added to my hair looking brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got a sample of this Argan oil with the HSI flat iron I&#x27;ve recently bought. Honestly, I&#x27;m usually not keen on putting oil in my hair because of the scorching heat coupled with the high humidity levels in my country. After washing my hair today, I decided to try the sample. I wanted to see for myself why Argan oil is making so much buzz. Like all things that generate hype, I was very skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I&#x27;ve got to say is BELIEVE the reviewers! The first thing I noticed about it was its heavenly,albeit subtle, scent. I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my hair. When I rubbed it onto my freshly-washed, dry hair, I was half-scared I might end up with greasy hair.  I half-expected to look like I&#x27;ve stepped out of a sauna with slicked back hair, but nope. When I began blow-drying it, I noticed that my hair was shinier and more manageable!  It looked sleek (like as though I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time perfecting my blow-out, when in truth, I&#x27;ve only spent very little time.) My sister saw me and asked me what shampoo I&#x27;ve begun using because my hair looked shiny. Bear in mind, the sample I received with the flat iron was very small, so this goes to show that a little goes a long way. I keep touching my hair because it&#x27;s become softer (and I think that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll end up with greasy locks - constant-touching lol). It also helped combat the frizz (when I went out into the humid air), so my hair ended up retaining its sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put the bottle in my shopping cart and will buy it. I&#x27;m so happy with the results, I just felt the need to write about it first! If your hair needs TLC, want to restore your hair&#x27;s vibrancy and manageability, and/or cut half the time you spend doing your hair, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this Argan oil. You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth and more!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!! I apply it as soon as i get outa the shower and my hair dries super soft! Also apply before using a straightening iron on dry hair and it seals my hair nice and smooth!! My life saver!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great price and fast shipping- thank you</li>
            <li> Believe the hype, this argan oil is great. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s light enough to leave my hair shiny and moisturized with BODY. My flat iron only goes up to 410 degrees and with other thermal protector&#x27;s or frizz reducers I could NEVER get my hair to \\&quot;salon quality straight\\&quot; or sleekness. Well, HSI professionals does the trick at 400 degrees. I take small sections, rub a very small amount of the product on each small section from root to end and pass through once with the flat iron. I sleep on a satin pillow case and shake and go or comb with a wide tooth come in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural, afro-textured hair. My strands are very fine yet I have thick hair (a lot of hair strands on my head) which makes flat ironing time consuming...that is until I made this purchase. See my hair here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently got caught in a misty, dewy, humid mess one night and my straight hair held up fairly well to the moisture. I did experience frizz but not so much that my hair drew up into a cloud/mushroom. So it seems to work as an ok humidity protector, but I&#x27;ll have to wait to the next summer to experience the DC heatwave to see how it holds up in very humid conditions. The most important point to note here, is that I went home afer getting caught in the rain, rubbed a pea size amount of the product throughout my hair, combed down &amp; tucked in the ends (I have a rihanna-like under cut), and put on a satin cap. The next morning, I woke up and there was no sign of frizz. #amazeballs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey (way beyond my usual hair product price point) but it is worth every penny and I suspect the 4oz bottle will last me about 9months -year.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using for a week and already notice my hair is softer and feels healthier! Very easy to apply and a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Leaves your hair silky and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about two weeks now. I have really long thick hair, and I use about a nickle sized amount each time I wash my hair. My hair looks less frizzy, and feels more soft and silky.The oil also smells amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bottle cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight and it spilled all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve tried a few other Argan Oil brands before and after this and definitely like this better. It does not weigh the hair down and prevents hair from drying out from heat appliances. Also gives hair a lot of shine. Love it!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Josie Maran Argan oil, but switched to this. It&#x27;s less expensive, smells better, and most importantly works better.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Last time I had to order 2 small bottles.  It was nice to only have to order 1 larger bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve used much less expensive products that worked just as well. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because of the stellar reviews and rating. It comes in an open pour bottle, which I find odd and awkward to dispense \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; of oil. Scent is barely there...I guess some other reviewers must have a hound-like sense of smell.  I will use until gone, but going back to my former cheapo serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED: I would like to change my opinion of this product. The more I use it, the better my hair gets. When I wrote the review above, I was using it on damp hair before blow drying. I started using it on my hair after drying, before the flat iron, and I now have a much higher opinion of it&#x27;s value. It keeps my hair frizz-free and smooth all day. I only shampoo my hair every other day, and my second-day hair is even better than on the days I shampoo. I don&#x27;t even have to use any product on non-shampoo days. Still hate the open pour bottle, but I won&#x27;t hold that against the product.</li>
            <li> Good product.akes my blow dried hair very smooth and shiny. Nice with flat iron also but I have found another one of my products is a little better (silky elements heat protection spray for flat irons, curling irons, etc). Otherwise love the product and no buildup.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with HSI&#x27;s thermal protector spray, and my hair is softer, silkier, and smoother than it ever has been before.  You only need a small amount of oil, so the bottle lasts for a good amount of time, even though I have long, thick hair.  I&#x27;ve definitely notice less split ends and breakages than in the past, even though I use a flat iron every day.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product, and the hire after using this oil feel amazing and so SOFT !&lt;br /&gt;The scent is beautiful as well.</li>
            <li> I like HSI argan oil because it is better than other argan oils for the price.  I&#x27;ve had ones that I like better that are too expensive to use regularly.  I&#x27;ve also bought cheaper ones that seem to have too much silicone or some other additives that are not good for hair.  So this is my daily go to argan oil.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil everyday before ironing my hair, and it protects my hair from damaging. BTW, the oil smells good. And every time, one to two drops oil is enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly and is a great product, I appreciate the good business! This product leaves my hair smooth and feeling healthier and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Ok guys, if you have dry damaged hair with splits like me, get it!&lt;br /&gt;This thing really works, I&#x27;ve tried many many hair products including the famous Moroccan oil, none of them did what this little guy does to my hair with 2 times. Will continue to use it from now on.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other people described. I used it when blow dry my hair, and I didn&#x27;t see the difference. I don&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about argan oil previously, but never thought to use it on my hair.  Since I was buying the HSI flat iron, this product came up as a complementary item, so I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, once or twice a week.  I use the argan oil on wet hair, damp hair, or even dry hair.  As soon as my hair is fully dry, it has a shine and softness to it.  Even after blow drying and using a flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend argan oil if you want soft, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell - -I could see myself using this during every season  - -esp. in the winters when it is so dry inside &amp; outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this seems to be great protection for my hair and takes the &#x27;static&#x27; away.</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps protect my hair from heat of flat iron.i would recommend this thermal protector oil to anyone looking for hair protector</li>
            <li> I had never used argan oil but heard about its attributes.  I was extremely pleased with the product.  Leaves your hair tangle free, manageable and smells oh so nice.</li>
            <li> I would like this product more if it was packaged differently.  The bottle was designed by someone who appreciates waste.  It&#x27;s near impossible to just pour out a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is okay.  Not the best I&#x27;ve used, but not the worst either.  It&#x27;s better than the Healthy Sexy Hair oil, but not near as good as Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> non sticky/ non greasy&lt;br /&gt;silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;good price for quantity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;applied in wet hair and dry hair. Wet hair has more results than dry hair. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT a thermal protector. use something else for thermal protection</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle with a flat iron purchase. After trying it I decided to buy the 4 oz bottle. It does wonders. Leaves the hair silky and light! Very nice. I just thought the price was a bit high for the size of the bottle. But on the other hand, it should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> We tried a sample of this that came with a hair ironing device. My wife absolutely love this product and asked me to order her some which I did. My daughter uses it also and they both plan on continuing to use it. Excellent value!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair. This oil conditions my hair leaving it soft and silky, while protecting it from heat at the same time. A little goes a long way, so try to use it sparingly.  Otherwise your hair will be greasy. I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> HSI argan oil hair treatment is the best hair treatment I ever used. This product instantly make my hair silky, shines and healthy look. It is suitable for all hair types, non-greasy, residue free, non-alcohol, ultra-light, and fit for all hair types.this amazing hair treatment product give constant nourishment for your hair and allow the hair to become incredible shine. This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is very luxurious, has a great fragrance and does what it says: makes my hair managable and shiny.  Very happy with the delivery and service as well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and delivered quickly.  This is a great product that works exactly as described.  Keeps hair shiny and protects against the heat of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different argon oils and this  by far is my favorite! It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too thick, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking. It is a great heat protectant as well! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it love it!  I could tell the difference on my hair when i don&#x27;t use it.  When i do use it my hair feels silky and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> This item works great.  I like that the oil is thick and not runny like most oils.  I will be ordering it again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product works great on hair especially when you are using hot iron. I even use just to tame the frizz after curling.</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde balayage hair and it was sooo dry and brittle until I started using this. My hair feels soft and and fluffy (not greasy and oily). I always use this on damp hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference.  I had no idea what to expect with this product. I purchased to find out about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning to oil based products for hair and face and am loving the results. My hair was over processed and dry. I started using this oil to combat the dryness and as a protectant because I flat iron. I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments on my hair. It&#x27;s no longer dry and there&#x27;s a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy like other oils do. I put it in my wet hair and then dry it. Then when it&#x27;s dry I add a little more to the ends. As long as I don&#x27;t apply it to my roots it never looks greasy.</li>
            <li> This product worked well hydrating my hair and leaving it silky smooth. I have ethnic, curly hair and this was able to do its job.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything about this that wows me. Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong. Not sure. I don&#x27;t like the way my hands feel after using it, so I prefer to use my moisturiser which has heat protection properties.</li>
            <li> Skip the vending machine, carpool, sell drugs (just kidding)--do whatever you need to do to get the money for this product. You will no longer need to buy cheap hair serums, heat protectants, or anti-frizz agents anymore--HSI argan oil will do it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: I ordered the 4 oz bottle on a Sunday with an estimated 3-5 business days to arrive. It arrived on Friday in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: subtle--you would have to press your nose to your hair to smell it, so it&#x27;s not overpowering. However, the scent is not my favorite. I prefer the wonderful salon-y smell of Organix Argan Oil (blue bottle--available for about $3 at shopko in travel size, but greasy in large amounts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Packaging: although it&#x27;s a a high-end product, the oil comes in a boring, 90&#x27;s-esque glass bottle. But this is just a superficial aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy? Not at all, even in large amounts. The oil can be applied all through the hair (no \\&quot;mid-shaft to ends\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat Styling? I used this as a heat protectant before straightening my hair . Before, I had been using Tresemme thermal protections, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great and leaves hair stiff like hairspray. HSI left my hair extremely soft and shiny without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the oil throughout my hair. No frizz!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When unstraightened, my hair is shoulder-length, thick, and poofy. It&#x27;s very time-consuming to style. But I almost don&#x27;t need to straighten it after applying the oil. I feel like my hair is much healthier and silky now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product came in barrels!!</li>
            <li> Really awesome product. A little goes a long away. This is my all-in-one go-to product whether I style my hair or let it dry naturally. This is the second time I ordered it. Really prompt delivery too!</li>
            <li> I have really thick and somewhat curly hair and every time my hair dries after a shower, it feels coarse and dry even though I use coconut and jojoba and skip shampooing every other day. I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out and I straighten my hair just to keep it looking tame and healthy. However, the split ends....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews and seeing this product get 500+reviews with 5 stars, I went for it. And let me tell you. It works.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it before straightening and it softens the hair up right away. And after straightening, it feels naturally straight instead of the burnt frizzy fake straight feeling I usually got. It really does help protect your hair from the heat. Although it&#x27;s not bulletproof, it slows down the damage a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pair this with a ceramic straightener and you&#x27;re golden. I use a pro beauty tools ceramic iron and it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the few idiots who says this doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair, this is just oil. You need to apply heat to straighten your hair. This stuff merely protects your hair and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and works good but I have tried other products that work as well and cost much less</li>
            <li> Love it!! Would buy again. Makes hair look very healthy! Works great as heat protectant!  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> very rich and tame my frizzy hair. I have used many kinds of leave-in conditioner and taming products but this works best.</li>
            <li> Ive read a lot of good reviews about different leave in conditioners and as a result tested plenty as well..While ive been happy with several purchases, i have never been wowed by any...until this!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly well with both a hair dryer or a flat iron. My hair feels light, non greasy, silky and bouncy. The conditioner lends a wonderful sheen and the entire effect lasts for at least 4 days! &#x27;Oil&#x27; is really a misnomer, this is more like a viscous liquid. I have long hair - upto my lower back, yet i need to use just a little of the oil to coat it all. I dont really see the difference until I blow dry or iron my hair..but boy, what a difference that is!! I loved it so much that I got a few bottles for my friends as &#x27;late&#x27; new years gifts :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to grow out my hair.  However due to the rough weather in Boston, my hair strands always dry up and break.  I&#x27;ve read a great deal about argan oil.  I bought HSI because it was an excellent deal for the price and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big plus that I like about HSI Argan oil is that it does not have an oily feel to it!  In fact, it keeps my hair dry and moist without the oily film like other products by the end of the long work day.  I do love the scent of the oil surprisingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two weeks, I noticed my hair regains its strength and shine, and finally it is growing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent price ($15)&lt;br /&gt;-Great scent&lt;br /&gt;-Non-oily texture or feel&lt;br /&gt;-Keep moisture in hair&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely store strength and shine.&lt;br /&gt;-Helps hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Noting that I find yet.</li>
            <li> Over many years, many products and ALOT of money, I have finally found a product that I love!  This product leaves my hair shiny and I can flatiron it straight with minimal flyaways.  It does not feel greasy or give you that look ever.&lt;br /&gt;I have started to go grey (prematurely, i might add!) and my hair is changing consistency to something I don&#x27;t recognize...coarse and curly-ish.  This product calms it all down.  I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I love how this product make&#x27;s my hair feel before and after flat ironing. With really course hair I needed something my hair could absorb and feel healthy. This product does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for years to limit the heat I use on my hair.  Now I don&#x27;t feel that bad about it.  This oil protects my hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> We love this argan oil. I have long, straight hair that&#x27;s just starting to get a little coarse with grays coming in and kiddo is 4 with long, crazy curly, fine hair. I got the HSI Argan oil in a monthly sample subscription, tried it on my hair and hers and it worked beautifully on both. In one use, it made my hair soft, shiny and bouncy and her hair soft, shiny and manageable. It makes combing amazingly easier and our hair looks so much healthier. My husband uses it as a beard softener too. We ordered full size bottles through Amazon and continue to be delighted with the product, now on the third month of consistent use.</li>
            <li> Good value for $. Soaks well into damp hair without making it look greasy when the hair dries. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Protects my hair and leaves it feel silky and soft. Not greasy at all! I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and I love it either way.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of argan oil, and this one is not my favorite. It has a very strong chemical smell, I had to use way too much of it, and it did not make my hair much softer. I highly recommend getting Joico K-Pak color therapy restorative oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, after read its reviews.  2 days after ordered, I received it. Shipping is fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I thought or expected, since I have no idea about 4 Oz. I didn&#x27;t use it every day. Since now, I tried a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;When applying it on my hairs after shower, I put some drops on my palms. It looks greasy and sticky, but actually, it is nature. The hairs are smooth, after used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it might not have functions to make hair softer, reduce losing hairs, and the kind of botter is not easy to use. I think the company can make some improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good stuff and worth to have.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star, because it makes my hair feel soft and shiny.  It is not greasy and I use it almost everyday.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry hair or would like to put life back into their hair.  It smells good and makes my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;I like the oil not sue if I love it.  I would like something that give me a nice gloss all day.&lt;br /&gt;It seems by the end of the day my hair doesn&#x27;t have the gloss that I desire. Not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to, maybe just a protect the hair.</li>
            <li> this Argan Oil is perfect for me. I used it twice a week and it helps to keep my hair incredible shine and soft. it gives your hair very healthy look and actually smell nice too. If you have a flat iron hair straightener, get this oil. you won&#x27;t regret and it makes straighten your hair alot easier and save at least half the time you spend on straighten your hair and much better result. i bought the 4 oz bottle, and with twice a week, i bet it will last for a year. good deal and very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after buying the HSI ceramic straight iron for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves the HSI professional argan oil. She highly recommends the oil for anyone that uses a straight iron.</li>
            <li> really high quality argan oill, but delivered with leak one bottle, I hope it need more tight sealing cap.</li>
            <li> It is the best product. I first tried it when I received a sample along with the HSI straightener. From then, I have been using it regularly. The product is very good. The fragrance is good. It left my hair very smooth, silky and shiny. I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> This has a very pleasant and light fragrance, and the oil adds smoothness to your hair and scalp but is not &amp;#34;greasy&#x27; at all.  I use it every day and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky without weighing it down. It feels healthier with every use.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have long, straight, frizzy, thick hair that I wear straight during the winter and curly during the summer.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of products before and this is hands down the best.  I like to wash my hair three times a week. I have bought this product almost four months ago and its more than half. I had one concern before that the product had arrived open and licking, so they will guaranty 100% satisfaction. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love the way my hair feels!</li>
            <li> Love this Argan Oil! It makes my hair so smooth and works as a great conditioner! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome for my hair and no oily residue with a pleasant smell.  It has tamed my hair frizziness completely and makes my hair looks healthy.  I would high recommend over pure Moroccan Oil (which would weight down my hair and was oily).</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this product I use. I am not sure how to rate it, because it does leaves the hair soft and takes care of the frizz. But I don&#x27;t know if it is just temporary or if its actually helping my hair...</li>
            <li> Love it! Make&#x27;s your hair soft and strong. Smells good too  I would recommend this product to anyone .  Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair so I wanted a nice light weight oil that didn&#x27;t weight my hair down while flat ironing.  This product works beautifully. I also found it helps detangles my hair which is a huge plus as I often have problems with that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I need a good heat protectant due to heat damage and this is an excellent. It has as good silky feeling, that isn&#x27;t greasy or messy. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Argan oil product. It leaves my naturally curly, color treated hair soft and more manageable. My only complaint is the scent. It&#x27;s not offensive, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it pleasant either. I don&#x27;t know quite how to describe it. I don&#x27;t know that really I should call that a complaint...but more of an observation. The scent could be better, but it&#x27;s not horrible. I think Moroccan oil and Agadir Argan oil have a much better scent (to me) but I think I like the end result with the HSI Professional ARGAN oil more than with the other Argan oils. Another observation is it comes in a glass bottle and has a screw on cap. The glass bottle is heavy and cumbersome to me. I would prefer a plastic bottle with a squeeze top so you can better control how much product comes out. I&#x27;m not sure why the product is in a glass bottle. There may be a legitimate reason...such a preservation of the product. I turn the bottle over frequently as I&#x27;m getting ready in the mornings and reaching for other hair products or cosmetics. I&#x27;m afraid that the bottle is going to break one of these days. I also feel like I waste product because I have to pour it into my hand. If there was some type of a dropper or squeeze cap (with a plastic bottle) I think there would be less waste of product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special... Like any other oil that u find in regular drugstores. It didn&#x27;t produce the effect that I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I love this oil formula for my hair it makes it really soft and shiny. Makes it fee incredibly amazing!!</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever used on my hair. Its very light and leaves my hair feeling so soft. Plus it leaves a soft shine on my hair. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Only three things count:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Did the company come through with their product and service with quality and efficiency?&lt;br /&gt;2. Did the product perform as claimed?&lt;br /&gt;3. Did the product give the purchaser a pleasant experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On all three counts, this was a home run:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Blue Novelties shipped the product quickly in a well-packed box, and then did a quality-control follow-up.&lt;br /&gt;2. HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioner leaves my beard silky and eliminates dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;3. My wife loves the fragrance and the look of my beard (there is no price tag on that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the company and the product. Guys, I&#x27;m 59 years old and have had a beard all my adult life. From long experience, I&#x27;m telling you; order this and use it. You&#x27;ll wish you had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> First time buyer.  I was looking for something that combat split ends and keep my hair soft and manageable.  It is not greasy and I how it smells.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very  impress with this product . it does just what it said . My hair is soooo.. silky and soft , it looks so healthy and beautiful .I love the way this product makes my hair feel . yes it is recommended for all types of hair . Unbelievable the results . yes I will be ordering it again .Love it love it ..</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I recently bought the HSI flat iron, and in the box I got a sample of this product. I FELL IN LOVE IMMEDIATELY. It&#x27;s smells good. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy and gross. It&#x27;s light weight and leaves my hair feeling super silky. It helps with the fritz too, being that I do live in the south. I highly recommend this product, ladies.</li>
            <li> Since I used this product, I got compliments on how my hair looks healthier and smell better. Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is Awesome!!! I use a small amount every day on my face and my hair, whether my hair is wet or dry.  It does Not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Have to agree with the other reviews, this oil is amazing!  This is the only product that has ever made my thick Asian hair soft and silky all day. I don&#x27;t flat iron; sometimes blow dry and other times just apply and air dry with same results regardless. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all, absorbs completely into my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent for taming frizz for dry curly hair, transforming to feel soft, and silky, not oily.  Used with non-sulfate shampoo and conditioner immediately after shampoo and between shampoos.  Particularly effective for keeping curly hair soft with daily swimming.</li>
            <li> great product, does what it promises and does not leave your hair with a lot of build up or residue.</li>
            <li> ***I bought this oil after reading the excellent reviews online. It&#x27;s supposed to serve two purposes:  1. give extra shine to hair without weighing it down- which it does :)  2. act as a great heat protectant before using hsi flat iron.- doesn&#x27;t work :(    I followed all the instructions and although I have thick hair that requires more heat to straighten, I never let the temperature go beyond 375F The heat protector did nothing to save my hair. It&#x27;s damaged and has multiple breakage points throughout the hair. I don&#x27;t know how to fix my hair now since there are multiple breakage points throughout the length of the hair (so trimming my hair wont help).  Bottom line- use it only as a product that gives a healthy shine to your hair, and NOT as a heat protectant.    ***UPDATE: I was contacted by the seller and they informed me that the product I received was probably defective since it&#x27;s not supposed to damage my hair. They were nice enough to replace it for free or give full refund. Excellent customer service! :) But I had to pay for the shipping :(</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive this product only to find that it was open and spilled inside the box damaging everything inside the box with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I was going to keep a product that was half empty and not because I used it. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil ONCE This is such a good product! It really makes my hair shiny and not frizzy! IT smells good, and has kind of an oily liquid. But you should only apply a bit on it because its really heavy, and it makes your hair sort of heavy but in a good way, okay that sounds weird.. :D Anyway, my ends, which are usually split and broken (you can see it..) are super soft and look like new!so yeah, its worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a lot. From Bleaching it to deciding to go dark and I use this all in between. WIth the dye, after the dye. Every day. It isnt heavy and the hair soaks it up. I love it. Ordering another bottle!</li>
            <li> As a person with damaged and overprocessed hair I highly recommend this as a leave-in conditioning product and as a heat protectant.  The one downside, and the reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating, is it can leave your hair feeling oily if you use even slightly too much.  It took me about a week to figure out the perfect amount.  I have long, thick, fine hair and a little less than a dime-size amount of this product will keep my hair conditioned and protected for up to three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer unscented products generally and there is a slight scent added to this, but I do not find it to be offensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products to reduce the frizz in my hair but this one works so much better. Does not make it to oily and smell so clean. Will definitely buy this product again. Recommend to anyone with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s friends had nothing but great things to say about this oil.  No matter what size you purchase, you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this product.  My daughter has never been able to flat iron her hair without there being a sort of fried smell behind it.  I finally purchased this item for her and she says for once her hair doesn&#x27;t have that smell!!</li>
            <li> This product itself seemed like many silicone based leave in hair treatments; moraccan oil, etc. I cannot however speak to how well the product performs over time because my bottle came broken... Kudos to Amazon for quickly refunding my account.</li>
            <li> This argon oil treatment is absolutely amazing! My hair has never been so soft before! It makes my hair feel soft and beautiful. I haver very wavy and unruly hair, but this makes it so manageable! It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  I wanted a new style and decided to buy this.  I am extremely happy with this product.  I have only used it twice and am still getting used to it, but it does flatten my hair well.  Not only does it flatten my hair, but when I use the styling product that came with it, my hair is shiny as well.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews on this and decided to order it! My daughter and I both LOVE it! Heats up quickly and straightens beautifully! Comes with a hand glove so that you don&#x27;t get burned but so far we haven&#x27;t even needed it. Can&#x27;t wait to try curliing with it! So far we are extremely satisfied and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for months, both in my hair, as was recommended by my stylist, but I also put a little bit on my face each morning after shaving. It has considerably lessened the redness due to rosacea and serves as a perfect, light, daily moisturizer. The light scent of this product is quite pleasing. My wife bought another brand for herself and the scent of that brand is not nearly so enjoyable nor is the quality even comparable. Great product![[ASIN:B007Q0WW0S HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]]</li>
            <li> This is easily the best straightening iron that I&#x27;ve ever owned. Mine was getting old and I wanted something nicer, so I checked out Amazon&#x27;s selection and was quickly sold on this one. Great price, stellar reviews, and all the features I was looking for, plus some. It arrived right on time and with everything included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to actually straighten it. What sets this iron apart for me is how much better my hair looks and even feels after using it. It&#x27;s much smoother and shinier, and I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel softer. I guess I never realized how much my old iron was drying my hair out. The HSI&#x27;s plates close together completely, too, so it actually catches every hair (without snagging it!), which has made a huge difference in my level of frizzies and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove included is nifty, but I haven&#x27;t had reason to use it. The HSI doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hot to the touch, and the outside of the iron doesn&#x27;t feel hot at all. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever burn myself on my flat iron again. :) The swivel cord is a great touch, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: great product, and great service!</li>
            <li> I received this oil when I bought my flat iron ad I was really surprised at how just a small amount made my hair silky and shiny I really liked it and will probably buy a bottle when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have never been very successful with styling my hair on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until I had my hair cut and I purchased the HSI hair straightener and the HSI Argan Oil.  Since then, using the Argan oil before I begin styling, I have noticed a positive difference in the health of my hair.  My hair is shiny and smooth and easier to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Great product - doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Love it and will keep using it and ordering it off of Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I got the HSI iron and Argan oil. They work great together. The oil somehow leaves my hair perfectly smooth and shiny without making it feel or look greasy. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I left this product in the bathroom and my 25 year old daughter seen it and also tried this product.  We were both very pleased.  Your hair is so soft and smooth!!!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Smooth, not sticky and can last longer. Never try this product before and I&#x27;m so happy with it now.&lt;br /&gt;A must try product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Really make your hair healthy. Be careful though--my first full glass bottle fell an inch onto the floor and shattered.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with majority of the reviewers of this product.  It is really wonderful.  My problem with serums is that my hair would feel flat and dirty by the end of the day.  Not so with this product. My hair is coarse and tends to frizz, but when I put this product on my hair it makes it look smooth and well conditioned.  And you only need to use a few drops to see results.  Since I have used this product the last few weeks I have thrown out all my other hair serums.  I have used this product with both a flat iron and a curling iron and have had excellent results with both.  I hope they don&#x27;t ever change the formula of this oil.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma and feel for this finishing oil. It requires just a drop or two in the palm of your hand to smooth onto almost dry or dry hair for a professional looking shine. I have also used it before using a flat-iron styler, so it works well as a thermal shield. I would recommend this product for its performance as well as the fact that it is bound to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Makes your hair feel super soft.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the first ingredient listed in there is SILICONE</li>
            <li> This was horrible. I ended up just trashing it. It didn&#x27;t work like any other oil I have used on my hair. It made my hair &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and it just kept getting tangled. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair!</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I find if I use too much in my hair, it becomes frizzy. I have to say it has a very silky feel without an oily residue. I have even used it on my face because it works great as a primer for my foundation. Foundation glides on over this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Hydrates my hair and leaves my curls soft.  Protects my hair when I want to straighten it.  Great price, great seller.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It smells amazing and it leaves my hair very soft. I have damaged hair and because of split ends my hair can be very dry. This product helps to prevent that. Even the ends are very soft. Also, it helps with frizz. Even when I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair or treat it with any kind of heat it still helps to eliminate any kind of frizz. Moreover, I think this product really helps to style your hair easier and after blow drying, it literally looks and feels like silk. I recommended argan oil to my family and friends and I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair was dull and frizzy from over processing and was really happy with the result. I was amazed how shiny my hair was and felt instantly healthier. My only problem with the product is that it was a little difficult to apply because it came from a bottle without a pump and it was just a mess trying to apply. I would have given it just 4 stars for that factor but I hear they now have a pump that comes with it and the company is sending me a pump. While its not 100% Argon oil it works really well and is alot cheaper than the 100% Argon oil and works just fine on my hair. So glad they are now including the pump  !!!</li>
            <li> I never tried any sort of leave in hair old before a free sample came with a flat iron I purchased from Amazon. I loved it and have since purchased two bottles of the HSI professional Argan Oil. I have fine hair (although a lot of it), and unlike a lot of products, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I blow dry my hair and then distribute a bit of the the oil on my hair before using the flat iron. My hair is smooth all day and not oily or weighed down. I definitely recommend it as a great product.</li>
            <li> Received this item in very good condition.  It is a gift for my granddaughter and I am sure she will love it.  I will order it again for her.  Thank you for your fast delivery.</li>
            <li> You will really like it.</li>
            <li> The bottle was open when i received it and nothing was in it.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every time after washing my hair. It instantly feels smoother, looks shinier, and overall makes my hair healthier. Definitely use before applying any heat to your hair!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle.  It is an excellent product.  I use it daily to prevent split ends from hairdrying and flat ironing.  I would highly recommend it.  You only use a small amount on hair ends, so a 4 oz bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> This is the best argan oil I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many and spent way too much money.  I&#x27;ll never switch.  If you&#x27;re going to buy the smaller bottle, just spend a little more to get twice as much.  It&#x27;s worth it and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and a little dab of this when she is right out of the shower allows me to comb through her hair without it getting snagged or pulling out.</li>
            <li> WORKED ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S THICK FRIZZIE HAIR, WORKED ON MY SON&#x27;S CURLS (WITHOUT FLATIRON :), WORKED ON MY DRY DAMAGED HAIR EXCELLENT THERMAL PROTECTOR. VERY HAPPY WITH A PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT PROMISES! WILL DEFINITELY RE-ORDER. IF YOUR&#x27;E SITTING ON THE FENCE ON THIS ONE, TAKE THE JUMP - YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY! HAPPY FLAT-IRONING :&gt;</li>
            <li> This is an absolute miracle in a bottle .My hair was very dry , damaged and was breaking off . I have very long hair and was afraid I was gonna have to cut it short.This  completely transformed my hair into silky shiny healthy looking hair in a matter of a week.  I also applied a little at bedtime to the ends which helped to  condition and  prevent further damage. I will definitely be ordering this again .</li>
            <li> A great conditioner that does not leave my hair greasy to the touch.  Absorption is 100% and my hair has definitely benefitted from using this product.  I like to mix it with L&#x27;Oreal Anti Frizz styling cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair!  Thanks for offering this oil.  I plan to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this product with a HSI straightener and me and my three teenage daughters loved it, so I bought a small bottle. It lasted a long time and with wonderful results. It leaves your hair shiny, silky, frizz free and smelling good, all with out making your hair look greasy. I tried another more expensive brand, and it made our hair look greasy and didn&#x27;t smell good. Then I bought another straightener (these are the best that I have found and a great price) and a large bottle. All the of us girls just love this product, and will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have worked initially. But I do not see a big difference in the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> Although it is an oil, this leave in conditioner does not way hair down. After styling, hair is silky smooth. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I just go ahead and say it: PLEASE go and get HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil, my hair after just a week started to look shinier, smoother and healthier. Especially if your hair is very dry, and breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and I use my flat iron on most days.  This helps protect my ends from becoming too frizzy/flyaway.  I use it after I dry my hair - section my hair off as I flat iron so each section gets it&#x27;s own &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the Argan oil before I put the flat iron to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product love it.  This is the only leave-in hair conditioner work really good on my hair.  I will be purchasing again when run out.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make it appear oily.  Argan Oil works through my hair beautifully, leaving it silky smooth without making it oily. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use this right before flat ironing my hair to protect from the heat. It makes my hair silky and calm after. It also smells amazing !</li>
            <li> I was very please with this product and would purchase it again. Very importantly, it is natural and delivers an abundance of moisture to my natural hair. I could apply to wet of dry hair. it is also very pleasant to my very sensitive sense of smell. I only wish that the bottle was bigger. This is easily a five star product.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have very dry freeze hair and it does the job to tame my hair,some reviews are negative,but i would recommend everybody to try it,i was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews but i am glad i listen to the majority of people</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses, my hair does not look like straw on the ends any more.  I also noticed that breakage was nearly gone when flat ironing my hair.  I could hear it break before and had to shake my flat iron over the garbage can to release the hair.  It smells good, doesn&#x27;t need to be washed out, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hands.  I have no negatives to say after one month of use and can&#x27;t imagine any in the future.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Product is good but not the applicator!!</li>
            <li> I mentioned on another review how I love the Arvazallia Argan oil. I liked this one, I would recommend it but if you have greasy hair like me you might want to put just a tiny bit as I found it to be a little less lightweight thant the arvazallia one. Still this one delivered good results and it does hydrate your hair and makes it look shiny.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my hair. After recently bleaching my hair I needed something that was going to keep it from getting dry and frizzy all the time. I put this product in my hair everyday after showering and my hair feels so silky. At first I was skeptical about using an oil as heat protection but this oil worked out fabulous. I no longer have any frizz in my hair after using it. I&#x27;m down to about 1/4 of a bottle (4 oz) after using it approx 3 times weekly for about 5 months now. Best Argan oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have dry, frizzy, damaged hair.  After using HSI Argon oil, my hair is soft and healthy.  When I use my curling iron or flat iron, my hairstyle stays in place all day and is nice and soft.  I highly recommend this product.  Update.  The product is still good.  The package is horrible!!!!!! They have gone plastic.  During shipping the plastic got bent and oil was all over the packaging.  The pump does not work correctly.  You must open the top and poor it into your hand to use.  Hopefully they will bring back the glass bottles with the amazing pumps on them.</li>
            <li> I love the 1st purchase of this product so well, that I purchased another on to keep with me when I travel.....</li>
            <li> Really love this product. A small drop could make my frizzy hair shine and smooth in seconds. Not greasy at all and smells great. Always use it before flat iron to protect the hair. Absorbs well and very durable. Have recommended to many friends.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It works just as promised and leaves my hair super soft. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Wife really loves this product for her hair. leaves hair soft and manageable. Would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> My wavy hair gets frizzy so easily. I love this product! Keeps my hair soft, shiny and wavy, not frizzy!</li>
            <li> May hair was fried after a relaxing treatment and I tried many products in an attempt to bring life back to my hair. A combination of the HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In, the It&#x27;s a 10 products and also the Organix products definitely did the trick!</li>
            <li> This product works great for my thick, sometimes frizzy hair.  Best thing I have tried.  I never let myself run out and have had great luck ordering from amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s realy help me and my sisters i only need small amount , i like to use it after a shower before my hair become dry ( while my hair a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they&#x27;ll  make the bottle more easily to use (it&#x27;s still good)</li>
            <li> Gives a really nice shine to the hair without the greasy feel of oil. Also leaves the hair feeling very soft and manageable. Im so glad I found this. I have had a really bad experience with leave-in conditioners. They either made hair brittle with no shine or hard as cardboard. Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> A gift makes my friend happy</li>
            <li> Great product, not greasy, no overpowering smell. Great finishing or leave in treatment. Works very well for styling or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> i love this product  and i am very happy that i bought this.  This is CHEAP but it has good quality.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different hair serum products and this one worked well.  I have very fine hair so I like a product that is not too heavy but leaves a great shine on my hair. I also liked the fragrance.  While it&#x27;s not as good as Sedu hair serum, it&#x27;s also not the high price.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and after using &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil&amp;#34; for years she now uses this. She says it works just as good if not better then the Moroccan Oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair oily/greasy like the Moroccan Oil did and it is a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Works great leaves hair nice and smooth. U don&#x27;t have to use alot works on both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> I first tried this conditioner when it came along with the flat iron as a sample. Loved it! My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Bought based on the good reviews i read here.! and i really dont regret it!!!! its amazing leaves my  hair soft and pretty</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very pleased with this purchase, will recommend to anyone and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde fine straight hair with an oily scalp.  I have to wash my hair daily or it sticks to my head on Day 2.  I used to use It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and hair spray, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way my hair looked, so I tried this Argan Oil.  I have been using about a nickel sized portion of this product in the palm of my hand and add it to the bottom 4 inches of my hair (I prefer to apply it to my hair dry but you can do it wet) and then style as usual.  My hair feels softer and more manageable now - and if I decide to add curls, the curls last all day without adding hair spray.  Because I don&#x27;t need hair spray, I have been able to go a day in between without washing.  It has a pleasant smell when you apply it, but I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I&#x27;m done styling.  With this product, the straightening iron runs smoothly down the hair and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s damaging anything.  No more fly-aways at the bottom - just smooth, shiny, silky hair that flows.  I am on my second bottle now - the first one lasted about 4 months.  I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Definitely on the oily side but it&#x27;s not over-powering. I bought a similar product from my hair dresser for 3 times the price and I can honestly say this cheaper version does a 100% better job then the one I bought from my hair dresser. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When she ran out of the little sample bottle that came with the hair straightener, she was pretty loud about it. I know this has cut down on the time it takes her to straighten her hair by a ton, easily going from an hour to 5-10 minutes. Highly recommended, for girls, or for guys whose girls may take awhile straightening their hair. :D</li>
            <li> I actually really, really love this Argan Oil.  Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this anymore, because they&#x27;ve hiked up the prices from $15 to almost $25.  That&#x27;s just crazy.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was 100% argan oil, but I guess I bought the wrong item on Amazon. This stuff is full of silicone, which is bad for the environment, and also for your hair. The smell is way too sweet, I feel like I wear a heavy perfume. Wish I could replace this with some natural product.</li>
            <li> My hair was really damaged from bleaching it. This argan oil has helped it immensely. Where my hair was dry and brittle, not it is soft. I really believe it is what repaired my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this argan oil with my flat iron. I have relaxed/natural hair and i have never use oil in my hair. After I was done straightening my hair i put a small bit on my hands and rubbed both my hand together and put it in my hair. It is very lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it builds up in your hair. This makes your hair shiny and soft, your hair will feel so healthy after you put this in your hair, I use it so much and it lasts ages!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I usually use it before the hot iron. It makes my hair soft but not oily. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that do wonders with my unruly and frizzie hair. Highly recommed it. I used it with the HSI styling iron and the result is just a miracle.</li>
            <li> This was a great product. I was happy to purchase it and my sister loved it. It makes your hair shiny without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it, this leave in conditioner did absolutely nothing to my hair. In fact I think it made my frizz worse. I had this product in my cart for a few days and then the price went up by like 6 dollars or so. I still ordered it thinking it must be worth all the hype. Utterly disappointed to say the least. I put some mayo in my hair, that worked far better. Alas my search for a better product continues...</li>
            <li> Great seller , super super fast ! Thank you soo much!!!! I will definitely will be shopping with them. And this product rocks , since I started using it , I&#x27;ve seen a difference. Simply amazing !!!</li>
            <li> This is really a five-star product, but I deducted a star for the questionable ingredients.  I really like the way my hair responds and feels... no other product has given me such good and instantaneous results. However, I just don&#x27;t see what benefit my hair can get from &amp;#34;D&amp;C Red #17&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;D&amp;C Yellow #11.&amp;#34;  As a matter of fact, of the dozen ingredients, I only recognized argan oil and I would be hard pressed to pronounce the majority of the ingredients. Like I said, the product works well, I just hate that all the companies insist on pumping chemicals into us. Thank goodness it&#x27;s made in the United States.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best hair product I have ever purchased. It makes my hair smell great and it straightens much easier than before. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not all that great I thoughr It was gna work better but nope its the same as baby oil might as well use cocoa butter cream</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron oil.  It works as good as the one my stylist uses.  Love it so much.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> The product was well packaged and arrived in good time. It&#x27;s got a nice texture and is very light once on the hair. Also hoping it will do a good job of protecting my hair from heat styling over time.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it so much this is the 2nd big bottle we have bought (had 2 sample bottles before from flat iron purchase). Makes her hair very straight and soft and easy to manage for her.</li>
            <li> It is good and leave my hair silky but I have to style my hair as soon as possible because if I put it and bend my hair it will be like coil hair.&lt;br /&gt;shipment on time.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty pissed when I received this product at first, mostly because I just spent 17 bucks on a tiny bottle, however, after using it I honestly can&#x27;t believe I put up with any other conditioner. I have incredibly thick and dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried every conditioner and nothing seemed to give my hair a soft and gentle texture and prevent it from poofing. You only need a drop and this thing does the trick. My hair is always super soft and I get compliments from others on the smell. This is one of the best purchases I made this year -- super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. If you use just the right amount, no larger than a pea, it works great with a flat iron to leave your hair silky, shiny (not oily-shiny), and looking great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product--after a month my hair is much healthier and smoother. I blow dry and straighten every day and HSI Argan Oil has protected my hair from the major damage and breaks that I used to experience. I&#x27;ve used other Argan oils and this is the perfect consistency for hair--not too oily and not to watery, plus a little goes a long way so the bottle will last me for months</li>
            <li> Argan Oil really keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  I have tried many products over the years and this one seems to be very effective when my hair feels dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I loved it!  My hair is thinning and seems dry, this made it feel thick and silky.... I love it!</li>
            <li> After using this product several times, I am very happy with the silky, soft results that it has given my dry hair.  It has a lovely scent and just a little goes a long way.  Highly recommend - especially for this price!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Not heavy on my hair. Great price.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that leaves the hair smooth and silky. I will be definitely buying this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wanted to give everyone a quick breakdown of what&#x27;s in the bottle.  We&#x27;re not dealing with 100% Argan Oil here, it is a combination treatment with Argan Oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two listed ingredients are Dimethicone Crosspolyme (DC) and Cyclopentasiloxane (CYC).  This combination of chemicals is often used in lotions, sunscreens, and the like -- anything that touts that it can &amp;#34;remove wrinkles in minutes!&amp;#34; likely has this set of chemicals in its ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still maintains the traits of argan oil.  Notably, it has the nutty/ rice-water like smell characteristic of argan oil and comes in a dark colored bottle that is needed to preserve argan oil&#x27;s character.  For me, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with having argan oil listed as the third ingredient.  After all, it is a very difficult to harvest the oil and DC and CYC both help to smooth hair and minimize breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely worked for me: my hair was not weighed down; it had a healthy sheen; my hair became more manageable (and took less time to style); and, my hair feels a bit fuller and moisturized.  As the title notes, when used with a combination of other similar products, the results appeared in days (less than a week).</li>
            <li> Love it! great product! leaves hair feeling great, no greasy feeling. good size bottle will last a long time :)</li>
            <li> Ok ...Although the packaging was a horrible.This product really works on my hair stayed smooth and shiny all day I will definitely buy this oil again.This is probably the best hair product I have ever purchased. This is really a five-star product, but I deducted a star&lt;br /&gt;for packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil, it leaves my hair soft, shiny with NO residue and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> My Hair Type:  Caucasian, fine light brown hair but a lot of it.  Long, almost to my back end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Non greasy/oily&lt;br /&gt;- Does not weigh my hair down&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my hair very soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;- Detangles well&lt;br /&gt;- Eliminates frizz (this has been the best product I have found for this)&lt;br /&gt;- Has a very pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not 100% Argan oil (which may be a con for others, but it&#x27;s fine with me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I have tried one of the highly rated 100% Argan oil products on Amazon and have had much better luck with this one.  The 100% Argan oil made my hair heavier, slightly greasy and did not eliminate frizz half as well as this product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff!  It&#x27;s an excellent bargain for the price as the bottle will last several months (I only use a nickel size amount in my hair as it spreads rather nicely).</li>
            <li> My daughter straightens her hair daily.  This product actually really worked!  Her hair is silky and it has body.  I would buy it again.  The shipping was great.  It arrived on time, packaged well.</li>
            <li> It is not oily at all.. Smell nice.. I use it daily ... Good packaging... I think I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived opened and leaking. Missing 1/4 of oil.</li>
            <li> I love this argon oil. It definitely helped my hair grow so much. Kept it smooth and silky. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I used to have great silky hair. Unfortunately, it was damaged by coloring frequently. It is very dry now. I bought this product after reading the reviews. I am impressed by how quickly it is absorbed by the hair, and it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil and will be a user for life.  I used to use 4 different products to what this one product does.  On top of that it leave my hair silky instead of sticky.  It great as a heat protectant and anti-frizz serum.  A little goes a long way too.  One of the first few times I used too much oil but my hair just soaked it up and it didn&#x27;t appear greasy.  I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive salon products and everything you can thing of.  NOTHING works as well as this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or oily at all, and a few drops really does do the trick!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for all hair types. Used with a flat iron, the hair is smooth and shiny and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this product, i got it last month and already see the benefit on my hair, it has been a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it very often, but it smells good and not sticky on my hair, so, on the whole, I like it!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really soft and manageable. I have hair that reaches down to the small of my back so you can imagine the tangles and knots that I get. After I wash and dry my hair, I pour a dime-sized amount onto my hand, rub to disperse and smooth it into my hair. I run my fingers through my hair to make sure that the Argan oil gets to all the right places. I then pour another dime-sized amount onto my hand and then rub it on the ends. My hair becomes greatly manageable and soft immediately. I love this product</li>
            <li> I ordered HSI straightener which comes with a sample of argan oil leave in conditioner. I loved the smell of it and also makes my hair shiny and smooth, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (other hair products tend to do that). This argan oil hair product definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. i got a small bottle inside with the HSI iron i bought and had to get a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> I had bought Argan oil before and loved it but had paid a huge price. I use it on both my hair and my face and hands and it is so effective that I was willing to pay almost anything. So I was thrilled to find this product at this price and was wondering whether it would be as good as the product I had had before. Absolutely yes and I will be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> I used this almost everyday and it makes my hair so shiny and soft. I love it and bought it for the 5th time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, no greasy residue and makes a significant difference in how soft and shiny my hair is!</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil leave in does not weigh hair down.  Adds softness, sheen, and really feels like it conditions the hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with my HSI flat iron.  Both the iron and the argan oil are amazing! It really works to tame the frizz.  Great seller too!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Helps control my frizzy curls, and protects when I use a straightener. Leaves hair soft. Product smells great.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil Leave-in Conditioner is OK. It&#x27;s no panacea or miracle product but seems to help with shine. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the hefty price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Keeps my hair soft</li>
            <li> Loved the way my hair feels after I use this product!</li>
            <li> Nice light texture, not thick and gooey like others I&#x27;ve tried.  This will be my go- to argon oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am multi-racial and I have curly-frizzy-dry hair. I was looking for a leave-in light oil to use daily and my mom recommended that I buy Argan oil. So, I searched on...and found this product on Amazon. I read the reviews and realized this product was to use before drying or the use of an iron, whereas all I do in the morning is shampoo/condition my hair and let it dry naturally. I never use an iron or a blower for they break my hair. So, I did not know how this oil would look on hair drying naturally and was so happy to see that it gets rid of all the frizzes and keeps my hair moist, soft and perfectly curled all day long and even into the next days.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. But after 3 weeks of use, I have already noticed a change in the texture of my hair. It is fuller, softer and so much healthier looking that it has ever been. I am now getting compliments all the time on how beautiful my hair is. I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for full, better designed, frizz-free, healthier looking curls. The 4Oz bottle will last me one to two months and it is an investment well made, after all the previous products I bought and had to throw away because they did not react well with my hair. For me the search is over! I found my curls&#x27; best friend and I&#x27;m sticking to it!</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged after I took out my senegalese twists, so I started looking for products that would revitalize it and help stem the damage. Since then, HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave in Conditioner has become a staple of my hair regimen. It worked just as well for damaged hair as it does now that my hair is healthy again. (I get soooo many compliments now on how soft and healthy my hair looks!!) It also smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel oily like lots of other AA hair products do. I finger comb it through my hair every other day after using the HSI straightener (I&#x27;m not planning on writing a review for that but the iron doesn&#x27;t break out my hair like previous straighteners have. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the argan oil or the iron but you should try both). I put a bit more of the HSI oil on my ends b/c they&#x27;re prone to breakage. Great product. Love that I get it with free 2 day shipping on prime. This place has a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> HSI Professional sent me a sample of their Argan Oil Leave-In Hair Treatment. As a leader in heat styling products, I had high expectations of their oil leave-in treatment. I tried first on damp hair and then on dry hair. I tried styling flat and leaving wavy. The flat iron seemed to help set in the smoothness, but I can&#x27;t say my hair looked any better than with other argan oil products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One particularly frizzy day, I dampened my hair and added nearly half the bottle (approx 1oz) to my hair and let it sit with a hair cap on while taking a bath for about 30 minutes. I then washed and dried as usual. That did the trick. My hair was smoother, shinier, and softer. I can&#x27;t say it would be worth it for me to spend that kind of money to dump half a bottle in my hair once or twice a month, but it&#x27;s tempting. The overall softness lasted about a week before it was back to the usually craziness.</li>
            <li> This made my daughter&#x27;s curly hair more puffy and very dry looking, she was not pleased at all!! Wasted $$</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my fiancée.  Her are her comments:  I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair for a few years now and as it grew, it started to feel a little dry.  I blow dry it and use a flat iron to straighten it, and I started to see some dryness.  I didn&#x27;t want to go back to having short hair, so I was looking for a different solution.  I had heard of argan oil.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just the latest fad, but I tried it anyway.  I got my first bottle earlier this year.  And I am pleased to say that it has had a dramatic effect on my hair.  I put a tiny amount on my hair before I use the flat iron and it leaves my hair feeling soft and bouncy and healthy.  Plus, it smells great.  I love it!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but is a bit expensive for what you get,  So happy with purchase but will probably look elsewhere in the future</li>
            <li> I really liked this oil! Unfortunately my son decided to dump it down the drain but the company was so nice and after explaining to them what happened, they sent me another bottle, which he ended up like the first bottle thanks to my son... So it was a great product for the 2 weeks I had it. It made my hair very soft, my hair had great shine, and it helped with frizz and since it had thermal protection I didn&#x27;t have to add another product to my hair. It&#x27;s great! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and am constantly curling and flat ironing.  I needed something to help with moisturizing and split ends.  This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used other argan oil products and they tend to make my hair greasy.  I put this on after my hair is washed and it absorbs right in.  The hair just soaks it up.  And, it&#x27;s never oily!  It&#x27;s amazing.  I can even put the oil on my ends close to the scalp.  It never makes my head oily.  I will not be without this product!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but good buy.</li>
            <li> Got this as a sample with my flat iron. Had to buy it. This bottle lasts forever  going on a year and I have hardly made a dent in it. A tiny bit goes a long way. It does just pour out.  I have thought of putting some in its own dropper type bottle so that I don&#x27;t use to much as a tiny bit goes a very long way. It has a light fresh smell.</li>
            <li> My wife has fuzzy hairs. We tried several products, they are either not very effective or with a chemical odor. But this one is the perfect product for her. It protects the iron heat while straightening the hair. It does smoothed her fuzzy hair and  with a pleasant aroma. As advertised, hairs turns to be shinning and silky. I and my wife love it.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, a spray is really useful for evenly spread oil on hairs.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! I have curly hair and it&#x27;s long. I&#x27;ve been growing it out for about 18 months and rarely trim it. I, also, color my hair dark with few highlights monthly at a salon. Of course, this abuse causes damage to my hair. Before using this product if I dared to straighten my hair the ends would look fried. Now, however, I use a little of this HSI Professional product after I wash my hair (not daily) and my hair looks shiny and healthy. If I straighten my hair, my hair feels silky smooth as though I walked out of a salon. If I decide to wear my hair curly, my curls look shiny and without frizz. On the days I do not wash my hair and wear it curly, I scrunch with only a little water and bed head is gone and even prettier curls than the day before appear. My husband says I my hair looks incredibly sexy. After 20 years and 2 kids later that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> my hair feels great after use. makes styling easy and helps to decrease the frizz in my SUPER FRIZZY hair!</li>
            <li> **Updated Review Due to New Packaging** Product is still good yet now is offered in a plastic bottle with NO shrink wrap. Photo shows previous glass bottle and it&#x27;s former boxed/shrink wrapped container next to the new plastic version - new plastic bottle is shipped with no protection to prevent leakage.  The new plastic, unprotected container is VERY POOR. Tampering, product loss, delays in receiving full product because of return - reduces rating. Correct the packaging issue at minimum by adding a shrink wrap on the top of the container to prevent opening &amp; leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most recent order arrived with less than 1/3 of the product inside the plastic bottle, the contents were not even inside the box so where did the product go?&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have:  shoulder length, coarse, thick, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair can be tough to manage and style.  When sleek became the predominant style - I definitely needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum smells nice, is easy to use, and it works.  I have used it for over 6 months now and there&#x27;s not an issue with buildup nor does it make my sensitive skin break out or feel uncomfortable.  When the weather is hot and humid, my hair is much more manageable.  When it rains - I actually CAN have a good hair day!  It does not weigh my hair down nor make it feel greasy or look &amp;#34;product-laden.&amp;#34;  Try it.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised what this conditioner does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for use with Flat Iron:  follow recommendation for applying product after shampoo/conditioner/towel dry; focus on ends; flat iron when hair is almost dry - still slightly damp - for super straight and sleek styles.  You can use a thermal spray with this conditioner if you like without trouble, just use it sparingly as you flat iron and focus on ends.  Try flat ironing thinner sections or layers of hair - use a clip to hold up top layers and release a layer at a time to flat iron if you have extra curly or wavy hair.  When you get to the top layer and want to create a little more body - especially at crown - flat iron close to scalp with a slight twist under and out to ends of hair section.

            <li> I purchased this with my HSI straightner. So far, I am really liking it. My sister-in-law absolutely loves the stuff though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an oil for my hair and bought this product. This smells amazing, and I have already finished a bottle. I have tried some Argan oils from other brand before, but this is the best and my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this HSI Professional Argan Oil (Leave In Condition) to add shine to my hair.  My mom said it does add some shine.  I was hoping it would add a lot of shine, but it only adds a little shine.  If you know of a product that adds a lot of shine to hair please let me know.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this little bottle of miracles. My hair has never been so soft, shiny, and healthy. It was very dry from coloring it and the winter weather before receiving the Argan Oil. I used it once and the next morning it was like I had someone else&#x27;s hair on my head. Very good value for the price. Fantastic product. I love it and I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> I reserve one star in that the product is new to me and I must try it out under stringent circumstances to be sure to respond accurately to those who, like me, depend almost entirely on customer reviews in choosing products online.  I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair and chose this one for its assurances of purity which is indeed truthful and to use to smooth my color treated hair because it&#x27;s frizzy.  Wonderful fragrance, I may have used too much for smoothing hair tho&#x27; as it seemed a bit heavy.  Notably it disappeared into my skin almost instantly, leaving a sense of a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34; if that is the correct term.  I&#x27;m happy to follow up in a few weeks bec the product is fairly priced and of high quality.</li>
            <li> Great product great price thank you</li>
            <li> Love the Argan Oil. My hair is really thick and frizzy, it relieves some if the volume and let&#x27;s me straighten it much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Will definitely make this part of my long term hair care regime.</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder+ length hair and I tip the bottle and put this on 4 fingertips then run my fingers through dry hair, and I&#x27;m all set to flat iron. A little goes a long way. This works very well. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using a different product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! My hair feels so soft and is shiny after using! I am so glad I have finally found something amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this leave in conditioner. I apply it before I flat iron, and it leaves my hair very silky, not greasy, the way it is packaged for shipping needs improvement, but other than that, its a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used several different Argan oils.  The problem is the price. This one however, was a lot less money and a great product.  Nice smell.  Nice texture.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Delivery/shipping was great no problems there. This product leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny, it feels moisturized without the greasy feeling. I am of mixed decent ( African and Indian) I have relaxed hair that I wear mostly straight. I would definitely order again and recommend it anyone.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and smooth, not oily at all.  No more frizz and fly aways when I straighten my naturally curly/wavy hair. Smells good too. I&#x27;ll be using this product a long time. Wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products on my coarse curly hair - but, nothing works as well as this!  I put it on before I flat-iron, and my hair stays straight and silky soft for days!</li>
            <li> I first starting using this product when I got it as a sample with the flat iron and I have not put it down! I have unrelaxed hair and this serum helps to protect my hair while straightening. I have used other top brand serums in the past but this one works best especially when blending my hair with weaves. I am a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT. PERFECT. I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for few months now, my damaged hair, thick asian black hair is now silky and really soft. I really love the scent of this item too. Thanks so much for this great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I came back from the break, my school friend love to brush my hair since I used this product for several months, my hair really gotten silky soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells amazing and leaves my hair silky soft. My hair is quite damaged from having bleach foils for so many years. After using the HSI Argon Oil, I don&#x27;t notice the split ends and fly always like I used to. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different products of all kinds for years - and I mean years.  This has been one of the best products I have used, my hair is fine and I have done highlights, lo-lights, color, etc all at the same time and my hair feels so soft - softer than when I used to just color and use mouse, gel, etc.  Package came in time, perfect condition, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product smells great. The liquid is thick (imagine honey) and it does not take much to serve it&#x27;s purpose. I could tell a difference after using it a few times.I always apply it before I blow dry my hair. It does not leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Light weight oil with an incredible smell. Left my hair feeling soft and silky without any added weight or greasy feeling. My hair is very fine and most oils typically are too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leave your hair shiny and smooth. I will purchase this product again, once I run out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice already and it&#x27;s awesome! Really makes my hair feel soft. I usually apply about a dime size drop (I have thick shoulder-length hair) before blow-drying then again before using a curling/flat iron. It smells great and definitely helps keep my hair soft and I feel it does a great job of protecting my hair from heat styling. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it&#x27;s not greasy. I don&#x27;t know if I can say I love it for my hair, its not giving me the shine and feel I was looking for and it arrived in an opened / damaged box.</li>
            <li> I love this argan leave in oil!  My hair stylist recommended it to me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this product I always look like I&#x27;ve just come from the hair salon.  I constantly get compliments on my hair!  I am amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair before using a flat iron to prevent hair damage. This product smells good and leaves my hair very soft. It does not make my hair look oily otherwise I would have stopped using it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This must be the best hair care product I have bought! I had purchased the HSI flat iron, and it came with a little sample of this leave in treatment. I had been told many times that if I was going to damage my hair by using hair straighteners, my hair would be better off if I used some sort of protection. Of course, I purchased many other thermal protectors, but each were thrown out or donated to someone else after the first of second use. Nevertheless, I went ahead and ordered this, and all I can say is WOW! I love how my hair feels right after I have straightened my hair with it. But the real proof comes in the \\&quot;second day hair\\&quot;, when to my surprise, my hair was just as pretty as the first day, not at all weighed down or oily. All I can add to that is, I even use this when I am going with my natural wavy hair, and that I certainly will be repurchasing this soon (backup).</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for your hair.  A little goes a long way and leaves my hair silky after using my Flat Iron. I love this product and it smells so good too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair oil I have tried. I read all the positive reviews but I was still skeptical. How is it not gonna make my hair look greasy? I was very excited to try it and was hoping that I was not wasting my $25 and it turned out to be my favorite hair product ever. I recommend it to everyone that comments on how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but I also don&#x27;t hate it. Like a lot of oils, you have to be careful not to apply too much or your hair will be sticky and difficult to fix. I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference with my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find a perfect hair product to deal with my hair.  All the products I&#x27;ve used over the years all fell short in some aspect, and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t come across this argan oil sooner.  Usually the day I wash my hair, all bets are off on how frizzy it will be and how well it will style.  But today was the first day I used this product, and I was floored by the results.  Absolutely no frizz, a sleek beautiful shine, and styling it was easier then ever!  This was my first time using this, and i spilled a little to much on my hands and was worried my hair would come out greasy.  Miraculously, this stuff does not make your hair greasy at all!  This review is lacking but I&#x27;m pretty pressed for words.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has yet to find their go to leave in conditioner.  5/5 all the way!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  I absolutely love how my hair feels and smells after using this.  I put it in towel dried (still wet) hair.  It DOES NOT make your hair oily.  I blow dry my hair, so after I am done blow drying my hair looks, feels, and smells ammazing.  Someone had mentioned she does not put it near hair roots fearing it may become oily.  I tried it and my scalp/roots are NOT oily at all.  I noticed that when I DON&#x27;T put it near my roots.. my roots are frizzy, when the rest of my hair is silky smooth.  I don&#x27;t rub it into my scalp.. I just rub some over the top of my head.  One thing I noticed was the after I put some in, my hair sucks it all up (absorbs it) and it feels as if I have not put anything in.  I then apply a second round and that&#x27;s when it feels like I have something in my hair.  I have already recommended this to my sister and mom and some close friends.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING STUFF!!!!! No greasey feel and no buildup; how do they do it?!!! First product ever to leave my hair so soft and bouncy. thanks for having it at such a good price, Amazon!</li>
            <li> If you put aside that fact that its mostly chemicals and not 100% Argan Oil, it actually worked wonders on my hair. I don&#x27;t chemically process my hair (dyes or relaxers) and I was able to apply this, blow dry it out and flat iron it (with one pass through) and my hair looked great. It wasn&#x27;t too heavy and on a pretty humid day, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz up! I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received one 2 ounce bottle of HSI Professional Leave-in Hair Treatment, with Argan Oil to review!  The fragrance is awesome, but after I read the ingredients, I was very disappointed!  Most of the ingredients are chemical based, so I would not recommend the HSI Professional Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Oil, Fragrance, D&amp;C Red # 17, D&amp;C Yellow #11, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not sure why, but the Benzyl Salicylate is listed twice on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPacc3cf636743014757b327807dd3077f\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this leaves my hair feeling and the smell is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMacc3cf636743014757b327807dd3077f\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Incredible stuff.  I&#x27;m trying the shampoo and conditioner now.  I have frizzy hair that dries a little curly.  I use a hair dryer and straightener on it daily.  This stuff is awesome!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product the first time I used it....but afterwards noticed that it did not protect my hair from damage. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! My hair is so soft and not greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> Very useful! I had dried and deeply damaged hair, but it becomes silky and beautiful after using this product!! I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have really stubborn hair for straightening. It does what it wants when it wants to. This is awesome, I find it better than CHI&#x27;s products and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy. I&#x27;ve been using Sally&#x27;s oil products but got sick of the weird texture it gave my hair. Totally love this product. Bought it because a tiny sampler came in my HSI straightener - which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works great for black Americans hair. You will only need to use a very small amount. Product does wear hair done or leave greasy feeling. Product is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail around two months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I usually blow dry my hair after I get out of the shower, which as we all know does some definite damage to your hair and mines already extremely crappy and brittle from multiple bleachings. I got this product because it had so many great reviews and they&#x27;re all completely true, this product makes your hair feel soft and gives it a wonderful shine. their&#x27;s no doubt that I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and smells amazinggggg. I have curly hair and use it even when I&#x27;m not straightening my hair. The instructions say a drop or two. I tend to use a good bit more, like swish it on my palm twice.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for my fine, processed hair. Gives it a healthy shine and appears to protect&lt;br /&gt;from the flat iron.  Wish the bottle had come with a dropper - had to transfer to another bottle&lt;br /&gt;with a dropper for easier access as one only needs to use a few drops</li>
            <li> After a long search for a product that really conditions and protects hair, I came upon this one.  I tried it based on reviews and I love it just like everyone else!  It really is amazing.  My hair looks shinier and healthier.  My hair tends to be very curly, especially in the back; and while the oil doesn&#x27;t give me perfectly straight hair (nothing will do that!) it does make it much smoother and easier to work with.  The best effect I&#x27;ve noticed is that a bothersome cowlick which causes a part at the crown is kept much more under control!  I will definitely keep ordering this product!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderfully!!! And it makes a difference in my hair. I recommend it to all my sisters and they also love it!</li>
            <li> it is a great product for my hair. look shine and healthy and not oily and no frizz.definitively i recommend</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does build up quickly so if you have fine hair as I do, you&#x27;ll notice that it needs to be washed a day earlier than I usually do.  All in all, I do recommend it. Plus, it&#x27;s a very fair price!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  A little goes a long way.  Does great for split ends and it keeps my hair moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking a dot worth. The first time I used like a dime size (I have fine hair down my to the middle of my back) and my hair looked greasy. If I use less it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like the good smell,  but I haven&#x27;t seen different in my hair</li>
            <li> Ok, so I read a ton of the reviews for this stuff and obviously it sounded like liquid gold or something. I have naturally curlly hair (that I hate) so I blow dry and flatiron every other day, so I really need a good protectant if I don&#x27;t want my hair to look like a total fuzz ball. I&#x27;ve used lots of other argan oils, protectants, sprays, serums, you name it. Verdict: This stuff is good. Really good. It smells wonderful, and make my hair so smooth. Now lets talk about the shine. It makes my hair super shiny. Enough said, right? Its good stuff. Buy it. Now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: I don&#x27;t particularly like that you just pour a bit into your hand. Wish there was some sort of nozzle/regulator/doohickey on the top.</li>
            <li> I love this. It smells so good. I use a little bit before I blow dry my hair. It makes my long hair feel soft and shiny. It lasts forever since all you need is a little.</li>
            <li> This is the sole product I use on my hair to make it sleek, shiny, and incredibly healthy looking.  I get compliments all the time about how great my hair looks, and it&#x27;s all thanks to this argan oil!</li>
            <li> I have tried several Oils for my hair and by far this is the best. I love the smell and it does not make my hair look greasy and I use about 2 teaspoons on my hair. I don&#x27;t usually flat iron my hair because I have so much hair and not enough time, but I do using a curling iron and this is really helping.</li>
            <li> i blow dry and flat iron my hair and i bought this stuff. my hair is like straw - it did not help at all. It smells good but doesn&#x27;t do anything, I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil was shipped quickly and wrapped correctly so there was no issue with leakage.  This product is amazing!  It leaves my long, think hair feeling amazingly soft.  I use it on damp hair before blow drying and straightening.  I only wash my hair every other day and it works amazing.  If you use a small amount as recommended, it is plenty to go around and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or make your hair feel sticky or weighed down.  I have very long and thick curly hair and it only takes a few drops for all of that.  I will buy this product from now on.  Oh, and the smell is wonderful and very subtle.</li>
            <li> I got a small free sample when I purchased my straighter, from Amazon. Looked at Ulta and was NOT about to spend the amount on a larger bottle. Came home and found it in Amazon and it was a Prime item, two day shipping… DONE AND DONE! I use this a lot! I have CRAZY thick dark brown wavy hair and it makes my hair smooth and nice. It doesn’t take a lot btw. Sometimes I use a little on my wet hair, then sleep, then use a tad in the morning while straightening my hair. If you use to much it can make your hair look greasy! So, use a little at a time!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have used for many years. Made my hair more manageable. Just love it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is magical on my thick coarse dry highlighted hair. I put it in my damp hair, and then blow dry. I sometimes add a tiny bit when it is dry but not too much. love this!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like at all; not much argan oil in this product.</li>
            <li> The best thing I have ever found for multi-purpose use for conditioner, frizz retardant,setting assistance.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and easy to manage. Does not add weight or oiliness.</li>
            <li> I use only this after I shampoo and condition and towel dry my hair.  My hair is fine and shoulder length, also is colored.  I use about a nickel sized drop and work through with my hands.  After blow drying it leaves my hair really silky soft, then after I flat iron, it is even softer.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of products to try to get soft hair but it either made it sticky or greasy.  I will buy this again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  I have thick dry hair and I have to apply a tiny amount otherwise it leaves a greasy film.  It does help with frizz and control</li>
            <li> This is my second order I love it</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought this&lt;br /&gt;Second time half of it has leaked out&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> This is a life changer for your hair. I tried this to curb the frizzyness in my hair and it works wonderfully. I love it and have bought it for my mom and friends.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this stuff! I got a sample of this with my HSI straightener, tried it once and ordered. I&#x27;ve used various oils (coconut, olive, moroccan etc.) but this is the BEST. My hair is color treated, long (past the bra strap) and thick and a very small dime-sized amount distributes easily and evenly through my hair and the end result is not oily-looking or feeling, just soft and protected!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It kept my hair shiny and smooth.  No frizz after blow drying my hair and it stayed that way all day.</li>
            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; argon oil, but it is the closest thing to it without spending a lot more.  I had done some damage to my hair when coloring the last time, and this really helped to get my hair back in shape.  It does not leave my feeling oily or greasy and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love how it helps me with my hair.  It leaves it soft and manageable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product. The packaging was pretty beat up when I received it. The lid was loose and I&#x27;m glad I got it when I did, as it would have gone everywhere I&#x27;m sure. I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because I&#x27;m rating the product and not the shipping.</li>
            <li> WOW! this stuff is wonderful.  I have long hair and live in a cold dry climate.  This product makes my hair feel soft and silky.  I had no idea how rough my hair felt until I used this product.  Do yourself a favor and buy this product.  I really really love it!</li>
            <li> got this for my girlfriend she seems to really like it so im happy what else to say great product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. absolutely love this. not oily but do its job perfectly. I would buy again and recommend it if your hair gets puffy after dry.  also smells very good</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for a while now, about 2 years and it&#x27;s a wonderful product for my hair. I have tried the cheaper drugstore brands and they don&#x27;t work as well as the professional ones I get at my hairdresser&#x27;s salon. Those are expensive though but I&#x27;ve been willing to pay the price since there&#x27;s a big difference in quality and results. Then I went shopping for the usual brand since my last bottle was almost gone. They were completely out of the product and it would take about 3 weeks to re stock. So I thought I&#x27;d take a look in Amazon and I found the reviews about this product. I know many reviews say it&#x27;s expensive but truly, professional products are much more expensive. I was paying 75 dollars a bottle exactly this size. HSI is even better than the product I was paying so much for, thicker and it leaves my hair shinning and freeze free. I have switched brands for good!</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this now for almost 2 years and I love it! I put just a little in my hands, warm it up and run all through my wet/damp hair. I let it set for a little bit before I blow dry and it makes my hair very soft, and also keeps it protected. I go 1-2 years between hair cuts and every time, my hair dresser tells me how great the ends of my hair look, and its because of this HSI product!! I definitely got better, the more i used it. At first I hated it, now I use it every single day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thin, fine hair that tangles VERY easily. I dont do my hair much ie: blow drying, straightening ect, because my hair is so delicate i avoid any potential damage. I bought this based on all the amazing reviews and Its ok from my few days of trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1. I used it on my daughters hair whos is just like mine, very fine. It was a little oily at first but then was fine, her hair seemed no different after it had dried. So I thought i&#x27;d try mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2. I used it on my dry hair, just a little bit and didnt seem to notice much of a difference, if anything it made my hair slightly frizzy and I did not liek that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3. I used it on my wet hair, blow dried it and it looked less frizzy than when i blow dry with no product, and a little more shiny. So I was impressed with that. I then went on to straight my hair and thats when I noticed a difference. It definitely made my hair more shiny and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it DOES work...if you are styling your hair. I was looking for something that I could just put in my hair and notice the difference but from what I gather, heat seems to active this. I could be wrong but thats how it appeared with my hair. I&#x27;ll try it a few more times but if I can&#x27;t get it to work without heat, i&#x27;ll probably just send it back.</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t write reviews recently but had to on this one.  I have the most wavy unruly hair.  I also live in Florida and the humidity is awful.  My gets frizzy easily even after straightening.  I really thought I was just going to have to live with it my whole life until i came upon this product.  I first bought the HSI straightener about a year ago and they had sent a sample of this Argan Oil leave in conditioner.  I put it away and forgot about it until i came back across it a few weeks ago and started to use it.  I immediately noticed an amazing difference..super soft, less frizz, hair stayed straight.  I thought maybe it was a fluke but continued to use it.  This product works wonders.  Highly recommend.  If it can cure my hair it can definitely yours!!</li>
            <li> After Years of searching for something to tame my hair, I finally found it!  This product is fantastic. I have an odd combination of hair/texture - it&#x27;s incredibly think, yet the strands are fairly fine.  My hair grows out (bushy), not in length though. So, by the time I&#x27;m due for a trim every 6-8 weeks, I end up losing whatever miniscule amount of length I accumulate due to damage from flat-irons, blow drying, etc.  Only people with my texture of hair will understand the problems we face.  My hair has to be washed daily due to the product I use to tame it (oil, leave in conditioner, conditioner, hairspray). It takes me about 30-45 minutes per day just to style my hair. I&#x27;ve often thought about just buying wigs to avoid the sheer hassle of it all!  I have to tell you that this product is miraculous!  I purchased the spray with argan oil along with this leave-in oil, and I use them both daily.  The other reviewers were right - they smell really good.  I straighten my hair in sections and work a small amount of oil in first.  The oil is both a protectant and a styling product.  The first day I used it, one of my friends noticed immediately and told me my hair looked so shiny and soft. My hair used to turn somewhat frizzy after a couple of hours out in the elements, but now it stays smooth.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and I highly recommend this purchase; you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I like it at first. However, the more I use it, the more I am getting sick of the smell. I rather this product doesn&#x27;t come with scent</li>
            <li> Where has this stuff been all my life? I have wavy/frizzy highlighted hair. I thought I would have to wear shoulder-length hair the rest of my life because of frayed ends, but this conditioner keeps my ends at bay and my hair looks so healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s arrived half way full and oil all over the box.</li>
            <li> This is the best, I swear to God I&#x27;ve never tried something as amazing as this to my hair in my life EVER, No frizzes, smooth hair, light shine, just everything good you want your hair to be this product will make it for you</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling all the while protecting it from heat damage. Good size bottle that will last me a long time because with argan oil a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!!  Has made a world of difference in my frizzy hair!!! So glad I found it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I will be buying it again. It leaves my hair feeling sooooo soft and shiny! And it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy! Love love it!</li>
            <li> The straightener works well, but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price.  It is comparable to every other straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, but not exceptional, which is what I was hoping from the description.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!I was use it all the time when i straighten my hair with my flat iron and it makes my hair so smooth and silky allday!!!I would really recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the HSI Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and works well to keep my fine hair from turning into a frizzy mess using the iron to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this system.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she claims it is amazing. She had fine blonde hair and she says she can use it as much as she wants and since it is a dry oil, it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look oily and heavy. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  She&#x27;s tried other products, but says that just a tiny bit of this is amazing.  We will buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s amazing. Seller was fast &amp; the price &amp; size is excellent!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have fine and thin hair and when I used this product it helps keep my hair bouncy..I can use it when my hair is damp and when it is dry either way it does a fantastic job. It&#x27;s definently worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this Argan Oil treatment after I received the HSI Professional Flat Iron as a Christmas Gift. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product. It leaves your hair feeling smooth and soft and fly away free. It&#x27;s a great price, and will last a very long time! I will definitely be ordering this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my hair very manageable and more importantly it doesn&#x27;t weight it down but gives it a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product since it makes her hair soft and nice, and I have ordered it twice so far. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, and is a very generous amount for the price. It makes my hair silky and shiny! Love it!</li>
            <li> this makes my hair extremely soft...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me tell you...my hair is not manageable.... i have thick course hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i use my Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Shampoo and Conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;and then i put HSI after, then i blowdry and straighten....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair looks like I came from a salon... very shiny, soft and manageable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i buy this all the time</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I have never had anything like it not even close. Smells great lite on your hair nice natural shine. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but when I got it the top wasn&#x27;t on correctly and the bottle leaked out</li>
            <li> I love this oil! My hair looks great and shiny after using it and I LOVE the smell :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING results!  I hope they never stop making this product!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!!! If you see it for $24.99, don&#x27;t buy it... The price constantly fluctuates to $14.99 and back up. Let it sit in your cart a few days and check on it a few times.. When you see it drop, SNAG IT UP ASAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST HAIR OIL EVERRRR! I have pretty damaged hair due to years of neglect and tying it up wet... This makes it look so smooth and healthy and it SMELLS SO GOOD!! Great product!!! Highly recommended!! :)</li>
            <li> This product is magnificent.  It really does leave your hair soft and silky.  I place a small amount on my hair after I shower every night. When I wake up in the morning,  my hair is nice and soft. Definitely recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft and shiny. All my friends enjoy this product and want it.  It gives you a good amount of product. I will definitely buy again! (:</li>
            <li> I hesitated writing a review for this product until I had used it for several weeks. I use it in conjunction with the HSI straightening iron. After giving both these products a fair amount of testing time, I can honestly say that they are amazing! I have long, very thick unruly hour (wavy and several cowlicks) and after applying the oil and using the iron, my hair is smooth, straight, shiny and flowing. I was concerned that the condition of my hair would deteriorate but it&#x27;s just the opposite. My hair has never looked so good. I wish I had discovered this a long time ago! I really appreciate this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Obviously this item has little more financial punch than others but the quality surpasses any other I have tried. I have coarse, curly hair and this product smooths and defrizzes my hair, while protecting from the flat iron as well. I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and is definitely recommended with flat iron use.  The scent is mild, and any leftover oil quickly absorbs in my alreay dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair and when I wash it... it gets so poofy and gross. My ends are dry and break off so easy...&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I got a free sample with a flat iron and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After every time I wash my hair... once my hair is 90% dry I go through all of my hair and put this oil on my ends only. I cover an inch or maybe 2 inches of the bottom of my hair in this oil and by the second day my hair looks gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this stuff is awesome to use as directed when flat ironing, but I have fine hair and usually when I put this stuff all over, I have to wash my hair the next day. If I just use the ends, and don&#x27;t even flat iron... my hair look beautiful.. my ends look and FEEL very happy and soft. I have not been having as much breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problems with split ends, get a trim and use this stuff religiously and you will not get no where near as much! I have the worst hair ever... and this stuff has literally made me so happy. I use moroccan oil too... but that usually is a little more greasy looking on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do put this on your ends like I do... be generous but not sloppy. do a pea size, rub it in your hands a very little bit and twist your ends or just rub it in. when your hands feel dry.. add more and move on to the untouched hair. keep doing that until you&#x27;ve covered your hair. Might look a little weird at first but when it dries it will be fine... and especially the second day!!! careful not to cover all of your hair or you might end up needing to wash it sooner than you&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. It works well without making your hair oily,  I use it before and after I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the product it makes my hair very soft. I can feel the oil making a difference and it makes my hair shiney.</li>
            <li> To be honest after adding this into my hair regimen I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks with no results :/</li>
            <li> I have pretty &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; hair that likes to do everything except settle down and look nice.  Tried so many conditioners over the years.  Some were ok.  The problem is they didn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my hair smooth and friz free.  Noticed the Argan Oil was rated highly on Amazon, so I took the leap and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I rubbed this in my hair I used too much - hair was almost saturated with oil.  It felt a little yuckie.  Lesson learned.  I&#x27;m amazed how little you need.  Hair is smooth and soft for days.  It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; I use now.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works really well, and makes my hair really smooth, and works great with my flat iron, to keep from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a Flat Iron to straighten my hair.  This product makes my hair look shiny and manageable.  No damage whatsoever.  Great service from this seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review of this Argan Oil for a while. I originally received this as a sample when I bought an HSI hair straightener (also an excellent product). I have purchased 2 bottles of the argan oil since and have been extremely happy with the product &amp; results. The only bad thing about it is the glass bottle-- I recently dropped a brand new bottle on my tile bathroom floor causing the bottle to shatter and the precious oil to spill all over the place. Time to reorder, I guess!</li>
            <li> im a hairstylist, i use this on all clients for blowouts, flatironing, and for maintaing my hairweave, this oil is light yet penetrating.exceptional product, good seller.:)</li>
            <li> Actually, I always forget to apply it on my hair before using the flat iron. But I really like the smell. It makes me feel that I&#x27;v just come out a professional salon.</li>
            <li> I first tried HSI Professional Argan Oil when my stylist gave me a sample bottle.  It was immediately something I knew I could not live without. I have never had such control over my thick, coarse, wavy hair and styling has never been so easy. A little drop helps to transform my hair into soft, straighter styles and also allows me to get bouncey curls with lots of body.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of the better hair oils I&#x27;ve tried.  Does soften hair somewhat and doesn&#x27;t make hair look greasy.  Great value too at this price point :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product, light and not greasy, hair is shine.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is a little bit too strong smell, but it goes away in a little bit, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Love this Argan oil so much. Got the tiny sample when I ordered the HSI flat iron. I can&#x27;t tell you how much work it takes out of blow drying your hair. I have a lot of hair, but it is on the fine side. I shampoo, condition, while hair is wet I apply a very small dime size amount of the oil, Blow dry, then you can use your flat iron. Another added bonus is this HSI ARGAN OIL SMELLS WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> I have done everything to my hair to damage it and almost everything to fix it. This stuff has been really helping. I use it before straightening but I also just use it on my dry hair almost every day. This along with coconut oil are slowly starting to improve my damaged locks.</li>
            <li> i found out about argan oil on amazon!  this will make your hair look &amp; smell great!  i have thick hair &amp; love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Gave my hair volume and shine</li>
            <li> I use this oil with and without HSI flat iron, in both cases it is great, it smells fantastic and softens hair, I really recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> i tried a few drops, I tried more than a few drops, and saw no affect whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t get why people like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Realistically, you can purchase argan at many stores but HSI seemed to leave my hair much more smooth than the other products.  Bonus, it has a beautiful scent, fresh, as though just leaving a salon.</li>
            <li> it is very smoothy after use this hair oil and dry the hair! make the hair not dry any more, very useful production, very recommend it to you all!</li>
            <li> provides shine without the oily, sticky feel.  Will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Argan oils for the hair and the leave the hair too greasy.  This product leaves your hair smooth with just the right amount of shine with no greasy feel.  4oz bottle lasts a long time because you only need a quarter size amount and my hair is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Really like this and the smell is great!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. would like to buy more and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> got here very fast. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times, I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling in my hair</li>
            <li> Really good stuff! Left hair very soft, not oily</li>
            <li> This is a super heavy oil.  I have really thick long hair.  One dime-sized amount, starting on the ends of my hair and working through is plenty.  A little goes a long way.  I also use it on my hair at night before bed and wash it out in the morning, which also helps keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> A thermal protector and a ceramic flat iron was recommended by my hair dresser to minimize the damage to my hair.  This product is very easy to use and results are as described; silky and shiny hair.  It smells pleasant and does not leave your hair looking  oily. I did purchase ther ceramic flat iron and discarded my old one.  I definitely have noticed a much smoother and less frizzir hair texture with the recommended combination.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, it&#x27;s made a 100% difference in the looks of my hair and softness. My friend at work noticed and i told her my new secret... she immediately got this and now we are both really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing, I can&#x27;t seem to get the amount right every time... some days its still a bit fly away or frizzy, others I think it looks like the models hair on the runway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly buy this oil again. I put a pea size in my palm and rub it in when my hair is damp... that seems to work, and then I actually use a Remington flat iron, just on about 310 degrees and use it as little as possible. It works a charm... (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have the HSI flat iron as a back up, I don&#x27;t like it as much as my Wal-Mart Remington which has a much wider blade and I can control the temp easier, so as not to burn my hair...[[ASIN:B007Q0WW0S HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]]</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry ends immediately.</li>
            <li> Ordered product for my wife...it arrived quickly and in good condition.  My wife began using it the same evening and she is pleased.  I&#x27;ll likely order again when she runs low.  We recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The argon oil is thick in texture, but it is super light once you smooth it into your hair. It didn&#x27;t give me an oily feel that i was worried about (i hate when my hair is too oily), instead it just looks extremely healthy and has a natural shine, not a greasy shine. It smells good, not overpowering. I&#x27;d just recommend being a little more generous with how much you use if you have african american hair like me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy shoulder length hair that tends towards frizziness.  It&#x27;s been colored and highlighted, and frankly, after this summer, was really unmanagable.  The ends felt like straw, no matter how much I conditioned them, and my hair floated around my face.  I wore a lot of buns. I read the reviews for this product and decided to try it.  I washed my hair, conditioned, and then towel dried.  I put a dime sized amount of oil, which is thicker than, say, olive oil, on the palm of my hand, gathered my hair into a pony, and massaged it in.  I used the excess on my scalp.  I then blew it dry.  I normally just let my hair air dry, but I think you need the heat to help it absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Success!  It is really soft now, full but not flyaway, and very shiny. It did not straighten my hair, just took out the frizz.  The ends were still a little dry, so I applied a touch more with my fingertips where things felt crispy.  It lasted for three days, which is how long I go between shampoos normally, so it wasn&#x27;t adding oil to my scalp. I did end up using more oil every day just on the ends.  If you have fine, damaged hair, give it a try....</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair conditioner ever! My hair is so soft and silky! This will be part of my beauty routine from now on. I recommend this to everybody! I would love to try some of their other products. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff. I don&#x27;t know why the prices went up from 14 to almost 20. That part sucks but the product itself is still amazing.</li>
            <li> Was using it on hair after shower.  Wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  My hair was a bit frizzy and dry by the afternoon.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used it with a flat iron that it seems to be hydrating my hair.  Not sure if I like it.  Going to use it, but might end up staying with EVANYC Hungry Hair oil or Makesh oil.</li>
            <li> Holy grail of hair oil - and I&#x27;ve tried them all. ALL! This leaves my over-processed, hopeless hair so silky and manageable. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I was happy with a product!</li>
            <li> This does NOT work as a hair treatment for me.  I used a pea sized amount, and then my hair took FOREVER to air dry... &amp; felt gross and heavy.  Back to Moroccan Oil!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve used others and this is exceptional. I put it on my wet hair and when my hair drys it&#x27;s silky soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  It does help with keeping my hair from getting frizzy.  It did not have any miracle effect on it though.</li>
            <li> Good product but not as great that I had hoped it would be.  It has a really nice scent to it though and is not oily like some of the other serums.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using it for a few weeks and have seen less breakage in my hair and my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair is naturally curly, and even when I straighten it it always seems to have flyways and sometimes looks kinda ratty...I put a little of this stuff in after I straighten it, and it immediately smooths it down and makes my hair look and feel so soft! Plus I only need to use a little, and the bottle is hardly gone at all! I will DEF be purchasing this again when I need to!</li>
            <li> prompt shipment, first time I&#x27;ve used argan oil.  I use it on semi-damp hair before I blow dry.  Leaves hair soft, not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Argan Oil on a whim. I had tried a few other argan oils before but they were much pricier. I was very impressed with the quality of oil I received at the price! It performs just as well as the other more expensive oils I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil leaves my hair feeling soft and very manageable. I use it to help tame frizziness and manage fly aways. This doesnt make my hair greasy or oily, just gives it a healthy shine. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I have fine hair and this does not weigh it down or make it look oily. It leaves my hair very shiny and soft. The only thing I have noticed is my hair has a lot of static since I started using this. If you have a central humidity system that may not be a problem. I like this a lot so I&#x27;m going to try using another product with it to eliminate the static. It&#x27;s much like Exquisite Oil by Biolage.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was so glad that I purchased this. I have some nasty kinky curly hair and use a flat iron on my hair to keep it so I do not look like bozo the clown. I have been using this for nearly a month now and love the smell and how it makes my hair feel soft and not fried after using the flat iron. I will purchase again as soon as I am low.</li>
            <li> This product saved my hair! I have healthy but dry hair with some gray so it gets a little curly. After blow-drying I just add a dime-sized amount to my hair and comb thru to get all areas. I either leave natural or use the hair straightener. It&#x27;s ok to use between washings too- just use less.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles. My hair feels rejuvenated after applying this.  Plus I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have used Argan oil in my hair for years and love this brand. It keeps my hair protected from the heat of my flat iron and also keeps my hair from being frizzy. I would recommend HSI Argan oil to anyone that uses a flat iron or just needs to keep their hair from frizzing if it&#x27;s curly.</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this product. It is amazing and makes my hair smell and feel luxurious. I will never go with out again. I am completely in love. I cant stop touching and smelling my own hair. Amazing is the only word I can use describe this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I used to be in love with biosilk but this argon oil product has blown it out of the water! It mends dry split ends and makes hair extremely soft and shiny! A very tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My life loves this stuff. She travels to Hong Kong every week and insists on bring this with her during all her travels to keep her hair moisturizered.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It leaves my wavy hair soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve tried many conditioning products for my naturally curly/wavy hair. I usually ended up with FRIZZY/curly/wavy/ hair. Not any more. This product is the first to actually tame my frizz. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Use small amount or hair may feel oily.  and I have very thick/long hair.  I gave it 4 starts - mainly because I think they could have designed the bottle better w/a dispenser or pump.</li>
            <li> When i recieved my package i was so excited but when i opened the box containing this oil it was leaking. The cap wasnt screwed on all the way and i lost a quarter of my argan oil. I really wanted to try this out so i just kept it instead of sending it back and getting a new bottle. I do have to say it works great and doesnt make your hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have curly, and frizzy hair that I wear straight. I&#x27;ve used a lot of products before and this is hands down the best. When I straighten my hair I like to wash my hair every 3 days. I don&#x27;t have greasy hair naturally, so I can easily go a week between washes when straightening. Plus, it&#x27;s better for your hair. Many products do not allow this because they make my hair greasy, and to top it off, I wouldn&#x27;t notice a deference in straightening time. If it takes me the same amount of time to straighten my hair with a product as it does without the product, and I have to wash my hair more with it, then it&#x27;s no good. Also, products claiming to last a week with straight  hair with washes are pointless for me since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair but once a week without any product. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy even after a couple days of using the product. Straightening my hair has cut in half. I take a shower, blow dry and straighten and it takes about 35-40 mins. It kept my hair straight and no frizz. Just a little goes a very long way. Ive used it a couple times now and barely even made a dent in the bottle.  It also works great on leaving on your hair even if you don&#x27;t straighten it. I put it on my hair and blow dried my hair and my daughter needed me and I went to check on her. After about an hour of me playing with my daughter I came back to straighten my hair. I was surprised that my hair had beautiful curl&#x27;s with no frizz. Such a great product!!! I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> When I used this, it really made my hair feel softer. However, I don&#x27;t feel that this has long lasting results. You very a lot of product for the price, unfortunately, the bottle is glass and I ended up bumping into it and it shattered everywhere. Very sad about that. I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase. I will try something else.</li>
            <li> weird... the sample aragan oil I got from HSI when I purchased my hair straighter feels completely different then this Aragan oil I purchased.  Not cool HSI &amp; BTW... a lot of the reviews looks fake!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! leaves my hair so soft and silky!!!!</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil leaves my hair feeling so good and it does wonders for my scalp, which promote growth of my hair, leaving it silky and shiny. I will keep using this product! Purchased from Amazon saved a trip to the store and cost less, most important, Satisfaction or money back, Win,win situation.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. It was less expensive than similar products, and it works very well. Makes hair very silky and shiny (and I have very wavy hair). I recommend!</li>
            <li> A free sample of this came with the HSI straightener I purchased for my girlfriend. She tried it with her first use of the straightener, and was instantly in love. As someone whose hair was very damaged due to multiple dyes, she is always looking for a boost to help it out. After using this product and the HSI straightener, her hair already felt better! After several uses it was almost as if she&#x27;d never dyed it! I will gladly purchase more of this, as it seemed to help way more than other, more expensive options!</li>
            <li> this product works wonders on my hair. My hair is extremely thick and hard to straighten, however with thisoil and the HSI straightener, what used to take me at least an hour on a good day now takes about 25 minutes and my hair is nice and smooth!!! I would recommend this product to anyone with any hair type.</li>
            <li> HIS Argan Oil is an excellent product, leave my hair shiny, silky and very manageable . I am very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> This oil was mediocre. I liked how it worked immediately after I put it on; however, after a few hours it seemed as if I never even put it on. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a long-term difference in the moisture or shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a leave in conditioner, and it has worked beautifully! No more tears while brushing her hair. :-) I also started using it on my own hair after I had Japanese hair straightening (my hair was damaged), and I love how light weight it is, and how it makes my hair shiny. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product and definitely would recommend to anyone looking for soft hair. I just add a little to my ends after my shower  and I&#x27;m ready for the day. I have naturally curly hair and I swear it make my curls even more defined and frizz free. Its also great to use when I straighten my hair makes it feel soft and silky. Plus it smell great!</li>
            <li> I received a trial bottle with the purchase of a new flat iron.  While I have a lot of hair, it is fine with a lot of waves and curls.  Prior to using Argan Oil I used hair serum as part of the daily ritual of straightening my hair.  After using Argan Oil I am sold on this product!  I blow dry my hair, rub a small (dime size) amount through it and then use the flat iron.  My hair is smooth and shiny without being weighed down or looking greasy. A little goes a long way ... and it will leave your hair looking great!</li>
            <li> Happy with the product but created slight flakes on use.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My sister in law recommended this product to my wife. Both are Vietnamese with hair that can be unmanageable at times. My wife has to often use a flat iron on her hair to get the slight wave out of her hair. Since using the leave in conditioner her hair has been much more manageable with less time invested using her flat iron. Overall she has been thrilled with the product, with her only wish being that she found it sooner.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and shines when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it absolutely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my 10 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and it stays shimmering all day long. I normally apply it after a shower as her hair gets dry (I suppose because of the length) and this product fixes the problem right away. Honestly don&#x27;t need much either; usually a dime-sized amount is all it takes and my daughter&#x27;s hair is past the middle of her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to purchase another bottle after our son accidentally busted the bottle but otherwise the same bottle would&#x27;ve lasted for months; maybe even a year (for my use anyway). Regardless, given the options available I would&#x27;ve purchased this bottle again and again. It is easily comparable to other leave-in conditioners at twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely sold.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife with her Ceramic Flat Iron from the same seller.  Great products for both.  Leave beautiful and healthy look hair every time used.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Leaves the hair silky and shiny as advertised. Bottle will last you a long time, so I just now bought a second one. To my disappointment, this time around the lid was not closed properly, so about 1/4 of the product had spilled in the box when I received it. Bottle will then be very slippery, so be careful when handling it.</li>
            <li> What a step up from pomade or fiber that I&#x27;ve been using for years. A friend turned me on to Argan oil last year and I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> HSI argan oil is great! It leaves your hair so soft and shiny! I love it and use it every day. It is very versatile. You can use it in wet or dry hair and helps keep the softness especially when hair is processed and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the basis of the reviews it received on Amazon.  I was ordering HSI&#x27;s flat iron at the time and people were raving about the iron as well as the oil.  This product is similar to  Moroccan Oil I have used but it&#x27;s not as expensive.  I also like the smell of HSI&#x27;s oil better.  It has a nice clean scent where the Moroccan Oil has a heavy scent.  Other women with frizzy hair said that the oil and flat iron combined kept their hair from being frizzy. After using the products together for a couple of months I suggest using the oil on damp hair to dry it and then again after it&#x27;s dry when flat ironing.  It makes hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  It is now the end of 2016 and I felt like I should update this review since it is so old.  I still use this product.  Yep, I still use it once a week to straighten or curl my hair with the iron.  Either or, depends on mood.  A couple things to note.  It still works great during the summer for my curly hair.  I have tried a lot of hair oils since this review.  Some were given to me, some were in my Ipsy bag, and some I bought thinking that I might find something better.  Wrong, oh so very wrong.  WRONG.  This is my holy grail hair product, the one I cannot, CANNOT live without.  I have repurchased it only 2 times in the past two years.  If you wash your hair more often you would use more.  I am still in love with this stuff, and I think I always will be as long as they keep making it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product.  I have long, curly, frizzy, thick hair that I wear straight during the winter and curly during the summer.  I do this because I have to air dry my curly hair for the curls to turn out okay, and it&#x27;s to cold to do that during the winter. Anyways, for starters, I&#x27;ve used a lot of products before and this is hands down the best.  When I straighten my hair I like to wash my hair once a week, on Saturday. I don&#x27;t have greasy hair naturally, so I can easily go a week between washes when straightening.  Plus, it&#x27;s better for your hair.  Many products do not allow this because they make my hair greasy, and to top it off, I wouldn&#x27;t notice a deference in straightening time.  If it takes me the same amount of time to straighten my hair with a product as it does without the product, and I have to wash my hair more with it, then it&#x27;s no good. Also, products claiming to last a week with straight awesome hair with washes are pointless for me since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair but once a week without any product.  That being said, after buying the straightener that had this little sample with it, I read up on all the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: it does not, in any way, make my hair feel greasy.  Even after a week there is no greasy feeling from the product, and my sister-in-law has commented on how great my hair looks on the Saturday I plan on washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: the styling time has been cut in half.  Literally blow drying and straightening my hair takes me about 30 minutes or less depending on how long after my shower I start doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: before this oil I would have to touch up my hair every morning. You know, get out a few kinks that showed up at night. Not anymore. Perfect hair all week, didn&#x27;t have to restraighten once.  I notice this only when I blow dry and straighten. If I put my hair in a braid and then straighten in the morning it isn&#x27;t as good, but still better than without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used this six times now, five weeks of awesome hair, and the oil isn&#x27;t even under the neck of the bottle yet. I was so worried that I would be spending about $20 a month on this, which for some people is not a lot, but for us full-time moms and college students, I was worried. Considering how much use I&#x27;ve gotten and still have a practical full bottle, the price is pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: it works great for leaving your hair natural. For those wondering how I got five weeks of awesome hair for six uses, well one time I decided to put it in my hair like I was going to blow dry and straighten, and my two year old started throwing up. Plans stop, mommy to the rescue. Well, an hour later I finally got to see myself in the mirror, and voila, non-frizzy, awesome, super soft curls. I could not believe it.  The secret to good curls in curly hair is don&#x27;t touch it while it&#x27;s drying. The secret to awesome curls is use this oil while wet, then don&#x27;t touch it while drying.  Worth every penny and then some.it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: it does not, in any way, make my hair feel greasy.

            <li> I actually purchased this with the flat iron and had a bad experience.BUT, after the provider of this product saw my review they immediately shipped me a new flat iron because somehow the one I bought was defective. I&#x27;m super happy now with my flat iron and this oil is awesome too! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it I absolutely loved it ❤ it leaves my hair soft and silky!! The price is totally worth it ! I would totally recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this product because I wanted to minimize hair damage from my blow dryer and straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair (not too thick, not too thin) and I have fairly healthy hair (still has shine and silkiness with split ends)&lt;br /&gt;I live in Las Vegas so I need something that will help with this dry weather (hair gets dull and frizzy). I guess it helped a little bit, but I thought the product was heavy and &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again. I found a better alternative that fit my needs better. It is called Argan oil Arvazallia. Compared to this product, Arvazallia definitely had better quality that was light with pleasant aroma. It did not make my hair feel heavy or sticky. It made my hair feel light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> My hair is all of the above, so it can be really difficult to find something that can leave my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down. This product absolutely does (be careful if you have fine hair however, you DO NOT need to put the product on your roots, only midlength to the ends).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great value, you only need a little to be effective, even on long hair (mine is past my shoulder blades, and while it&#x27;s fine there&#x27;s a lot of it), and it smells fantastic. All around a great buy at a great price (I&#x27;ve spent twice as much on products that don&#x27;t work nearly as well)</li>
            <li> love this. I have very thin fine hair that is damaged easily. This helped it so much and did not appear greasy or weigh it down</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Super Fast Shipping from Seller. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> My mom loves it and use it every other day</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! After years of using a straight iron on my hair daily, it was really beginning to show. My hair was also feeling very dry and brittle. I used one other spray product and while that worked for a couple of weeks, I noticed the leave-in spray stopped making my hair feel nice and soft. That&#x27;s when I purchased this Argan oil and it&#x27;s amazing. It does what everyone says. It leaves your hair smooth, shiny, and silky feeling without it feeling greasy. My hair feels healthy again and looks great! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair, love this product. It adds shine, makes my hair feel softer without a build up residue feel. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> It smells super gd!!! I loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter to use with her flat iron. Her hair looks so much more healthy using this. She is on her second bottle. The price is reasonable and shipped within Amazon Prime&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Great for a blow out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It made my hair soft and shiny.  I would recommend it for any to use.</li>
            <li> After trying several other brands of hair oil I have finally found one that does what it says.  I&#x27;ve been using HSI Argon Oil for several months now and my hair has never felt softer.  It also gives my hair a wonderful shine without feeling heavy or oily.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time. Leaves your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love what this oil does for my hair. It leaves my hair smelling great and looking smooth and shiny. I apply it during and after the straightening process and then the next day to control fly-aways. My hair is smooth and straight and shiny for days - and this is a big deal since I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product, especially for my natural hair; my hair feels silky soft and easy to manage in any style. However, the item comes in a very small bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t take much. I am going to order my second one soon.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I would highly recommend it to family and friends.  Very protective.  Smells great.  It was delivered quickly too.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for the past 6 months or so and it is absolutely wonderful! I use it every time after I wash my hair. It&#x27;s great because I live in Florida and it helps so much with humidity and frizz but also with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a heat protectant before I straighten, blow dry or curl my hair. I def recommended this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than other products because it is a more natural hair product without unnecessary chemicals but it works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after we bought HSI hair straightener where they had provided a sample HSI argan oil bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was really happy with that product so we ordered this one again. Only issue is it doesn&#x27;t have dropper but other than that excellent quality product.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that is hard to straighten, and Ivw always had to use flat iron spray. But with this product, I NEVER have to use the flat iron spray, my hair is now easy to get straight (and takes less time) plus feels silky smooth!! So glad I found out about this argon oil!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It protects my hair while flat ironing and leaves a nice shine without leaving a heavy build up. My hairdresser told me to only buy Argan Oil in a dark colored glass bottle...the rest aren&#x27;t authentic.  This one fits the bill at a reasonable price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this product, price and prompt delivery. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Personally, I swear by this product. It leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, and it has done wonders in my hair care. My only complain is the way it is packaged. It&#x27;s such a wonderful product and more care should be placed in packaging. The cover should be modified to ensure no spillage.</li>
            <li> Works exactly how it should and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, make my hair smooth and I would highly recommend trying it if your hair have dry split ends.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and silky, I use just befor I curl my hair with my flat iron and my hair still feels soft.  I am an African American female who has stopped using relaxers over a year ago.  I brought this product after reading previous reviews and this stuff didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Great stuff, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago and love it!  Great product, left my hair feeling smooth.  I have natural curly hair and this worked great at taming the frizziness and allowing me to keep my hair straightened all day long and looking great!!  Item was shipped promptly to me also.</li>
            <li> Good organ oil, good scent but doesn&#x27;t do much once it dries.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It really leaves my hair feeling very smooth and weightless. the product arrived on time. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a salon look without paying salon prices!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I look at the most negative reviews first to see if even in the worst case scenario, I can still live with my purchase decision. On one of those negative reviews,  I did confirm that \\&quot;Benzyl Salicylate\\&quot; is listed twice in the ingredients and although it may look intimidating, it&#x27;s used as a fragrance additive or UV light absorber. Others have complained that it contains silicon oils such as \\&quot;Dimethicone\\&quot;, which is commonly used as a moisturizer. After several months of moderate use, it did smooth out frizzy hair especially on the ends, leaves hair soft,  and smells nice for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Prodruct was as described.  I use Argan Oil for my beard.  Its light and works good.  I recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. It also has a nice soft scent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is Light weight, non greasy, and it leaves my hair feeling amazing! I use it daily. Love it!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I started using the tiny bottle that came with the HSI flat iron. That little bottle last nearly two months with just a drop a day. Put it on while hair is still wet, then blow dry and flat iron. Surprisingly, hair looks healthy even after all that heat!</li>
            <li> Tops the Moroccanoil I used to use and leaves my hair feeling moisturized... overall very pleased with HSI Argon Oil!!</li>
            <li> I received a complementary bottle of this Argan Oil with the purchase of my flat iron.  I love the product.  It smells wonderful and gives my not very shiny hair a nice sheen.  I hadn&#x27;t thought of using any sort of protective conditioner for my hair with my flat iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I have been introduced to this as I feel like I&#x27;m being proactive in keeping my hair from getting damaged.</li>
            <li> does as advertised.  it works well as a detangler, and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  i have very fine hair, so many products weigh it down, or leave it greasy.  this is one of the only oils i&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t do that.  Also, I use such a small amount each day, that this bottle will last a year.  Great value for the price.  My initial reason for purchasing was for the shine, which it does do, although, I wish more so.  Overall, definately will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Happy to have a high quality ceramic straightener and got a really decent price. Leaves hair smooth  Warms up fast and doesn&#x27;t rip hair out. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the product and am super satisfied with the purchase process.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that works on my frizzy yet flat and oily hair!  This product is oil but so light, as other reviewers have said.  I just put a couple drops in my hair then use the hair iron.  Leaves my hair soft, shiny, tames the frizz.  Looks like I just left the hair salon.  Also still looks good the next day.</li>
            <li> Hsi Argan oil is the best substance I have ever used. It leaves my hair shiny and glossy and it doesn&#x27;t way it down. It only takes a dime sized drop and I had better hair. ;)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  My hair is silky smooth and I used my iron every day. My hair is thin and prone to split ends, but this seems to keep my hair protected.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.  Use sparingly with just a drop on your hands, rub and together and put on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love!  Will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> Love this product!  A great add-on to use w/HSI ceramic flat-iron.  It gives my hair the polished &amp; sealed look that you get when leaving the salon.  My new must-have product.  5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it helps with my frizzy hair without leaving it greasy and also smells nice!</li>
            <li> First off, I have short (3-4\\&quot;), thick, curly brown hair that is wavy in spots, and decided a few days ago to try to style it with a hair straightening iron. (More specifically: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know whether the iron came with any oil so I went ahead and ordered a 5oz bottle of Redken oil (their &#x27;Smooth down Heat glide&#x27;), to later find out that the iron included a sample of Argan oil. I decided to give the sample a try and the results actually turned out pretty nicely even before I&#x27;d started using the iron. To me that was a surprise because I have trouble finding a hair gel that will keep my hair in place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan oil smells sweet; I like my antiperspirant, shaving gel etc. odorless, and the Argan oil smelled pleasant however maybe a bit too intensely for my tastes. Compared to the Redken oil, the sample smelled &#x27;darker&#x27; or &#x27;heavier&#x27;, for lack of a better descriptor. Then again, I didn&#x27;t notice much of the perfume after I&#x27;d styled my hair with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan oil does make my hair shiny (which I love) and like I said, it works wonders for keeping my hair in place. It has been 2 days since I ironed my hair and it&#x27;s still straight, even after I took a shower this morning. (I know going out into the rain instantly undoes my styling efforts whenever I use Heat Glide, but I *did* try to keep my hair dry in the shower.) It didn&#x27;t feel dry or greasy before I stepped in the shower either, so the sample did a good job there!&lt;br /&gt;I will have to see how the Redken oil compares in combination with my new hair iron, but I will consider getting a larger bottle of Argan in the future and I think I can safely recommend the Argan oil if you have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> This product reduces frizz and keeps hair feeling smooth without adding too much oil. A little goes a long way so this product should last for a while. Smell is nice as well.</li>
            <li> For a you women of color who spend money every two weeks going for a wash n set....STOP! I washed my hair, deep conditioned, and air dried my hair. While it was drying I used a nice dollar piece amount of this on my hair. Flat ironed it and the end result....looked like I had just got a wash n set and blow out. My hair is thick, so the volume was there.  It was feather light. People complimented me left and right, this flat iron was a great investment and this leave in is the bomb! Works on natural hair too</li>
            <li> Arrived 3/4 full and all over the box.</li>
            <li> I love this serum so much. It gives my hair extreme shine and makes it so silky and manageable. It smells like heaven and I love to touch my hair after blow drying. A few drops go a long way, don&#x27;t use too much. I hope HSI will never stop producing this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subconsciously refuse the idea of heat protectant products, simply because heat is heat and it is going to harm your hair whether you use a heat protectant serum or not. I have no idea whether it helps reduce the damage from the heat or not but I love it. It gives a great shine, it smells really good and it feels so so so soft on hair. This will be my hair serum forever.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I was my hair- it helps get rid of frizz and products my hair from my flat iron. It works better than all the other argan oil products I&#x27;ve purchased before as those products have left my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> This has been an amazing product for my damaged hair. I use flat irons and chemicals on my hair that have left it damaged. While I am attempting to repair this damage, the HSI Argan Oil has been a true hair saver. It leaves my hair silkier and shinier with a substantially less noticeable damaged appearance. I am sure that with continued use of this product, and maintaining better hair care, I will achieve the healthy looking hair I once had.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the HSI Professional Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener a few months back. I am very happy with both products. I have frizzy dry hair and lots of it. So straightening has been a constant challenge and most irons and hair product has had little effect leaving my hair either too greasy or hardly straight. I also have a lot of short hair on the top of my hair causing fly aways. With the HSI iron and argan oil, I have had more success than all other products I tried. Straightening is easy and fast and my hair looks nice and sleek something I have not been able to do for years. I also use the oil by itself immediately after showering and it helps keep the frizz down. The oil is not greasy at all and you only need a small drop to get the desired outcome.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Well worth the money! The bottle is small, but I little goes a long way so you get your money&#x27;s worth. Leaves hair extremely soft! Not necessarily a leave in to me, more like an oil but I use it as both. Leaves my transitioning hair so soft &amp; gives my extensions a nice shine!</li>
            <li> I too received a sample of this product with the flat iron.  I have frizzy, wavy hair that I had to flat iron daily just to make it look presentable.  I usually shower at nighttime and was using another brand of argan oil on damp hair, but I still woke up with crazy-looking hair.  I&#x27;ve also tried many other smoothing serums, anti-frizz products, conditioners, etc.  The first time I tried this product I woke up with much \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; hair.  It was smooth, shiny and not at all frizzy.  I only had to do a little flat ironing from then on.  The smell is pleasant and I just need to use a few drops on my thick, medium-length hair.  I can even get away with using this alone without the flat iron and still look casual good!  This is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that has lived up to its name!  TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I use this product before straightening.  This leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I first tried this oil with the flat iron and I love it. It makes your hair quite soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> wife loves it. no frizz for the entire day. not too greasy</li>
            <li> I notice a slight difference but nothing magical.</li>
            <li> This did not do a thing for my hair except to make it look very greasy. I cannot recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My daughter &amp; I both use it &amp; it leaves our hair feeling really soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this stuff before. It is absolutely amazing! I have curly, dry (like &amp;#34;could go 3 weeks without a shower and no one would know&amp;#34; dry), and frizzy hair - but this helps manage it wonderfully. It&#x27;s put so much life back into my locks - I&#x27;ve gone 6 months without a haircut, and I haven&#x27;t found a split end yet, this stuff is that amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: APPLY WHEN HAIR IS WET FOR BEST RESULTS. (maybe everyone knows this, but I didn&#x27;t until recently - applying heat protectants to your hair is close to useless if your hair is dry - when your hair is wet it&#x27;s pores are open and can actually absorb the product in a way that allow the hair to truly be protected from heat).</li>
            <li> This product works well for my thick coarse hair.  It leaves it silky and shiny and I usually do not need to use my flat iron at all after using this product.  It is much less expensive than what I was buying from my hair salon and it works better.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my daughter but once again five stars for prompt delivery! I am sure she will love it!</li>
            <li> I Bleach my hair and this really tames the frizz and dryness look my hair gets when it dries. It doesn&#x27;t take very much and it last a looooong time.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight. I have used other oil products in the past that no matter how little I used they left my hair looking greasy. This is NOT the case with this oil. You use a TINY bit and it makes your hair SUPER soft!! Its also shear price and Blue Novelties is great company with AMAZING customer service they had my stuff to me within 2 days!</li>
            <li> Smells very good and works well on my hair. I recommend this product! The brand is very good and I will continue using it and definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil is wonderful. I would recommend that you try this. I put it in when the hair is wet and I let it dry. So you don&#x27;t always have to use it when you blow dry your hair. I feel it has helped my hair not feel so damaged from coloring.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil is wonderful, not only does it make my hair silky and shiny.  The scent is wonderful! I shared this with a friend...yep she will be placing an order.  I could sell this stuff!</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone raving about this product. It&#x27;s ok.  Does as good of a job as Paul Mitchel&#x27;s Skinny serum, I do like HSI&#x27;s scent more. It is very light on my hair and takes a lot for it to get greasy but it never really gets that lush shinny look that I was hoping for.  My search continues...</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot about argan oil and it&#x27;s effects on the hair, so when my husband bought me some to go with my Valentine&#x27;s Day gift, I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing stuff! Just a couple drops and it makes my hair soooo soft and shiny. I usually put it on while it&#x27;s damp, and then blow-dry and flat iron my hair and it makes it look and feel so sleek and beautiful. This is definitely a product I will always make sure to have on hand!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t give your hair a shine and it did not help the dryness of my hair.  The amount of money I paid to have it shipped and the amount of money I would paid to send it back would not be cost effective. That is the only reason why I am not sending it back.  Never again would I purchase a product from HSI on line.</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample when i recived my straighter and this stuff really seals your damaged ends in and make your hair look healthy and strong. No frizze and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this stuff..I tried sooo many things and nothing works like thie stuff..get it I&#x27;m telling you that you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I have used SO many types of styling products over the years and this by far is THE BEST and simplest hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s like a Brazilian Blow Out in a bottle. My hair is smooth and silky and tame. Love it!</li>
            <li> The reviews said it would be the ultimate treatment, so on.... well in my hair did nothing but getting thicker and oiled.I tried use just a drop, same thing.It is not the argan oil natural , probably a cheap artificial ingredient.So far my traditional  hair treatment worked out bette.Try it is a 10, leave in conditioner and it worked better.</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil is head &amp; shoulders above other available Moroccan Oil leave in conditioners. It maintains the proper balance of conditioning for hair exposed to heat &amp; daily environmental factors that cause dry lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after receiving a sample with my HSI flat iron. It works well on my dry fine hair in dime size doses. I would definitely purchase again. Item smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I love the product, hate the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;First - the product.  Sensational!  I have very thick, colored, naturally curly hair which I torture daily with straightening spray, blow-dry and flat iron.  Despite that, it&#x27;s pretty healthy, mainly because I keep it fairly short.  I&#x27;ve started growing it out, and since those ends aren&#x27;t getting clipped every 5 weeks, the need a bit more love.  I&#x27;m not sure how I happened across this product on Amazon, but I was very impressed with the reviews and reasonable price.  I like argan oil - I have a bottle of pure oil that I use for skin, and I could probably use it on my hair, but it was REALLY expensive.  So, I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very please with how the product performed, and consider it a great value considering  small amount goes a long, long way - I&#x27;m talking less than dime size for my thick almost-shoulder length hair.  And there-in lies the problem with the packaging.  Good luck trying to get a small amount out of the bottle.  There is no reducer included, so you have to try to slowly pour a small amount into your palm (this stuff is the consistence of olive oil).  Given the tiny amount of product I need to get the job done, this is no easy feat.  After 3 days of over-pouring, I started using an eye dropper to get a small amount without wasting, which works, but seriously....HSI --- put a pump on it!</li>
            <li> I had been reading such good things about using Argan Oil to add shine and manageability to your hair, (especially if you use heat tools regularly), that I finally tried it.--- I&#x27;m really glad I did! I&#x27;ve been skeptical about trying more oils on my hair because it&#x27;s thick and very porous, and others that I&#x27;ve tried made my hair look flat--even dirty, right after I&#x27;d just washed and flat ironed it.  But I kept seeing everyone give it 5 stars, so I gave in and ordered a bottle .... I LOVE this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every other day since I got it a couple of weeks ago, and have even started getting compliments about how shiny and healthy my hair looks, already!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even hesitate to try this stuff--seriously, you&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>
            <li> I have super long, thick hair that gets tangled easily. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of serums and heat sprays, including purology, paul mitchell, biosilk, chi, you name it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it. I am so glad I found this product, &#x27;cause now it&#x27;s all I need, heat spray and serum and leave in conditioner all in one. I love it! It smells good too and my hair has never felt so soft and been so manageable!</li>
            <li> This product is the best. I apply the oil before drying my hair. I have long hair, and having this oil, It helps to comb my hair faster because of the silkiness after applying the oil. I love this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well with flat ironing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!Best oil I&#x27;ve tried in a while!!! leaves hair amazingly silky!!! great for thick/unruly hair.....we will be buying this product for years to come ^.^</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I received a sample bottle with my HSI flat iron and I have been using it ever since. Living in Florida humidity with curly hair is a constant battle and this stuff beats anything else! Even when I skip the flat iron, I still use this to tame frizz without any greasy feeling. A little goes a long way, so its a great buy.</li>
            <li> This product is really awesome for protecting my hair against heat damage. I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has really helped keep the integrity of my overly processed hair. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service. Great product. Delivered on time. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting tangles out of hair. only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> I hate it! Not for me. Left residuos on my flat iron.</li>
            <li> awesome product! Make my hair soft like a silk</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff for her frizzy hair.  Better than any other product she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much shinier since I started using this oil! I also cannot believe how much it helps the \\&quot;fly aways\\&quot; that I used to have. I have fairly long, layered hair and even when I would flat iron it, there was always fly aways. Not anymore...I also hardly have to use any oil so I think it will last me a long time and it is not greasy! Awesome product thanks!</li>
            <li> Although the bottle top was broken when I received this item I gave it 5 stars because nothing leaked out and this product is AMAZING!!! If u r thinking about trying this product let me tell u, u want be disappointed. I 1st got this oil from Groupon with the HSI curling/flat irons and together they work like magic. It came with a 2oz bottle of the oil and when I ran out I ordered more oil from amazon. You only need a very small amount to work the magic, about the size of a dime.  I&#x27;m African American and if u have ever been to a salon where they place you under a steamer with the conditioner, blow dry, then curl your hair and you love that salon look,  well this is the same look and feel you will get from this product (along with the HSI flat irons).  Your hair will feel silky and bouncy. I only use this oil after I blow dry my hair and right before I curl/flat iron my hair with the HSI curling/flat iron or on days my hair is dry. This is a must try (along with the HSI curling/flat iron) U will Love It!!! {~_~}</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this argan oil to my hair after it has been blow dryed (I use tresemme heat tamer on hair first, then blow dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my shoulder length thick hair I use about a &#x27;skittle&#x27; sized amount of oil, sometimes a tad bit more. You don&#x27;t want to overapply the product or you&#x27;ll end up with greasy results. It&#x27;s better to use less and then add in more oil if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub it between my hands and then disperse into hair. I love the silky soft salon results when using this argan oil and then flat ironing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried one other moroccan oil hair treatment from another company, but I really prefer this HSI Argan oil over it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> This is oil is awasome for the damaga hair...I apply it before I start using the blower and then the iron from HSI . Since almost all my hair is falling out ...this seem to work with my hair and the amount of the bottle is good since this is Argan oil u know that is expensive so for this price is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I have fine, &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hair, and it&#x27;s always gotten seriously tangled in the washing process. I just moisten my fingers with this conditioner and dab it onto my towel-dried hair, and presto! The comb glides right through and my hair is more amenable to my attempts to control it in general. As a definite extra plus, HSI doesn&#x27;t leave any obvious lingering signs of its use-- no heavy scent, no oily-looking residue. And finally, although the price may look a little steep, a very little bit of the product goes a long way; that little bottle will be working for you for a very long time.I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a product!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Finally a leave in that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down! I think I&#x27;ve figured out that creamy doesn&#x27;t work for fine hair, but oil does. Just got the beachy waves haircut and this is how I use this: Shampoo/Condition with Pureology. Spray mid length down with It&#x27;s A Ten Miracle Blowdry Volumizer, then I turn the HSI bottle over in my hand 3 times while keeping my palm on top of the bottle. This is just enough to then smooth through my hair. Blow dry and flat iron. Finish with It&#x27;s a Ten Miracle Texture Fiber to separate out pieces and spray with favorite finishing spray. Voila! Love my hair, YEAH!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and i like it. Hsi Argan Oil helped with my frizz and static and this is a problem i have with my hair. If you have this problem with your hair you will like it too. I recommend this poduct to anyone that has these problems.</li>
            <li> Love using this on wet/dry hair it&#x27;s amazing makes my hair shiny smooth and moisturized, would recommend this to friends</li>
            <li> amazing oil and one of the best and pure argain oil out there, leave my hair so soft and silky, just love it.</li>
            <li> The best.  Works great, smells great.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Awesome product. Makes my hair so very soft and shiny. Will definitely purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> i was hoping based on reviews this would do something other products havent done.  i will say its nice as a pre flat iron protector but not any nicer than other brands.  i dont like that it doesnt have a pump, and the hole is too small for me to get my finger into to get product out.  and i have tiny hands!  i gave it three stars because it didnt hurt anything....and worked to do what it needed to do.  i have african american relaxed hair, and i also use remy clip on extesions brazilian.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my hair before I falt iron my hair. It makes my hair so silky smooth and shiny... but a little bit greasy some hours later.</li>
            <li> Really tame my frizzy hair away.... I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great. :) a must. Wish I used this sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on all of the other positive reviews, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. I have very fine, curly hair which I regularly blow dry straight and require a heat protectant for. This formula is lightweight, not too greasy, and smells sweet but not terribly perfumey. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Get this when you purchase the HSI flat iron.  Bought both for my girfriend and she looks great. She loves the sheen from the HSI oil.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Works 10 times better than any de-tangler i&#x27;ve tried. Plus protects from heat and leaves hair extremely soft</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I live in Vegas and this product makes my hair shiny and tamed. No static cling. Love it!</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair everyday, and have tried many different oils. This one is by far the best one. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Great Leave in conditioner for your hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE HSI profess. I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on hair products. This one passage my approval!  👍 I does what it says it will simple as that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a really good conditioner for awhile now and came across this product. It works very well on my hair, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It leaves my hair relaxed, shiny, and manageable all day which is important to me since I work in a clean room environment with virtually no humidity. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Argan oil. I bought the HSI hair iron and tried the sample that came with it. Because of the results of the sample and the raving reviews,I bought a larger sized one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I live in an area with terrible water that makes my hair dull and dry.  This oil is wonderful.  Just a few drops before styling makes my hair look shiny and healthy without a greasy look or feel.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Argan oil of the highest quality! It smells great and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth with no gummy buildup. Simple to use and facilitates easy styling, a little bit goes a long way. I am looking forward to seeing the improvement in my hair after continued use, but I am impressed with the condition and texture already! I will purchase this product again, I thought the price was right for such a good sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> I naturally have long, fine, straight hair that&#x27;s on the thin side. I went to the salon and got extensions put in for more volume. The minute I left the salon my hair (extensions) literally inflated, got curly and extremely frizzy. I was so upset as I just could not match the extensions texture to the texture of my real hair! I tried numerous different products, but even the ones recommended by stylists that I purchased in the salon did not help at all. I saw this on amazon and ordered along with the heat protector spray, and no lie, it worked WONDERS!!! Just a tiny amount through the hair not only eliminates frizziness, but makes hair incredibly soft, I can&#x27;t stop twirling it! The extensions now match my natural hair perfectly! I use it every other day or less, it does not make hair greasy - in fact, I used to wash my hair twice a week, now I wash it once a week as it stays soft and straight for much longer. I also own HSI hair straightener, and this product combined with the straightener works fantastic. I am incredibly impressed by this product and absolutely recommend it, especially if you have tried everything else and all hope is lost. Hope this helps! :)&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: I never write reviews on anything, but this product deserves a shout out!</li>
            <li> The flatiron works great.  It heats up quickly &amp; is easy to use.  The oil leaves hair very shiny but not greasy.  The product arrived quickly &amp; there was great communication from the company.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The only drawback is you can easily use too much. I have used this and really like it, however, I have found a product that I like better. It is the one I use most often.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!  I have pretty straight and thick hair.  This flat iron heats up nicely and glides through my hair removing any &#x27;frizzies&#x27; and leaving it shiny and bouncy straight.  I&#x27;ve stored away all my other flat irons including my CHI because this iron works so much better.  I would definitely recommend this iron and am so happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter.  She has been very happy with it and says even after 2 days her hair is still straight.  She has very thick hair with natural waves, so that&#x27;s saying a lot. This review was suppose to be for the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch. Wrong link came through.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It leaves your hair feeling silky and shiny.  Since i use my flat iron often, it feels good having extra protection.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of Morraccon Oil but is a lot cheaper. Plus is has such a great, exotic smell! I love it!</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair soft and smooth. It stops my hair from frizzing out and it really stops the damage from heat.</li>
            <li> I got it to go with the flat iron. This stuff smells amazing and it leaves my hair super silky and straight!! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> i really wanted to believe after all the glowing reviews but this did tame some frizzies of my daughter&#x27;s hair but by the end of school the frizzies were back in force.  she has very curly &amp;#34;Shirley Temple&amp;#34; type of hair and maybe the tropical heat plus her hair render this product useless.  We&#x27;ll keep using it but it does not last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> richard bought this product for ME.  the review is by ME and not him.  ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this with the HSI flat iron I bought.  I loved it, so between that and the awesome reviews it got--I ordered a bottle.  I still love the product, but the bottle it came in is a hassle to use.  you have to pour the product out.  the directions say to use 2 drops, which is impossible to dispense in that way.  it should have came with a dropper or something.  I&#x27;ve used a similar product, skinny serum by paul mitchell, which has a pump.  it&#x27;s the same consistency and works a lot better.  i&#x27;m guessing this won&#x27;t last as long as you risk overusing because of having to pour and it running past your fingers.  don&#x27;t get me wrong--the product itself is great and works as described!  i&#x27;m just hoping the manufacturer will change the packaging--that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this product! I use it after blowdrying my hair and before using a straight iron or curling iron. It helps to smooth the hair as well as to hold shape. It feels oily when first applied, but seems to to really distribute well once it is heated when hair is styled. My hair stays the way I styled it for much longer than it would without this product and it smells heavenly! A little goes a long way-will definitely buy again. IMHO better than morrocan oil, at least in my hair.</li>
            <li> I can use this product before blow drying and it comes out straight and smooth enough to not even need the flat iron!  I didn&#x27;t love the smell at first, but I also don&#x27;t find that it leave any smell in my hair at all as it did on my hands.  Use a very small amount though because it can definitely leave hair greasy if you use too much.  A dime size is enough for me, and I have moderately thin hair.  Great product overall!</li>
            <li> This is God sent. I use it on my hair, my nails, my weave. I will def buy again. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> i heard it from internet&lt;br /&gt;when i first time try ，it makes my hair smooth&lt;br /&gt;it surprised me，i like it</li>
            <li> This product is great! It made a real difference to my chemically damaged hair. The only down side is that it is quite pricy. However, it should last a while. :)</li>
            <li> I really love this leave-in conditioner! I have coarse, thick, curly, shoulder-length hair. This product helps tame frizz and flyaways and makes my hair softer.  I also love the smell, I would describe it as a mix between amber and musk but it is subtle. As a bonus, my styling products appear to be more effective. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t make a bigger bottle.  Buy the large bottle, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying a brand that was not familiar to me, but the ratings and the price made me take a chance. I LOVE this product! I have naturally curly, thinning, frizz-prone hair.  I use a good dime-size amount on my towel-dried hair, and the HSI Argan Oil does its magic! My hair ends up soft and frizz-free. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Smooth, non-greasy, light.  Great shine; better than Moroccan Oil.  My order arrived the very next day after ordering.  Impressive!!</li>
            <li> My teen-aged daughter obsessively straightens her hair every day. She used to have to get all of the split and damaged ends trimmed every few weeks. We got her a new straightener and there was a sample of the Argan Oil in the package. It really is fantastic. Since she has been using it, her hair is much healthier and there are no signs of damage. Unlike some other products she&#x27;s tried, it smells really nice, too. A little goes a long way, the 4oz bottle will easily last for 6 months on her below the shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> HSI leave in conditioner is really one of the best products if you color your hair and use flat iron daily. It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite organ oil! Yes, it is not cheap BUT it will last you forever! It only takes a little bit to give your hair that silky shine. This product is not greasy and smells amazing! I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I tried for the first time and wow ... amazing , I heave tick freeze hair, it make them silky and soft from one wash to another ..wonderful product ordered 3 more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for me, because I used ceramic capillary which is excellent and makes the hair greasy makes it soft and smooth&#x27;ve Naspena I can not sacked curse before today I&#x27;ve experimented with that because he came sample with a ceramic which Harith, and now I am asking from the site because it is suitable for me and I would recommend using because it Chil embrittlement hair by Excellent 90% recommend it and I dyed my hair and dye and damage from this oil tempered damaged hair</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t need to use any other product in my hair after getting out of the shower. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my hair, quite possibly ever. The price is reasonable and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, just re-ordered and LOVE it.  I don&#x27;t use daily, maybe 2-3 times a week..a little will do you and bottle lasts a long time.  I have long, thick hair that I dye often and it is great to use whether I&#x27;m blow-drying and straightening, blowdrying or just air drying for the day.  It does have a scent, which I love, very similar to other musky hair emollients I&#x27;ve used in the past, but might not be for everyone.  I keep buying this particular brand because the soft/shiny results without the greasy/build up I&#x27;ve gotten from other.  I&#x27;ve thought about trying other products, but I keep going back to this one because of the results!</li>
            <li> works great on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I used to buy Moroccan Oil for about 4 times the price; this works better.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample of this with my HSI flat iron purchase and was so pleased I ordered a bottle.  I have extremely thick, wavy hair.  If I use my flat iron and no oil (or another brand of oil I used to use) my hair will straighten easily but curl as soon as I get warm/perspire even a little bit.  Using just a bit of this oil keeps my hair straight almost all day long - I&#x27;ll see some very light wave return around my face by the end of the day, but just barely.  I anticipate that with using just a little bit every day the 4 oz bottle will last me at least 6 months.  Good value.  Only con is that the bottle is made of heavy glass and I&#x27;m a bit on the clumsy side, so I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t drop and break it at some point.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, especially the smell, I wish they would sell this in a perfume.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will recommend to anyone and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it smells good! Not like pure argan oil, that smells quite gross. This does NOT leave your hair greasy, or even greasy looking. It absorbs into each strand, and leaves your hair silky, shiny, and healthy looking.  My daughter has very fine hair, and always has these little fly aways, and frizzies. Just a little bit of this, and a quick brush and that problem is solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my hair before I flat Iron it, and it is a miracle with my HSI flat Iron. My best friend has very curly, frizzy, and dried out hair. This little guy fixed all those problems. Her hair after using both this and my flat iron is straight, soft, and very healthy looking. It leaves just the right about of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: Apply a small amount to the ENDS of your hair. My stylists, all tell me you don&#x27;t need to condition anything other than your ends, same with the argan oil. There&#x27;s no need to go all the way to your scalp, it will end up looking greasy, since the natural oils from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li> Great oil, nice and light!</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF, smells good! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I tried many different oils but I keep using this one and I am happy with the results. I use it for my hair ends every time after shower. Really recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom after she asked me to find her a good priced and quality leave in conditioner. After a month of using the product this is what she had to say.&lt;br /&gt; First of all, I have very curly hair that I flat iron almost everyday and because of that I&#x27;ve struggled with dry and damaged hair. I have numerous leave in conditioners all either do not work or leave my hair with an unwanted residue. So when got this product I was very skeptical that it would be like all the rest. The first time I tried the product I was very satisfied with the quality and how well my hair felt afterwards. My hair was shinier and smoother and left without the greasiness some products leave behind. A few weeks after using the product my hair began to look and feel less dry and more healthy. Today, my hair has completely recovered and I no longer have problems with dry, heat damaged hair. Over all, I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone with similar problems to myself or anyone just looking for a quality product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with lots of body that require lots of product, work, and time to get it smooth &amp; straight. I used to use the Liss Ultime Shine Serum which would make my hair greasy and heavy but the Argan Oil is wonderful, just a few drops in my wet hair and style as usual. My hair is soft shiny and smells lovely after using the flat iron.  I love this product and would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bought this in 2012 at double the price.  I have used only 1/2 of the bottle by now.  I always get compliments on my hair.  I use very little on dry hair.  After I swim and wash my hair, I use a lot more on my wet hair, but it never makes it oily and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged after exposure to chlorine in the pool.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have wavy/curly hair, but like one of the other reviewers mentioned, if you mess with it too much while it&#x27;s drying it won&#x27;t be curly anymore.  Just a puff.  (lol)  My hair gets really frizzy though so I have to put something in it to help.  I put this on while my hair is damp and it really isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  It gives it a nice shine and my hair curls nicely.  Pretty effortless.  While I like other anti-frizz products maybe a tad better, they&#x27;re heavy (or greasy) and flatten the curl out.  This one does not.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo200BOV9B2WJW4]]My wife wanted a ceramic flat iron for her hair about a year ago and we purchased the HSI version. She was happy with it but she wanted a conditioner to keep her hair soft and silky. We purchased a couple of other brands of thermal protection sprays from other manufacturers and we were sadly very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This HSI Professional Argan oil is the best we have tried. Her hair is soft and silky and the frizziness is just gone. Her hair is normally naturally oily and with this product we cannot even see a hint of oiliness. Her hair has a nice shine and the oil leaves a very, very light fragrance in her hair that I can barely notice. It only takes a few drops of the oil to work and it helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that it only takes a little to work and it is ultra-light. Some of the other products we had tried just made your hair feel stiff and like you had used hair spray. Her hair feels soft and silky and less frizzy. That is exactly what you are looking for in a thermal protector. She gives it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in this product is silicone, it makes you makes you wonder how much argon oil is in it, perhaps only traces. I find the product works like any cheap silicone. This product weighs down my hair some. Maybe it is because it is hard to dispenSE small amount with the kind of bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  It helps get rid of frizz and makes my hair feel smooth.  I only have it 4 stars because of the bottle-I wish it was easier to get a small amount of the oil out of the bottle-I am going to try and find a \\&quot;pump\\&quot; style top that will fit this bottle.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely unbelievable how good this Argan oil hair treatment is! I hate(d) flat ironing my hair because I thought my hair was too dry, limp, and weak to get soft, bouncy, moisturized results. Please believe the previous reviewers when they say &amp;#34;A little goes a long way!&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very low porosity hair (low porosity &#x3D; hair that has a hard time absorbing and holding onto moisture, eg. dry!!!) And heat from blow-drying, flat-ironing, etc. (which I rarely use anymore), always drys my hair out even more. The reviews were so good on this product, I thought, though pricy, I&#x27;ll give this a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow-dried my hair w/a diffuser and I poured a little of the HSI Argan oil into a saucer (about the diameter of a votive candle). With each section I flat-ironed, I dipped my pointer finger in the oil, rubbed it between my first two fingers and my thumb, and applied it to the length of my hair. One pass of the flat iron at about 300-320 degrees was all each section took. One pass! It took about 4 &amp;#34;pours&amp;#34; into the saucer to do my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? Uber soft, moisturized curls that (and this never happens), lasted all day! Confession: I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;For ladies who have a similar hair type and want to know how it may work for them; I&#x27;m African American and have shoulder length 4a-4b hair that&#x27;s been textlaxed (hair with a relaxer used 1/2 the processing time with oil added to it, to only slightly release the curl pattern).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now, and will continue to be, a permanent part of my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> First let me just say argan oil is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hair which is normally very dry, extremely soft &amp; it is a great protector when using a flat iron.I bought my first bottle of argan oil through my hairdresser to the tune of $40. so needless to say after I found this bottle of argan oil for $20 I was willing to give it a try. I actually find this brand superior to the one I purchased through my hairdresser. The seller sent out my product very quickly, I will be purchasing this again, Love it!</li>
            <li> It was ok. Doesn&#x27;t tame my frizzy curly hair like I had expected. Does the trick for the first few mins but once dried (30 mins later) my hair goes back to being frizzy.</li>
            <li> i mean the bottle i used to use was like $50 for similar size bottle and i loved it.&lt;br /&gt;it is not heavy. it smells nice and very light, but i don&#x27;t c anything different from my other cheaper products that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product does wht it says. It leaves your hair very soft and shiny.  I love it. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Liked applying it best on damped hair.  After using flat iron, my hair was shiny and soft.  Liked the texture.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;awful dry, frizzy and very thin hair&amp;#34;.  This stuff is amazing, it calms the frizz and helps the blow out leave some thickness to may hair. I put it on and blow dry and then add more and blow dry again.  My hair is thin, there&#x27;s no way this would add that much volume, but for what I have it does an incredible job. I&#x27;ve purchased at least 80 products trying to find something and so happy with this.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. It makes hair very smooth. Not oily or greasy either. You should buy it. I know I am going to continue to buy this hair treatment. It does work.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, for the price it&#x27;s ever better than amazing.  I got a sample from ipsy, and from there I knew I had to have it.  My hair was bleached, so it was really dry, and damaged.  I starting using this, and it made it feel softer and healthier.  I love my hair.  And for anyone who has dry or damaged hair and want it feeling soft again.  For the price and quality for this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my thick coarse hair. I have tried other argan oil products  which work better. Disappointed. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a great deal of time to really work with styling my hair (mother of a 2-year-old), but the few quick flat iron stylings I have managed to undertake seem to have produced good results. My hair does look a bit shinier and not as  fuzzy. Thus far I am pleased with the product. It has a nice scent too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I think this products is very nice, i highly recomends this to all ladies out there with African hair. it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter that has very dry curley hair. But I used it once and I&#x27;m in love. Leaves your hair sleek and silky. If you use a very small amount it is weightless. It only requires a few drops. It has helped my daughter as well. It makes her hair look beautiful.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product more compare to the other argan oil leave-in treatment I have used.  This one is much thicker and smells wonderful just like the rest of the argan oil products out there.  It gives the hair a softer and less tangle when uses finger to run through the hair.  I will continue use the product and see if I would like it further more since I have only used it twice after I received it.  The only thing I would change is the designed of the cap; I would prefer a smaller opening to control how much product I can use instead I always get way more oil on my hand than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair and this oil is the best! Very light scent that smells wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily. Also, doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve the perfect look! I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my hair soft, silky and shiny.  Probably the best hair care product I&#x27;ve ever stumbled across.</li>
            <li> I can not even tell you how much I love this product! I had totally dry hair and I could not figure out how people had soft hair they could run their fingers through it. Now I have it too! People this is amazing!!! It leaves hair soft and manageable without being greasy. It&#x27;s wonderful!! Thank you HSI!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny with no sticky residue like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair oil I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I love it! Hair feels incredibly soft, frizz-free and it gives my hair a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommending this product. For the price, it was a bargain. I had bought, more expensive product and the quality are the same.</li>
            <li> It really helps mend my split ends and hair feels silky and smooth after using the straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint I have is the packaging.  Would be more convenient if it was a pump style rather than just twist off cap.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes notice I get way too much product out, hard to control the amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that such a great product!</li>
            <li> At first I had my doubts, but I have been using it for a month, and I really love it!,My hair is starting to look better and softer, and healthier, I divide my thick hair in 2 parts, then I put a dime size Lt Side and another drop Rt side, with my wet hair, I rub my hands each time and run  my fingers through my hair, the inside with one hand palm and the other hand palm the outside. Is working well!, then I comb my hair. Is better than the CHI oil I was using.</li>
            <li> I wish this product had a squirt top, rather than having to pour some liquid into my hands in order to apply the product.  But, the smell makes up for any mess I might make.</li>
            <li> I always use this after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower and before I dry my hair.  I wait until it&#x27;s still a little damp, but not wet, and it works really well.  It smells good and my hair dries so shiny and nice :)</li>
            <li> Product is ok but I am not  100% happy,smells like baby powder for me (I use the same brand flat iron).work on my hair the same like rest products I have tried.nothing special.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with relaxed hair. This product is amazing for flat iron users. Leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair look and feel nice only after I blow dry it with a boar bristle brush. I am still ranking chi smoothing syrum just a touch ahead of this one, but it is an amazing product and I am happily using it!</li>
            <li> Definitely expensive and small in size, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now. It smells good and I believe its protecting my hair as it says it will.</li>
            <li> my hear feels great after.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I put about a quarter sized amount to my hair right after I wash it, then blow dry it and finally straighten it. My hair couldn&#x27;t be any softer! The serum also seems to add lasting volume and bounciness. Score!</li>
            <li> One of the best leave-in conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time at the best price. you only use a small amount and it really protects your hair from hot iron damage. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Awesome service. Product arrived before estimated time. I loved the effect it has on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes brushing much easier and leave it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This oil works well for me.  It is oily enough for me to think it is moisturizing my hair but not so oily that my hair is greasy.  I have not used it with a curling iron or other heated product, so I can&#x27;t say how it works with those.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to the expensive Moroccan oil I had been buying and came across all the great reviews here.  I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This argan oil leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and I love that it also has a thermal protector for when I use my flat iron.  I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> Love this, use it daily. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive stuff, I&#x27;ve used it and this is the same if not better. I use it on my hair dry or wet, whether I&#x27;m using styling tools or not, although their (hsi) flat iron is great when I get around to doing  my hair. :)</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! Never knew there was a product that would help straighten hair without even using the flat iron. Highly recommend this product to anyone with naturally curly/frizzy hair that wants it to be straight. Add the iron and it is the easiest/best way to get my hair how I want it.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely satisfied. I will definitely buy it again,, It made my hair so straight, shinny and feels so light and manageable.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product makes my hair look great: super smooth, super shiny. But after about 2 weeks my scalp started itching, burning, became very sensitive (it hurt to touch my hair), then my head (scalp) started hurting. I looked on the label and saw that it had a lot of chemicals in it. So this was probably a reaction to those chemicals. Had to discontinue using the oil. My scalp stopped hurting afterwards. If your scalp doesn&#x27;t mind all the chemicals, then try it, it will make your hair look very pretty. Still, I would recommend a more natural version of this oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my jam. I have frizzy long dry hair and this stuff smells awesome too but it&#x27;s not a strong scent. It&#x27;s light and unique. I love that it makes my hair soft and helps with the frizz all while protecting it from blow drying/curling/straightening. I have bought 2 bottles of this stuff and it lasts for a long time! Thank you Science and HSI professional for helping a sister out!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with my flat iron and loved it. Makes hair drying time quick and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> A RIDICULOUSLY amazing product! I always put it in my hair before I blow dry it straight and as a result, at the end of blowdrying it is soft, silky and not at all dry! The thing smells amazing as well! Thank you Amazon for selling it as such a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> I love all of HSI products. Good for all textures of hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many products and nothing works like HSI Argan Oil! It is the best product I have ever used! It leaves my hair feeling healthy, shiny and beautiful. It is not heavy or oily, and it smells really good! Service was great, I received it earlier than expected. Thank you Blue Novelties for providing this incredible product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Love it! makes my hair very soft, adds life to my hair again when it gets dry.  I do have to be careful to only use a tiny amount at a time as a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have thick coarse hair with lots of body that usually needs lots of product, work, and time to get it smooth &amp; straight. I received a sample of HSI argan oil with the HSI flat iron. I work about 4-5 drops in my wet hair. The first thing I noticed is how soft my dry hair was, even before using the flat iron. After straightening my hair with the HSI flat iron, the results are even more amazing. I have recreated the salon look at home! My hair is smooth, straight, and silky. Plus, the look lasts all day even in the summer humidity. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The Argon oil is fantastic.  The first bottle I bought leaked, making a mess and practically emptying the contents.  However, Amazon solved my issue and I received  new bottle.  So glad they did!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way I love the way my hair feels</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry, and this product really improves its appearance. I do have the HSI flat iron. I apply the Argan oil conditioner when my hair is still just slightly damp, and then finish drying and styling it. I am very pleased with this product. You don&#x27;t have to use very much, so the bottle lasts longer than you would think.</li>
            <li> Great smell and leaves hair feeling silky, would purchase again as it does not leave an oily feel to the hair. The product delivered as advertised and it shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I ove this oil, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome Arian products!</li>
            <li> This product does not work for my hair type. I have fine hair. It makes my hair frizz up. I read all the reviews and thought it would be great, but it was not. I used about 3 x over a 3 week period. My hair seems so dry when I use it.</li>
            <li> This product met more than my expectations it had a wonderful smell and left my hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> The oil has a pleasant smell and most importantly makes my hair smooth and silky. It won&#x27;t make your hair too oily. I will continue to use this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair product is wonderful, non greasy and smells nice. It works with wet or dry hair.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have the HSI flat-iron, which I like.  I used the HSI sample and ordered the full size.  I can&#x27;t remember why, but I also ordered the Arganesqe Morrocan Argan oil about the same time.  I guess I wanted one to stay in my suitcase, one in my bathroom, and I could compare the two as well.  I don&#x27;t want to travel without the Arganesque now, so I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle of it, and I&#x27;m giving the HSI away.  It&#x27;s okay, but I can&#x27;t believe that the Arganesque is so much better.  I use it on damp hair, and there&#x27;s almost no frizziness when I blow dry.  Then I flat-iron, and it takes away even more. (I use a thermal spray after it&#x27;s dry, before I flat-iron or use a Perfector.) I can even use some on dry hair for a final finish.  With the HSI it looked halfway decent the first day, then better the second day, after I&#x27;d flat-ironed again.  Hands down, the Arganesque oil made my hair softer, silkier feeling and shinier, with a lot less frizz.  Couldn&#x27;t believe there was that much difference in brands.  I expected them to be the same.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it every day after I blow dry my hair.  I have color treated (cover the grey), shoulder length hair and just a tiny bit of this product each AM makes my hair shiny, soft and easy to work with.  i do not use a flat iron as it is intended for use with but and sure it would work great with that tool as well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so wonderful. Now be aware you aren’t buying pure argan oil, and it has some synthetic stuff in there I’m sure, but good grief it makes my hair feel so soft and silky! And it’s a thermal protector, so I feel like it’s really helping my hair on styling days. I love it.</li>
            <li> I loved this one and has become a part of my daily routine</li>
            <li> Will never go without this stuff again. Lasts forever, have been using it almost a year and still have over a half a bottle. This stuff is the perfect straightening potion!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! smells great and leaves a very nice shine</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on Bradley Stafford&#x27;s review of November 10, 2012 as well as other reviews that gave  long, very explanatory reviews.  Most of the reviews were 5 star ratings.  What caught my eye with Bradley&#x27;s review was his comment that he&#x27;d used silicone based leave-in conditioners prior to this product which left his hair dry (which silicone can do).  Then he went on to rave about this Argon oil based product.  I was pleased that he seemed to suggest that this product did not have silicone so after seeing all the 5 star ratings along with his I decided to order it.  Once it arrived I immediately read the ingredients to see what the heck was in this &#x27;miracle&#x27; oil.  What a disappointment to find the very second ingredient was dimethicone (a silicone) Sheesh. I compared it to my Moraccan Oil Light MoroccanoilTreatment which does not protect my hair from heat at all and ends up drying my fine hair after using a flat iron.  It too lists dimethicone as the second ingredient.  In fact they are very close in their ingredient list.  What a huge disappointment.  As far as the smell, it&#x27;s OK, not exceptional; and in fact, smells very very close to the scent of the Moroccan Oil treatment I mentioned  Though disappointed, I tried it anyway.  It&#x27;s nothing special.  I still had to put my other leave-in conditioner in along with it to be able to comb through my dry hair.  I was careful to only used a few drops as the instructions say so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair again (I&#x27;ve made that mistake before-haha).  Please note as discovered by another reviewer of a beauty product:  when numerous reviews are written on the same day or successive days consistently giving 5 star reviews containing little or no descriptive words  (for instance: &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; be suspicious folks.  On average you normally get 1 or 2 reviews a month on any given product, not 4 or 6 in one day and successive days as well.  This is not normal.  Perhaps groups of people arepaid to write 5 stars reviews or something. I&#x27;ve noticed this happening with several beauty products recently.  Why is this happening?  I don&#x27;t know, but for me, I will hereafter be very careful about basing my purchases on reviews like that.  I now look for Vine reviews and reviews with 3 or less stars to see what people don&#x27;t like about the product.  I also look only at descriptive reviews, but I am now even a bit suspicious of overly long reviews from people who sound like ad men for the company selling the product.  Beware and be smart before buying.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It makes my hair soft and shiny.  It smooths brittle ends.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice.  No greasy feeling or buildup in hair.  I will continue to purchase this is.  I like it better than biosilk and a similar paul Mitchel product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I am trying to grow my hair long and it is keeping me from having to trim too often as it prevents split ends (which I normally get like CRAZY!)  Less haircuts &#x3D; longer hair!  Plus it smells so good and I get compliments on my hair all the time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is long lasting as you only need a few drops for your head. I use it before I apply heat to my hair and sometimes right out of the shower for conditioning. Smells great and my hair is so much healthier!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel sticky like other heat protectants.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. I have frizzy dry thick hair. This makes it behave better than any product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is average at best.  I feel more than qualified to post this review. I have used at least 20 different kinds of leave-ins, premium oils, and thermal protectants. I have drawn enough comparisons to say this is nowhere close to magic in a (very impractical, glass, open-pour) bottle!</li>
            <li> All the reviews are true! Amazing scent, light weight, leaves your hair silky and shiny. A little expensive to use as your only form of conditioner, but it works SO well!</li>
            <li> Not only was this item poorly packaged, but it made my hair extremely frizzy. I tried it different ways and it wouldn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and shiny using it with fat iron. I have short transitioning hair and I tend to use a lot of heat styling tools to manage. This product helps straightening out my new growth while protecting from heat damage.</li>
            <li> Ordered this along with the HSI Flat Iron for my daughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the hair oil to suit my hair for years, tried lots of different products, including organic argan oil. Finally, I tried this one - LOVED it. The smell is amazing, it does not make my hair oily, it gives it great shine. I cannot be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! My hair gets soft and easy to style. I definitely recommend this product for YOU!</li>
            <li> A bit greasy but it&#x27;s a good heat protectant for the hair.</li>
            <li> Best product to help my frizzy hair! I use it with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair is frizz free all day!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best of its kind. My damaged hair looked silky and soft with use of this product before and after drying. Only issue i have with it is the bottle, i tend to pour more than needed on my hand.</li>
            <li> If you use a flatiron everyday, I would definitely recommend using this Argan Oil. It makes your hair soft and shiny, prevents damage, and is not oily. Much better than store bought argan oils.</li>
            <li> I like that It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down but it does not provide the shine I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and the fact that this product is not greasy. My hair is so dry and frizzy and I use this product after shower. So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this oil when I purchased my HSI  professional ceramic iron and it is great.  My daughter and I used it for the first time and it leaves you&#x27;re hair soft and shinny.  I would  recommend this product to everyone I know it is a great product, will definitely purchase ths oil in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have tried everything to make my hair syaight without getting messy and this is the only thing that has worked! Will buy it again !</li>
            <li> I have shorter, finer hair... this flat iron works great! Heats up quickly... like the swivel cord... use it with the Argan Oil---makes hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> This hair treatment smells really good and leaves your hair soft and shiny. I recommend this product because the quality</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new flat iron. The hsi iron works wonders on my hair. Im using now and it works better then the Chi I had before this. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and finally found a straightener to tame the wild mess!! It gets hot enough to leave my hair straight. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the entire bottle yet but I really like what I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair smooth and silky and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Like this hair straightener, it heats up quickly and I can easily create waves, curls or straighten my hair. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I used this Argan oil with my HSI professional flat iron and it works great! Leaves hair straight and smooth for days! Has a lovely fragrance also.</li>
            <li> Now here I am, a grandma with silver hair using the HSI flat hair iron I purchsed online through Amazon and really loving it.  The leave in conditioner protects and helps to make my hair as sleek as a model&#x27;s.  My hair has never looked so wonderful and I am a changed woman with silky hair that keeps its style all day.  Never happened to me before!!  And the compliments keep coming.  If there were 10 stars to review, this hair miracle would get it.  It&#x27;s Amazon for me.</li>
            <li> Along with the HSI iron, I got a sample of this amazing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that my hair never look as flat and beautiful until I used this products. I&#x27;m really happy with the results, so I ordered a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret buying it, my hair is wavy and heavy and this helped quite a lot to keep it shinny and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it, you have nothing to loose :).</li>
            <li> I use about a dime-sized amount on my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable, even after I heat-style.  I have used other products containing Argan oil, but this one works better than the others I have tried (maybe because it has fewer other ingredients and more Argan oil?  I&#x27;m not sure).  This works great on color-treated, dry hair.</li>
            <li> GIRLFRIEND USED IT THE OTHER DAY AND SHE WAS PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME AS WAS I. NOTHING BETTER THAN YOUTHFUL AND SHINY HAIR ON A WOMAN.HER HAIR IS NORMALLY DRY AND HAS NO LIFE BUT SINCE USING THIS PRODUCT IT LOOKS 100% BETTER. WORKS AS ADVERTISED AND WOULD BUY AGAIN....(HOWEVER FOR THE MONEY WOULD ORDER THE 4 OUNCE BOTTLE)...</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  My hair is relatively curly and this product worked great to hold together my curls and eliminate frizz.  Not only is it great for the flat iron, but you can just use it everyday without the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was shiny and soft after I used it, but didn&#x27;t feel heavy or look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used a drop or two.</li>
            <li> Works well-good to know that there is a layer of protection on my hair when I am so inclined to abuse it.</li>
            <li> I refuse to give products good ratings if they don&#x27;t deserve it.  This is one product that deserves it!  It really makes your hair manageable and super soft.  I have naturally curly hair that I hot iron daily causing lots of damage.  This makes it all better!  I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> The box had argan oil all over. And the bottle was open when I got it.. I WANT A REFUND..... ok so amazon has the best customer service ever!. I still am dissapointed in the way it was shipped.  But I have to say the way they handled it was awesome. Will be reordering argan oil but from another seller.</li>
            <li> My hair had heat damage and I decided to purchase this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  It has done wonders to my hair and protects it from heat.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft. Only small amount is required. Best thermal protector i have ever used so far.</li>
            <li> This oil definitely helped my dry hair. A little is all that is needed. It has a really nice smell. I would buy this product again. It was also delevered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I use this oil everyday, it really seems to protect my hair. It also leaves it very shiny, it just takes a tiny amount so the bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this argan oil after researching it online---it got very good reviews.  I have very fine hair with damaged ends from a botched keratin treatment, highlighting &amp; coloring.  I can&#x27;t use anything too heavy or my hair gets weighed down. I used it the first day I received it--just a little bit rubbed between my palms &amp; smoothed over the top of my hair, focusing on the ends that are damaged.  It was awesome!!  My ends looked so much better!!  My hair was very shiny too.  And it smells nice.  I&#x27;m glad I found this product.  It should last for a long time since all I need is a drop or two.  I just wish I could squeeze a drop or two from the bottle, but it is glass with just a screw-top opening.  I might pour it into another bottle so I can squeeze out a couple of drops when I use it.  Other than that, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ordered the HSI Flatiron for a trip that I was taking, and this small bottle of oil was included in the shipment. I had never used it before so I thought I would give it a try.  It definitely leaves your hair feeling very silky and shiny.  I will be using this product from now on!!  Works very well with the HSI Flatiron that I ordered!!</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative I can say about this product. It has done WONDERS for my hair! I am 37 years old and have colored, straightened, curled and done a lot of damage to my poor hair. This product gives my hair shine, softness and the youthfulness it&#x27;s been craving. People compliment me on my hair all the time and others have purchased this when I tell them this is what I&#x27;ve been using. Love it! Only negative thing I can say is I wish I would have purchased more than two when the price was only $14.99.</li>
            <li> I add this product to my rinse out conditioner when I flat-iron. I have relaxed mid-back length hair and need the cones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love beauty products, so any opportunities that present themselves to me are amazing.&lt;br /&gt; The HSI Argan Oil  is actually a leave-in treatment conditioner, that literally felt like true &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; on my hair.. Just a small about in your hand, and  a quick finger-comb through, is like moisturizing bliss. I highly recommend this product as a pre-protectant before any of the following:&lt;br /&gt;•flat iron&lt;br /&gt;•hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;•curling iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product smoothes hair and tames any frizzy split ends. There is no greasy residue, but do not saturate your hair with the product, just a little, goes a long way.. This exceptional oil is also great for all hair types as well. My hair is so soft and shiny after use, you really must try the product for yourself.  This product can be used on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for when I flat iron, it smells very very good, it definitely protects my hair, and leave it feeling silky smooth. I do use a lot to plenty of protection.</li>
            <li> I apply this to towel dry hair -- about a quarter size amount , then I use my hot rollers.  It really protects my hair and leaves it so shiny.  If I have to wash my hair, but I do not have time,  I put about a dime size amount in my palms and rub it threw my dry hair and my hair looks fresh and shiny.  It is an exceptional product.  I am a senior citizen and never had shiny hair before.  This bottle will last a long time, but when it is empty, I will not hesitate to buy another.</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample when i bought the HSI straightner because i have thick hair that hangs past my butt it wasnt enough. I recieved another sample that was more then enough, this product with or with out  the straightner is one of the best oils i have ever used. If i put it in my damp hair and let it dry without the flat iron, it makes my frizzy hair dry with soft curls and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you combine this product with the HSI flat iron, WOW! My hair is pin straight with no kinks or frizz and its even easier to control how you want the flip at the end of your hair. This oil keeps hair from flipping at the ends and it holds its straight frizz free look all day. I feel like my hair is more protected from heat with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great plus, it smells wonderful. Not purfume laced, it just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase a full bottle when my sample bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing for my hair. I have thin hair and get my hair highlighted, I also blowdry and straighten my hair every day so it definitely gets stressed. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair has been much healthier and last time I went to get my hair done my stylist told me I didn&#x27;t even need to cut it because it was so healthy :) I put a small amount in before I blow dry my hair and an even smaller amount before I use my flat iron. This product doesn&#x27;t leave your oily or greasing looking either, just healthy and shiny. The ONLY COMPLAINT I have is in regards to the bottle not having some kind of pump. It&#x27;s kinda of difficult to get the appropriate amount out. Luckily I had an old bottle with a pump that I cleaned out and put this product into so that was helpful. Don&#x27;t hesitate lady&#x27;s try this stuff it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  It is as my title says.  Moisturizing and light.  Which she says is a hard to find combo!</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this purchase, it works just like moroccanoil but at a much better price. I have fine blonde hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all! I put a tiny bit in my palms and run it over my wet hair after my shower and before combing. The bottle also lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have generally frizzy hair, and it gets worse in the humid air.  So I figured i&#x27;d give this a try.  First thing I always check, how much does something smell.  Well I was pleased that this gave off no nasty odor.  Then I thought hmm oil it&#x27;s going to be greasy and oily and nasty, but it wasn&#x27;t!  This product felt great and got rid of the frizz! It smoothed, didn&#x27;t leave an after oily feeling, or stiff at all.  I will be using this daily I can tell already!</li>
            <li> We really like this product.  It&#x27;s definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve bought before. BUT, it still leaves my daughters hair looking frizzy.  It does make it soft and that is why I gave it a 4 star review.  I would still buy it, buy I do need to purchase an additional product for the friz.  I wish they made something that would take care of both the softness and friz.</li>
            <li> The HSI Argan oil is by far the best argan oil I&#x27;ve used... it has a great smell (not strong though) and makes my hair shiny and soft. I use it every day before I straighten my hair and it never makes my hair look oily! Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It protects my hair from heat, while leaving it soft and silky. I use this with my HSI flat iron and my Liquid Keratin products (keratin treatment) and honestly, my hair has never look better or been healthier. Being mixed, finding the right hair products has been all about trial and error but I&#x27;ve finally found the right combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product replaced the far more expensive Argan oil they sell at salons (I won&#x27;t name names, but the teal label with orange writing product is what I&#x27;m referring to) for me because it is cheaper and a better product, how often does that happen? Like never. This has earned a place among my favorite hair products, and that is no easy feat!</li>
            <li> I was happy with the vendor and product was delivered as expected, but I just didn&#x27;t care for the product so much after use.  The smell is great, but it just did not create the silkiness and shine that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and smooth not heavy good sheen long lasting non greasy feels healthy look strong and healthy</li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my hair was after using this product. I have thick, coarse hair and many products simply don&#x27;t work. This was smoothing, smelled great, and tamed my frizzy flyaways. Love it!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all shopped Amazon, looking for a big seller with lots of positive reviews - bought it, and although good, it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;all that&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never imagined that I would write a review like this, it will be the corniest review I ever write:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does all the things that you see happen to a television commercial model&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m 46 (as of this writing) and my hair has become more course as I get older. A surprisingly small amount of this stuff, and my hair is silky soft and shiny! I&#x27;ve only found one other anti-frizz product that makes it this smooth. It&#x27;s kind of a wonder how one product, and such a small amount, can do all these things in one treatment. When I think of all the semi-effective products I&#x27;ve tried and settled for over the years, it&#x27;s hard to believe this product even exists. I hope it stays at this affordable price, although it&#x27;s certainly worth $50, or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair with lots of flyaways, and this stuff literally transformed my hair to something unrecognizably silky and smooth. I&#x27;m stoked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read ridiculous words like this in a review before too, and took it with a grain of salt, so I&#x27;m surprised to be writing this stuff...but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy, gray hair and have problems with fly-aways. I have tried many conditioners; my bathroom shelves are stuffed with them, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes your hair soft, silky and controllable.  I love the way my hair smells after using it.  The bottle is quite large, and it takes a tiny bit  to do the job, and so I consider it a good bargain.</li>
            <li> This definitely has become my favourite go to hair oil. Ive tried a different brand of argan oil, but was very much disappointed. I felt it would dry out my hair further. I decided to switch back to Morrocan oil until I came across this product and due to the great reviews decided to give it a shot. This product does as it claims. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and frizz free with every application. It also has a pleasant smell for an oil. I am highly pleased with it  and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Really works!  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy -I use it on my wet hair before blow drying and on my dry hair too- every day</li>
            <li> My youngest likes to have her hair flat ironed once in awhile (she has naturally gorgeous curly hair) - other products left her hair dry and sticky-awful. With this product, professional results were achieved without spending a small fortune at the salon. Left her hair super soft and shiny and more importantly to her - straight. Really nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer.  I have thin, fine hair, so even though it is light, I can only use a tiny amount so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, esp here in humid Florida.  I love the smell and way it smooths my frizzy hair; however I do have one gripe (hence the 4 stars): It needs to have a different delivery system, either a dropper or a top that delivers a smaller amount of fluid.  It is really difficult to get the smallest amt that I need for my hair. Also, I have found it works better for me if I put it on while my hair is wet or damp.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, however, I have super fine hair and it is still a little frizzy at the ends with this conditioner. But overall it improves my hair immensely, it feels great and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> A must have product. The whole line of HSI products is great.</li>
            <li> I love this oil to help keep my hair from frizzing and to help protect it from the flat iron heat. I received my product quickly and it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, dry, colored, with split ends, yet you wouldn&#x27;t know it after using HSI Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner. Finally, I am able to achieve the soft shiny look that my stylist gets from my hair.  Just a few drops applied to towel-dried hair and it&#x27;s easy to brush with no tangles.  A little goes a long way so very affordable.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Will definitely order again.&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/21/14 - I apply it after every shampoo and sometimes on dry hair before using curling iron and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle ordered 5 months ago. HSI has really made a difference in the appearance and condition of my hair.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It actually places a beautiful shine on your hair and works as a detangler. I was impressed because I have coarse hair, and it worked and did not leave my hair feeling very dry if I flat ironed it.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law has this exact same straightener.  I tried hers one day and loved it.  I decided I wanted a straightener too and went to my local CVS and bought the most expensive one they had ($50).  It was a disappointment, so I took it back.  When I asked her where she got hers she told me it was an HSI and she got it on Amazon a while back.  It was still working great even though she&#x27;s had it a while and uses it quite often.  So I decided to get one too.  It is a great product.  Works with one or two passes and makes my hair so shiny and slick!!  I thought I was going to have to pay over $100 for a good one...Thanks Blue Novelties for having such a great product and pricing it reasonably.  I will definitely look to HSI if I need other haircare appliances!!</li>
            <li> I have really long and thin hair I was afraid this product would weigh my hair down or make it greesy. It doesn&#x27;t! I love this product! My hair looks healthy and shiny and it&#x27;s super soft with no static!</li>
            <li> I use product as an overnight treatment once weekly.  I apply the oil to dry hair, wrap my hair in a towel, then go to bed for the night.  In the morning, I rinse and wash my hair.  My hair feels and looks terrific!  It&#x27;s smooth, soft, and frizz free.  I apply a small amount (2-3 drops for long hair) to wet hair after daily wash, blow dry, then use my HSI flat iron to smooth my hair.  This is a great product- good value that promotes healthy hair!</li>
            <li> This is a truly great product.  I have thick and very curly hair.  It will straighten fairly easily, but with other products or without any products, i end up with somewhat \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair.  Not with this Argan Oil, it is great.  It moisturizes the hair very well, leaves it nice and shiny and I LOVE the fragrance.  It may seem like a limited amount given the small container, but it really only takes a few drops.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Love this product, it protects my hair even though I flat iron it daily after sweating from workouts.</li>
            <li> This HSI conditioner is wonderful, using it with the iron that I ordered for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. Both she &amp; I are pleased with both products. Your hair will be silky, shiny &amp; still hold a great curl from the iron. If you are hesitant to try it, go for it, you won&#x27;t be dissappointed. The customer service from this company is outstanding, they will resolve and problem or answer any question you have about your purchase. I will not heistate to purchase from them in the future.</li>
            <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil is a phenomenal product that left my hair feeling silky smooth and frizz free.  I used the product prior to styling with the HSI Professional Flat Iron (also a phenomenal product!). It really protected my hair from the heat styling and made my hair shiny, while adding a beautiful sheen to my hair and highlights. And, an added bonus, a little goes a long way!  I have already recommended this product to friends and am looking forward to hearing if they like the oil as much as I do.</li>
            <li> A gift to my wife for use as a backup straightener, but she prefers this new one to her old one now. She says that it really improves the texture of her fine hair, and it curls and straightens much better than the old iron. It heats up fast and has a wide range of temperatures. Consumers who don&#x27;t like the location of the temperature dial might want to consider that some people actually prefer that location because the temperature stays put once it is selected, unlike side dials. [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]</li>
            <li> This oil left my wife&#x27;s hair very soft to the touch and smooth. She loved the frizz control that the oil was able to give her hair. My hair soaked in the oil. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its very good. Gives nice texture to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a great.leave in to protect from heat. I received a sample with my HSI flat iron and it has been great!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Argan oil after reading so many good reviews and I am so happy I got it. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, it makes is shine and frizz free! I just love the smell of it and everyone around me agrees to that. My hair now looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> Great price for what you get. I have long hair and haven&#x27;t run this this as quickly as I thought I would -- a little goes a long way. The product itself is awesome, but I hate the packaging. For one, it&#x27;s glass, so you have to be careful with where you set it on the counter. This also makes traveling with it really scary. Two, it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump or some other dispensing mechanism. If you accidentally knock it over, forget to tighten the cap all the way, etc., it will all come dumping out -- and rather quickly due to the weight of the glass bottle. As long as you&#x27;re not an accident-prone person or living with kids, you should be okay.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this product.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses this item.  I am assuming it is satisfactory, since I have not heard anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. You can just leave it in, and it seems to leave my hair in nice condition.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of argan oil (different brand) a couple of years ago, but I ended up not using it because I started blow drying and straightening my hair regularly. Fast forward to the present: I was searching for a leave-in product to protect from heat styling, and I was drawn to this one due to the rave reviews and the fact that it contains argan oil. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product! It leaves my hair looking and feeling so healthy and shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair or cause it to appear or feel greasy. I use about a nickel size amount and distribute most of it to the ends of my hair. I also add a smaller amount to the top of my head (what&#x27;s left on my hands after distribution to the rest of my hair), and I&#x27;m amazed that it doesn&#x27;t cause any flattening at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that there was a pump on the bottle, or even a smaller opening that the oil came through, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I will probably purchase a cheap bottle with a pump and transfer it over at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product. 5 stars. Get it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this product on amazon. I constantly use a flat iron and it damaged my hair. Now using this leave in treatment helped revived my hair and looked more healthier. It&#x27;s a must when you use flat irons all the time. I ordered again recently and will definitely order again. Ordering experience with seller is awesome. It came on time and carefully packaged. thank you!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for the perfect oil and found it! I needed a heat protectant oil after buying a high heat professional curling wand. This oil exceeded my expectations! I have very fine hair and was worried the oil would weigh my hair down. It does not at all! It protects my hair from heat, isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, adds the perfect touch of shine, and on top of all that it is affordably priced!</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome, I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love it...&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair very soft and shine.  My hair is damaged from coloring and blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;This oil turns my hair back to shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is wonderful! Was apprehensive at first thinking it would leave my hair oily but that was not the case.  What I got was beautiful shiny glossy hair especially after I used my HSI ceramic flat iron. What a difference a little Argan oil can do and I mean little since it only takes a few drops to get the results I get.  This bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, is a great flat iron for the price.  I had the Solia flat iron before.  It finally broke on me after 7 plus years of almost daily use.  This HSI feels just like my old reliable Solia, but it&#x27;s better because it performs just as well and it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> My first experience with  a flat iron hair straightener.  It was suggested that I only purchase a CHI, but because of price and not knowing whether I would like using a flat iron, I wanted a less expensive one.  This is perfect for me.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved this Argan Oil more than any other because it makes your smooth &amp; shiny -without feeling heavy. It also is a good heat protector and smells nice!!! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have really difficult hair: super fine (my stylist says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;like a baby&#x27;s hair&amp;#34;) and very prone to frizz. It&#x27;s not quite ringlet curly, but is definitely more than just wavy; basically it&#x27;s just a poofy blond mess and looks ridiculous if I don&#x27;t straighten it. I&#x27;ve been dealing with it for close to 20 years now, and have tried MANY different products, but this one is without question the best so far. It just makes my hair so much more manageable and really helps to protect my hard-won straightness from humidity (which is a constant issue in my part of the world). I use quite a lot of it, and often for consecutive days without washing, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down the way many products do. I also think that it does a lot to protect my hair from being damaged by all the straightening I do (my evidence for this is that my hair is now much longer than I have ever been able to have it before; usually it just gets so frayed and broken at the ends that I would have had to cut it months ago). Bottom line: I would recommend trying this product to anyone who wants straighter, shinier hair. It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice. When I straighten my crazy curly hair, this oil helps smooth the ends and also keeps the flyaways to a minimum. NOTE: Super seller. Great followup. They really care what you think and want the customer to be satisfied. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the next great thing for my hair. I usually jump from product to product since most of them make claims they&#x27;ll do this or that but so very few of them actually live up to their claims. This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that I&#x27;ll keep in my hair-care routine. My hair has a tendency to frizz out and be fairly rough to the touch, even with different leave-ins. But with this serum, I can add just the smallest amount before blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair and my hair turns out silky smooth and so soft to the touch, without that heavy greasy feeling or look.</li>
            <li> This has been miraculous for my hair.  I use it daily and also use it very often in my daughters&#x27; hair as well.  One bottle lasts me several months.  It gives my hair smoothness and shine without being greasy and is still easy to style.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very unmanageable hair.  I have tried dozens of different products to get my hair to lay smooth.  I have short hair and I only use a very small amount to get the desired results.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a couple of weeks since I purchased this product.  I am VERY happy with the product.  My hair is so manageable.</li>
            <li> The HSI Argan oil is by far the Best, pre- flat iron protection for my hair. It&#x27;s also great for Frizz Taming hair- this is my 2nd bottle, and I will continue buying this brand- Also, the price is right!</li>
            <li> I like this leave in oil and it make my dry frizzy hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t I find the ingredients for this product anywhere? One reviewer stated that they&#x27;re not even on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;How can I make an informed decision? The FDA is totally useless. They don&#x27;t regulate ANYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re all just guinea pigs. Btw, just referencing animal testing makes me sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE............&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company and they sent me the list of ingredients. It&#x27;s not pure argan oil but a combination of things inluding silicones. Sorry I dont have the ingredients anymore but I didn&#x27;t see anything that concerned me so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  You can immediately feel the difference in how soft and silky it leaves your hair.  I have tried other similar products, but this one is superior.  It also lasts long because only a couple of drops go a long way.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I am a male whose hair has always been thin and dry. It is AMAZING how much of a difference I noticed in the thickness and healthiness of my hair immediately! I am a huge fan and I know this product will become a staple in my hair products.</li>
            <li> It did no work for me</li>
            <li> This product has actually shortened the amount of time it takes me to style my hair. I didn&#x27;t even buy it for that purpose but I&#x27;m thrilled with it! It smooths my hair so well, I actually need to use the flat iron less! I can also choose to go without flat ironing at all sometimes because after just blow drying my hair is still smooth and shiny- just a little wavy.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and I was a little worried about this weighing it down but as long as I use a very small amount it&#x27;s great!  Makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love it a lot! favorite fragrance and make my hair much more smooth than before! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that gets extremely frizzy.  This product really works!  A little goes a long way...I love it!</li>
            <li> I love HSO Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner. I use it everyday as indicated in the bottle. I don&#x27;t have split ends anymore thanks to HSO Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner. The HSI Professional Argan Oil leaves the hair soft and not greasy, and smell good. The results are higher than my expectations.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this oil when I bought the HSI flat iron. I didn&#x27;t think I would end up using it but I decided to give it a try. WOW! I love this product! I use it every time I flat iron my hair and love the results. My hair is shiny and smooth but not greasy looking. Needless to say, I used up the sample and ordered a full bottle of it. I use only a small amount so it lasts a long time. Fully recommend this product for anybody who uses a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price. Perfect oil</li>
            <li> I have been using both products, HSI and Biosilk and per my research both are made by the same company.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the result for my frizzy hair, I like Biosilk much better. I only use 2-3 drops for my shoulder length hair and my hair would be nice and smooth once I blow dry it. With HSI  I have to use more than just a few drops and the result is as not as good as Biosilk. The reason I bought HSI was because it has argan oil and argan oil seems to be very popular today and I wanted to try it :(</li>
            <li> love it, not too greasy for me hair</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was half empty, the cap was open there was oil all over the box.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, not just for my hair, but for my whole body. It has a lovely, delicate scent which relaxes me and makes me feel happy, so I use it as aromatherapy especially when I gently massage it into my skin. I enjoy it so much that I use it every night for my body and just a few drops for my hair after it is washed and dried. It conditions my hair and makes it shiny and manageable. This is a lovely addition to my hair and skin care and I cannot imagine not having it.</li>
            <li> Ok, bought this in bulk last time. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months as the ONLY product after I wash and towel-dry my hair (every 2 days).  I have had shoulder length and more recently short:  wavy, more- thin- than- thick hair.  I pour a tiny bit of the product into my palm, mix it a bit with both hands and then run my hands through my hair particularly where I want to ensure no fly-aways. I can then flatten or fluff the hair as I see fit.  You may need to test the amount you use but it does not take much and it leaves my hair silky and as full/light as I want it to be.  Bottom-line: so easy to use and it loves my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Using a minimal amount protects your hair from the flat iron and makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li> HSI Professional Argan Oil is a must have for daily hair treatment. My hair is colored every 5 weeks, hot dryer, and flat Iron, &amp; it stays super soft and silky with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to buy it with the HSI flat iron the results are amazing and at a fraction of the price of a CHI!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. Works great. Company is A #1. Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It leaves my hair silky smooth and light. I use it before I blow dry, on my near blond highlights that have been bleached one time too many. Sometimes I even put a little extra in on the ends after drying and it smooths the ends down. Bought it at an excellent price, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft and damage free. Hair is not as dry as before. And I love the smell of this product. Blue Novelties is a very good seller, received the product on time and in perfect condition, will order from them again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave-in.  I use it to seal my hair after washing and conditioning, and I use it whenever my hair feels dry.  You only need a tiny bit so a little goes a long way.  This leaves my hair feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked healthier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks, so I don&#x27;t have a full opinion yet.  At this point, I can definitely say that my hair feels silky soft, which was not the case prior to using this.  My hair is pretty frizzy with fly-aways everywhere.  I think that may be toned down SOME at this point, but I&#x27;m still hoping that continued use of the product will make a bigger difference over time.    UPDATE:  I just got my first haircut since using this product.  As my hair stylist worked with my hair, she was commenting on how healthy and moisturized it was, and asked what I was doing differently.  I told her I had started using Argan oil. Before I left the salon, she told me to definitely keep using it because she was \\&quot;very impressed.\\&quot;  This update is just a couple days after my original review, which means that after just a few weeks of using this product, my hair stylist noticed a huge difference in the healthiness of my hair.  Impressive, indeed!</li>
            <li> I had heard of this product through a friend, and, thought I would try it as I have had to use the flat iron alot- my hair began to wave and frizz oddly when I went through menopause. This product helps to prevent my hair from feeling like it&#x27;s getting fried by the heat of the iron.</li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t feeling this hsi argan oil leave in for air drying/ heat styling. Recently however, after watching some relaxed hair ladies on youtube using similar serums to seal in their moisturizer I decided to do so. It is the bizniz! Initially I hesitated, thinking a &amp;#34;coney&amp;#34; serum will damage my hair,thanks to all the cone bashing by other hair gurus. Boy,was I wrong. My moisturizers had all been underperforming. First I thought my hair was protein sensitive, then low porosity, then high porosity,bottom line: my hair couldn&#x27;t be/ stay moisturized! Can you tell my hair WAS confused? (Not me,I&#x27;m ok. Just my hair, lol). I say was,because since using it to seal, my hair has done a complete 360. Awesome sauce! My moisturizer once applied gives my hair a stiff,stringy feel. Once I follow up with hsi, bam! Instant softness &amp; moisture. Something no natural oils/ butters did for me. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil when I received a trial size bottle with my new HSI Flat Iron.  I...love...it!!!  My initial concern was that it would make my hair greasy, but that isn&#x27;t the case at all.  This oil has brought my dry, aging hair (I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s, therefore my hair is too!) back to life!  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years.  Truly a miracle product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairdresser for almost 30 years.  I still work in the salon every day. I purchased this HSI iron, it arrived quickly.  I was so pleased! Good quality, easy to use, and fast! Wont burn your hair.  I was so pleased, I told my daughter about it and she bought one.  So nice to get a good quality item at a wonderful price! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I love this product it really protects your hair from damage. I found my hair looked silky and smooth and healthier. It also is easy to apply and smells great.</li>
            <li> This was costlier but you get what you pay for! I am completely satisfied with this product and I am a woman of color with natural hair. I enjoy versatility in my styles and this product makes my hair smooth, shiny &amp; protected for blow out and flat iron styles. I will continue to use this product. You only use a few drops per amount of hair &amp; do not need to use more! It does what they say it will do so don&#x27;t over do it :) You get your money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
            <li> I was scared this product would make my hair oily but it didn&#x27;t. It just made my hair soft to the touch. I even took my sister a sample to try. Everyone likes the smell also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different oils for my hair.  This one is the best!  You can actually put a lot in without it weighing down your hair or making it greasy looking.  It helps hide some of my really damaged parts.  Good for before or after blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair had poor quality since I curled and dyed it, but this product certainly saved it!&lt;br /&gt;I applied it on the bottom of my hair after washing it, and it turns great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops. Makes my hair more manageable. Feels great in your hair. not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this oil that came as a sample with her HSI flat iron.When the sample was empty she insisted on 2 more bottles of this argan oil.Both products are great.</li>
            <li> I bought a hot iron with HSI, and although I was less than impressed with the hot iron, the sample of Argan oil was great.  It is the best leave in conditioner that I have found.  I ordered the 4 ounce bottle and have been using it for a couple of weeks.  I wish it came in a better container or would have like a better method of getting some of the oil out rather than pouring it on my hand.  All in all, the product is great and worth the cost if you take good care of your hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome.  I just start using it - it leaves my hair silky smooth, and it gives it that &#x27;mirror look&#x27; that you see on women with super healthy hair.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Ive been a regular user of Redken smooth down for years. It works well on my frizz but doesn&#x27;t Moisturize or help the health of my hair. I was looking for one that did both so I tried this one as it is labeled a conditioner. It seems to behave a lot like the redken (but not quite as well) and it still does nothing for the moisture. I wont buy it again</li>
            <li> If you use only a dime size quantity it works very well. I have coarse somewhat damaged hair and this oil helps the texture and overall appearance to be smoother and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I actually quite like this product. Bought it out of curiosity mostly and I&#x27;ve been using it after shampooing my hair. After a month my aging hair seems to have gained a thickness not seen in several years at least in the places where I still have hair!! So far worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair silky and soft</li>
            <li> Although it may be too early to assess W Ultra Beauty ArganGold 100% Pure Argan Oil for hair product, I find excellent results. Recommend a great product.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how wonderful this product is. My ends felt so dry that I was contemplating cutting my hair off. After one day using this oil, my hair felt good. Now after 2 weeks it feels amazing. It does not way my hair down. My hair feels soft and silky. I have tried many other hair oils, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> honestly haven&#x27;t seem much improvement in my hair. Also it makes hair oily quickly. I don&#x27;t get where all the hype is coming from. I have long suspected that some products sold on amazon have fake reviews. Buyers be aware.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and it smells pleasant. There is a lot of product and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s well worth the price and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> HSI Argan Oil is quite thick in formula, much thicker than pure argan oils I have tried. Its texture is thicker than cooking oil, so using too much could make your hair greasy. There is a pleasant hair product scent to it, because it has added fragrance, and it spreads out nicely in your hair, not creating clumps. I like this because it didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything about added shine, but as a leave-in treatment, it definitely did make my hair softer and easier to brush (I usually have slightly wavy, very tangly hair). I noticed this has lots of added ingredients so it is NOT all-natural. If you are looking for an all-natural pure argan oil, this product is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, because it worked amazingly well—making my hair so soft and manageable—I use this every time I come out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the packaging. You&#x27;re only supposed to use a few drops and smooth it through your wet hair, but there is no dropper or pump; it&#x27;s just a screw-top bottle, which means you need to POUR the oil into your palm. Obviously if you pour an oil, you&#x27;re not going to get a perfect 2-3 drops; you&#x27;re going to get a little handful. Fortunately, I had some extra droppers from vitamin C serums laying around, and one of them fit perfectly on the mouth of this glass bottle. You are going to want to invest in a screw-on dropper bottle or pump cap if you want to use this product correctly and not waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this hair oil from HSI Professionals in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to smell like MoroccanOil and the other Argan Oil products I&#x27;ve used the past few years. This does not smell like those. I&#x27;m not seeing as much shine with this either.</li>
            <li> Love this product leaves your hair so soft and it doesnt make it look oily.  Would recommend to others to try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write a review, but this product wowed me! I read most of the reviews on my search took look for a good oil that made me hair look healthy and feel healthy. I had to think about if or a week before spending this amount on this product because I can find Argan oil for much cheaper, and I have used Argon oil but not from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, i keep it straight because is more managable that way. After I wash it I let it air dry then I flat iron it. I use Wen as my shampoo, and thats been working great.&lt;br /&gt;Today after washing the Wen off I put some of this on while still wet. I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot wich is surprising because I have so much hair I could already tell the difference once it air dried! After I finished flat ironing it, my hair was so soft! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I know Wen is already expensive but adding this to my regular hair routine will be a must from now on. It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Just recently I discover this great treatment. I was desperate cause my hair was in very bad healt consequence of the many color and misuse of the iron. After the first apply of this HSI leave in oil I started to feel and see the difference. Therefore I totally recommended it. My poor hair is on the mend</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> This product is so good! I have wavy hair and I use this when my hair is wet. My hair dries up in really nice soft curls!</li>
            <li> This leaves your hair moisturized and silky.  I am an African American woman who has experienced significantly less breakage. I use an amount about the size of a half dollar in my hair once per week when I roller set my hair, and I have definitely seen and felt a difference. I am trying to allow my hair to grow; therefore a combination of significantly reducing the amount of heat I use, deep conditioning once per week, and moisturizing/wrapping my hair with a satin scarf each night has really helped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I used it on everything. After my shower I put it all over my hair and skin. It is not greasy and has a silky feel to it. Ever since I started using this product on my face everyones been complimenting my skin, saying it is very bright and glowing. My hair was super dry and frizzy due to constant dyeing and even bleaching my hair. Since I started using it, it is softer and smooth. This is my number 1 beauty product and have recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This oil has been the long awaited secret to great hair. I have wavy hair and it does the trick. Also cuts down on drying and styling time in a big way. Super fast delivery and pleased!</li>
            <li> This oil is very good for your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking greasy.  I use more than a drop though because I have very thick hair with a natural wave and since I wear it back all the time my hair has been breaking.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> Works very well on my thick hair. It smooths and adds shine.</li>
            <li> The best hair product I have EVER used on my hair. I had a lot of damage due to over processing and wanted something to help repair and protect my hair from future damage. This product has done both. My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s been in years and it&#x27;s finally starting to grow again due to it being so much healthier. It smells great and never leaves a residue or weighs down your hair like some products do. I would highly recommend getting this oil. It&#x27;s worth every penny and then some!!!</li>
            <li> I just got it today,, this product is AMAZING, From the first time I used it I fell in love &amp;#60;3 it is a miracle&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order the big bottle soon...</li>
            <li> This is the best oil I have ever used. I have naturally curly hair, that can sometimes be very dry. This oil helps keep the softness and shine, while also keeping it healthy. I have tried other oils before, and they always left a greasy feeling. I have never had that problem with this oil, and I tend to use a ton of it when I&#x27;m putting it in my hair. The best way I have found to use it is on wet hair, right out of the shower. I can put it in my hair and either leave my hair natural, or blow dry it out. Either way it cuts down tremendously on the frizz, and leaves it healthy and shiny. This is my absolute go to and I am never without it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used! The hair doesn&#x27;t look oily, or all over the place. I apply it before straightening almost every day and looks great. The hair looks healthy and not damaged. Will definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Works great on both wet and dry hair without messing my hand. Felt every drop is absorbed and my hair got softer in the first time use. So far my hair end doesn&#x27;t crack!</li>
            <li> Great product! Completely satisfied! Now this is my  my favorite oil,  It helps tame the frizz, leaves my hair feeling  smooth and healthy.Will recommend to my all my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a handful of times since purchasing and it works really well! You only need a tiny amount each time so the bottle will last for a while. My hair was easier to straighten and after sleeping on it, the next day my hair was still very straight! I like this product a lot and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best Argan Oil I&#x27;ve ever tried.. I use this just about every day, when I get out of the shower, I comb and divide my hair into 4 sections and apply a dime size to all 4 ends. I have pretty damaged hair, but also prone to getting greasy which it will if you get this anywhere near your roots. Then I usually let air-dry if I have time and then curl it with my HSI flat iron. The oil really helps prevent my hair from getting those sizzled ends (those who have damaged, fried hair know what I&#x27;m talking about) and I&#x27;m not kidding it definitely tricks people into thinking I have luxurious, soft, healthy hair. I think if you trim regularly and use this every time you style, your hair won&#x27;t get damaged. I just need to suck it up and get a good trim, continue using this, and I&#x27;ll be set and on my way to growing the last 4 inches before I&#x27;m content with my length.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I&#x27;ve been using the oil on a regular basis and two months later, I still have half a bottle left. My hair is below shoulder length and very thick so it goes to show that little does go a long way for this product (essentially it comes out to $3.75 per month based on usage). The best part is that this product actually does work, my hair is now naturally silky and much healthier than it was two months ago. It nourishes and conditions your hair without making it greasy or creating rapid oil build-up. It also smells wonderful. Easily the best product out there (I&#x27;ve also used Redkin conditioners, Nexus, Loreal, Beverly, you name it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase all around, very happy and will be ordering regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you for a wonderful product HSI!</li>
            <li> My hair stayed smooth and shiny all day.  It looked healthy with no fly-a-ways or oily look.  I will definitely buy more.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Good product, wish it were in an easy pour container.</li>
            <li> Works good on my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this Argan Oil a few months ago, and I am very happy with this product. My hair is very easy to manage, it looks shiny and healthy. I am pleased that the oil doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. It absorbs easily and smells fantastic. You don&#x27;t need to use much, so it will last for a year or even more. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first bottle of argon oil that I have purchased. I kept my 5 yr old niece over the holidays and this is what she used instead of conditioner on her baby fine hair. I have always had problems finding the conditioner that did not leave my hair weighted down or frizzy since my hair is fine. After playing around with it a little bit I realized the best way to use this was to put very little conditioner in my hair and then apply the argon oil after I blowdried it. It leaves my hair very silky but not greasy at all. I also ended up applying the oil to my face and feet instead of lotion at times. I love this product and it also smells very good.</li>
            <li> So addicted to this hair oil! It&#x27;s better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried. I have 3C curls and if not careful, hair oils can make my hair look oily. This one does an amazing job of protecting/keeping my hair hydrated but not too oily. I can use it on the ends on a daily basis and not have buildup.</li>
            <li> Its a good quality product. Its thick and has good volume, but its not greasy at the same time. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came opened and spilled everywhere, waste of money.</li>
            <li> It has nice fragrance and it&#x27;s non-greasy -- very nice. This will be  my long term leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;ll get more for my sister and niece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an argan oil that is non greasy and flake free after multiple uses, and this product has surpass my expectations. I was so impressed of the difference that my hair felt and the light scent was very pleasant. I wash my hair only twice a week and having the oil remain until then prevented it from getting dry and heavy. I loved the product so much that when I discovered there was a flat iron to work along with the oil, I had to get it. The flat iron is great!!!! ️It intensified the oil and made my hair look healthy and shiny. I would highly recommend the oil and definitely the flat iron along with it!!!! Give it a try, you will not be disappointed. My only regret is that I found the two products now and not sooner, could have saved so much money and time. Thank you HSI for creating such GREAT products!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my Beard, it keeps it from becoming frizzy, and when I use a straight iron on my beard it protects it from heat.</li>
            <li> I have purchased MANY straighteners over the years. This one is by far the best one ever. I have extremely curly hair so only straighten my hair occasionally because it&#x27;s such a pain. Since I received this straightener, I&#x27;ve straightened my hair every day (almost 2 weeks now). Could not be happier with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as requested by my wife. She loves it! She has had a long history of dealing with extremely curly/dry hair and could never find products that either didn&#x27;t help or left a greasy residue. This product absorbs into her hair, leaves it feeling soft without any residue. She said she will continue to use this product forever!</li>
            <li> Fantastic ... Protects my hair and leaves it looking and feeling silky smooth after each pass with my HSI flat iron - which is also fantastic. I had a CHI previously and the HSI rivals it EASILY at a fraction on the price. I have coarse fine hair and these products leave my hair looking great!</li>
            <li> I used this months now but dont see any difference.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this item was packaged and delivered. I didn&#x27;t even expect the extra things that came packaged with this product and let alone the great price. I used the standard delivery which can take at least 7 business days and it was delivered to me in 3 to 4 business days. I didn&#x27;t expect the glove, the small container of oil and the red silk cover for the flat iron...Wow! I purchased this flat iron to have as a backup cause when my hair dresser&#x27;s (who is my niece) flat iron died on her she couldn&#x27;t do my hair and I needed a relaxer and my hair needed to be done real bad. She didn&#x27;t have the money to get one right away so I ended up purchasing one for her as an early birthday present cause I needed my hair done. Since one of the hair product stores here was having a sale on flatirons I asked her which one to get and she preferred a Chi which this particular store did not sale plus they are too expensive but she said an Ion works just as good as a Chi. She use to own a real good Chi that cost over $100 and her second flatiron was an Ion flatiron and she told me that the Chi died out on her like about a year but the Ion lasted about two years.&lt;br /&gt;I figured I would purchase one for my self just to have as a backup and decided to order the HSI flatiron after reading the reviews from Amazon. The shipping and packaging is great! My hairdresser tried both the Ion flatiron by using it to style my hair on one side of my head and the HSI on the other to see which one works the best. She also used the oil that came with the HSI cause she left her oil that she normally use at home. I can say that the Ion did work best but the HSI still did the job. I can say that it did straighten my hair and I wish I could post a photo on here cause the next day I took a picture of my hair and went to work and got a few compliments that my hairdo was looking good and that I looked good. So far my HSI professional flatiron has only been used once so a few more uses and if I can geton here and give an update I will try my best to do so. Oh and when I showed my hairdresser the package that my HSI flatiron came in she said, \\&quot;EW I like the bag that it came with, mine didn&#x27;t even come with a bag\\&quot;. She was also surprised at the cost...&lt;br /&gt;Oh and one more thing...I did post my photos on facebook and got compliments from friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I tried it when I bought the HSI iron, and loved it. I have very thin, wavy, frizzy hair that has finally been tamed by this incredible product. It smells great, and it definitely does not leave my hair oily.  I bought other products that claimed to be argan oils, and they were nowhere near as good as this one.  It doesn&#x27;t have an ingredient list, which could only mean 2 things, its only ingredient is argan oil or they just don&#x27;t want to reveal the ingredients.  Either way I would like to find out, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter because this product really works.  The only down side to this is the price, but I do not need any other product for my hair when I have this one, so in that sense I&#x27;m definitely saving money.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair smooth soft and silky. I use it mostly on the ends of my dry hair after styling and it smooths everything out and makes my hair look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I can definitely notice a difference when I use this product. My hair is softer and shinier! I just use a little bit right before blow drying and it gives great results. I&#x27;ve never used any other brand of argan oil, but this one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> horirble.. i guess after trying out the good kind of argan oil.. this one sucks</li>
            <li> Greasy oily it does not work do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I’ve had a lot of luck using Argan oil to extend my hair color between dye jobs. I wish I could explain how it works, but I can’t. It somehow hides my greys and leaves my hair silky smooth, shiny, and looking great. It’s not greasy and gets rid of frizz and flyaways. If you’ve never tried argan oil for your hair, give HIS Professional a try and see how well it works as a leave in treatment, heat protectant, and overall great product for your hair!</li>
            <li> Great product! Comparable to Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> The good: It really does make my hair very slick and smooth...when I can figure out how to apply the PERFECT amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Getting the right amount each time I use it is a real guessing game; would be better if it came with a dropper cap. When I use even a little too much, my hair looks very greasy and no amount of blow-drying changes it. Also, it was naïve of me to take it at face value as far as &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; is concerned...it has a very high amount of silicone in it which makes it seem extra smooth but is very drying to my hair.</li>
            <li> Not amazed, its okay.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product I decided to try it. I gave it a chance a few times but it did  not make ANY difference on my hair. I am disappointed with how much I paid for this &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a thing.</li>
            <li> I have brown straight hair and this unfortunately did not go well with my hair.  Instead of making my hair smooth and shiny, it just makes my hair lumpy :(  Makes it really difficult to dry my hair.    Oh and not to mention, it arrived with oil spilling out like many others. The cap wasn&#x27;t sealed tight, causing some of the oil to leak out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil had spilled out into the packaging and soaked the product container - there was no seal under the cap - hum???.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it - concerned with the credibility of the product.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff!  My hair looks healthy, shiny, and feels soft.  I will definitely order again when I run out.  I have thin naturally wavy hair but I often straighten it with a flatiron.  I put this on just out of the shower or when my hair dries before blow drying or straightening.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll apply some extra to the ends the next day between washings.  My hair is very dry from dying over many years.  Recently I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal Total Repair Extreme, the shampoo, &amp; the Total Repair Extreme Damage Erasing Balm, alternating the balm with the conditioner of the same name.  The change in my hair with these products is nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry, damaged looking, AND feeling hair.  I run my fingers through my hair, and it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not the same hair!</li>
            <li> I like this hair oil, I bought HSI CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER with this oil. I am not very much satisfied with Hair Straightener, but I love this oil. This makes your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will never use another argan oil. this stuff is the best and you only need a tiny bit. I HAVE TRIED OTHERS BEFORE AND THEY DON&#x27;T WORK THE SAME.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky smoothe</li>
            <li> This hair product does wonders! Leaves your hair silky smooth, somehow fixes your bad ends, and it rejuvenates your hair. It&#x27;s made from moroccan oil which is one of the best organic oils in the market.&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it somehow doesn&#x27;t leave your hair extremely shinny and greasy. Which is great, for me anyways. I personally don&#x27;t use hair products but this thing, I love it, leaves it looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Great oil that does what it is supposed to do but I don&#x27;t care for how it smells.</li>
            <li> I tried another argan oil, but I like this one better.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  I have used lots of straightening products and this is by far the best.  Silky smooth and it straightened so fast. :)</li>
            <li> This product is great.....I received the little sample when I ordered the HSI flat iron (which I love also) and had to order the big bottle.  It smells great and leaves your hair soft and silky.  It does not weigh it down one bit and I use it every day before blow drying and before flat ironning.  Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li> Becareful!!  You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product at one time!  If you use it sparingly it will leave your hair soft and shiny!!  The ony reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think they could improve on the smell a little.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad my any means, just not quite the fragrance I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> My hair is a big fluff ball. I&#x27;ve been looking for healthy ways to both maintain and style it and this little product does the trick! my hair comes out soft and undamaged after applying heat!</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair! It makes my hair feel so smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> I love this! I have coarse, long, curly hair which is finally tamed, glossy, healthy, and looks glamorous thanks to HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER. I don&#x27;t use a flat iron, and do let my hair dry naturally. I use the HSI Argan Oil when my hair is at that almost dry stage by gently pouring a dollop into my hand and lightly massage it through the tresses. My hair seems to drink it in, leaving it shiny and smooth. Just be careful with the amount, because a little does go a long way. Too much will leave it feeling a bit heavy. The scent is very pleasant and fragrant. The price is decent, plus you get delivery from Amazon, which is great, too!  I&#x27;ve finally found a great Argan Oil product that I can appreciate and would recommend. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I have curly hair but everytime I straightened it I put it on my hair and it leaves it looking healthy, shiny and silky. I highly recomend it! This is a very good oil for the hair! Happy with my purchase and will continue buying it :)</li>
            <li> Great product with a pleasant aroma.  Works like more expensive treatments at a better price, leaving my hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> I put this product on before I straighten my hair and it makes it so soft and silky! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing, amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Natural curly, frizzy hair, that takes a while to straighten. Typically without this product my long hair looks very dry and odd. With it its soft and smooth and healthy as can be!</li>
            <li> I like it so far, but the only bad thing is that it makes my scalp itchy at times.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it after blow drying my hair. Just a few drops rubbed around in my palms, then rubbed through my hair before straightening leaves by hair very soft and feeling moisturized and protected. My hair is shiny and very touchable. I don&#x27;t worry about damage from over styling when I&#x27;m using this Argan Oil. This bottle goes a long way, as too much causes greasy, slick looking hair. A must for my morning routine.</li>
            <li> This is not pure argan oil.  Argan oil is the 3rd ingredient and is among about 10 ingredients.  BUT, that is what I like about this oil ... it is not too greasy.  I also have used pure argan oil, and it is leaves my hair with that greasy/oily look if I put it in when my hair is dry.  This HSI oil can be used on wet or dry hair and not leave it oily or greasy looking (if you only use a drop or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great at conditioning and protecting my hair, while also smoothing the frizzies.  The added bonus is that it smells really nice ... nothing strong, just a nice, clean scent.  The only thing that is missing is this jar does not have a dropper or pump to dispense it.</li>
            <li> I received this glass bottle of Argan oil to use on my daughters 4B hair. The smell isn&#x27;t loud but I was very disappointed that my bottle was open and leaking oil; the top wasn&#x27;t sealed at all.</li>
            <li> amazing product!  Left my hair shiny and silky!  A must have for me, a new forever product!!!  Love!!!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I love how this HSI Argon Oil left my hair, shine, smooth &amp; beautiful. It will be my only hair product when straightening my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  It leaves my hair shiny  I would definitely  recommend to my friends  already recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther</li>
            <li> I order this product based on reviews, and I am very satisfied. It leaves my hair soft and not oily which is a great + for me. I have very thick, coarse and wavy hair it really helps manage my hair and control friz.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! This adds a little weight &amp; luster to unmanageable fine hair. This product keeps the hair looking moisturized &amp; healthy. 5-6 drops massaged through the hair is all I need.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it leaves your hair soft and detangles well.  Only con is that you have to be very careful not to use too mucch or your hair will be look very greasy</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for hair and skin. I have hair that can tend to get oily fast, and I struggle with applying conditioner because I never know if it is really needed and then regret how frizzy/over oily my hair looks after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;Enter leave in Argan Oil conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this product smell amazing and make you feel great because it is totally natural, but it also genuinely conditions my hair without making it overly greasy and it also benefits my skin when I am applying it.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last forever- love this product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite HSI product! The leave in-treatment really does help make my bleached hair feel softer and smoother. I got it on sale, which was a plus! I am sold on HSI products and styling tools.</li>
            <li> After back and forth a few messages with company’s customer service I got small bottle 4 oz. of Argan oil leave-in treatment conditioner. I have to say that company has very good customer service with immediate response.  Even after first use I was impressed. I will explain why. Those who have bottle bleach wavy hair knows that the challenge is to keep hair nourished and out of frizz.  Additional, living in Florida where 90 % humidity all year long, my long blond hair is brutal and dry. I have arsenal of conditioners, leave-in treatments and moisturizers for my hair but all works for a day and after that need wash my hair because it looks like dull and unwashed. I am always in search of “miracle “and I have to say I was very skeptical about that product with the assumption that will one more bottle in my drawer.  But what a surprise got from HSI Professional leave-in treatment conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Company claimed:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Instantly Makes your hair silky, shiny and gives it a healthy look- check mark - true&lt;br /&gt;2.  Residue free, non-greasy, ultra-light- check mark- true&lt;br /&gt;3.  Can be used before styling (flat iron hair straightner, dryer) for extra thermal protection – check mark-true&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I discovered the Moroccan &#x27;liquid gold&#x27;. It gives to my hair constant nourishment and incredible shine, very healthy look, lots of shine and velvet smoothness. That leave-in treatment conditioner feels really light on my hair, without building up residue or being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Every day use of that treatment help to my hair looks healthy and finally I got compliment about my healthy hair from coworkers. I never thought that will happen. Will I buy leave-in treatment conditioner again – ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li> This product is the bomb!! Makes my hair really shinny and soft with no greasiness and it smells awesome!! . A little goes a long way. It also has a heat protectant. I use it in conjunction with the HSI flat iron. My hair has never looked better and I have received compliments on how shinny and healthy my hair looks which is amazing since I damaged it pretty bad from coloring/hi-lighting.  I have a drawer full of hair products that will not get used now that I have this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have significantly less split ends, and my hair feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Bought this as a give for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for about a week, but I can really see and feel a difference.  The best way to describe the difference is that it makes my hair look and feel healthy and takes away the \\&quot;frizzyness.\\&quot;  I think I&#x27;m hooked.  Gret product, good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of, and used, argan oil before, but never heard of HSI. WELL... I highly recommend the brand. Their straightener and leave-in conditioner were incredible. I was a bit skeptical after reading all of these crazy, lovestruck reviews, but I gave in and bought their products since I was using the same straightener and CVS brand frizz-no-more something or other product for years. I&#x27;m officially sold and I highly recommend their products to whoever is reading this.</li>
            <li> Had to back my good review because this product didn&#x27;t work for me in long run. My hair now all eatchy.</li>
            <li> works terribly -- tried it on silky yet curly hair that tends to frizz. this did nearly nothing to minimize the frizz.  would recommend coconut or jasmine oil as much cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I rub it through my hair and it leaves my hair silky and shiny. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Just received this product and I am very pleased.  The bottle is very small so don&#x27;t be surprised when you receive it.  However, it&#x27;s not deceptive advertising - the ad clearly states that it&#x27;s a 4 oz bottle.  Anyway, I doubt that really matters because the product itself is FANTASTIC and it takes only a very small amount to do the job.  I have very thick, dry, coarse shoulder length hair which soaks up any sort of conditioner.  I used a TINY amount of this product (like two very small drops -about 1/4 a teaspoon at the most), and rubbed it into my hair.  It imparted IMMEDIATE shine and silkiness.  It has a very pleasant, light fragrance.  A little goes a long, long way.  When I used my flat iron there was no smoking or odd odor - and my hair straightened very well.  I love it and will reorder.</li>
            <li> wonderful oil. It glides on and absorbs almost immediately. Great additive  to massage oil.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves hair looking shiny and healthy.  This is good for anyone who wants there hair to look alive!</li>
            <li> I have been using this argan oil since December 2014 and I must say it makes my hair so soft. I have naturally frizzy hair and coloring and straightening had made it worse. So I thought of giving this oil a try and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is how I use it: After a wash I let my hair air dry and when it is damp (not wet), I pour a little of it on my palm and rub my palms together to spread the oil. Then I run my hands in my hair (nowhere near the scalp as my scalp gets naturally greasy). And then let my hair air dry completely. Once it is dry, my hair feels so soft and no frizzes even if my straighten my hair. After applying this argan oil, I can go for 4 days without any frizz or greasiness but just silky soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love the way my hair feels when I use this argan oil. It is definitely better than most of the big brands available in the market! And all those who are still thinking whether to buy this, I would say: yes, go ahead and get rid of your frizzy hair with this argan oil!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil especially since I use the flat iron quite often. I really have seen a difference in my hair since I have used this oil. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem so dried out.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works gud for me. Bought a 4oz , u don&#x27;t have to use a lot just a lil and turn down your flat iron when using. Just let the oil soak in your hair at first then style.</li>
            <li> Love this! Good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil! Smells great and I put in wet hair to condition ends. Also use to tame fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! A miracle for people with dry hair! A must have! I totally recommend this product to everyone! Loved it!</li>
            <li> So far, so good! It makes my hair much silkier/softer which I love.</li>
            <li> As a background, I have very thick hair. I leave this conditioner in my hair and let it dry naturally. A little goes a long way with this product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to it. It has a nice smell to it as well, which is a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product and leaving it in my hair, it&#x27;s left my hair so silky smooth and shiny. It seems to have rejuvenated my hair from damage that&#x27;s stemmed from styling. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments after use of this product. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick, oily hair.  I usually can&#x27;t use oils on it because I end up looking like I dipped my hair in grease.  At first, I used this extremely sparingly--not getting too much of a result.  I was too nervous to put a lot on my hair.  After reading these reviews, I decided to try using a quarter size or more on my hair.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE.  My hair is soooo shiny and sleek.  I use no products on my hair--NONE.  I shampoo, condition, blowdry, and straighten every day.  And I only take about 5-10 minutes at the very most to straighten.  This stuff makes my hair so soft and easy to &amp;#34;style.&amp;#34; I am thrilled to find a 4 oz bottle on sale for $24.99 too! Will continue to use and recommend!</li>
            <li> I will swear by this product until the day I die, my hair has never felt softer or more conditioned. My hair is really long so maintaining split ends is no joke, but this has kept my hair healthy and moisturized. It&#x27;s all I can ask for. It can be pricey but it&#x27;s worth the indulgence.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am an African American woman with natural brown hair. Due to the color of my hair i and natural state it dries out very easily. I I order this product  and flat iron after reading the reviews. However, I was not impressed by this product. I have had better experiences using Argan Oil by One and Only. This product, in my opinion did not protect  the hair shaft from exposure to the blowdryer and flat iron. It left my hair feeling sticky. I ended up using my Argan Oil by One and Only and had better results. This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great for African American hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because (1) I needed to protect my hair from all the straightening I&#x27;ve been doing recently, and (2) the MoroccanOil I&#x27;ve been using takes so long to ship. The reviews on this were great, and I&#x27;m so happy I tried it - I&#x27;ll be now using it in place of the MoroccanOil. It leaves my hair looking amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t make it look oily or full of product at all, just salon-fab. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily before flatironing my hair and sometimes after. It is light and smells amazing! It protects my hair and makes it super shiny and smooth.  It is the best hair oil I have ever tried and it&#x27;s a reasonable price too! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I just put some on my palm and rub in my wet hair-- it leaves hair frizz-free. Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I just love this oil, makes my hair so soft and it has protected it from the heat. I will forever continue to buy it. I am telling everybody about it.</li>
            <li> Not the best heat protectant but it works the best for restoring damaged broken or bleached hair. It&#x27;s a bit oily best for dry hair.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were fried after lightening it in the past and I haven&#x27;t cut it in 2 years in an attempt to get it longer. Needless to say, it was looking awful. This product made my hair sooo soft and healthy looking and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I would say I will be buying this product again, but since a little goes a long way, this bottle had so much that I might not be buying more for a very very long time. Try this, people! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like this Argan oil I had started using it when I bought the flat iron a small bottle came with the flat iron for free.  I liked the shine it gave my hair when I used the flat iron. This bottle is a good size and since you only have to use a small amount this should last for a really long time, you have to be careful not to use to much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for great price.  Half the price of other web sites.  Makes my hair shiny and soft.  No frizz</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used other argan oil products from other sources and they did not perform as well as this product.  It leaves hair silky and with great shine and allows hair to remain pliable until the next shampoo. Buy it...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is such a g r eat hair treatment. I use it every day. It protects my hair from flat iron heat and I have never had hair this shiny. Never is greasy, very light and gentle.</li>
            <li> after all these months, I still use this product almost every day.  Please give it a try, and if you regret it send the rest to me!</li>
            <li> This product really works. Calmed down my frizzy hair. Have been blow drying only instead of flat ironing everyday. Have tried many argan oil brand and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife she told me she tried several hair oils over the years she said this is the best thing she&#x27;s ever used will never use anything else but HSI</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, it makes my hair feel ft and shiney even after blowing my hair dry every day</li>
            <li> I bought this at the last minute (impluse buy) but based on all the positive reviews I figured it would be a safe bet.  It smells great, isn&#x27;t too oily, definitely makes my hair very shiny, and is affordable.  Drawbacks- I still have fly-aways even after ironing my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t completely frizz free.  I have VERY think hair and iron it probably every 3 days.  I can never get that salon look or the texture like after a Japanese Straight Perm but this product gets me to the mid-way mark.  Overall great product for the price but I will probably keep looking for that secret formula.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Works great, leaves my hair feeling sleek. HOWEVER, I was unhappy to find that there are artificial ingredients including artificial colors. I try to go all natural.</li>
            <li> Love this oil will always keep a extra</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how awesome this stuff is! My hair feels like silk! I put in about a quarter of product into my hair while damp and work it through the ends then blow dry.  Normally my hair is frizzy due to the heat in FL but with this product my hair looks silky and smooth all day.  I&#x27;ve been spending big money on expensive products and nothing has worked as well.  Highly recommend! Price is great, but it works which is what matters!!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is 7 and I use it when I flat iron her hair to help reduce damage from the heat, or when I want to touch it up and add a bit of shine. A little bit goes a long way. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I never felt my hair so soft, light and manageable super love this and great tandem with hsi flat iron! I tried the free sample and now i purchased a full size bottle. Will surely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great customer service! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this as a leave in conditioner. It smells great. I&#x27;ve also put it on my skin after showering and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Really nice product! I have really thick hair and when I am blow drying and straightening a lot it gets fragile and frizzy. I tried this stuff this morning and my hair looks really healthy and smooth. Very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I normally dont write reviews, but this is one of my most satisfy purchase thru Amazon.  After reading the reviews, I decide to give it a try.  I have natural coarse curly asian hair, and if I just blow dry without anything conditioner, I would be very frizzy.  But I tried the HSI Argan oil on my damp hair before blow dry, the result was pretty amazing. It feels silky smooth and manageable.  I wouls not hesitate and recommend this to my friends who might have the same problem with my hair. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Ok so...I&#x27;ve been using argan  oil in general for about 2 years then I ran out -sad face-. I totally forgot where I purchased the last bottle from and decided to just get it from my favorite place to shop (amazon obviously). I&#x27;ve Read countless reviews of other brands and honestly 3 or 4-ish stars just isn&#x27;t enough for my spoiled taste but after using this oil I must say I&#x27;m more than satisfied.  A little goes a LONG way and it detangled my 3c/4a (otherwise uncooperative strands) natural hair making it soooooo much easier to comb...geez lol.  Anyway if your not bothered by the original price when its not on sale...and you value quality not quantity, then this should definitely be a staple in your hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen plenty of old ladies with lovely soft gray hair, but mine&#x27;s coming in frizzy and coarse. The Argan Oil helps, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products that didn&#x27;t. If you want smooth and shiny, use it with the flat iron, but you can skip the iron just to control frizz.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Argan oil products and this serum is my favourite.  It smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s the only product I use for blow drying and straightening my hair.  2 of the bottles I ordered were broken but the company quickly replaced the products without any hassle.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a flat iron often because of the potential damage it can do to my hair. That being said, I like this conditioner and like the way it protects. While most people (probably) use it during heat styling, I also use it as just a leave-in even when I don&#x27;t style with a flat iron. My hair ...and its curls...are shiny and quite tame. Because of where I live, I can&#x27;t speak about humidity, but it helps the moisture stay in my hair. I also use it in between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the very small amount needed for the hair, this quite a bargain!</li>
            <li> Ordered this a few weeks ago; about a year after buying my HSI flat iron. I had tried on the sample that came with it back then and I was very happy with how my hair turned out, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a mixture of the hair products I&#x27;d used. In the meantime, I was using a different brand of argan oil with agreeable results, but I had to treat my hair daily with the oil and iron to keep it manageable. Had I bought this sooner, I would not have wasted so much time on my hair; it&#x27;s about 30 inches long and it was becoming a burden, so much so that I was considering getting a haircut. But as soon as I incorporated the HSI argan oil into my weekly hair routine, my hair is no longer something I worry about every day. I am very stingy with the amount of oil I use, and even just a little goes a long way and keeps my hair smooth (and smelling great) for 3-5 days in my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent as well. When this bottle arrived home, half of its contents had spilled out into the box. I was very annoyed by this situation, but completely forgot about it when I shared this with BeautyChange and got set another bottle, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Highly satisfied with this product. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling to keep their hair in control.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff that I have found leaves your hair feeling silky</li>
            <li> I had been using Moroccan Oil, which I liked, but decided to give this a try since it was less expensive.  I am very happy with it so far.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy which allows me to go longer between shampoos.  My hair seems to get straighter with this product but some of the ends are a little more frayed.  Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> A relative of mine had an HSI straightener, when I tried hers, I was amazed, and when she told me the price, I HAD to order one of my own. With my straightener came a sample size of this serum, I absolutely LOVED it, so I decided to purchase the full-size product. HSI offers AMAZING value, salon-like results, and all at a great price. If you are in the market for a straightener, I strongly recommend theirs, it is half the price of a Chi, with much better results and durability. If you are in need of a serum, get this one! It smells wonderful and absorbs super fast, and for the price, it&#x27;s a pretty good size container of it - you only need very little to do the job, so it will last you. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I must say this is unbelievable. I put it on my hair after shower and it dries up sooo soft without even using the hot iron and when I do use it, the results are even better. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Worked as others had written. BUT, I had it about a week when I dropped it. (Argan oil is very greasy.) Why, oh, why, do they package bathroom supplies in glass?  All gone; glass all over the place; greasy oil all over the place ;- (((    Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> It made my hair in great condition but I only use it on the ends...</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom, she loves it, said it makes her hair soft and silky.  Planning on trying this for myself soon</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all of the recommendations I saw on here.  All of the reviews said to use it with the straightener and how wonderful it is.  Perhaps it is because I already use quality products (Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner, Kenra blow dry spray, Sebastion Shaper plus hairspray) on my hair but I honestly did not see a huge difference between using it and not using it.  I tried it with different amounts.  I tried it when my hair was wet, when my hair was damp, and when my hair was dry.  The only thing I can say is that I couldn&#x27;t use it when my hair was completely wet or it would almost leave it oily looking.  I will try it again in the spring / summer to see if it helps when the humidity is high.  If it does, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Bought a long time, just use it, rub the hair soft and bright, and I like it.</li>
            <li> love this product. Have purchased several times from amazon. This bottle arrived with the bottle cap loose and a couple ounces wasted. Will definitely purchase again because it provides protection from flat irons with no buildup and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I pour about a dime size - my hair is shoulder length. Smells nice and leave my hair feeling soft and thick.</li>
            <li> This product will last for months. Makes my hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I have very thick, coarse hair and this oil leaves it feeling very silky and manageable. Wonderful for use with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I have thick,curly,frizzy hair and this oil is exactly what my hair needed.You only need a small amount and it does an amazing job!I have purchased very expensive oils and none have worked until this one.I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample of HSI argan oil  when I purchased the HSI Flat Iron. I have thick, curly and dry hair, I put the oil in my hair before I flat ironed my hair. My hair is shiny and soft. Can&#x27;t wait for the full size bottle to be available on Amaon!</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny when using this product.  I have only used for a few weeks now so can not tell if it is helping shield my hair from high heated styling tools.  But so far no problems and love the shine my hair has.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smooths my hair without making it look oily.</li>
            <li> Received a trial size bottle of the oil with my flat iron purchase and I was quite impressed! I put it on before blow drying my hair and instantly noticed a difference.  My hair was smooth and manageable. I usually have very frizzy hair after i blow dry and I noticed that wasn&#x27;t the case after using the oil.  I could easily run my fingers through my hair! The end result after using my HSI straighten was amazing.  My hair looked great! I was actually contemplating cutting my hair soon but now that i have these great products that give me long straight healthy looking hair I don&#x27;t think i want to!</li>
            <li> Great product, pleasant smell. A little bit goes a long way, will recommend for smooth finish for both straight or curly hair</li>
            <li> I have been using HIS Argan Oil for about a year now and my hair is very soft and silky.  I Love the Stuff!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this HSI ARGAN oil with my HSI Flat Iron last February 2013. When I opened the bottle, it smells really good, applied it and did an excellent job with my flat iron. This HSI flat iron was the best straightener I’ve ever used and with this HSI ARGAN oil, it made my life so easy! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, makes it shine and stress-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought another set of this HSI Argan Oil from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the girls&#x27; must have.. I am pleased with this leave in product. I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> HSI argon oil is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It adds a silky feel to my hair but is not greasy or oily. HSI smells nice and a little goes a long way. Works well for straightening, blow drying and for just letting colored hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I like the Argan oil leave in conditioner and i use it regularly. Very small portion of the oil is enough for one application and the hair are smooth and silky. i will definately buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It made my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down.  I have thick but fine hair so it has been hard to find a product that worked and didn&#x27;t make my hair flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a question about the product and was also very happy with the quick response.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience.</li>
            <li> Off all the products I&#x27;ve used to help control my wavy/thin/frizzy hair, this is the best. It&#x27;s the only one that really tames the frizz and it leaves my hair soft and not greasy after I&#x27;ve flat ironed it. I use about a half teaspoonful on my shoulder length hair and it smells great too. I would recommend it to anyone who uses a flat iron or blow dries their hair.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my hair silky and manageable.  Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping your hair conditioned. I put about a quarter sized into my hair after washing and before drying, tends to get rid of tangles and help with split ends. (Note that I also have treated/bleached ends and I straighten my hair on a daily basis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; as suggested, however. It is fairly dense oil and will cause your hair to look greasy. Once after washing your hair is good.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered almost immediately, so first of all I was very happy with the service. The product really delivered as well, it is great stuff! just a little bit goes a long way so keep that in mind when dispensing the product..it leaves my hair soft and shiny, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female and this works great for me and my daughter. Protects my hair from heat like it says and also keeps it soft and shiny all day. I always disliked oils in my hair because they sat on top of the hair, but this doesn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;m not breaking out from oil sliding from my scalp to my face and I&#x27;m not leaving trails of oil on everything my head touches. If someone touches my hair, they aren&#x27;t caked in the oil either. They can only exclaim about how soft my hair feels. I also love the smell! It&#x27;s very pleasant!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my gf and this is what she had to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for about 2 weeks and although I have to use more than the recommended &amp;#34; few drops&amp;#34; because of my ridiculously thick hair I&#x27;ve really come to enjoy and rely on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just overall, my hair has been healthier on the ends, softer and smoother.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can feel the hair getting smooth immediately after using this oil. It&#x27;s super easy to use, and not greasy at all. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I recommend this conditioner to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair is much healthier and softer then before. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I have ever done was to buy my wife the hair iron and oil. She loves them both and uses the oil on my 2 daughters hair as well</li>
            <li> Best argan product that I&#x27;ve used thus far! I&#x27;ve bought Josie Maran before but this product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as weighed down and I see a visible improvement when using this. My hair stylist says my hair&#x27;s never looked healthier!!</li>
            <li> I have thrown out all my other hair products! This stuff is great!  it leaves my hair smooth, silky, and full of shine! I was concerned it might make my hair look oily, but that is not the case at all - just looks healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i found this product on Amazon. Split ends has always been my problem due to frequent blowdrying, and styling. Now that I started using HSI Professional Argan Oil, i noticed that i don&#x27;t have hair split ends and dry ends anymore. This product really makes styling easy. My hair looks glossy which make me happy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this product because it makes my natural hair soft and manageable....</li>
            <li> I like to wear my natural, 4b hair straight. I also have hypothyroidism which is very hard on hair. Between the heat styling tools and my thyroid, maintaining healthy, moisturized hair is a losing battle, especially through Ohio winters. My hair is so much healthier this winter  with HSI Profeesional Argan Oil. It makes my coarse hair much more soft and manageable and using it everyday doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and weighed down. My hair isn&#x27;t dry and brittle so I haven&#x27;t had a lot of breakage like I normally do during the winter months. Flat ironing much less damaging because I don&#x27;t have to do as many passes to get smooth, shiny straight hair. And since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get good results, I won&#x27;t go broke maintaining my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes hair soft and shiny, even if you don&#x27;t iron over it. Keep watching the price, it swings between 14.99 to 24.99</li>
            <li> This product adds shine without making the hair feels greasy.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for flat ironing. Blue Novelties has been wonderful to work with.  I had a question regarding packaging and they were very prompt in replying adequately.  I just purchased my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! This makes my hair smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is smooth as silk when I use it, and I only have to use it once after washing my hair and I can straighten it and it&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT (light, soft, and ridiculously smooth) for days afterward, much longer than when I straighten it with just the other stuff I use. The Argan Oil really sets it off.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This oil is very effective. It reduces hair dryness and makes it healthier. Hair will also resist excessive heating due to flat ironing. I only wish it&#x27;s larger in size or cheaper in price. I would use it daily! Thanks!</li>
            <li> ONG IM IN LOVE WITH THIS ORGAN OIL</li>
            <li> wow, i am someone who has bought tons of serums only to be disappointed. this one is fabulous. i am not sure how much i paid but i believe it was reasonable. i would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the HSI argan oil leave-in conditioner. It leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny without any kind of oily or greasy feeling at all. I even love the way it leaves my hands feeling soft and smooth after I&#x27;ve applied it to my hair. I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.  It not only protected my hair from the heat, it made my hair extremely soft and added some flow to my hair.  You don&#x27;t even need to apply a lot; I applied just under a teaspoon amount and rubbed it between my hands before brushing it through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I got the sample size when I purchased the HSI straightener and fell in love with it immediately. My hair looks so soft and silky and feels soo much healthier too. Love how it only takes about a dime size for my long hair and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil! Ive never used it before buying this product. And its just pure amazing for my naturally curly hair. It stays beautiful bouncy non-frizzy and wonderful after using it. Especially nice for straightening hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! She uses it all the time. Highly recommended!</li>
