    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These use to be wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great quality and there are soooo many in this package which is great because I lose them constantly/leave them everywhere!</li>
            <li>I used to love these, they were perfect!</li>
            <li>Now here&#x27;s the good news...</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is a great solution</li>
            <li>These used to be a good product</li>
            <li>The good part is that the package has a lot of them</li>
            <li>so it is a nice price value.</li>
            <li>These used to be really good, but they break easily now.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great if you don&#x27;t want your hair band to be obvious.</li>
            <li>and I felt like they needed to be a bit larger, but that was my own fault for assuming they were the perfect size and not double checking.</li>
            <li>I ended up carrying a pocket full to get me through the day as they disintegrated.</li>
            <li>Your lucky to get one use out of these ones.</li>
            <li>These are nice and string and can be used more than once unlike some other ties we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>About a month ago after lots of cussing (I&#x27;m not normally a cussing girl) and lots of headaches, I started my search for a good elastic.</li>
            <li>I took my problem to social media and one of my friends said to double them up and poof magic, they are almost as good as before.</li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely thick hair and they would hold it beautifully.</li>
            <li>These used to be the the only elastics that worked for my both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair as we both have very fine and silky hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they have changed recently</li>
            <li>but i tried three more and all was the same.</li>
            <li>Even when one doesn&#x27;t break while putting it in your hair, definitely do NOT count on it remaining intact to be able to use it twice.</li>
            <li>Fine and certainly not a thick main.</li>
            <li>They do not bust automatically when you stretch them nor do they break off in your hair right after you place them, they are by far superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>The first one I used broke straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li>They work really well and do their job.</li>
            <li>but they were brown and much stronger material.</li>
            <li>add too much banding for a pony tail.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many clear elastic bands from various sources and have to say that Goody brand is still the way to go!  </li>
            <li>Despite my better judgement, ignored the recent reviews for these bands and placed an order when I ran out recently.  </li>
            <li>anyone knows something like the older version of the product, or where we can get the old stock, let us know!</li>
            <li>and I think I can live with them like this.</li>
            <li>Then I bought a new pack--it says (c)</li>
            <li>I usually just go to the dollar store for these - but needed more and decided just to order them on amazon.</li>
            <li>Goody completely cheapened this product!</li>
            <li>Completely unreliable!</li>
            <li>These stretch quite a bit but are only good for one use at a time because they don&#x27;t go back to their small shape.  </li>
            <li>With fine hair, you need a stretchy elastic that you can wrap a few times around the hair, but these elastics have no give to them.</li>
            <li>They are more like a hard plastic</li>
            <li>Great price and quantity but disappointing product.</li>
            <li>I picked mine up at Walmart, thinking I was getting a pack of the clear elastic bands I&#x27;m used to buying and using in my hair.  </li>
            <li>A few years back they were made from a more durable material but clearly they&#x27;ve been cheapened.</li>
            <li>Goody, I&#x27;ve used these for years and they used to last for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Not very stretchy, but they&#x27;re all right for what I needed.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the older version of these and was so disappointed when I opened the package and the first four that I tried to use snapped as soon as I stretched them around the end of my braid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really disappointed that this company cheapened their product (of course not the price though) in order to make their customers use and buy more as they break so easily.</li>
            <li>Bring your old string bands back!</li>
            <li>Goody used to make the best clear elastic hair ties, but they are now the worst.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 1.5 YO baby&#x27;s fine hair, and found that, despite their small size, there&#x27;s no real stretch to these elastics that allows me to use them.</li>
            <li>I just finished an old pack--it says (c) 2006 and doesn&#x27;t have a woman on the cover--where each band would last weeks or months before getting too stretched out or just lost.</li>
            <li>Was hoping that the few positive reviews were true but these are not good.  </li>
            <li>These things are cheap and no matter how much or little you spend on them, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>

            <li> These things are cheap and no matter how much or little you spend on them, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> However,  I expected them to be bigger than they actually were.</li>
            <li> Usually goody products are great but this seller must have a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my 2 year-old&#x27;s hair, which is getting long.</li>
            <li> I can have my hair in a pony tail and feel something strange and realize the band just broke, for no reason.</li>
            <li> And I really don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was in a business meeting last week when I felt my ponytail start melting down the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> I use to love these ponies, but these new ones are worthless.  </li>
            <li> or so I feel it break and snap loose.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in black from a local retailer and they break almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The previous elastics could be used several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Out of the 75 pieces included only about half were usable.</li>
            <li> I only use these to tie back a small section of my hair (the old half up half down look).</li>
            <li> These have absolutely no elasticity in them.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> This is only after a few hours or so of wearing them.</li>
            <li> They are not really elastic.  </li>
            <li> They are thin, flimsy and break on a regular basis --- not like the old ones that you could use over and over again.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they changed their formula and how they make them, but these don&#x27;t hold anything and break instantly.</li>
            <li> I find they get tangled in my hair just as much as other ponytail bands.  </li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d be like the old Goody elastics I used to buy, but these are not very stretchy, making it extremely difficult to get them in the hair of a wriggling toddler without hurting her.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time even though I have really thick long hair.</li>
            <li> If on the rare times they don&#x27;t snap before I get them in my daughters hair, they would slide down and either snap in her hair or slide down so far her hair is hanging all over the place and looks horrible within minutes of styling.</li>
            <li> I need small sizes because I don&#x27;t have thick hair and bigger bands</li>
            <li> Thinking it was maybe a fluke, I was a little gentler moving forward.  </li>
            <li> Cannot use them on my little girl&#x27;s thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Upon reaching back, I was mortified to realize that the band had broken.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into Pinterest hairdos, well you could plain forget it.</li>
            <li> I can use these for very small pieces of hair (like the end of a small braid) but not much else.</li>
            <li> Now half of them snap at the worst of times, like when you&#x27;re on stage!&lt;br /&gt;Please listen to your heavy user customers and go back to the older version.</li>
            <li> I do not have thick or heavy hair and they won&#x27;t even hold my ponytail for a day.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I hate the look of black hairbands when I have a ponytail or braid, and so I use clear bands instead of the black elastics.</li>
            <li> I am still very annoyed at goody for changing the product to something so shoddy, and feel like I am now basically paying double the price, but...</li>
            <li> You might think &amp;#34;wow, she must have really thick hair&amp;#34; - well, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> These hair ties are extremely unreliable and will break at any moment letting your hairdo fall down (usually the worst possible time, but that could just be for me).</li>
            <li> It is medium thick to thin at the least.</li>
            <li> at least I am no longer cursing every morning!</li>
            <li> The elastic becomes weak and misshapen-ed the moment you stretch them around your thumb and index finger.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for quality elastics, then steer clear - these are awful!</li>
            <li> And my hair is on the thin side!  </li>
            <li> Anytime I use these they randomly break partway through the day.</li>
            <li> Poor quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad they would put these on the market.</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed Goody chose to cheapen their product at the expense of their customers.</li>
            <li> Horrible &amp; just as bad as dollar store ones.</li>
            <li> I posted because I hope this helps some frustrated soul like I was!</li>
            <li> Hate them so much - worst bands I have ever had ever!</li>
            <li> Terrible, what happened Goody?</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>
            <li> The brown ones are horrible too!</li>
            <li> Worst I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These are awful!  </li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to the quality of these, but they are terrible - they break while in my hair!!</li>
            <li> These are terrible...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Keep reading to end for helpful tip..I used to love these, they were perfect! My daughter has extremely thick hair and they would hold it beautifully. I&#x27;m pretty sure they have changed recently and now they are total garbage. That&#x27;s why I gave it a one star. If on the rare times they don&#x27;t snap before I get them in my daughters hair, they would slide down and either snap in her hair or slide down so far her hair is hanging all over the place and looks horrible within minutes of styling. I&#x27;m talking even a simple braid or pony. If you&#x27;re into Pinterest hairdos, well you could plain forget it. About a month ago after lots of cussing (I&#x27;m not normally a cussing girl) and lots of headaches, I started my search for a good elastic. Well, it turns out everyone is selling junk. I tried 2 at Sally&#x27;s, some from Peerless, some from Target for ethnic hair hoping they would be stronger(goody brand) my daughters a blonde. Now here&#x27;s the good news...I took my problem to social media and one of my friends said to double them up and poof magic, they are almost as good as before. I can honestly say this is a great solution and I think I can live with them like this. I posted because I hope this helps some frustrated soul like I was! I am still very annoyed at goody for changing the product to something so shoddy, and feel like I am now basically paying double the price, but...at least I am no longer cursing every morning!</li>
            <li> Terrible, what happened Goody? Bring your old string bands back!</li>
            <li> These used to be the best, but now they are the worst, just like everyone says! I just finished an old pack--it says (c) 2006 and doesn&#x27;t have a woman on the cover--where each band would last weeks or months before getting too stretched out or just lost. Then I bought a new pack--it says (c) 2012 and has the woman on the front, but the UPC is the same--and literally within an hour or so I feel it break and snap loose. Turns out, they&#x27;re all like that. I ended up carrying a pocket full to get me through the day as they disintegrated. Stay away from these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows something like the older version of the product, or where we can get the old stock, let us know!</li>
            <li> These snap and break soon after using them. Horrible &amp; just as bad as dollar store ones.</li>
            <li> I usually just go to the dollar store for these - but needed more and decided just to order them on amazon. They are literally like someone shaved off rubber tubing, packaged it and sold it for $8 plus shipping! NO ELASTICITY! If you want something that pulls your hair and has NO STRETCH whatsoever - get these. Hate them so much - worst bands I have ever had ever! I&#x27;m so mad they would put these on the market.</li>
            <li> These use to be wonderful. Idk what has happened to the product they use to have but they arent the same. They are breaking in no time all. I thought i just bought a defective pack but i tried three more and all was the same. Sad!</li>
            <li> I use these all the time even though I have really thick long hair. They&#x27;re great if you don&#x27;t want your hair band to be obvious.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in black from a local retailer and they break almost immediately. I do not have thick or heavy hair and they won&#x27;t even hold my ponytail for a day.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Each one has broke after maybe 2 uses ... And my hair is on the thin side!  I use to love these ponies, but these new ones are worthless.  The brown ones are horrible too!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 1.5 YO baby&#x27;s fine hair, and found that, despite their small size, there&#x27;s no real stretch to these elastics that allows me to use them. With fine hair, you need a stretchy elastic that you can wrap a few times around the hair, but these elastics have no give to them. Great price and quantity but disappointing product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. These elastics literally disintegrate at the end of my braid. Worst I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many clear elastic bands from various sources and have to say that Goody brand is still the way to go!  They do not bust automatically when you stretch them nor do they break off in your hair right after you place them, they are by far superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product and won&#x27;t buy it again. The bands have no elasticity. They are more like a hard plastic then anything close to rubber. I couldn&#x27;t stretch them at all to use in my hair. I can use these for very small pieces of hair (like the end of a small braid) but not much else. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have bought these Goody polybands for years.  Despite my better judgement, ignored the recent reviews for these bands and placed an order when I ran out recently.  The first one I used broke straight out of the box.  Thinking it was maybe a fluke, I was a little gentler moving forward.  They are thin, flimsy and break on a regular basis --- not like the old ones that you could use over and over again.  I had never had a band break in my hair until purchasing these.  I was in a business meeting last week when I felt my ponytail start melting down the back of my head.  Upon reaching back, I was mortified to realize that the band had broken.  I had no backup, of course, and decided in that moment that I would leave this review and hopefully help someone from making the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> These have absolutely no elasticity in them.  I picked mine up at Walmart, thinking I was getting a pack of the clear elastic bands I&#x27;m used to buying and using in my hair.  These are awful!  They don&#x27;t stretch, they don&#x27;t hold.  Terrible.  Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my 2 year-old&#x27;s hair, which is getting long. I thought they&#x27;d be like the old Goody elastics I used to buy, but these are not very stretchy, making it extremely difficult to get them in the hair of a wriggling toddler without hurting her.</li>
            <li> Great product. These are nice and string and can be used more than once unlike some other ties we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> They stretch and then break immediately. What happened to these?? A few years back they were made from a more durable material but clearly they&#x27;ve been cheapened.</li>
            <li> These deserve zero stars! Goody used to make the best clear elastic hair ties, but they are now the worst. Not sure if they changed their formula and how they make them, but these don&#x27;t hold anything and break instantly. Such a waste. Bring back the stronger ties!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for quality elastics, then steer clear - these are awful! I hate the look of black hairbands when I have a ponytail or braid, and so I use clear bands instead of the black elastics. I don&#x27;t know what happened to the quality of these, but they are terrible - they break while in my hair!! In order to avoid this, I tried doubling up and using two bands at once...but they still break. This is only after a few hours or so of wearing them. You might think &amp;#34;wow, she must have really thick hair&amp;#34; - well, I don&#x27;t. It is medium thick to thin at the least. Bottom line - don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Goody, I&#x27;ve used these for years and they used to last for the whole day.  Now half of them snap at the worst of times, like when you&#x27;re on stage!&lt;br /&gt;Please listen to your heavy user customers and go back to the older version.</li>
            <li> Not very stretchy, but they&#x27;re all right for what I needed.</li>
            <li> They work really well and do their job. However,  I expected them to be bigger than they actually were. I have really thick hair and I felt like they needed to be a bit larger, but that was my own fault for assuming they were the perfect size and not double checking.</li>
            <li> These used to be a good product but Goody changed the way they make them. These hair ties are extremely unreliable and will break at any moment letting your hairdo fall down (usually the worst possible time, but that could just be for me). I&#x27;m really disappointed that this company cheapened their product (of course not the price though) in order to make their customers use and buy more as they break so easily.</li>
            <li> great quality and there are soooo many in this package which is great because I lose them constantly/leave them everywhere!</li>
            <li> These used to be the the only elastics that worked for my both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair as we both have very fine and silky hair. Not anymore! Goody completely cheapened this product! The elastic becomes weak and misshapen-ed the moment you stretch them around your thumb and index finger. Your lucky to get one use out of these ones. The previous elastics could be used several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just put my hair up and was on my way  to Yoga this morning when the elastic just snapped. Completely unreliable! I&#x27;m really disappointed Goody chose to cheapen their product at the expense of their customers.</li>
            <li> Zero stars. These are terrible... I LOVED the older version of these and was so disappointed when I opened the package and the first four that I tried to use snapped as soon as I stretched them around the end of my braid. Even when one doesn&#x27;t break while putting it in your hair, definitely do NOT count on it remaining intact to be able to use it twice. They basically disintegrate immediately after removing it from your hair.</li>
            <li> These things are cheap and no matter how much or little you spend on them, it&#x27;s a waste of money. I bought these to replace some that I had that were made by Goody but they were brown and much stronger material. I can have my hair in a pony tail and feel something strange and realize the band just broke, for no reason. Just sitting and the band will break and my pony tail will fall. And I really don&#x27;t have thick hair. Fine and certainly not a thick main. I&#x27;ve been trying to no avail to find the brown ones. I need small sizes because I don&#x27;t have thick hair and bigger bands add too much banding for a pony tail. Why Goody did away with those and tried to replace them with this junk is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Was hoping that the few positive reviews were true but these are not good.  They are not really elastic.  Just non-stretchy plastic.  Cannot use them on my little girl&#x27;s thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Usually goody products are great but this seller must have a bad batch. I only use these to tie back a small section of my hair (the old half up half down look). Anytime I use these they randomly break partway through the day. All of a sudden they snap and my hair comes undone. I have to carry extra with me to work. Poor quality!</li>
            <li> These used to be really good, but they break easily now. Out of the 75 pieces included only about half were usable.</li>
            <li> These stretch quite a bit but are only good for one use at a time because they don&#x27;t go back to their small shape.  I find they get tangled in my hair just as much as other ponytail bands.  The good part is that the package has a lot of them so it is a nice price value.</li>
