            <li>but the effect on skin is remarkable.</li>
            <li>It came in a plastic container and was a bright gold colour.</li>

            <li>This is a good  product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I heard shea butter may be good for skin irritations i.e. eczema.  </li>
            <li>I had tried shea butter before but this product is superior.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like a child&#x27;s skin, truly, for a good 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this shea butter.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>And my favorite thing to use it for is shaving!</li>
            <li>AND IT FEELS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also experimented with it some around my eyes and it feels so nice</li>
            <li>Get the refined, ordorless kind.  </li>
            <li>but it is good to know there are great products like this one that can control it and make my life much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I warm it up in my hands and rub it on my face and body.  </li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try shea butter because I heard many times about the many uses and how great the product.  </li>
            <li>This product is pleasant to smell and easy to apply to the skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging in which it arrives is beautiful and simply elegant, with an easy twist off top.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant clean smell not a perfume type odor.</li>
            <li>This sheabutter is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best moisturizing product I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the real, grade A unrefined shea butter before, and the quality is incredible.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>The area healed very quickly and without any trace of a scar!  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>As soon as it melts in your hand the Shea Butter becomes a very smooth oil that goes on very easily.  </li>
            <li>Smooth , gentle , Perfect skin care</li>
            <li>On my first foray into the world of shea, I made the great mistake of buying some highly-refined drugstore junk.</li>
            <li>I was originally happy with the product when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries quickly which is great.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many products over the years trying to find something that works.  </li>
            <li>This winter will be better.  </li>
            <li>After hundreds of dollars and numerous creams I found Shea Butter and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Heels are smooth!  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>I waited over 8 months to write this review because I wanted to make sure I gave the product time.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, creams, etc.</li>
            <li>Applies much better in all temperature ranges.</li>

            <li>great butter for pregnant bellies :) but not only.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference with the skin on my hands.</li>
            <li>something I had on was causing a huge allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I found this especially with winter on the way.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth and not greasy like some products.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the contact from African Skin Solutions to make sure I was happy with the product and also provide tips on the many uses of their product.</li>

            <li>The smell is nutty but light.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if it could come in smaller sizes for purses and travel.  </li>
            <li>This African Shea Butter is a great product.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and creamy with no odor.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this shea butter definitely met the need.  </li>
            <li>important, I have been using it on my face.</li>
            <li>Everybody in the house uses it right now...:)</li>
            <li>As I gained more faith in the product, I started using it for a lot of the other uses listed in the product description, and I am happy to say that it delivers.</li>
            <li>and it really does work better if you let it warm up first.</li>
            <li>I had heard that raw unrefined shea butter was wonderful</li>
            <li>Wonderful pure product, so soothing for ultra dry skin &amp; psoriasis.</li>

            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed  in this product.  </li>
            <li>Worth the time!  </li>
            <li>it feels so rich and creamy but it absorbs into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Using it for keeping my large pregnant belly (twins!!)</li>
            <li>It also is a great healing ointment staying moist a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Clean smell that is not over frangrant..</li>
            <li>was delighted to get African Skin Solutions Shea Butter and did not expect it to be as fabulous as it is.  </li>
            <li>huge factor that led to my increased trust in the product was the follow-up emails from the company; you can tell that they really care if you&#x27;ve enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best product by far for closing your facial pores.  </li>
            <li>It has an interesting scent which I find refreshing because it is natural.</li>
            <li>I liked most about the African Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Since I started using it, I haven&#x27;t experienced dry skin</li>
            <li>The company has been in touch with some useful tips on how to use the product which is always nice to know they really care about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of Eczema and this has helped tremendously - goes on smooth and keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>(Bright white color.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for rough heels and elbows</li>
            <li>Not really a smell and great for skin all around</li>
            <li>I am already a fan of Shea Butter and so far this product has been really nice.</li>
            <li>Even so, I can tell that this product from African Skin Solutions is of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a company that really cares about the customer.  :-)</li>
            <li>I use this in my shea butter mixture for my hair, to make butter bars for the bath and as a full body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and soft after using this even with the temperature changes.</li>
            <li>THERE IS NOT BAD SMELL</li>
            <li>, I broke out - this product is super thick and waxy, the best way I can describe it is like putting melted greasy candle wax on your skin and good luck in trying to wash it from your skin, it’s so think and waxy regular soap won’t do the trick, I have to use a scrub to get it</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat greasy but that seems to sink in rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>This does work as a wonderful body moisturizer but not a facial moisturizer especially if your face is the oily or combination type.  </li>
            <li>would love to get more information on this, such as how to make lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing such a great quality product.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my pregnant daughter-in-law out of the goodness of my heart even though I wanted to keep it.  </li>
            <li>I was also impressed with how much came in one tub of this raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away - and it has only gotten better the more I used it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived very quickly, was sealed very well and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>It is rich and moisturizing without being too heavy and has made a remarkable difference in the softness of my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it with great success on chapped lips and on the little bit of eczema that I have on my toes.</li>
            <li>But this African Shea Butter is amazing.</li>
            <li>I must say I am very satisfied especially with this being my first time purchasing shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was able to put it on my face and body directly from the jar.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love skin products that are natural, simple AND effective and this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li>so when I was offered this African Shea Butter during a promotion for my honest review I was hoping to give him some relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially I was concerned about what effect the shea butter would have on my super sensitive skin, but have ultimately been impressed with the results and am now hooked.  </li>
            <li>My break out stopped right when I stopped using it on my face.</li>
            <li>The president and founder responded to a question of mine right away and with a thorough reply.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter is unscented, good consistency, melts in your hands and absorbed easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I loved the large jar with the wide opening.  </li>
            <li>It is emollient rich and restorative and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure what I used is good for my skin and won&#x27;t make my acne worse.  </li>
            <li>There were no awful smells or discoloration as some other people experienced with their purchases from other vendors.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love how rich it feels as it sinks into your skin, yet it does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter is totally different than any product I&#x27;ve tried and after I got used to letting it &#x27;melt&#x27; first in my hands it is so quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and in only a couple days my feet look better.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchased more when this is gone.</li>
            <li>So glad I gave African Skin Solutions a chance.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a top notch moisturizer, look no further!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I use on my face at night and in the morning my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been interested in a premium Shea butter for awhile</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first time I used Shea butter on my scalp</li>
            <li>so I have tried MANY different moisturizers that claim to help &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; (Aquaphor, Cetaphil, Burt&#x27;s Bees, that California Baby stuff at Target...</li>
            <li>the time it takes to rub a dab back &amp; forth in your hands to emulsify 2)the absorption time before being able to dress.  </li>
            <li>I finally settled on this one as the most pure, un-touched, premium quality.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, so it&#x27;s great for those of us who are sensitive to fragrance.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I found that it was a really positive influence on my dandruff.</li>
            <li>Though I like good smelling lotions, I&#x27;d settle for this natural non-odorous product due to its performance.</li>
            <li>It was good to know that this was all natural Shea Butter and that there was no chemicals, fillers, or other impurities.</li>
            <li>In the evening I use a tiny dab on my palm which I then hold briefly above a gas burner on our stove for a quick way to melt it; it&#x27;s then very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My husband has horribly dry hands most of the year from what he does at work</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is working wonders on his dry cracked hands, and I am sure with continued use his cuticles with quit splitting.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it is a pure product without additives.</li>
            <li>Living in Colorado, keeping your skin moisturized and protected is a must, and this shea butter certainly delivered.  </li>
            <li>I thought, why not just buy the pure shea butter?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It lasts a very long time, so the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>Easy of application,excellent skin results, and African Skin Solution is very concerned about your satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Before I tried this product from African Skin Solutions, I had never heard of shea butter, but when a friend recommended this product, I read the description and was intrigued by a number of things: the many different uses for shea butter and the fact that Pure Premium Shea Butter is unrefined and contains vitamins that are essential for healthy</li>
            <li>It is fast absorbing, you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>Well I use it on my heels--they are so much softer and healthier looking after using the shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I decided to do some research and learned that what I was really looking for was Grade A Unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>(The real difference, according to the description, comes after 4-6 weeks.)</li>
            <li>so it really melts before applying to your face.</li>
            <li>very hydrating..and not oily.  </li>
            <li>What I really like about this Shea butter is that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very creamy.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated that their was an expiration date on the jar.  </li>
            <li>This Shea butter is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and I have not broken out with acne at all.</li>
            <li>Works so fast and so well.</li>
            <li>I started using it for my son&#x27;s occasional eczema, the winkles on my face, and for smooth legs after I shave.</li>
            <li>I really like to use this on my hands, feet and lips.  </li>
            <li>Coconut oil is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>My whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li>Grease is one thing that I really don’t want on my hair especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND I MUST SAY I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>Very generous with the amount in the container.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It takes just a few seconds to warm in the hands to give it a creamy texture before you rub into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Shea Butter from African Skin Solutions and am very pleased with the results ive seen on my dry scalp, the dandruff flaking has reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use it during the day it lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;and has moisturized my skin better than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products, creams that never helped him.</li>
            <li>I have used several creams and lotions to combat the dry climate in Colorado, but none have been as effective as this particular shea butter!</li>
            <li>I liked that it was raw shea butter</li>
            <li>The jar ( of ASS) smelt attractive and the colour was a much brighter, more natural shade of yellow than the startling gold I’d used before.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product to people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly (in just a few days) and securely wrapped and boxed.</li>
            <li>There is a remarkable difference between the textures of a Grade A butter and greasy ungraded or low-grade Shea ‘butter’.</li>
            <li>It is a solid but melts quickly with your body temperature.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lip balms, which worked decently</li>
            <li>My hands in particular are always cracking and peeling and at times even bleed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Months later while in the City I found some Shea butter that was bright yellow and began using the butter not only on my scalp but also on my drier skin in general, being now aware to the powerful potential of Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, has little to no scent that dissipates quickly and absorbs completely into our skin.</li>
            <li>I have used the 100% Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and have been pleased with the quality of the product and the customer service that is provided by the supplier.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The butter is very soothing and really does calm dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li>My husband who has very itchy ankles that get irritated in the winter has received complete relief from this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin; I don’t use products that upset the gentle balance I have achieved for myself.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own body butter , mixed with cocoa butter,coconut oil and other natural oils...</li>
            <li>This will be a new household staple.</li>
            <li>THIS Shea Butter is my new moisturizer and body lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li>He prefers me to use aquafor as he has a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>One last thing is the company really cares about there product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this Shea butter is more expensive than what I bought before the quality is much better, and African Skin Solutions provides a lot of information about where Shea butter comes from.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember how many over the counter products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, hoping they would help.  </li>
            <li>her skin is really soft!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Works super for our dry skin!</li>
            <li>and it was not much better, even though it cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve begun using it in my hair as well, as I&#x27;ve found it helps to ease the frizz that my hair naturally has!</li>
            <li>But it quickly started to mold after I opened the jar, due to the high humidity in Florida.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so this jar should last for a good while.</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to shea butter, but this definitely appears to be a very high-quality product.  </li>
            <li>I did not even have to warm it up in my hands first as I did  with the other previous batches from different companies.  </li>
            <li>It has only one ingredient, pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, legs and put a little on my hair to smooth it</li>
            <li>I used this product daily for three weeks and noticed significant improvement in my dry, cracked heels, hands, and fingers.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and has hardly any smell at all</li>
            <li>great now that the weather is cold</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about shea butter recently</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference in my skin since I started last year.</li>
            <li>natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have used it for everything from diaper rash, chapped lips, and wind burn on my two-year-old daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My five-year-old son does not like it as well as it has a natural smell.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel hydrated and makes it look soft and</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I used this unrefined Shea Butter to help my face stay soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I like using all natural products, because I know what is in the product.  </li>
            <li>The burning, itching and flamed up areas on my ankle are almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream only since last few days and already loving it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it to my hands and the dry spots on my elbows, knees and feet and my dry skin is actually smooth again.  </li>
            <li>I also like using this Raw Shea Butter as a full body moisturizer after a shower - even on my face, which I&#x27;m picky about using new products for my face.</li>
            <li>I have moderate psoriasis and this the FIRST non-prescription product I&#x27;ve used that actually made a difference.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter</li>
            <li>The way David&#x27;s handle my complaining for the package due to torn and dusty is so amazing!</li>
            <li>I am very hopeful that long term use will heal my skin.</li>
            <li>This product works very well at moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It really works on dry skin!!I use it on my body, hands, face..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even began to see improvements on a six month old scar after using it daily for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>African Solutions Shea Butter has allowed me to continue with the skin therapy by keeping my face hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>While the african shea butter comes in a soft, solid form, it only takes a small amount rubbed between your palms before it becomes more of a liquid that instantly nourishes your skin!</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than other shea butters I have tried!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this Shea butter for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to cure dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>this stuff is thick, I only need a little, and my hands feel better much longer than with lotions.</li>
            <li>This is my first shea butter purchase, so I am in no way an expert on the subject.</li>
            <li>I also live in Colorado with extremely dry air</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few days so far, and my face has not broken out.  </li>
            <li>As I get older, I am constantly dealing with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and moisturized in a long time.</li>
            <li>Much more expensive than the last (purely natural)</li>
            <li>Little pricy but works very well.</li>
            <li>The price might seem expensive at first, but a little goes a long way and it is really so much better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>both good and bad experiences</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this, honestly!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> but the effect on skin is remarkable.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic container and was a bright gold colour.</li>
            <li> Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> However, I do not think that aquafor does as good of a job at relieving winter skin issues.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work you guys.</li>

            <li> Nice product -- and great customer service.  </li>
            <li> This is a good  product.</li>

            <li> I had tried shea butter before but this product is superior.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> And my favorite thing to use it for is shaving!</li>
            <li> AND IT FEELS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also experimented with it some around my eyes and it feels so nice</li>
            <li> Get the refined, ordorless kind.  </li>
            <li> but it is good to know there are great products like this one that can control it and make my life much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I warm it up in my hands and rub it on my face and body.  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try shea butter because I heard many times about the many uses and how great the product.  </li>
            <li> This product is pleasant to smell and easy to apply to the skin.</li>
            <li> The packaging in which it arrives is beautiful and simply elegant, with an easy twist off top.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant clean smell not a perfume type odor.</li>
            <li> This sheabutter is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best moisturizing product I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the real, grade A unrefined shea butter before, and the quality is incredible.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> The area healed very quickly and without any trace of a scar!  </li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> As soon as it melts in your hand the Shea Butter becomes a very smooth oil that goes on very easily.  </li>
            <li> Smooth , gentle , Perfect skin care</li>
            <li> On my first foray into the world of shea, I made the great mistake of buying some highly-refined drugstore junk.</li>

            <li> it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries quickly which is great.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many products over the years trying to find something that works.  </li>
            <li> This winter will be better.  </li>
            <li> After hundreds of dollars and numerous creams I found Shea Butter and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Heels are smooth!  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s safe.</li>

            <li> Applies much better in all temperature ranges.</li>

            <li> It was easy to scoop the butter out and use it on my heels and hands at night.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say they were very quick to respond to any of my questions.</li>

            <li> Look years younger with beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> The Shea Butter that I received from African Skin Solutions was beautiful.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is high quality the best I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> The frangrance is very mild and light.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses it to moisturize (husband, 3 kids) and we all love it!</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my face -- glides on smoothly with a slight &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel (till it soaks in) and leaves my face with no tightness or itch.</li>
            <li> great butter for pregnant bellies :) but not only.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference with the skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> something I had on was causing a huge allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I found this especially with winter on the way.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is smooth and not greasy like some products.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the contact from African Skin Solutions to make sure I was happy with the product and also provide tips on the many uses of their product.</li>
            <li> Since I did not have an aloe plant available, I decided to treat the burned area with this shea butter instead.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nutty but light.  </li>
            <li> It would be great if it could come in smaller sizes for purses and travel.  </li>
            <li> This African Shea Butter is a great product.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and creamy with no odor.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this shea butter definitely met the need.  </li>

            <li> Everybody in the house uses it right now...:)</li>
            <li> As I gained more faith in the product, I started using it for a lot of the other uses listed in the product description, and I am happy to say that it delivers.</li>
            <li> and it really does work better if you let it warm up first.</li>
            <li> I had heard that raw unrefined shea butter was wonderful</li>
            <li> Wonderful pure product, so soothing for ultra dry skin &amp; psoriasis.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the item, I was also excited to see that it did not need refrigeration.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed  in this product.  </li>
            <li> Worth the time!  </li>
            <li> it feels so rich and creamy but it absorbs into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Using it for keeping my large pregnant belly (twins!!)</li>
            <li> It also is a great healing ointment staying moist a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Clean smell that is not over frangrant..</li>
            <li> was delighted to get African Skin Solutions Shea Butter and did not expect it to be as fabulous as it is.  </li>
            <li> huge factor that led to my increased trust in the product was the follow-up emails from the company; you can tell that they really care if you&#x27;ve enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product by far for closing your facial pores.  </li>
            <li> It has an interesting scent which I find refreshing because it is natural.</li>
            <li> I liked most about the African Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I haven&#x27;t experienced dry skin</li>
            <li> The company has been in touch with some useful tips on how to use the product which is always nice to know they really care about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of Eczema and this has helped tremendously - goes on smooth and keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> (Bright white color.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for rough heels and elbows</li>
            <li> Not really a smell and great for skin all around</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of Shea Butter and so far this product has been really nice.</li>
            <li> Even so, I can tell that this product from African Skin Solutions is of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a company that really cares about the customer.  :-)</li>
            <li> I use this in my shea butter mixture for my hair, to make butter bars for the bath and as a full body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and soft after using this even with the temperature changes.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NOT BAD SMELL</li>
            <li> , I broke out - this product is super thick and waxy, the best way I can describe it is like putting melted greasy candle wax on your skin and good luck in trying to wash it from your skin, it’s so think and waxy regular soap won’t do the trick, I have to use a scrub to get it</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat greasy but that seems to sink in rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> This does work as a wonderful body moisturizer but not a facial moisturizer especially if your face is the oily or combination type.  </li>
            <li> would love to get more information on this, such as how to make lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing such a great quality product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my pregnant daughter-in-law out of the goodness of my heart even though I wanted to keep it.  </li>
            <li> I was also impressed with how much came in one tub of this raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away - and it has only gotten better the more I used it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived very quickly, was sealed very well and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> It is rich and moisturizing without being too heavy and has made a remarkable difference in the softness of my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it with great success on chapped lips and on the little bit of eczema that I have on my toes.</li>
            <li> But this African Shea Butter is amazing.</li>
            <li> I must say I am very satisfied especially with this being my first time purchasing shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was able to put it on my face and body directly from the jar.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love skin products that are natural, simple AND effective and this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> so when I was offered this African Shea Butter during a promotion for my honest review I was hoping to give him some relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially I was concerned about what effect the shea butter would have on my super sensitive skin, but have ultimately been impressed with the results and am now hooked.  </li>
            <li> My break out stopped right when I stopped using it on my face.</li>
            <li> The president and founder responded to a question of mine right away and with a thorough reply.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter is unscented, good consistency, melts in your hands and absorbed easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I loved the large jar with the wide opening.  </li>
            <li> It is emollient rich and restorative and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure what I used is good for my skin and won&#x27;t make my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> There were no awful smells or discoloration as some other people experienced with their purchases from other vendors.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love how rich it feels as it sinks into your skin, yet it does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is totally different than any product I&#x27;ve tried and after I got used to letting it &#x27;melt&#x27; first in my hands it is so quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and in only a couple days my feet look better.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely purchased more when this is gone.</li>
            <li> So glad I gave African Skin Solutions a chance.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a top notch moisturizer, look no further!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I use on my face at night and in the morning my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been interested in a premium Shea butter for awhile</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first time I used Shea butter on my scalp</li>
            <li> so I have tried MANY different moisturizers that claim to help &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; (Aquaphor, Cetaphil, Burt&#x27;s Bees, that California Baby stuff at Target...</li>
            <li> the time it takes to rub a dab back &amp; forth in your hands to emulsify 2)the absorption time before being able to dress.  </li>
            <li> I finally settled on this one as the most pure, un-touched, premium quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, so it&#x27;s great for those of us who are sensitive to fragrance.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I found that it was a really positive influence on my dandruff.</li>
            <li> Though I like good smelling lotions, I&#x27;d settle for this natural non-odorous product due to its performance.</li>
            <li> It was good to know that this was all natural Shea Butter and that there was no chemicals, fillers, or other impurities.</li>
            <li> In the evening I use a tiny dab on my palm which I then hold briefly above a gas burner on our stove for a quick way to melt it; it&#x27;s then very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> My husband has horribly dry hands most of the year from what he does at work</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is working wonders on his dry cracked hands, and I am sure with continued use his cuticles with quit splitting.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is a pure product without additives.</li>
            <li> Living in Colorado, keeping your skin moisturized and protected is a must, and this shea butter certainly delivered.  </li>
            <li> I thought, why not just buy the pure shea butter?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time, so the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> Easy of application,excellent skin results, and African Skin Solution is very concerned about your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Before I tried this product from African Skin Solutions, I had never heard of shea butter, but when a friend recommended this product, I read the description and was intrigued by a number of things: the many different uses for shea butter and the fact that Pure Premium Shea Butter is unrefined and contains vitamins that are essential for healthy</li>
            <li> It is fast absorbing, you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> Well I use it on my heels--they are so much softer and healthier looking after using the shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I decided to do some research and learned that what I was really looking for was Grade A Unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> (The real difference, according to the description, comes after 4-6 weeks.)</li>
            <li> so it really melts before applying to your face.</li>
            <li> very hydrating..and not oily.  </li>
            <li> What I really like about this Shea butter is that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very creamy.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated that their was an expiration date on the jar.  </li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and I have not broken out with acne at all.</li>
            <li> Works so fast and so well.</li>
            <li> I started using it for my son&#x27;s occasional eczema, the winkles on my face, and for smooth legs after I shave.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this on my hands, feet and lips.  </li>
            <li> Coconut oil is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> My whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li> Grease is one thing that I really don’t want on my hair especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND I MUST SAY I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Very generous with the amount in the container.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It takes just a few seconds to warm in the hands to give it a creamy texture before you rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Shea Butter from African Skin Solutions and am very pleased with the results ive seen on my dry scalp, the dandruff flaking has reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use it during the day it lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;and has moisturized my skin better than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products, creams that never helped him.</li>
            <li> I have used several creams and lotions to combat the dry climate in Colorado, but none have been as effective as this particular shea butter!</li>
            <li> I liked that it was raw shea butter</li>
            <li> The jar ( of ASS) smelt attractive and the colour was a much brighter, more natural shade of yellow than the startling gold I’d used before.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product to people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly (in just a few days) and securely wrapped and boxed.</li>
            <li> There is a remarkable difference between the textures of a Grade A butter and greasy ungraded or low-grade Shea ‘butter’.</li>
            <li> It is a solid but melts quickly with your body temperature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lip balms, which worked decently</li>
            <li> My hands in particular are always cracking and peeling and at times even bleed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Months later while in the City I found some Shea butter that was bright yellow and began using the butter not only on my scalp but also on my drier skin in general, being now aware to the powerful potential of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, has little to no scent that dissipates quickly and absorbs completely into our skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the 100% Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and have been pleased with the quality of the product and the customer service that is provided by the supplier.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The butter is very soothing and really does calm dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> My husband who has very itchy ankles that get irritated in the winter has received complete relief from this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin; I don’t use products that upset the gentle balance I have achieved for myself.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own body butter , mixed with cocoa butter,coconut oil and other natural oils...</li>
            <li> This will be a new household staple.</li>
            <li> THIS Shea Butter is my new moisturizer and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li> He prefers me to use aquafor as he has a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> One last thing is the company really cares about there product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this Shea butter is more expensive than what I bought before the quality is much better, and African Skin Solutions provides a lot of information about where Shea butter comes from.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember how many over the counter products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, hoping they would help.  </li>
            <li> her skin is really soft!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Works super for our dry skin!</li>
            <li> and it was not much better, even though it cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun using it in my hair as well, as I&#x27;ve found it helps to ease the frizz that my hair naturally has!</li>
            <li> But it quickly started to mold after I opened the jar, due to the high humidity in Florida.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this jar should last for a good while.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to shea butter, but this definitely appears to be a very high-quality product.  </li>
            <li> I did not even have to warm it up in my hands first as I did  with the other previous batches from different companies.  </li>
            <li> It has only one ingredient, pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, legs and put a little on my hair to smooth it</li>
            <li> I used this product daily for three weeks and noticed significant improvement in my dry, cracked heels, hands, and fingers.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and has hardly any smell at all</li>
            <li> great now that the weather is cold</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about shea butter recently</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference in my skin since I started last year.</li>
            <li> natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have used it for everything from diaper rash, chapped lips, and wind burn on my two-year-old daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My five-year-old son does not like it as well as it has a natural smell.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel hydrated and makes it look soft and</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I used this unrefined Shea Butter to help my face stay soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I like using all natural products, because I know what is in the product.  </li>
            <li> The burning, itching and flamed up areas on my ankle are almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream only since last few days and already loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it to my hands and the dry spots on my elbows, knees and feet and my dry skin is actually smooth again.  </li>
            <li> I also like using this Raw Shea Butter as a full body moisturizer after a shower - even on my face, which I&#x27;m picky about using new products for my face.</li>
            <li> I have moderate psoriasis and this the FIRST non-prescription product I&#x27;ve used that actually made a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter</li>
            <li> The way David&#x27;s handle my complaining for the package due to torn and dusty is so amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very hopeful that long term use will heal my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works very well at moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It really works on dry skin!!I use it on my body, hands, face..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even began to see improvements on a six month old scar after using it daily for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> African Solutions Shea Butter has allowed me to continue with the skin therapy by keeping my face hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> While the african shea butter comes in a soft, solid form, it only takes a small amount rubbed between your palms before it becomes more of a liquid that instantly nourishes your skin!</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than other shea butters I have tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this Shea butter for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to cure dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> this stuff is thick, I only need a little, and my hands feel better much longer than with lotions.</li>
            <li> This is my first shea butter purchase, so I am in no way an expert on the subject.</li>
            <li> I also live in Colorado with extremely dry air</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few days so far, and my face has not broken out.  </li>
            <li> As I get older, I am constantly dealing with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and moisturized in a long time.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive than the last (purely natural)</li>
            <li> Little pricy but works very well.</li>
            <li> The price might seem expensive at first, but a little goes a long way and it is really so much better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> both good and bad experiences</li>
            <li> Completely cleared up my dry skin, from face to heels!!</li>
            <li> think the fact that it is pure and raw shea butter definitely made the difference.</li>
            <li> African Skin Solutions&#x27; 100% Pure Raw  </li>
            <li> As a 24-year old guy, I&#x27;m not exactly a connoisseur of skin products.</li>
            <li> This Raw Shea Butter has proven to be very helpful in our home.</li>
            <li> a little harder to spread on the skin, but that tells me that it is in it&#x27;s pure form.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell whether it evens out skin tone or not.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a beard, but needed to be clean shaven for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously never used anything like raw shea before.</li>
            <li> Though a pound of shea butter may seem pricey, my bet is that it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s technically expired, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it has a really nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been constantly getting dry lips since winter began.</li>
            <li> I especially noticed a difference on my dry cuticles and feet.</li>
            <li> It has cured our winter skin and instantly soothes cracked hands and dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Really I am forever told I look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> you have dry skin as I used to have, this product will definitely help.</li>
            <li> Over the next few days, I applied frequent applications of the shea butter to the affected area.  </li>
            <li> Also you really do just use a small amount of this stuff it&#x27;ll go a long way and does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of shea butter and after using African Skin Solutions, I&#x27;ll never buy anything less than certified grade A shea butter.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how heavy a 16oz jar felt, it felt a lot heavier than 1lb.</li>
            <li> Used it the first day I got it on my daughter&#x27;s eczema and the next morning, the redness was significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other butters before but none were as long lasting.</li>
            <li> It did not just fix it for a day or two like other lotions, but it has a lasting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother has extremely dry skin due to medical treatments and she loves this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> as many products have bad things put into them to make them last longer or smell perfume like, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They get so dry at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> that I decided I would give it a try for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> but u have to keep using it or else ur skin becomes dry again.</li>
            <li> for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry, itchy skin...</li>
            <li> His skin is dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I even used it to soften my dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> and my hands get so dry...</li>
            <li> my wife and I used it on our dry and callous feet.</li>
            <li> or if I notice my skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> last note: a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is very firm (depending on the room temperature) but it will turn soft in the palm of your hands.</li>
            <li> Also the added bonus is how it heals your chapped lips and my husbands dry cracked feet!</li>
            <li> The effects of each application can easily last through a typical day for me.</li>
            <li> Less gritty and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> and I also have very dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It takes so little with each use that I anticipate it will last is quite some time.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and has a delicate smell that doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s really sensitive allergies at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the shea butter for a few days, but can already feel a difference.</li>
            <li> and I try to be careful about what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> I like the jar with the wide mouth for ease in removing product.</li>
            <li> For the past several years every time the winter weather comes along I get dry and cracked skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that this is 100% raw shea butter it smells and feels different than the others that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> In fact I use it as a body lotion, and a little on the ends of my long hair as added protection and moisture for blow drying.  </li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need much, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use it most on my lips but also on my face as a base before applying makeup, on my hands nightly, and on any dry spots I may have.</li>
            <li> After washing they dont feel as tight and dry as they use</li>
            <li> My husband asked me if we can get rid of all the other ones now and make some space.  </li>
            <li> My skin did not break out and I used it alone with out any other products.</li>
            <li> I had ordered from several suppliers in the past and was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It arrived only a few days ago and the company has already contacted me on my satisfaction of the product!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy like other lotions, shea butters and vaseline.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other lotions and creams, this brand of shea butter has dramatically outperformed anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Shea butter products that have had a stronger smell.  </li>
            <li> The owner is knowledgable about the product and extremely responsive to customer questions and needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a Retin-A product which is normally extremely drying.  </li>
            <li> I will never use anything else for my skin and with a minimum of other products, on my hair as well.  </li>
            <li> so it will not interfere with any other fragrance being used.  </li>
            <li> Although a little expensive - it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all, and it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I think this is helping slow down the inevitable aging process.  </li>
            <li> The pure unrefined shea butter hydrated and soothed my skin which had become very dry from the cold, windy winter weather.  </li>
            <li> no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> Compares favorably with a previously tried brand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no cure for psoriasis but this Raw Shea Butter really did provide some relief.</li>
            <li> As a result, it has been looking dull as well as dry.</li>
            <li> the list is too long and my bathroom cabinet is too small!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over half a year since my car accident, and this lotion has almost halved the scars within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have yet to find a bad brand of it!</li>
            <li> In the winter they are always developing little cracks.  </li>
            <li> I have had dry cracked feet for over 5 years now and it is very emabarrassing and can be painful at times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I accidentally burned the palm of my hand on a cast iron skillet.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Much less flaking!</li>
            <li> because this is a large jar, it is very difficult to use all the product.</li>
            <li> If you have cracked feet or any other skin problem, give this a serious look and try some now.</li>
            <li> This will serve you well if you live in a cold climate.</li>
            <li> It heals my dry skin and leaves no film behind.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my four year old son who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> I spent approximately 4 hours researching shea butter companies &amp; qualities.  </li>
            <li> The prescribed ointment medicine I had purchased in the past went from $15 a tube to over $100</li>
            <li> I usually put on after my shower every night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to spread on skin.  </li>
            <li> we have arthritis in your hands and it can be hard to get the shea butter out of the jar.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is way to thick and greasy to be applied to the face,  </li>
            <li> I saw some very expensive lotions recently promoting the fact that they contained 20% shea butter.  </li>
            <li> The nutty scent is subtle, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Hard to find that now a days!</li>
            <li> This keeps that ugly grey cracked skin from taking over.</li>
            <li> For years I have had a problem with cracked heels - no more!!  </li>
            <li> I got confused with this product.</li>
            <li> the shea butter has provided relief by moisturizing the skin which has decreased the callous in our feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night because I want my skin to get moisturized from the cold.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to melt using body temp.</li>
            <li> This is expensive.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was not good, it was greasy not buttery and it smelt bad not nutty.</li>
            <li> My feet were horribly cracked and dry</li>
            <li> I have a son who suffers from ezema</li>
            <li> Bad mistake.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with that part.</li>
            <li> I had bought some in a drugstore before and it was, basically crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been using this product for a week now. I have noticed a huge difference with the skin on my hands. I work in a medical office and wash/sanitize my hands often. After washing they dont feel as tight and dry as they use to.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isnt the greatest and I am still getting use toit. Definitely worth the money though!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am already a fan of Shea Butter and so far this product has been really nice.</li>
            <li> great now that the weather is cold</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used for my dry cracked heels.  I have bought so many products over the years trying to find something that works.  I finally found it.  My husband asked me if we can get rid of all the other ones now and make some space.  I use it twice a day and in only a couple days my feet look better.  It is a solid but melts quickly with your body temperature.  It is fast absorbing, you don&#x27;t need to use much.  I&#x27;m happy I found this especially with winter on the way.  Now I won&#x27;t have to feel embarrassed about my feet.  I also use it for my hands.  In the winter they are always developing little cracks.  This winter will be better.  Will definitely buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> For years I have had a problem with cracked heels - no more!!  After hundreds of dollars and numerous creams I found Shea Butter and it is wonderful.  Heels are smooth!  Use it every day.  Will definitely purchased more when this is gone.</li>
            <li> Well I use it on my heels--they are so much softer and healthier looking after using the shea butter.  It works on all skin types and colors--I like it also on my arms and hands. They get so dry at the end of the day. Just rub it in your hands until it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34;--I have not yet tried it on my hair but that is something I will do. Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> As a 24-year old guy, I&#x27;m not exactly a connoisseur of skin products. However, I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about shea butter recently that I decided I would give it a try for dry, itchy skin. On my first foray into the world of shea, I made the great mistake of buying some highly-refined drugstore junk. (Bright white color.) Didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to do some research and learned that what I was really looking for was Grade A Unrefined Shea Butter. *This* stuff actually works! I&#x27;ve only been using the shea butter for a few days, but can already feel a difference. (The real difference, according to the description, comes after 4-6 weeks.) So glad I gave African Skin Solutions a chance. Would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: a little bit goes a long way. Though a pound of shea butter may seem pricey, my bet is that it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because it was on super-sale.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for when you get clearanced shea butter -- it was short dated to expire within a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;I used it to make a calendula/marshmallow root/chamomille infused oil moisturizer.  Even though it&#x27;s technically expired, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it has a really nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;So, pretty good for the price.  You might want to email the company/seller and inquire about the expiration date before buying it -- especially if it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to melt using body temp. as described.</li>
            <li> Best over-all moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, and I know it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for the exzema under my eyes and for my elbows and skin in general. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I waited over 8 months to write this review because I wanted to make sure I gave the product time. I usually use it at night because I want my skin to get moisturized from the cold. My skin did not break out and I used it alone with out any other products. The instructions say to warm in your hands first before applying and I found that to be the case so it really melts before applying to your face. Sometimes I would forget to do that and it really does work better if you let it warm up first. When I use it during the day it lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;and has moisturized my skin better than other moisturizers. The company has been in touch with some useful tips on how to use the product which is always nice to know they really care about their product and their customers. I can really see the difference in my skin since I started last year.</li>
            <li> Love this but u have to keep using it or else ur skin becomes dry again.</li>
            <li> I love this product...very hydrating..and not oily.  Clean smell that is not over frangrant..natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use it wherever I need moisture!</li>
            <li> I have used several creams and lotions to combat the dry climate in Colorado, but none have been as effective as this particular shea butter! The consistency is smooth and not greasy like some products. The nutty scent is subtle, not overpowering. If you are looking for a top notch moisturizer, look no further!</li>
            <li> This Raw Shea Butter has proven to be very helpful in our home. We have used it for everything from diaper rash, chapped lips, and wind burn on my two-year-old daughters sensitive skin. My daughter loves it when I use this Shea Butter on her face. My five-year-old son does not like it as well as it has a natural smell. He prefers me to use aquafor as he has a very sensitive sense of smell. However, I do not think that aquafor does as good of a job at relieving winter skin issues. I was also impressed with how much came in one tub of this raw Shea butter. It takes so little with each use that I anticipate it will last is quite some time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  The pure unrefined shea butter hydrated and soothed my skin which had become very dry from the cold, windy winter weather.  I had heard that raw unrefined shea butter was wonderful and I&#x27;m glad I listened.  Plus, it feels and smells good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an acne sufferer all my life and I try to be careful about what I put on my face.  I read about Shea Butter and it&#x27;s healing properties.  I wanted to make sure what I used is good for my skin and won&#x27;t make my acne worse.  The seller really listened to my concerns and provided good information on the product.  I&#x27;ve used it a few days so far, and my face has not broken out.  I am very hopeful that long term use will heal my skin.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is high quality the best I have used thus far. Keep up the good work you guys. Love this stuff!!! Also the best customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I got confused with this product. Not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and tried it when I visited her.  I like the consistency of the cream better than the one I have at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, creams, etc. for my dry skin. What I really like about this Shea butter is that it isn&#x27;t greasy. It heals my dry skin and leaves no film behind.  Though I like good smelling lotions, I&#x27;d settle for this natural non-odorous product due to its performance. I&#x27;d highly recommend this Shea butter for those with dry skin. My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and moisturized in a long time. If you suffer from dry, itchy skin...this may be just the product for which you&#x27;ve been looking!</li>
            <li> I have had dry cracked feet for over 5 years now and it is very emabarrassing and can be painful at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of products with no help. I have heard of these shea butters before and I discounted them as only products used in spas and for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the African Shea Butter, I was intrigued by the name and did some looking into the product. I liked that it was raw shea butter as many products have bad things put into them to make them last longer or smell perfume like, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this for my feet as a last resort. The results were awesome. It did not just fix it for a day or two like other lotions, but it has a lasting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the fact that it is pure and raw shea butter definitely made the difference. If you have cracked feet or any other skin problem, give this a serious look and try some now. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Before I tried this product from African Skin Solutions, I had never heard of shea butter, but when a friend recommended this product, I read the description and was intrigued by a number of things: the many different uses for shea butter and the fact that Pure Premium Shea Butter is unrefined and contains vitamins that are essential for healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and I have to tell you: I&#x27;m a convert. I use it on my face, legs and put a little on my hair to smooth it (especially when it gets frizzy). It&#x27;s great for rough heels and elbows and I&#x27;ve used it with great success on chapped lips and on the little bit of eczema that I have on my toes. It makes my skin feel hydrated and makes it look soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it on my husband who is diabetic and has a lot of skin issues. His skin is dry and flaky. He uses it on his legs and feet and also used it to heal an itchy red rash that he had on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those multipurpose products that are essential to keep on hand. You&#x27;ll love how rich it feels as it sinks into your skin, yet it does not leave a greasy residue. It is emollient rich and restorative and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now. I must say I am very satisfied especially with this being my first time purchasing shea butter. I read several vendor reviews and information on what to look for when purchasing shea butter. What brought me to this vendor as a final choice to purchase is the fact that they are certified. I received the product quickly. There were no awful smells or discoloration as some other people experienced with their purchases from other vendors. I really appreciated the contact from African Skin Solutions to make sure I was happy with the product and also provide tips on the many uses of their product. I will definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect when I ordered this Shea Butter.  I had ordered from several suppliers in the past and was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to get African Skin Solutions Shea Butter and did not expect it to be as fabulous as it is.  It is very creamy.  I did not even have to warm it up in my hands first as I did  with the other previous batches from different companies.  I was able to put it on my face and body directly from the jar.  I appreciated that their was an expiration date on the jar.  I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this shea butter.  I am relatively new to shea butter, but this definitely appears to be a very high-quality product.  The butter comes packaged in a nice plastic container and product arrived in great condition.  The butter melts nicely in my palms and feels great on my skin.  Nice product -- and great customer service.  UPDATE:  A few weeks ago I accidentally burned the palm of my hand on a cast iron skillet.  Since I did not have an aloe plant available, I decided to treat the burned area with this shea butter instead.  Over the next few days, I applied frequent applications of the shea butter to the affected area.  The area healed very quickly and without any trace of a scar!  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> The way David&#x27;s handle my complaining for the package due to torn and dusty is so amazing! Definitely buy it from him again.</li>
            <li> This is my first shea butter purchase, so I am in no way an expert on the subject. Even so, I can tell that this product from African Skin Solutions is of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, my intended use for the product was to moisturize the lips. I&#x27;ve been constantly getting dry lips since winter began. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lip balms, which worked decently but I found myself constantly reapplying them throughout the day. I did some research and decided to take the plunge on this shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite meticulous when it comes to skin products, so initially I used the shea butter solely as a lip moisturizer. The effects have exceeded my expectations. After each application, my lips became smoother almost instantly. The effects of each application can easily last through a typical day for me. As I gained more faith in the product, I started using it for a lot of the other uses listed in the product description, and I am happy to say that it delivers. It just feels. freaking. amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge factor that led to my increased trust in the product was the follow-up emails from the company; you can tell that they really care if you&#x27;ve enjoyed the product. I&#x27;m usually not one to leave reviews like this, but the company was VERY honest and polite when asking me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product. Will definitely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used the 100% Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and have been pleased with the quality of the product and the customer service that is provided by the supplier.  This product is pleasant to smell and easy to apply to the skin. The product provides excellent moisturizing to my skin and has other theraputic and medicinal values that I like for my skin. I will continue to purchase the product as it meets my needs and exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> The pot will last you forever. The shea butter is very firm (depending on the room temperature) but it will turn soft in the palm of your hands. The skin looks great. It&#x27;s a wonderful product for dry, itchy or wrinkled skin. Everybody in the house uses it right now...:)</li>
            <li> This is a good  product. Generous jar of product, however, you must use this sparingly because of the richness of the product. I&#x27;ve have used this on elbows, hands, nails, and feet. This will serve you well if you live in a cold climate.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I use it on my face as a moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed how it is evening out the darker tones on my face and neck. It makes it feel great.  In fact I use it as a body lotion, and a little on the ends of my long hair as added protection and moisture for blow drying.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my four year old son who suffers from eczema. This Shea Butter is absolutely amazing! I have tried so many other products, creams that never helped him. I&#x27;m so happy with this, honestly! Also the added bonus is how it heals your chapped lips and my husbands dry cracked feet! One last thing is the company really cares about there product! Hard to find that now a days! African Skin Solutions has a forever customer with me!</li>
            <li> I was originally happy with the product when I first purchased it. However, I did not realize that it had an expiration date of 6 months and because this is a large jar, it is very difficult to use all the product. When I purchased the item, I was also excited to see that it did not need refrigeration. But it quickly started to mold after I opened the jar, due to the high humidity in Florida. I realized afterwards, that the product needed refrigeration. I would recommend anyone that is thinking of purchasing the item, to refrigerate it regardless of region.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product! Would give 10 stars if I could. The butter is very soothing and really does calm dry, itchy skin! It arrived only a few days ago and the company has already contacted me on my satisfaction of the product! This is a company that really cares about the customer.  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of shea butter and after using African Skin Solutions, I&#x27;ll never buy anything less than certified grade A shea butter. The quality of this shea butter can&#x27;t be beat and what a relief it is to know that I&#x27;m using a product that is contaminant-free. I use this in my shea butter mixture for my hair, to make butter bars for the bath and as a full body moisturizer. This stuff melts to touch. I&#x27;ve even began to see improvements on a six month old scar after using it daily for 3 weeks. I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the real deal.  it IS unrefined and provides plenty of moisture for you skin.  Little pricy but works very well.</li>
            <li> This product works very well at moisturizing dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the product to achieve this.  I like the jar with the wide mouth for ease in removing product. It is somewhat greasy but that seems to sink in rather quickly.  The smell is nutty but light.  It would be great if it could come in smaller sizes for purses and travel.  I especially noticed a difference on my dry cuticles and feet. I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is a pure product without additives. It arrived very quickly! It is great on my face, hands, lips, and feet. My husband who has very itchy ankles that get irritated in the winter has received complete relief from this product. It is smooth, has little to no scent that dissipates quickly and absorbs completely into our skin. My face feels soft and moisturized and I have not broken out with acne at all. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have become a Shea Butter convert after using this African Skin Solutions product. It is rich and moisturizing without being too heavy and has made a remarkable difference in the softness of my hands and feet. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to cure dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> Works so fast and so well. Started using this unrefined Shea butter on my heals, which get cracked and sore throughout the winter months. Within a few days I noticed a difference. I started using it for my son&#x27;s occasional eczema, the winkles on my face, and for smooth legs after I shave. I&#x27;ve used other butters before but none were as long lasting.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this on my hands, feet and lips.  I&#x27;ve also experimented with it some around my eyes and it feels so nice - doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.  I noticed a difference right away - and it has only gotten better the more I used it.  My feet were horribly cracked and dry so I used it daily for a couple weeks.  Then I headed out of town for a couple days and forgot it - but I was stunned with how well my feet held up even though I skipped a couple days.  Well worth the investment.  It isn&#x27;t greasy like other lotions, shea butters and vaseline.  It absorbs well and has a delicate smell that doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s really sensitive allergies at all.  That is a big plus since there have been plenty of times I had to shower before going to bed b/c something I had on was causing a huge allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I have never tried unrefined Shea butter before purchasing this from African Skin Solutions. My whole family uses it to moisturize (husband, 3 kids) and we all love it! It has cured our winter skin and instantly soothes cracked hands and dry cuticles. It takes just a few seconds to warm in the hands to give it a creamy texture before you rub into the skin. I use on my face at night and in the morning my skin is smooth and soft. I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> This does work as a wonderful body moisturizer but not a facial moisturizer especially if your face is the oily or combination type.  Shea butter is way to thick and greasy to be applied to the face,  It made me broke out especially my forehead area.  My break out stopped right when I stopped using it on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best product by far for closing your facial pores.  Look years younger with beautiful skin.  Really I am forever told I look at least 10 years younger.  I think this is helping slow down the inevitable aging process.  I put this on every night to maintain my skins moisture, every woman should use this.</li>
            <li> Easy of application,excellent skin results, and African Skin Solution is very concerned about your satisfaction. I will recommended it to friends and patients.</li>
            <li> This African Shea Butter is a great product. I usually have a beard, but needed to be clean shaven for a few weeks. I used this unrefined Shea Butter to help my face stay soft and moist. It was good to know that this was all natural Shea Butter and that there was no chemicals, fillers, or other impurities. It has a pleasant clean smell not a perfume type odor. I strongly recommend the product and this company.</li>
            <li> For the past several years every time the winter weather comes along I get dry and cracked skin on my hands.  Compared to other lotions and creams, this brand of shea butter has dramatically outperformed anything else I have tried.  I would strongly recommend this product to people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive than the last (purely natural) Shea Butter I ordered but it&#x27;s worth every penny. Applies much better in all temperature ranges.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily for three weeks and noticed significant improvement in my dry, cracked heels, hands, and fingers.  Living in Colorado, keeping your skin moisturized and protected is a must, and this shea butter certainly delivered.  I even used it to soften my dry, brittle hair.  Initially I was concerned about what effect the shea butter would have on my super sensitive skin, but have ultimately been impressed with the results and am now hooked.  Thank you, African Skin Solutions!</li>
            <li> I spent approximately 4 hours researching shea butter companies &amp; qualities.  I finally settled on this one as the most pure, un-touched, premium quality. I was not disappointed. It has an interesting scent which I find refreshing because it is natural. It takes a bit of rubbing in the palms of my hands to make it easy to apply, but not a problem. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product &amp; love knowing that I&#x27;m doing something wonderful for my skin!</li>
            <li> I like using all natural products, because I know what is in the product.  I have a son who suffers from ezema and I also have very dry skin in the winter.  I loved the large jar with the wide opening.  It was easy to scoop the butter out and use it on my heels and hands at night.  The frangrance is very mild and light.  I have used other Shea butter products that have had a stronger smell.  This product will become a regular fixture on my counter.  I hope they offer smaller travel sizes soon.  I am on the airplane 3 to 4 times a month and flying drys out my skin.  I would love to have a travel size 30z for my carry on bag.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li> the best shea butter!! It really works on dry skin!!I use it on my body, hands, face..It s really good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to spread on skin.  Do not notice any big difference yet.  Coconut oil is much cheaper.  It absorbs into skin quicker.  Get the refined, ordorless kind.  This is expensive.</li>
            <li> This sheabutter is the best I have used so far. It still has the smell that fades away after a while but the effect on skin is remarkable. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BJ.</li>
            <li> I have been interested in a premium Shea butter for awhile and I was not disappointed  in this product.  It was smooth and creamy with no odor.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for unrefined Shea butter for a gift or personal use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars to this unrefined shea butter because it transformed my skin after using it for just 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked most about the African Shea Butter was that I now feel my skin is softer and healthier. Since I started using it, I haven&#x27;t experienced dry skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin as I used to have, this product will definitely help. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I heard shea butter may be good for skin irritations i.e. eczema.  The prescribed ointment medicine I had purchased in the past went from $15 a tube to over $100 so my options were to either pay it or look for an alternative.  I am happy to say that this shea butter definitely met the need.  The burning, itching and flamed up areas on my ankle are almost completely healed.  I understand that my eczema will be with me the rest of my life but it is good to know there are great products like this one that can control it and make my life much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream only since last few days and already loving it. a little harder to spread on the skin, but that tells me that it is in it&#x27;s pure form.</li>
            <li> I do see the difference an love it. Also you really do just use a small amount of this stuff it&#x27;ll go a long way and does the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over half a year since my car accident, and this lotion has almost halved the scars within a few weeks. Not really a smell and great for skin all around</li>
            <li> I love shea butter.  I saw some very expensive lotions recently promoting the fact that they contained 20% shea butter.  I thought, why not just buy the pure shea butter?&lt;br /&gt;This is great on my skin.  I warm it up in my hands and rub it on my face and body.  It melts well at body temperature and feels wonderful on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to get more information on this, such as how to make lotions, etc. from this.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is going to be a permanent part of my life.</li>
            <li> Used it the first day I got it on my daughter&#x27;s eczema and the next morning, the redness was significantly decreased. This will be a new household staple.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Completely cleared up my dry skin, from face to heels!! My whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li> The acid test of any moisturizer is what it does on your heels! This keeps that ugly grey cracked skin from taking over. Also, I still feel the softness on my skin next day. It has only one ingredient, pure Shea butter. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like having to rub it between palms to apply it but this soon became a non-issue.</li>
            <li> The single best moisturizer I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best moisturizing product I have used. Using it for keeping my large pregnant belly (twins!!) moisturized. I&#x27;m 32 weeks and no stretch marks. Lasts a long time as well. I would never, ever switch.</li>
            <li> Wonderful pure product, so soothing for ultra dry skin &amp; psoriasis. Love it! Seller is 5 Star all the way. Amazon is the BEST!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter that I received from African Skin Solutions was beautiful. There is a remarkable difference between the textures of a Grade A butter and greasy ungraded or low-grade Shea ‘butter’. The jar ( of ASS) smelt attractive and the colour was a much brighter, more natural shade of yellow than the startling gold I’d used before. I have been using the Shea Butter from African Skin Solutions and am very pleased with the results ive seen on my dry scalp, the dandruff flaking has reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had some Shea butter before, both good and bad experiences ;) The first time I used Shea butter on my scalp I found that it was a really positive influence on my dandruff. I was using my friend’s Shea butter then while staying with them. It came in a plastic container and was a bright gold colour. My friend told me they had gotten it in NYC (we were in MA). I was there using the Shea butter about a week and was really pleased with the results. Much less flaking! Much more attractive hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later while in the City I found some Shea butter that was bright yellow and began using the butter not only on my scalp but also on my drier skin in general, being now aware to the powerful potential of Shea butter. This Shea butter was not good, it was greasy not buttery and it smelt bad not nutty. I have sensitive skin; I don’t use products that upset the gentle balance I have achieved for myself. Grease is one thing that I really don’t want on my hair especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this Shea butter is more expensive than what I bought before the quality is much better, and African Skin Solutions provides a lot of information about where Shea butter comes from. the more info the better.</li>
            <li> This unrefined Shea butter is the BEST! I love skin products that are natural, simple AND effective and this stuff does the trick. I&#x27;m a sailor and my hands get so dry...this stuff is thick, I only need a little, and my hands feel better much longer than with lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the real, grade A unrefined shea butter before, and the quality is incredible. It lasts a very long time, so the price is more than reasonable. I use it most on my lips but also on my face as a base before applying makeup, on my hands nightly, and on any dry spots I may have. I was shocked that it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all, and it feels fantastic. Thanks for providing such a great quality product.</li>
            <li> I do believe that this is 100% raw shea butter it smells and feels different than the others that I&#x27;ve purchased.  This shea butter is smoother and lighter it goes on very smoothly.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell whether it evens out skin tone or not.  I will continue using it. I also use it on my hair after co-washing its an excellent hair product as well.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 4 DAYS NOW AND I MUST SAY I REALLY LIKE IT. I WAS WORRIED I WOULD NOT LIKE IT BECAUSE ALL I KEPT THINKING WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE GREASY BUT IT IS NOT. THERE IS NOT BAD SMELL AND IT FEELS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and I&#x27;m a believer! I have moderate psoriasis and this the FIRST non-prescription product I&#x27;ve used that actually made a difference. Unfortunately, there is no cure for psoriasis but this Raw Shea Butter really did provide some relief. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about two weeks.  I also live in Colorado with extremely dry air so I have tried MANY different moisturizers that claim to help &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; (Aquaphor, Cetaphil, Burt&#x27;s Bees, that California Baby stuff at Target...the list is too long and my bathroom cabinet is too small!). I also like using this Raw Shea Butter as a full body moisturizer after a shower - even on my face, which I&#x27;m picky about using new products for my face. The Shea Butter is totally different than any product I&#x27;ve tried and after I got used to letting it &#x27;melt&#x27; first in my hands it is so quick and easy to apply. Absorbs quick and not greasy. My skin feels like it just came from the spa after I use it - I love it! I recommend this to anyone looking for skin relief.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my face. The Shea Butter is awesome...no more dry skin. I apply after each shower.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent company too. The president and founder responded to a question of mine right away and with a thorough reply. Impressed by everything.</li>
            <li> Smooth , gentle , Perfect skin care</li>
            <li> Very generous with the amount in the container.  This will last for quite some time.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it stays greasy for quite some time on my skin before soaking in if ever.  Disappointed with that part.</li>
            <li> This butter is the best quality I&#x27;ve tried. I tried some cheaper products and the feel, smell, appearance overall cannot be compared to this. I know this is more pricey but I like to believe you pay for what you get (in most cases). I use it to make my own body butter , mixed with cocoa butter,coconut oil and other natural oils... great butter for pregnant bellies :) but not only. I have been in contact with the seller and I have to say they were very quick to respond to any of my questions. Overall great company to deal with and amazing product. I waited a while to post a review, I wanted to make sure I am truly happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have yet to find a bad brand of it!</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Raw Unrefined Shea Butter is unscented, good consistency, melts in your hands and absorbed easily into the skin.  Although a little expensive - it is worth the price.  The product shipped quickly (in just a few days) and securely wrapped and boxed.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I am constantly dealing with dry skin.  I can&#x27;t even remember how many over the counter products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, hoping they would help.  My hands in particular are always cracking and peeling and at times even bleed.  I&#x27;ve been applying it to my hands and the dry spots on my elbows, knees and feet and my dry skin is actually smooth again.  It&#x27;s hard to believe I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I had tried shea butter before but this product is superior. Applies easily out of the jar and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. Made it through the winter without chapped hands or feet!!! The owner is knowledgable about the product and extremely responsive to customer questions and needs.</li>
            <li> I received a coupon for this item so I thought I would try it. It goes on smooth and dries quickly which is great. My mother has extremely dry skin due to medical treatments and she loves this Shea Butter. She puts it on at night and lets is soak in and in the morning her skin is really soft! Much higher quality than other shea butters I have tried! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Works super for our dry skin! I have a mild case of Eczema and this has helped tremendously - goes on smooth and keeps the skin moisturized. I usually put on after my shower every night. It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, so it&#x27;s great for those of us who are sensitive to fragrance.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love the results of this product.  My skin feels like a child&#x27;s skin, truly, for a good 12 hours.  My skin says&amp;#34;thank you for nourishing me&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are1) the time it takes to rub a dab back &amp; forth in your hands to emulsify 2)the absorption time before being able to dress.  Worth the time!  I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> THIS Shea Butter is my new moisturizer and body lotion. It is by far the best I have tried. I had bought some in a drugstore before and it was, basically crap. I bought some online and it was not much better, even though it cost a lot more. I was seduced by the packaging.  Bad mistake.  African Skin Solutions&#x27; 100% Pure Raw  Premium Unrefined Shea Butter is night and day different - and better.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my heels, which have those &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34; cracks from not getting regular pedicures like I do in the summer months. My husband has really deep cracks in his heels and this Shea Butter helps those, too.&lt;br /&gt;More important, I have been using it on my face. My skin cannot seem to retain moisture anymore. As a result, it has been looking dull as well as dry. But this African Shea Butter is amazing. It keeps my skin supple for hours and even brightens my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company is super nice to deal with. I never had this level of customer service when I bought Clinique or Oil of Olay moisturizer!</li>
            <li> great shea butter product. my wife and I used it on our dry and callous feet. we have arthritis in your hands and it can be hard to get the shea butter out of the jar. we use an ice cream scoop to get the correct amount. the shea butter has provided relief by moisturizing the skin which has decreased the callous in our feet.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a Retin-A product which is normally extremely drying.  African Solutions Shea Butter has allowed me to continue with the skin therapy by keeping my face hydrated and soft.  In the evening I use a tiny dab on my palm which I then hold briefly above a gas burner on our stove for a quick way to melt it; it&#x27;s then very easy to apply.  It feels wonderful on my face -- glides on smoothly with a slight &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel (till it soaks in) and leaves my face with no tightness or itch.</li>
            <li> My husband has horribly dry hands most of the year from what he does at work so when I was offered this African Shea Butter during a promotion for my honest review I was hoping to give him some relief.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly, was sealed very well and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this for about a week now every night before he goes to bed and after he gets out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I have also rubbed it into his cuticles twice.&lt;br /&gt;It is working wonders on his dry cracked hands, and I am sure with continued use his cuticles with quit splitting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it no effect for me</li>
            <li> Buying this product is one of the more TIFU moments of my Amazon shopping experience... why in the world a Asian person (me) would buy a product from a company called &amp;#34;African Skin Solutions&amp;#34; is mystical, just as mystical as that tree of life they source this butter from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think product is made for Asian skin, when I started using it, I broke out - this product is super thick and waxy, the best way I can describe it is like putting melted greasy candle wax on your skin and good luck in trying to wash it from your skin, it’s so think and waxy regular soap won’t do the trick, I have to use a scrub to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a 90 day guarantee on this product but I won’t be using it, I think this company means well, it probably is a quality product but it’s definitely not meant for me.</li>
            <li> Softens skin in one application! I&#x27;ve seriously never used anything like raw shea before. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try shea butter because I heard many times about the many uses and how great the product.  I will never use anything else for my skin and with a minimum of other products, on my hair as well.  The hype is true, this is an amazing product.  The price might seem expensive at first, but a little goes a long way and it is really so much better than anything else I have tried.  I love that it is natural and has hardly any smell at all so it will not interfere with any other fragrance being used.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product, excellent customer service! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> As soon as it melts in your hand the Shea Butter becomes a very smooth oil that goes on very easily.  And you don&#x27;t need much, a little goes a long way.  It also is a great healing ointment staying moist a very long time.  Anywhere you need extra skin moisture it works.</li>
            <li> This african shea butter is simply a dream! The uses for this afircan shea butter are countless, I&#x27;ve been blown away at all the things you can use it for! Being lucky enough to get this item at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I&#x27;m a very happy customer! The packaging in which it arrives is beautiful and simply elegant, with an easy twist off top. While the african shea butter comes in a soft, solid form, it only takes a small amount rubbed between your palms before it becomes more of a liquid that instantly nourishes your skin! It comes in the unrefined form, meaning it contains vitamins that are essential to the health and well being of your skin. I&#x27;ve begun using it in my hair as well, as I&#x27;ve found it helps to ease the frizz that my hair naturally has! And my favorite thing to use it for is shaving! It has completley replaced shaving cream for me!</li>
            <li> Compares favorably with a previously tried brand. Less gritty and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Smooths the skin! You don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my pregnant daughter-in-law out of the goodness of my heart even though I wanted to keep it.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for EVERYTHING. I use it as a replacement for saving cream in the sower and I also use it as a hand and body moisturizer after I shower or if I notice my skin feels dry. it feels so rich and creamy but it absorbs into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel. My skin is nice and soft after using this even with the temperature changes. A little goes a long way so this jar should last for a good while. I was surprised at how heavy a 16oz jar felt, it felt a lot heavier than 1lb. I like the smell, not overpowering or off putting at all.</li>
